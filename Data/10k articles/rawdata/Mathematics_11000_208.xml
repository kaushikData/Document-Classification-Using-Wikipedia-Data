'''70''' ('''seventy''') is the [[natural number]] following [[69 (number)|69]] and preceding [[71 (number)|71]].

==In mathematics==
'''70''' is:

* a [[sphenic number]] because it [[factorization|factors]] as 3 distinct primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A007304 : Sphenic numbers|url=https://oeis.org/A007304|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Pell number]].
* the seventh [[pentagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A000326 : Pentagonal numbers|url=https://oeis.org/A000326|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the number of ways to choose 4 objects out of 8 if order does not matter. This makes it a [[central binomial coefficient]].
* the smallest [[weird number]], a natural number that is abundant but not [[semiperfect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A006037 : Weird numbers|url=https://oeis.org/A006037|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[palindromic number]] in bases 9 (77&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), 13 (55&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;) and 34 (22&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;).
* a [[Harshad number]] in bases 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
* an [[Erdős–Woods number]], since it is possible to find sequences of 70 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A059756 : Erdős-Woods numbers|url=https://oeis.org/A059756|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of the first 24 squares starting from 1 is 70{{sup|2}}. This relates 70 to the [[Leech lattice]] and thus [[string theory]].

==In science==
*70 is the [[atomic number]] of [[ytterbium]], a lanthanide

===Astronomy===
*[[Messier object]] [[Messier 70|M70]], a [[visual magnitude|magnitude]] 9.0 [[globular cluster]] in the [[constellation]] [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]
*The [[New General Catalogue]] [http://www.ngcic.org/ object] [[NGC 70]], a magnitude 13.4 [[spiral galaxy]] in the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]

==In religion==
* In [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition:
** Seventy souls went down to Egypt to begin the Hebrews' Egyptian exile ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|46:27}}).
** There is a core of 70 nations and 70 world languages, paralleling the 70 names in the [[Table of Nations]].
** There were 70 men in the Great [[Sanhedrin]], the Supreme Court of ancient Israel. (Sanhedrin [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e101.htm#4 1:4].)
** According to the Jewish [[Aggada]], there are 70 perspectives ("faces") to the [[Torah]] (Numbers Rabbah [http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37456&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=109 13:15]).
** Seventy elders were assembled by [[Moses]] on [[God]]'s command in the desert ({{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:16-30}}).
** {{Bibleverse||Psalm|90:10}} allots three score and ten (70 years) for a man's life, and the [[Mishnah]] attributes that age to "strength" (Avot [http://www.chaver.com/Mishnah-New/Hebrew/Text/Seder%20Nezikin/Masechet%20Avot/Masechet%20Avot%20Perek%205.htm 5:32]), as one who survives that age is described by the verse as "the strong".
**[[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ordered 72 Jewish elders to translate the [[Torah]] into [[Greek language|Greek]]; the result was the [[Septuagint]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] for "seventy"). The Roman numeral seventy, LXX, is the scholarly symbol for the Septuagint.
* In [[Christianity]]:
**In {{Bibleverse||Matthew|18:21-22}}, [[Jesus]] tells [[Saint Peter|Peter]] to forgive people seventy times seven times.
**In {{Bibleverse||Luke|10:1-24}}, [[Jesus]] appoints [[Seventy Disciples]] and sends them out in pairs to preach the Gospel.
*[[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] is a priesthood office in the [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint religion]].
* In Islamic history and in Islamic interpretation the number 70 or 72 is most often and generally hyperbole for an infinite amount:
** There are 70 dead among the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s adversaries during the [[Battle of Badr]].
** 70 of the Prophet Muhammad's followers are martyred at the [[Battle of Uhud]].
** In [[Shia Islam]], there are 70 martyrs among [[Imam Hussein]]'s followers during the [[Battle of Karbala|tragedy of Karbala]].

==In law==
*In certain cases, [[Public domain#Expiration of copyright|copyrights expire]] after 70 years.

==In sports==
*In Olympic [[archery]], the targets are 70 meters from the archers.
*In [[college football]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers]] scored 70 points against [[Clemson Tigers]] in the [[2012 Orange Bowl]], setting the record as the most points ever scored by one side in the history of all bowl games.
* The number of the laps of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] and [[Hungarian Grand Prix]].

==In other fields==
{{Seealso|List of highways numbered 70}}
* 70 [[miles per hour]] is a common [[speed limit]] for freeways in many [[United States|American]] states, primarily in the central United States (in the Eastern U.S. the speed limit is generally 65, in the Western U.S. it is 75).
* 70 miles per hour is the [[national speed limit]] in the [[United Kingdom]] for cars and motorcycles on the best grades of road.&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Highway Code'', pub. Department for Transport (Revised 2007 Edition). {{ISBN|978-0-11-552814-9}}. A white circular sign with a black diagonal stripe indicates that the national speed limit applies. This depends on the vehicle type and grade of road. The table on p. 40 shows the highest speed permitted to be 70&amp;nbsp;mph, for normally-laden cars and motorcycles on dual-carriageways and motorways.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 70 years of marriage is marked by a [[platinum]] [[wedding anniversary]].
* 70 is the [[hull classification symbol|hull number]] of the U.S. Navy's nuclear aircraft carrier [[USS Carl Vinson|USS ''Carl Vinson'' (CVN-70)]], named after U.S. Representative [[Carl Vinson]].
* The French department [[Haute-Saône]] is number 70.
* As a year, "70" may refer to [[70 BC]], [[AD 70]], or [[1970]].
* The number 70 is frequently referenced by the musical duo [[Boards of Canada]]: they have songs titled "Sixtyten" (''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', 1998) and "The Smallest Weird Number" (''[[Geogaddi]]'', 2002), and their record label is named [[Music70]].
* In the [[Far East]]ern culture of China, Japan, Korea, etc., 70 years old is called the Rare Age of the Olden Times (古稀 Guxi in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[:ja:古稀|古稀]] Koki in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], 고희 Gohui in [[Korean language|Korean]], etc.), as written in one of [[Du Fu]]’s poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/88441.htm Guxi in Baidu Encyclopedia] (Chinese: 七十岁，古来稀)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number name==
{{Main article|number name}}
Several languages, especially ones with [[vigesimal]] number systems, do not have a specific word for 70: for example, [[French language|French]] ''soixante-dix'' "sixty-ten"; [[Danish language|Danish]] ''halvfjerds'', short for ''halvfjerdsindstyve'' "three and a half score". (For French, this is true only in France; other French-speaking regions such as [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Aosta Valley]] and [[Jersey]] use ''septante''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Higgins, ''Number Story''. London: Copernicus Books (2008): 19. "Belgian French speakers however grew tired of this and introduced the new names septante, octante, nonante etc. for these numbers".&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Adhyavasāya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अध्यवसाय ) generally means – 'apprehension', 'clinging to', 'mental effort' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=adhyavasAya&amp;link=m }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also 'perseverance', 'having decided'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of Adhyavasaya|url=http://sanskritdictionary.org/adhyavasaya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic interpretation==
Nārāyana Tīrtha, in his ''Sāmkhya-Candrikā'', explains ''adhyavasāya'' as " a modified condition of the intellect (''[[buddhi]]'') the determination in such a form as – ''such an act is to be done by me'' ". [[Gaudapada|Gaudapāda]] explains it as " intellectual determination of the object of perception as belonging to a definite class ". Vācaspatimiśra explains it as " ascertainment or determinate knowledge consequent upon the manifestation of the essence (''[[sattva]]'') of the intellect, when the inertia of the intellect is overcome by the operation of the sense-organs in apprehending their objects, as the intention which follows self-appropriated knowledge or volition of the agent to react to the object of perception in a definite way ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Psychology|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Psychology Press|page=121|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3rEpe3OmqMMC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mkLQKzEZT7&amp;sig=t489FGH2M-gQP_rbDTz8E5rPCZA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o3SrVIyOIoGzuAS2y4DACA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ascertainment also means definite awareness which according to the [[Samkhya|Samkhya school]] is associated in ''[[buddhi]]'' (अध्यवसायो बुद्धिः), in perception which is definite ascertainment involving the senses with respect to specific kinds of empirical objects, and which is an activity of ''buddhi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perceptual Error|author=Srinivasa Rao|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=38|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-_ugDu5XSMAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B59Qr6Xaga&amp;sig=6thVH8p89T6bfc2bHmaQieEFu70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o3SrVIyOIoGzuAS2y4DACA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies determination of objects (''avidhāranā'') which by itself is decisive knowledge (''niścaya'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laksmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=33|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7YWrVPz5LMm1uQSJsIDwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sage of the [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitri Upanishad]] (VI.30) explains:-

: स हि सर्वकाममयः पुरुषोऽध्यवसायसङ्कल्पाभिमानलिङ्गो बद्धः | अतस्तद्विपरीतो मुक्तः ||

: " The purusha full of kama or desire is bound having adhyavasaya, sankalpa and abhimana as his lingas (characteristics) ; he who is 
the opposite of this is liberated. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kalatattvakosa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=335|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dhRKCh70ouMC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=532rVI6qJMO0uQTyuIEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vindhyāvasin holds the view that ''[[Sankalpa (Hindu thought)|sankalpa]]'', ''abhimāna'' and ''adhyavasāya'' are not different functions but the modifications of the mind or intellect. Samkhyas hold the view that perception is the reflective discerning (''adhyavasāya''), a kind of awareness, an operation of the intellect in its ''sattva'' modality;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies Vol.4|pages=144, 303|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bqr_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYCrVM7FE4ORuATTt4LwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be aware of perception as perception is to define and distinguish it from others which definition (''adhyavasāya'') can come only through conception (''vikalpa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Indian Thought|author=T.R.V.Murti|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=277|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=d7ryQuk_inUC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYCrVM7FE4ORuATTt4LwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadyojyoti defines discernment as the ascertaining cognitive activity (''adhyavasāya'') which is understanding (''[[Janana|jñāna]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhoga Karika of Sadyojyoti|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=48|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HUZqbkYBshUC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=532rVI6qJMO0uQTyuIEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga interpretation==

According to the [[Yoga]] school and [[Ayurveda]], ''adhyavasāya'' i.e. apprehension of clear and clean knowledge of the knowable, is one of the sixteen qualities of the empirical soul (''[[Jiva|jīvātmān]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.3|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=143|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-lUxeauYnxAC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYCrVM7FE4ORuATTt4LwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lakshmi Tantra]] (XVI.4) explains that the intellect (''buddhi'') is the incentive to mental effort (''adhyavasāya''); ''[[prana]]'' is the incentive to endeavour (''prayatna'') and time (''[[Kāla (time)|kāla]]'') is the incentive to transform in the form of impulse and effective development; whereas ego (''[[ahamkara]]'') results from a modification of ''mahat'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laksmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=83|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7YWrVPz5LMm1uQSJsIDwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which cognition is indeterminate cognition (''nirvikalpa adhyavasāya'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=324|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7YWrVPz5LMm1uQSJsIDwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Jaina and Buddhist interpretation==

The followers of [[Jainism]] consider ''adhyavasāya'' referring to good or bad sentiments, and of the nature of ''Bhava-Yoga'' which is made up of 'inauspicious combined meditation' and 'meditation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essentials of Bhagavan Mahavira’s Philosophy|author=Acarya Vijay Bhuvanbhanusuri|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=129|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cdgpDf1iEbQC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utpala (astronomer)|Utpala]] in his following statement:-

terms - ''adhyavasāya'' as mental apprehension as he  proceeds to explain ''māyā-shakti'' to be the differentiating power of [[Brahman]] that affects consciousness resulting in the false perception of duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isvara Pratyabhijna Karika|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=66|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m-ps9z8UQpoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=532rVI6qJMO0uQTyuIEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Ratnakīrti]] holds the view that non-momentary existence is a figment of imaginative intuition projected as real by the process of intellection called ''adhyavasāya'' which is impulsive movement of the mind generated by the force of immediately preceding cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist Philosophy of Universal Flux|author=Satkari Mookerjee|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=34|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=q6A3OOxx3-wC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhist]] view is that the judgment of the object of cognition ('spatio-temporal objects') owing to special synthesis of moments gains sensible qualities etc., to become universal (''sāmānaya lakshana'', ''ekatva adhyavasāya'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Reality|author=Kaisa Puhakka|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=82|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=He0dRyesf-QC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=adhyavasaya+buddhist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiwZoZdOXL&amp;sig=LXSL2zZi8SwKe1deuB0UBiTX8iE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TtKrVOzyLc-fugTA_IHYCQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya%20buddhist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jñanasrimitra]] holds the view that only deluded persons interpret an image by conceptual thinking.

==Adhyavasāya in Sanskrit literature==

Common characteristics (''sādhāranadharma'') in poetry can either be in the form of existence (''bhāva'') or negation (''abhāva''), and can involve supersession (''adhyavasāya''). In ''apahnuti'' (concealment of truth, denial), when a thing is concealed and something else is described in its place, the ''āropa'' (raising, elevating, superimposition) that is based on negation amounts to ''adhyavasāya'', which view is refuted by Jayaratha who agrees with Ruyyaka that ''adhyavasāya'' is the phenomenon where the ''visayah'' is concealed and its ''[[Non-difference (Abheda)|non-difference (abheda)]] '' with the ''vishayin'' is known, and that doubt (''bhrānti'') is always based on ''adhyavasāya'' and not on ''āropa''. In [[Sanskrit literature]], ''Alankāraśāstra'' deals with the beauty which poetry (''[[kāvya]]'') alone can display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alankararatnakara of Sobhakaramitra|author=G.Parthasarthy Rao|publisher=Mittal Publications|pages=22, 23, 76, 89|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EhKBKjS56loC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adhyavasāya'' is considered as ''[[siddha]]'' (accomplished) when the object is not expressed in words but is lost in comparison, it is considered as ''sādhya'' (perfect) when the object in the process of being represented is identical with the object of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mallinatha|author=P.G.lalye|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=72|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y0FfADSV6o4C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It distinguishes ''utprekśa'' ('alliteration') and ''atiśayokti'' ('hyperbole') from ''rūpaka'' ('dramatic representation', 'form') and ''āropa'' ('superimposition').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=More than Real|author=David Shulman|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=57|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7SACAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]], a '''BF-graph''' is a type of [[directed graph|directed]] [[hypergraph]] where each [[hyperedge]] is directed either to one particular [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] or away from one particular vertex.

In a directed hypergraph, each hyperedge may be directed away from some of its vertices (its ''tails'') and towards some others of its vertices (its ''heads'').
A hyperedge that is directed to a single head vertex, and away from all its other vertices, is called a ''B''-arch. Symmetrically, a hyperedge that is directed away from a single tail vertex, and towards all its other vertices, is called an ''F''-arc.

If a hypergraph has only ''B''-arcs, it is called a ''B''-graph. If a hypergraph has only ''F''-arcs, it is called an ''F''-graph.yperarc with a tail of size 1. A hypergraph with only B-arcs is a '''B-graph''' and a hypergraph with only F-arcs is a '''F-graph'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">In [[vector calculus]], a '''Beltrami vector field''', named after [[Eugenio Beltrami]], is a [[vector field]] in three dimensions that is parallel to its own [[curl (mathematics)|curl]].  That is, '''F''' is a Beltrami vector field provided that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\times (\nabla\times\mathbf{F})=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are parallel vectors in other words, &lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{F} = \lambda \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is solenoidal - that is, if &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0&lt;/math&gt; such as for an incompressible fluid or a magnetic field, the identity  &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \equiv -\nabla^2 \mathbf{F} + \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F})&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \equiv -\nabla^2 \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and  this leads to

::&lt;math&gt;-\nabla^2 \mathbf{F} = \nabla \times(\lambda \mathbf{F})&lt;/math&gt;

and if we further assume that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, we arrive at the simple form

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{F} = -\lambda^2 \mathbf{F}.&lt;/math&gt;

Beltrami vector fields with nonzero curl correspond to Euclidean [[contact form]]s in three dimensions.

The vector field
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = -\frac{z}{\sqrt{1+z^2}}\mathbf{i} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^2}}\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;
is a multiple of the standard contact structure &amp;minus;''z''&amp;thinsp;'''i'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''j''', and furnishes an example of a Beltrami vector field.

[[File:Binary clock.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|A [[binary clock]] might use [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s to express binary values. In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]

In [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).

In byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''unpacked'' BCD&lt;ref name="Intel_IA32"/&gt; usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''packed'' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance. The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called ''tetrades'' (for the [[nibble]] typically needed to hold them also known as [[tetrade (computing)|tetrade]]) with those [[don't care]]-states unused named {{Interlanguage link multi|pseudo-tetrade|de|3=Pseudotetrade|lt=''pseudo-tetrad(e)s''}}&lt;ref name="Schneider_1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafel_1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinbuch-Weber_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tietze-Schenk_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalski_1070"/&gt; or ''pseudo-decimal digit''&lt;ref name="Ferretti_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speiser_1965"/&gt;).&lt;ref group="nb" name="Pseudo-tetrades"/&gt;

BCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary [[positional system]]s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetics and a slightly less dense storage.

BCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]] and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_GDA"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==
BCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is "natural BCD" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called "8421" encoding.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Decimal digit
! scope="col" colspan="4" | BCD
|-
! 8 !! 4 !! 2 !! 1
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1

|-
| 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1
|}

Other encodings are also used, including so-called "4221" and "7421"—named after the weighting used for the bits—and "[[Excess-3]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20–25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&amp;lpg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.

As most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:
* '''Unpacked''': Each numeral is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the numeral and the remaining bits having no significance.
* '''Packed''': Two numerals are encoded into a single byte, with one numeral in the least significant [[nibble]] (bits 0 through 3) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).

As an example, encoding the decimal number &lt;tt&gt;'''91'''&lt;/tt&gt; using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:
  Decimal:          9          1
  Binary :  0000 1001  0000 0001

In packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:
  Decimal:     9    1
  Binary :  1001 0001

Hence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.

To represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number &lt;tt&gt;'''12345'''&lt;/tt&gt; in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:
  Decimal:          1     2    3     4    5
  Binary :  0000 0001  0010 0011  0100 0101

Note that the most significant nibble of the most significant byte is zero, implying that the number is in actuality &lt;tt&gt;'''012345'''&lt;/tt&gt;. Also note how packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage as compared to unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.

[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation|logical operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.

==BCD in electronics==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}

BCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Packed BCD==
&lt;!-- Section header used in redirects --&gt;
In '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.

Standard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (−). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).&lt;ref name="IBM_POP"&gt;{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEC_PDP11"&gt;{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEC_VAX11"&gt;{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and −127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).

No matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')−1 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.

For example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from ±9,999,999. Thus the number −1,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:
 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101
 ''1    2    3    4    5    6    7    −''

(Note that, like character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal – with the most significant two digits – is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.)

In contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

While packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.

Packed BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the "COMPUTATIONAL-3" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or "PACKED-DECIMAL" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as "FIXED DECIMAL". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).

[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for, a 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from −50,000,000 to +49,999,999, and −1 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)

===Fixed-point packed decimal===
[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:
 12 34 56 7C
 ''12 34.56 7+''

The decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.

===Higher-density encodings===
If a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (1,024) is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen–Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.

=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==
Some implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the "zone" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters "0" through "9". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).

For signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value −123:
 F1 F2 D3
 '' 1  2 −3''

===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===
&lt;!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. --&gt;

===Fixed-point zoned decimal===
Some languages (such as [[COBOL]] and [[PL/I]]) directly support fixed-point zoned decimal values, assigning an implicit decimal point at some location between the decimal digits of a number. For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:
 F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0
 '' 1  2  7  9. 5 +0''

==IBM and BCD==
{{Main article|BCDIC}}
[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].

The [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the "12", "11", and "0" "zone punches" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A "12 zone" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an "11 zone" set ''B'', and a "0 zone" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the "zone" in the even-addressed digit and the "digit" in the odd-addressed digit, the "zone" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' "zone punches" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

In the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the "zone" in the left digit and the "digit" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

With the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.

On the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.

Today, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or "pure" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other computers and BCD==
The [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.&lt;ref name="DEC_VAX11"/&gt; The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.

The [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|page=4-9|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.&lt;ref name="m68k"&gt;url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications. There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add or subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name="Jones_AT"&gt;{{cite web |title=BCD Arithmetic, a tutorial |work=Arithmetic Tutorials |author-first=Douglas W. |author-last=Jones |author-link=Douglas W. Jones |publisher=The University of Iowa, Department of Computer Science |orig-year=1999 |date=2015-11-25 |location=Iowa City, Iowa, USA |url=http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/bcd/bcd.html |access-date=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the following code (written in [[C (programming language)|C]]) computes an unsigned 8-digit packed BCD add using 32-bit binary operations:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
uint32_t BCDadd(uint32_t a,uint32_t b)
{
    uint32_t  t1, t2;    // unsigned 32-bit intermediate values

    t1 = a + 0x06666666;
    t2 = t1 ^ b;                   // sum without carry propagation
    t1 = t1 + b;                   // provisional sum
    t2 = t1 ^ t2;                  // all the binary carry bits
    t2 = ~t2 &amp; 0x11111110;         // just the BCD carry bits
    t2 = (t2 &gt;&gt; 2) | (t2 &gt;&gt; 3);    // correction
    return t1 - t2;                // corrected BCD sum
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Addition with BCD==
It is possible to perform [[addition]] in BCD by first adding in binary, and then converting to BCD afterwards. Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 – 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:
 1001 + 1000 = 10001
    9 +    8 =    17

Note that 10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result. Also note that it cannot fit in a 4-bit number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to that sum and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:
 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 =&gt; 0001 0111
    17 +    6 =       23       1    7

The two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits "1" and "7". This yields "17" in BCD, which is the correct result.

This technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.

==Subtraction with BCD==
Subtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 − 432.

In signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 − 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number −432 can be represented. So, −432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.

Now that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:
   0000 0011 0101 0111
      0    3    5    7
 + 1001 0101 0110 1000
 &lt;u&gt;     9    5    6    8&lt;/u&gt;
 = 1001 1000 1011 1111
      9    8   11   15

Since BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:
   1001 1000 1011 1111
      9    8   11   15
 + 0000 0000 0110 0110
 &lt;u&gt;     0    0    6    6&lt;/u&gt;
 = 1001 1001 0010 0101
      9    9    2    5

Thus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (−925). To check the answer, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 − 432 should result in a negative number. To check the rest of the digits, represent them in decimal. 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 − 925 = 999 − 925 + 1 = 074 + 1 = 75, so the calculated answer is −75. To check, perform standard subtraction to verify that 357 − 432 is −75.

Note that in the event that there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 − 122), the number with the fewest  digits must first be padded with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 − 122, 122 would have to first be represented as 0122, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0122 would have to be calculated.

==Background==
The binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD&amp;nbsp;8421''.
&lt;!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal''). (where?) --&gt;
In the headers to the table, the '{{code|8 4 2 1}}', indicates the weight of each bit shown; note that in the fifth column, "BCD&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;−2&amp;nbsp;−1", two of the weights are negative. Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits are examples of zoned BCD, and are also shown in the table.

The following table represents [[decimal]] digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD systems:

==Legal history==
In the 1972 case ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.

==Comparison with pure binary==
&lt;!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)--&gt;
&lt;!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)--&gt;

===Advantages===
* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values.
* Scaling by a factor of 10 (or a power of 10) is simple; this is useful when a decimal scaling factor is needed to represent a non-integer quantity (e.g., in financial calculations)
* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.
* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.
* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see [[Binary numeral system#Conversion to and from other numeral systems|Binary numeral system]]).

===Disadvantages===
* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15–20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)
* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.&lt;!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. --&gt;
* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.

==Application==
The [[BIOS]] in many [[personal computer]]s stores the date and time in BCD because the [[MC6818]] real-time clock chip used in the original [[IBM PC AT]] motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- also see MC6818 datasheet --&gt;

The [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer’s manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.

Early models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2000 problem#Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].

==Representational variations==
Various BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).

===Signed variations===
Signed decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:

The mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte. Bits, octets and digits indexed from 1, bits from the right, digits and octets from the left.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
bits 8765 of octet n encoding digit 2n

bits 4321 of octet n encoding digit 2(n-1) +1
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meaning number &lt;code&gt;1234&lt;/code&gt;, would become &lt;code&gt;21 43&lt;/code&gt; in TBCD.

==Alternative encodings==
If errors in representation and computation are more important than the speed of conversion to and from display, a scaled binary representation may be used, which stores a decimal number as a binary-encoded integer and a binary-encoded signed decimal exponent. For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.

This representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment—particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.

[[Chen–Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD) is a similar scheme that is used for most of the [[significand]], except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="Pseudo-tetrades"&gt;That is, in a standard packed 4-bit representation, there are 16 states (four bits for each digit) with 10 tetrades and 6 pseudo-tetrades, whereas in more densely packed schemes such as [[Chen–Ho encoding|Chen–Ho]] or [[densely packed decimal|DPD]] coding there are less, f.e. only 24 pseudo-tetrades in 1024 states (10 bits for three digits).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graph book sample.gif|thumb|A triangular book]]
In [[graph theory]], a '''book graph''' (often written &lt;math&gt;B_p&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;) may be any of several kinds of graph.

One kind, which may be called a '''quadrilateral book''', consists of ''p'' [[quadrilateral]]s sharing a common edge (known as the "spine" or "base" of the book). That is, it is a [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of a [[star (graph theory)|star]] and a single edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|id=BookGraph|title=Book Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallian"&gt;{{cite journal

 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7-page book graph of this type provides an example of a graph with no [[harmonious labeling]].&lt;ref name="gallian"/&gt;

A second type, which might be called a '''triangular book''', is the complete tripartite graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a graph consisting of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; [[triangle]]s sharing a common edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lingsheng Shi |author2=Zhipeng Song |title=Upper bounds on the spectral radius of book-free and/or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,l&lt;/sub&gt;-free graphs |journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications |volume=420 |year=2007 |pages=526–9 |doi=10.1016/j.laa.2006.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A book of this type is a [[split graph]].

Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, one may write &lt;math&gt;bk(G)&lt;/math&gt; for the largest book (of the kind being considered) contained within &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "book-graph" has been employed for other uses.  Barioli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Francesco |last=Barioli |title=Completely positive matrices with a book-graph |journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications |volume=277 |year=1998 |pages=11–31 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3795(97)10070-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; used it to mean a graph composed of a number of arbitrary subgraphs having two vertices in common.  (Barioli did not write &lt;math&gt;B_p&lt;/math&gt; for his book-graph.)

==Theorems on books==
Denote the [[Ramsey number]] of two (triangular) books by &lt;math&gt;r(B_p,\ B_q).&lt;/math&gt;

* If &lt;math&gt;1\leq p\leq q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;r(B_p,\ B_q)=2q+3&lt;/math&gt; (proved by [[Rousseau]] and [[Sheehan]]).
* There exists a constant &lt;math&gt;c=o(1)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(B_p,\ B_q)=2q+3&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;q\geq cp&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt; p\leq q/6+o(q)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is large, the [[Ramsey number]] is given by &lt;math&gt;2q+3&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a constant, and &lt;math&gt;k = Cn&lt;/math&gt;.  Then every graph on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges contains a (triangular) &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Erdős |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ijm/1255631811 |title=On a theorem of Rademacher-Turán |journal=Illinois Journal of Mathematics |volume=6 |year=1962 |pages=122–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Cauchy sequence''' ({{IPA-fr|koʃi}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|k|oʊ|ʃ|iː}} {{respell|KOH|shee}}), named after [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], is a [[sequence]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Serge (1993), Algebra (Third ed.), Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Pub. Co., {{ISBN|978-0-201-55540-0}}, {{Zbl|0848.13001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.

It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the {{em|preceding}} term. For instance, in the sequence of square roots of natural numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=\sqrt n,&lt;/math&gt;
the consecutive terms become arbitrarily close to each other:
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}-a_n = \sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n}} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt n}.&lt;/math&gt;
However, with growing values of the index {{mvar|n}}, the terms {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} become arbitrarily large, so for any index {{mvar|n}} and distance {{mvar|d}}, there exists an index {{mvar|m}} big enough such that {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; – ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''d''}}. (Actually, any {{math|''m'' &gt; ({{sqrt|''n''}} + ''d'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} suffices.) As a result, despite how far one goes, the remaining terms of the sequence never get close to {{em|each other}}, hence the sequence is not Cauchy.

The utility of Cauchy sequences lies in the fact that in a [[complete metric space]] (one where all such sequences are known to [[limit of a sequence|converge to a limit]]), the criterion for [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] depends only on the terms of the sequence itself, as opposed to the definition of convergence, which uses the limit value as well as the terms. This is often exploited in [[algorithm]]s, both theoretical and applied,  where an [[Iterative method|iterative process]] can be shown relatively easily to produce a Cauchy sequence, consisting of the iterates, thus fulfilling a logical condition, such as termination.

The notions above are not as unfamiliar as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance of the fact that any [[real number]] ''x'' has a [[decimal expansion]] is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive [[truncation]]s of the decimal expansion of ''x'') has the real limit ''x''. In some cases it may be difficult to describe ''x'' independently of such a limiting process involving [[rational number]]s.

Generalizations of Cauchy sequences in more abstract [[uniform spaces]] exist in the form of [[Cauchy filter]]s and [[Cauchy net]]s.

==In real numbers==
A sequence

:&lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

of real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence, if for every [[positive and negative numbers|positive]] real number ''ε'', there is a positive [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all [[natural numbers]] ''m'', ''n'' &gt; ''N''

:&lt;math&gt;|x_m - x_n| &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;

where the vertical bars denote the [[absolute value]].  In a similar way one can define Cauchy sequences of rational or complex numbers.  Cauchy formulated such a condition by requiring &lt;math&gt;x_m - x_n&lt;/math&gt; to be [[infinitesimal]] for every pair of infinite ''m'', ''n''.

==In a metric space==

Since the definition of a Cauchy sequence only involves metric concepts, it is straightforward to generalize it to any metric space ''X''. To do so, the absolute value |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| is replaced by the distance ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) (where ''d'' denotes a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Formally, given a [[metric space]] (''X'', ''d''), a sequence

:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

is Cauchy, if for every positive [[real number]] ''ε'' &gt; 0 there is a positive  [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all positive integers ''m'', ''n'' &gt; ''N'', the distance

:''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''ε''.

Roughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to have a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] in ''X''. Nonetheless, such a limit does not always exist within ''X''.

==Completeness==
A metric space (''X'', ''d'') in which every Cauchy sequence converges to an element of ''X'' is called [[Complete metric space|complete]].

===Examples===
The [[real number]]s are complete under the metric induced by the usual absolute value, and one of the standard [[Construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] involves Cauchy sequences of [[rational number]]s. In this construction, each equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers with a certain tail behavior—that is, each class of sequences that get arbitrarily close to one another— is a real number.

A rather different type of example is afforded by a metric space ''X'' which has the [[discrete space|discrete metric]] (where any two distinct  points are at distance 1 from each other). Any Cauchy sequence of elements of ''X'' must be constant beyond some fixed point, and converges to the eventually repeating term.

===Counter-example: rational numbers===
The [[rational number]]s '''Q''' are not complete (for the usual distance):&lt;br/&gt;
There are sequences of rationals that converge (in '''R''') to [[irrational number]]s; these are Cauchy sequences having no limit in '''Q'''. In fact, if a real number ''x'' is irrational, then the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), whose ''n''-th term is the truncation to ''n'' decimal places of the decimal expansion of ''x'', gives a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers with irrational limit ''x''. Irrational numbers certainly exist in '''R''', for example:

* The sequence defined by &lt;math&gt; x_0=1, x_{n+1}=\frac{x_n+\frac{2}{x_n}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; consists of rational numbers (1, 3/2, 17/12,...), which is clear from the definition; however it converges to the [[irrational number|irrational]] square root of two, see [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|Babylonian method of computing square root]].
* The sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n = F_n / F_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; of ratios of consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s which, if it converges at all, converges to a limit &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\phi^2 = \phi+1&lt;/math&gt;, and no rational number has this property.  If one considers this as a sequence of real numbers, however, it converges to the real number &lt;math&gt;\varphi = (1+\sqrt5)/2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Golden ratio]], which is irrational.
* The values of the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(''x''), sin(''x''), cos(''x''), are known to be irrational for any rational value of ''x''≠0, but each can be defined as the limit of a rational Cauchy sequence, using, for instance, the [[Maclaurin series]].

===Counter-example: open interval===
The open interval &lt;math&gt; X = (0, 2) &lt;/math&gt; in the set of real numbers with an ordinary distance in '''R''' is not a complete space: there is a sequence &lt;math&gt; x_n = 1/n &lt;/math&gt; in it, which is Cauchy (for arbitrarily small distance bound &lt;math&gt; d &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; all terms &lt;math&gt; x_n &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 1/d &lt;/math&gt; fit in the &lt;math&gt; (0, d) &lt;/math&gt; interval), however does not converge in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; — its 'limit', number &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, does not belong to the space &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

===Other properties===
* Every convergent sequence (with limit ''s'', say) is a Cauchy sequence, since, given any real number ''ε'' &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point, every term of the sequence is within distance ''ε''/2 of ''s'', so any two terms of the sequence are within distance ''ε'' of each other.
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence is [[bounded function|bounded]] (since for some ''N'', all terms of the sequence from the ''N''-th onwards are within distance 1 of each other, and if ''M'' is the largest distance of the terms up to and including the ''N''-th, then no term of the sequence has distance greater than ''M'' + 1 from {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''}}).
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence with limit ''s'' is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number ''r'' &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance ''r''/2 of ''s'', and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance ''r''/2 of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance ''r'' of ''s''.

These last two properties, together with the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the [[least upper bound axiom]]. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of {{em|constructing}} the real numbers as the [[Completion (metric space)|completion]] of the rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.

One of the standard illustrations of the advantage of being able to work with Cauchy sequences and make use of completeness is provided by consideration of the summation of an [[infinite series]] of real numbers
(or, more generally, of elements of any complete [[normed linear space]], or [[Banach space]]).  Such a series 
&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be convergent if and only if the sequence of [[partial sum]]s &lt;math&gt;(s_{m})&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, where 
&lt;math&gt; s_{m} = \sum_{n=1}^{m} x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a routine matter 
to determine whether the sequence of partial sums is Cauchy or not,
since for positive integers ''p'' &gt; ''q'', 
:&lt;math&gt; s_{p} - s_{q} = \sum_{n=q+1}^{p} x_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f \colon M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniformly continuous]] map between the metric spaces ''M'' and ''N'' and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence in ''M'', then &lt;math&gt;(f(x_n))&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in ''N''. If &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; are two Cauchy sequences in the rational, real or complex numbers, then the sum &lt;math&gt;(x_n + y_n)&lt;/math&gt; and the product &lt;math&gt;(x_n y_n)&lt;/math&gt; are also Cauchy sequences.

==Generalizations==

===In topological vector spaces===
There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence for a [[topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;: Pick a [[local base]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; about 0; then (&lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence if for each member &lt;math&gt;V\in B&lt;/math&gt;, there is some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever 
&lt;math&gt;n,m &gt; N, 
x_n - x_m&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. If the topology of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with a [[translation-invariant metric]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the two definitions agree.

===In topological groups===

Since the topological vector space definition of Cauchy sequence requires only that there be a continuous "subtraction" operation, it can just as well be stated in the context of a [[topological group]]: A sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; in a topological group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence if for every open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the [[identity element|identity]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt; m,n&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n x_m^{-1} \in U&lt;/math&gt;. As above, it is sufficient to check this for the neighbourhoods in any local base of the identity in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

As in the [[Complete metric space#Completion|construction of the completion of a metric space]], one can furthermore define the binary relation on Cauchy sequences in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_k)&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if for every open [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the identity in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists some number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt; m,n&gt;N &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_n y_m^{-1} \in U&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is an [[equivalence relation]]: It is reflexive since the sequences are Cauchy sequences. It is symmetric since &lt;math&gt;y_n x_m^{-1} = (x_m y_n^{-1})^{-1} \in U^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; which by continuity of the inverse is another open neighbourhood of the identity. It is [[Transitive relation|transitive]] since &lt;math&gt;x_n z_l^{-1} = x_n y_m^{-1} y_m z_l^{-1} \in U' U''&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U''&lt;/math&gt; are open neighbourhoods of the identity such that &lt;math&gt;U'U'' \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;; such pairs exist by the continuity of the group operation.

===In groups===

There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence in a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:
Let &lt;math&gt;H=(H_r)&lt;/math&gt; be a decreasing sequence of [[normal subgroup]]s of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].
Then a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be Cauchy (w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) [[if and only if]] for any &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; there is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall m,n &gt; N, x_n x_m^{-1} \in H_r&lt;/math&gt;.

Technically, this is the same thing as a topological group Cauchy sequence for a particular choice of topology on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, namely that for which &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a local base.

The set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of such Cauchy sequences forms a group (for the componentwise product), and the set &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; of null sequences (s.th. &lt;math&gt;\forall r, \exists N, \forall n &gt; N, x_n \in H_r&lt;/math&gt;) is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. The [[factor group]] &lt;math&gt;C/C_0&lt;/math&gt; is called the completion of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

One can then show that this completion is isomorphic to the [[inverse limit]] of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(G/H_r)&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of this construction, familiar in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] is the construction of the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic completion]] of the integers with respect to a prime ''p''. In this case, ''G'' is the integers under addition, and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the additive subgroup consisting of integer multiples of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] sequence (i.e., any normal subgroup of finite index contains some &lt;math&gt;H_r&lt;/math&gt;), then this completion is [[Canonical form|canonical]] in the sense that it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of &lt;math&gt;(G/H)_H&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; varies over {{em|all}} normal subgroups of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]]. For further details, see ch. I.10 in [[Serge Lang|Lang]]'s "Algebra".

===In constructive mathematics===
{{Tone|section|date=August 2018}}
In [[constructive mathematics]], Cauchy sequences often must be given with a ''modulus of Cauchy convergence'' to be useful. If &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then a modulus of Cauchy convergence for the sequence is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; from the set of [[natural number]]s to itself, such that &lt;math&gt;\forall k \forall m, n &gt; \alpha(k), |x_m - x_n| &lt; 1/k&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, any sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse (that every Cauchy sequence has a modulus) follows from the [[well-ordering property]] of the natural numbers (let &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k)&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest possible &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of Cauchy sequence, taking &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt;). However, this well-ordering property does not hold in constructive mathematics (it is equivalent to the principle of [[excluded middle]]). On the other hand, this converse also follows (directly) from the principle of [[dependent choice]] (in fact, it will follow from the weaker AC&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;), which is generally accepted by constructive mathematicians. Thus, moduli of Cauchy convergence are needed directly only by constructive mathematicians who (like [[Fred Richman]]) do not wish to use any form of choice.

That said, using a modulus of Cauchy convergence can simplify both definitions and theorems in constructive analysis. Perhaps even more useful are ''regular Cauchy sequences'', sequences with a given modulus of Cauchy convergence (usually &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k) = k&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\alpha(k) = 2^k&lt;/math&gt;). Any Cauchy sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is equivalent (in the sense used to form the [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of a metric space) to a regular Cauchy sequence; this can be proved without using any form of the axiom of choice. Regular Cauchy sequences were used by [[Errett Bishop]] in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7I-AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Foundations+intitle:of+intitle:constructive+intitle:analysis&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;pgis=1 Foundations of Constructive Analysis], but they have also been used by [[Douglas Bridges]] in a non-constructive textbook ({{ISBN|978-0-387-98239-7}}). However, Bridges also works on mathematical constructivism; the concept has not spread far outside of that milieu.

===In a hyperreal continuum===
A real sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle u_n: n\in \mathbb{N} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a natural [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension, defined for [[hypernatural]] values ''H'' of the index ''n'' in addition to the usual natural ''n''.  The sequence is Cauchy if and only if for every infinite ''H'' and ''K'', the values &lt;math&gt;u_H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_K&lt;/math&gt; are infinitely close, or [[adequality|adequal]], i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;\, \mathrm{st}(u_H-u_K)= 0&lt;/math&gt; 
where "st" is the [[standard part function]].

===Cauchy completion of categories===

{{harvtxt|Krause|2018}} introduced a notion of Cauchy completion of a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Applied to '''Q''' (the category whose objects are rational numbers, and there is a morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;le; ''y''), this Cauchy completion yields '''R''' (again interpreted as a category using its natural ordering).

In [[mathematics]], the '''convolution theorem''' states that under suitable conditions the [[Fourier transform]] of a [[convolution]] of two [[Signal|signals]] is the [[pointwise product]] of their Fourier transforms. In other words, convolution in one domain (e.g., [[time domain]]) equals point-wise multiplication in the other domain (e.g., [[frequency domain]]). Versions of the convolution theorem are true for various [[List of Fourier-related transforms|Fourier-related transforms]]. Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s with [[convolution]] &lt;math&gt;f*g &lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the [[asterisk]] denotes convolution in this context, not standard multiplication. The [[tensor product]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used instead.) &lt;br&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Fourier transform [[operator (mathematics)|operator]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{f\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt; are the Fourier transforms of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{f*g\} = \mathcal{F}\{f\} \cdot \mathcal{F}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes point-wise multiplication. It also works the other way around:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{f \cdot g\}= \mathcal{F}\{f\}*\mathcal{F}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt;

By applying the inverse Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:

: &lt;math&gt;f*g= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{\mathcal{F}\{f\}\cdot\mathcal{F}\{g\}\big\}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

: &lt;math&gt;f \cdot g= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{\mathcal{F}\{f\}*\mathcal{F}\{g\}\big\}&lt;/math&gt;

The relationships above are only valid for the form of the Fourier transform shown in the [[#Proof|Proof]] section below.  The transform may be normalized in other ways, in which case constant scaling factors (typically &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;) will appear in the relationships above.

This theorem also holds for the [[Laplace transform]], the [[two-sided Laplace transform]] and, when suitably modified, for the [[Mellin transform]] and [[Hartley transform]] (see [[Mellin inversion theorem]]).  It can be extended to the Fourier transform of [[abstract harmonic analysis]] defined over [[locally compact abelian group]]s.

This formulation is especially useful for implementing a numerical convolution on a [[computer]]: The standard convolution algorithm has [[Quadratic function|quadratic]] [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]]. With the help of the convolution theorem and the [[fast Fourier transform]], the complexity of the convolution can be reduced from [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O\left(n^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;]] to [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O\left(n \log n\right)&lt;/math&gt;]], using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[big O notation]].  This can be exploited to construct fast [[multiplication algorithm]]s, as in {{Section link|Multiplication algorithm|Fourier transform methods}}.

== Proof ==

''The proof here is shown for a particular [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]] of the Fourier transform.  As mentioned above, if the transform is normalized differently, then constant [[Scale factor|scaling factors]] will appear in the derivation.''

Let &lt;math&gt;f,g&lt;/math&gt; belong to the [[Lp space]] &lt;math&gt;L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;F(\nu) = \mathcal{F}\{f\} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i x\cdot\nu} \, \mathrm{d}x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(\nu) = \mathcal{F}\{g\} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}g(x) e^{-2 \pi i x\cdot\nu} \, \mathrm{d}x, &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''dot'' between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; indicates the [[dot product|inner product]] of '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;'''. Let &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; be the [[convolution]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h(z) = \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) g(z-x)\, \mathrm{d} x. &lt;/math&gt;

Also

:&lt;math&gt; \int\!\!\int |f(x)g(z-x)|\,dz\,dx=\int |f(x)| \int |g(z-x)|\,dz\,dx = \int |f(x)|\,\|g\|_1\,dx=\|f\|_1 \|g\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence by [[Fubini's theorem]] we have that &lt;math&gt;h\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; so its Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the integral formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  H(\nu) = \mathcal{F}\{h\} &amp;= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} h(z) e^{-2 \pi i z\cdot\nu}\, dz \\
                            &amp;= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) g(z-x)\, dx\, e^{-2 \pi i z\cdot \nu}\, dz.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that &lt;math&gt; |f(x)g(z-x)e^{-2\pi i z\cdot\nu}|=|f(x)g(z-x)|&lt;/math&gt; and hence by the argument above we may apply Fubini's theorem again (i.e. interchange the order of integration):

:&lt;math&gt;H(\nu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} g(z-x)e^{-2 \pi i z\cdot \nu}\,dz\right)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;y=z-x&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;dy = dz&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt;H(\nu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} g(y) e^{-2 \pi i (y+x)\cdot\nu}\,dy \right) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-2\pi i x\cdot \nu} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} g(y) e^{-2 \pi i y\cdot\nu}\,dy \right) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)e^{-2\pi i x\cdot \nu}\,dx \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} g(y) e^{-2 \pi i y\cdot\nu}\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

These two integrals are the definitions of &lt;math&gt;F(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;G(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;, so:
:&lt;math&gt;H(\nu) = F(\nu) \cdot G(\nu),&lt;/math&gt;

[[Q.E.D.|QED]].

==Convolution theorem for inverse Fourier transform==
A similar argument, as the above proof, can be applied to the convolution theorem for the inverse Fourier transform;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{f*g\} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{f\} \cdot \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{f \cdot g\}= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{f\}*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;f*g= \mathcal{F}\big\{\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{f\}\cdot\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{g\}\big\}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

: &lt;math&gt;f \cdot g= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{\mathcal{F}\{f\}*\mathcal{F}\{g\}\big\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Functions of discrete variable sequences ==
By similar arguments, it can be shown that the [[Convolution#Discrete convolution|discrete convolution]] of sequences &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;x * y = \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}^{-1} \displaystyle \big[ \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{x\}\cdot \ \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{y\} \big],&lt;/math&gt;

where '''DTFT''' represents the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]].

An important special case is the '''[[circular convolution]]''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;x_N * y,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[periodic summation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_N[n]\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n-mN].&lt;/math&gt;

It can then be shown that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_N * y &amp; = \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}^{-1} \displaystyle \big[ \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{x_N\} \cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{y\} \big] \\
&amp; = \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}^{-1} \displaystyle \big[ \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle \{x_N\}\cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle \{y_N\} \big],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''DFT''' represents the [[discrete Fourier transform]].

The proof follows from [[DTFT#Periodic data]], which indicates that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{DTFT}\displaystyle \{x_N\}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{x_N\}(f) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{x_N\}[k]\right)\cdot \delta\left(f-k/N\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The product with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{y\}(f)&lt;/math&gt; is thereby reduced to a discrete-frequency function:

:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{x_N\}\cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{y\} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{x_N\}[k]\cdot \underbrace{\scriptstyle{\rm DTFT}\displaystyle \{y\}(k/N)}_{\scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{y_N\}[k]}\cdot \delta\left(f-k/N\right)&lt;/math&gt; (also using [[DTFT#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]]).

The inverse DTFT is''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(x_N * y)[n] &amp; = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{x_N\}[k]\cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{y_N\}[k]\cdot \delta\left(f-k/N\right)\cdot e^{i 2 \pi f n} df \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{x_N\}[k]\cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{y_N\}[k]\cdot \int_{0}^{1} \delta\left(f-k/N\right)\cdot e^{i 2 \pi f n} df \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{x_N\}[k]\cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle\{y_N\}[k]\cdot e^{i 2 \pi \frac{n}{N} k} \\
&amp; = \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}^{-1} \displaystyle \big[ \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle \{x_N\}\cdot \scriptstyle{\rm DFT}\displaystyle \{y_N\} \big],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Convolution theorem for Fourier series coefficients ==
Two convolution theorems exist for the [[Fourier series]] coefficients of a periodic function:
*The first convolution theorem states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;L^1([-\pi,\pi])&lt;/math&gt;, the Fourier series coefficients of the 2{{pi}}-periodic [[convolution]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are given by:

::&lt;math&gt;[\widehat{f*_{2\pi}g}](n) = 2\pi\cdot \hat{f}(n)\cdot\hat{g}(n),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The scale factor is always equal to the period, 2{{pi}} in this case.&lt;!-- You can easily verify that the factor is necessary here, by choosing f and g to be constant 1. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:where:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[f*_{2\pi}g\right](x) \ &amp;\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(u)\cdot g[\text{pv}(x-u)] du, &amp;&amp; 
\big(\text{and }\underbrace{\text{pv}(x)  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \text{Arg}\left(e^{ix}\right)
}_{\text{principal value}}\big)\\
&amp;= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(u)\cdot g(x-u)\, du, &amp;&amp;\scriptstyle \text{when g(x) is 2}\pi\text{-periodic.}\\
&amp;= \int_{2\pi} f(u)\cdot g(x-u)\, du, &amp;&amp;\scriptstyle \text{when both functions are 2}\pi\text{-periodic, and the integral is over any 2}\pi\text{ interval.}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* The second convolution theorem states that the Fourier series coefficients of the product of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are given by the [[Convolution#Discrete convolution|discrete convolution]] of the &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt; sequences:

::&lt;math&gt;[\widehat{f\cdot g}](n) = [\hat{f}*\hat{g}](n).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3920">'''Danielle Monique Macbeth''' (born 1954 in Edmonton, Canada) is a philosopher whose work focuses on the [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[Philosophy of language|the philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and the philosophy of logic. She is T. Wistar Brown Professor of Philosophy at [[Haverford College]] in Pennsylvania where she has taught since 1989. Macbeth also taught at the University of Hawaii from 1986-1989.
 
Macbeth received a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry at the University of Alberta in 1977 before beginning her philosophical studies. She then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Religious Studies at McGill University in Montreal in 1980 and received her PhD from University of Pittsburgh in 1988. She wrote her dissertation under [[John Haugeland]], and studied also with [[Wilfrid Sellars]], [[John McDowell]], and [[Robert Brandom]].  Macbeth has received numerous awards and fellowships including NEH Grants, and an ACLS Frederick Burkhardt Residential Fellowship. In 2002-2003, she was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ww3.haverford.edu/philosophy/dmacbeth/ |title= Danielle Macbeth : Biographical Sketch |publisher= Haverford College |access-date= 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Frege's logic'' ==
Macbeth is the author of two books, ''Frege’s Logic'' and ''Realizing Reason: A Narrative of Truth and Knowing''. In the first, Macbeth proposes a new reading of [[Frege]]’s notation and logical project. Rather than treating [[Begriffsschrift]] (Frege's logic) as a notational variant of quantificational logic, Macbeth proposes that reasoning in Begriffsschrift is more like the diagrammatic reasoning of the geometrician or algebraicist. She argues that philosophers and mathematicians alike have failed to recognize the revolutionary powers of Begriffsschrift in its expressive and demonstrative capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Macbeth, Danielle. Frege's Logic. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of mathematics ==
Realizing Reason, her most recent book, takes a [[Hegelian]] approach to the philosophy of mathematics and traces developments in philosophy, logic, mathematics, and physics beginning with [[Aristotle]] in order to illuminate how (pure) reason has come to be realized as a power of knowing. She focuses on three periods: Ancient Greece, early modern mathematics, physics, and philosophy ([[Descartes]] to [[Kant]]), and late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century mathematics and physics. Macbeth argues that with her new reading of Frege, we can finally break out of the Kantian framework that remains in place even in twentieth-century analytic philosophy and thereby finally understand how contemporary mathematics enables real extensions of our knowledge on the basis of strictly deductive reasoning. Thus, she demonstrates how pure reason has finally been realized as a power of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;Macbeth, Danielle. Realizing Reason: A Narrative of Truth and Knowing. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Macbeth has also published many articles on a wide range of topics in the history and philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mind, and pragmatism.

'''Data analysis''' is a process of inspecting, [[Data cleansing|cleansing]], [[Data transformation|transforming]], and [[Data modeling|modeling]] [[data]] with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, while being used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business, data analysis is playing a role in making decisions more scientific and helping the business achieve effective operation.&lt;ref&gt;Xia, B. S., &amp; Gong, P. (2015). Review of business intelligence through data analysis. ''Benchmarking'', ''21''(2), 300-311. doi:10.1108/BIJ-08-2012-0050&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Data mining]] is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while [[business intelligence]] covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171018181046/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-analysis Exploring Data Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into [[descriptive statistics]], [[exploratory data analysis]] (EDA), and [[Statistical hypothesis testing|confirmatory data analysis]] (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing [[hypotheses]]. [[Predictive analytics]] focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while [[text analytics]] applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of [[unstructured data]]. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.

[[Data integration]] is a precursor to data analysis,{{according to whom|date=March 2018}} and data analysis is closely linked{{how|date=March 2018}} to [[data visualization]] and data dissemination. The term ''data analysis'' is sometimes used as a synonym for data modeling.

==The process of data analysis==
[[File:Data visualization process v1.png|right|350px|thumb|Data science process flowchart from "Doing Data Science", Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt, 2013]]
Analysis refers to breaking a whole into its separate components for individual examination. Data analysis is a [[Process theory|process]] for obtaining raw data and converting it into information useful for decision-making by users. Data are collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses or disprove theories.&lt;ref name="Judd and McClelland 1989"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Judd, Charles and
| first = McCleland, Gary
| year = 1989
| title = [[Data Analysis]] | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
| isbn = 0-15-516765-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistician [[John Tukey]] defined data analysis in 1961 as: "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."&lt;ref&gt;[http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177704711 John Tukey-The Future of Data Analysis-July 1961]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several phases that can be distinguished, described below. The phases are iterative, in that feedback from later phases may result in additional work in earlier phases.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"&gt;{{cite book
| last = O'Neil, Cathy and
| first = Schutt, Rachel
| year = 2013
| title = [[Doing Data Science]] | publisher = O'Reilly
| isbn = 978-1-449-35865-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data requirements===
The data are necessary as inputs to the analysis, which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analysis or customers (who will use the finished product of the analysis). The general type of entity upon which the data will be collected is referred to as an experimental unit (e.g., a person or population of people). Specific variables regarding a population (e.g., age and income) may be specified and obtained.  Data may be numerical or categorical (i.e., a text label for numbers).&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Data collection===
Data are collected from a variety of sources. The requirements may be communicated by analysts to custodians of the data, such as information technology personnel within an organization. The data may also be collected from sensors in the environment, such as traffic cameras, satellites, recording devices, etc. It may also be obtained through interviews,  downloads from online sources, or reading documentation.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Data processing===
[[File:Relationship of data, information and intelligence.png|thumb|350px|The phases of the [[intelligence cycle]] used to convert raw information into actionable intelligence or knowledge are conceptually similar to the phases in data analysis.]]
Data initially obtained must be processed or organised for analysis. For instance, these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format (i.e., [[data model|structured data]]) for further analysis, such as within a spreadsheet or statistical software.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Data cleaning===
Once processed and organised, the data may be incomplete, contain duplicates, or contain errors. The need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that data are entered and stored. Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, overall quality of existing data,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/clean-data-in-crm-the-key-to-generate-sales-ready-leads-and-boost-your-revenue-pool/ Clean Data in CRM: The Key to Generate Sales-Ready Leads and Boost Your Revenue Pool] Retrieved 29th July, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; deduplication, and column segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Cleaning|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/datacleaning/|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques. For example, with financial information, the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers believed to be reliable.&lt;ref name="Koomey1"&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/quantitative_data.pdf Perceptual Edge-Jonathan Koomey-Best practices for understanding quantitative data-February 14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual amounts above or below pre-determined thresholds may also be reviewed.  There are several types of data cleaning that depend on the type of data such as phone numbers, email addresses, employers etc.  Quantitative data methods for outlier detection can be used to get rid of likely incorrectly entered data. Textual data spell checkers can be used to lessen the amount of mistyped words, but it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hellerstein|first=Joseph|title=Quantitative Data Cleaning for Large Databases|journal=EECS Computer Science Division|date=27 February 2008|page=3|url=http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/papers/cleaning-unece.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory data analysis===
Once the data are cleaned, it can be analyzed. Analysts may apply a variety of techniques referred to as [[exploratory data analysis]] to begin understanding the messages contained in the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Selecting the Right Graph For Your Message-September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cll.stanford.edu/~willb/course/behrens97pm.pdf Behrens-Principles and Procedures of Exploratory Data Analysis-American Psychological Association-1997]&lt;/ref&gt; The process of exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data, so these activities may be iterative in nature. [[Descriptive statistics]], such as the average or median, may be generated to help understand the data. [[Data visualization]] may also be used to examine the data in graphical format, to obtain additional insight regarding the messages within the data.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Modeling and algorithms===
Mathematical formulas or models called [[algorithms]] may be applied to the data to identify relationships among the variables, such as [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] or [[causality|causation]]. In general terms, models may be developed to evaluate a particular variable in the data based on other variable(s) in the data, with some residual error depending on model accuracy (i.e., Data = Model + Error).&lt;ref name="Judd and McClelland 1989"/&gt;

[[Inferential statistics]] includes techniques to measure relationships between particular variables.  For example, [[regression analysis]] may be used to model whether a change in advertising (independent variable X) explains the variation in sales (dependent variable Y). In mathematical terms, Y (sales) is a function of X (advertising). It may be described as Y = aX + b + error, where the model is designed such that a and b minimize the error when the model predicts Y for a given range of values of X. Analysts may attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data to simplify analysis and communicate results.&lt;ref name="Judd and McClelland 1989"/&gt;

===Data product===
A data product is a computer application that takes data inputs and generates outputs, feeding them back into the environment. It may be based on a model or algorithm. An example is an application that analyzes data about customer purchasing history and recommends other purchases the customer might enjoy.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Communication===
[[File:Social Network Analysis Visualization.png|thumb|250px|[[Data visualization]] to understand the results of a data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10| issue = 3| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = La connaissance est un réseau| journal =Les Cahiers du Numérique| date = 2014| pages = 37–54| url = http://www.martingrandjean.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Grandjean-2014-Connaissance-reseau.pdf| doi=10.3166/lcn.10.3.37-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main article|Data visualization}}
Once the data are analyzed, it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements. The users may have feedback, which results in additional analysis. As such, much of the analytical cycle is iterative.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

When determining how to communicate the results, the analyst may consider [[data visualization]] techniques to help clearly and efficiently communicate the message to the audience. Data visualization uses [[information displays]] (such as tables and charts) to help communicate key messages contained in the data. Tables are helpful to a user who might lookup specific numbers, while charts (e.g., bar charts or line charts) may help explain the quantitative messages contained in the data.

==Quantitative messages==
{{Main article|Data visualization}}
[[File:Total Revenues and Outlays as Percent GDP 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time.]]
[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A scatterplot illustrating correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time.]]
Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message. Customers specifying requirements and analysts performing the data analysis may consider these messages during the course of the process.
#Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A [[line chart]] may be used to demonstrate the trend.
#Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the ''measure'') by sales persons (the ''category'', with each sales person a ''categorical subdivision'') during a single period.  A [[bar chart]] may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.
#Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%).  A [[pie chart]] or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.
#Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period.  A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.
#Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0–10%, 11–20%, etc. A [[histogram]], a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis.
#Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A [[scatter plot]] is typically used for this message.
#Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.
#Geographic or geospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A [[cartogram]] is a typical graphic used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Selecting the Right Graph for Your Message-2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Graph Selection Matrix]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques for analyzing quantitative data==
{{See also|Problem solving}}
Author Jonathan Koomey has recommended a series of best practices for understanding quantitative data.  These include:
*Check raw data for anomalies prior to performing your analysis;
*Re-perform important calculations, such as verifying columns of data that are formula driven;
*Confirm main totals are the sum of subtotals;
*Check relationships between numbers that should be related in a predictable way, such as ratios over time;
*Normalize numbers to make comparisons easier, such as analyzing amounts per person or relative to GDP or as an index value relative to a base year;
*Break problems into component parts by analyzing factors that led to the results, such as [[DuPont analysis]] of return on equity.&lt;ref name="Koomey1"/&gt;

For the variables under examination, analysts typically obtain [[descriptive statistics]] for them, such as the mean (average), [[median]], and [[standard deviation]]. They may also analyze the [[probability distribution|distribution]] of the key variables to see how the individual values cluster around the mean.
[[File:US_Employment_Statistics_-_March_2015.png|thumb|250px|right|An illustration of the [[MECE principle]] used for data analysis.]] The consultants at [[McKinsey and Company]] named a technique for breaking a quantitative problem down into its component parts called the [[MECE principle]]. Each layer can be broken down into its components; each of the sub-components must be [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]] of each other and [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively]] add up to the layer above them. The relationship is referred to as "Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive" or MECE.  For example, profit by definition can be broken down into total revenue and total cost. In turn, total revenue can be analyzed by its components, such as revenue of divisions A, B, and C (which are mutually exclusive of each other) and should add to the total revenue (collectively exhaustive).

Analysts may use robust statistical measurements to solve certain analytical problems. [[Hypothesis testing]] is used when a particular hypothesis about the true state of affairs is made by the analyst and data is gathered to determine whether that state of affairs is true or false. For example, the hypothesis might be that "Unemployment has no effect on inflation", which relates to an economics concept called the [[Phillips Curve]]. Hypothesis testing involves considering the likelihood of [[Type I and type II errors]], which relate to whether the data supports accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.

[[Regression analysis]] may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X affects dependent variable Y (e.g., "To what extent do changes in the unemployment rate (X) affect the inflation rate (Y)?"). This is an attempt to model or fit an equation line or curve to the data, such that Y is a function of X.

[https://www.erim.eur.nl/centres/necessary-condition-analysis/ Necessary condition analysis] (NCA) may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X allows variable Y (e.g., "To what extent is a certain unemployment rate (X) necessary for a certain inflation rate (Y)?"). Whereas (multiple) regression analysis uses additive logic where each X-variable can produce the outcome and the X's can compensate for each other (they are sufficient but not necessary), necessary condition analysis (NCA) uses necessity logic, where one or more X-variables allow the outcome to exist, but may not produce it (they are necessary but not sufficient). Each single necessary condition must be present and compensation is not possible.

==Analytical activities of data users==
Users may have particular data points of interest within a data set, as opposed to general messaging outlined above. Such low-level user analytic activities are presented in the following table. The taxonomy can also be organized by three poles of activities: retrieving values, finding data points, and arranging data points.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Amar, James Eagan, and John Stasko (2005) [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/papers/infovis05.pdf "Low-Level Components of Analytic Activity in Information Visualization"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Newman (1994) [http://www.mdnpress.com/wmn/pdfs/chi94-pro-formas-2.pdf "A Preliminary Analysis of the Products of HCI Research, Using Pro Forma Abstracts"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Shaw (2002) [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Compose/ftp/shaw-fin-etaps.pdf "What Makes Good Research in Software Engineering?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConTaaS"&gt;{{cite web|title=ConTaaS: An Approach to Internet-Scale Contextualisation for Developing Efficient Internet of Things Applications|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/41879|website=ScholarSpace|publisher=HICSS50|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to effective analysis==
Barriers to effective analysis may exist among the analysts performing the data analysis or among the audience. Distinguishing fact from opinion, cognitive biases, and innumeracy are all challenges to sound data analysis.

===Confusing fact and opinion===
{{quote box|quote=You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.|source=[[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]|width = 250px}}

Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant [[fact]]s to answer questions, support a conclusion or formal [[opinion]], or test [[hypotheses]]. Facts by definition are irrefutable, meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them. For example, in August 2010, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated that extending the [[Bush tax cuts]] of 2001 and 2003 for the 2011–2020 time period would add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21670|title=Congressional Budget Office-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2010-Table 1.7 on Page 24 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone should be able to agree that indeed this is what CBO reported; they can all examine the report. This makes it a fact. Whether persons agree or disagree with the CBO is their own opinion.

As another example, the auditor of a public company must arrive at a formal opinion on whether financial statements of publicly traded corporations are "fairly stated, in all material respects." This requires extensive analysis of factual data and evidence to support their opinion. When making the leap from facts to opinions, there is always the possibility that the opinion is [[Type I and type II errors|erroneous]].

===Cognitive biases===
There are a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es that can adversely affect analysis. For example, [[confirmation bias]] is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. In addition, individuals may discredit information that does not support their views.

Analysts may be trained specifically to be aware of these biases and how to overcome them. In his book ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'', retired CIA analyst [[Richards Heuer]] wrote that analysts should clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of the uncertainty involved in the conclusions. He emphasized procedures to help surface and debate alternative points of view.&lt;ref name="Heuer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art3.html|title=Introduction|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innumeracy===
Effective analysts are generally adept with a variety of numerical techniques. However, audiences may not have such literacy with numbers or [[numeracy]]; they are said to be innumerate.  Persons communicating the data may also be attempting to mislead or misinform, deliberately using bad numerical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-28/bad-math-that-passes-for-insight Bloomberg-Barry Ritholz-Bad Math that Passes for Insight-October 28, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, whether a number is rising or falling may not be the key factor. More important may be the number relative to another number, such as the size of government revenue or spending relative to the size of the economy (GDP) or the amount of cost relative to revenue in corporate financial statements. This numerical technique is referred to as normalization&lt;ref name="Koomey1"/&gt; or common-sizing. There are many such techniques employed by analysts, whether adjusting for inflation (i.e., comparing real vs. nominal data) or considering population increases, demographics, etc. Analysts apply a variety of techniques to address the various quantitative messages described in the section above.

Analysts may also analyze data under different assumptions or scenarios. For example, when analysts perform [[financial statement analysis]], they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow, which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate, to determine the valuation of the company or its stock.  Similarly, the CBO analyzes the effects of various policy options on the government's revenue, outlays and deficits, creating alternative future scenarios for key measures.

==Other topics==

===Smart buildings===
A data analytics approach can be used in order to predict energy consumption in buildings.&lt;ref name="Towards energy efficiency smart buildings models based on intelligent data analytics"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The different steps of the data analysis process are carried out in order to realise smart buildings, where the building management and control operations including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting and security are realised automatically by miming the needs of the building users and optimising resources like energy and time.

===Analytics and business intelligence===
{{Main article|Analytics}}
Analytics is the "extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions." It is a subset of [[business intelligence]], which is a set of technologies and processes that use data to understand and analyze business performance.&lt;ref name="Competing on Analytics 2007"&gt;{{cite book

===Education===
[[File:User-activities.png|Analytic activities of data visualization users|thumb|right|350px]]
In [[education]], most educators have access to a [[data system]] for the purpose of analyzing student data.&lt;ref&gt;Aarons, D. (2009). [http://search.proquest.com/docview/202710770?accountid=28180 Report finds states on course to build pupil-data systems.] ''Education Week, 29''(13), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These data systems present data to educators in an [[over-the-counter data]] format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve the accuracy of educators’ data analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28).

==Practitioner notes==
This section contains rather technical explanations that may assist practitioners but are beyond the typical scope of a Wikipedia article.

===Initial data analysis===
The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase, is that during initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that is aimed at answering the original research question. The initial data analysis phase is guided by the following four questions:{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|p=337}}

====Quality of data====
The quality of the data should be checked as early as possible. Data quality can be assessed in several ways, using different types of analysis: frequency counts, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), normality (skewness, kurtosis, frequency histograms, n: variables are compared with coding schemes of variables external to the data set, and possibly corrected if coding schemes are not comparable.
*Test for [[common-method variance]].
The choice of analyses to assess the data quality during the initial data analysis phase depends on the analyses that will be conducted in the main analysis phase.{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=338-341}}

====Quality of measurements====
The quality of the [[measuring instrument|measurement instruments]] should only be checked during the initial data analysis phase when this is not the focus or research question of the study. One should check whether structure of measurement instruments corresponds to structure reported in the literature.

There are two ways to assess measurement: [NOTE: only one way seems to be listed]
*Analysis of homogeneity ([[internal consistency]]), which gives an indication of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of a measurement instrument. During this analysis, one inspects the variances of the items and the scales, the [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's α]] of the scales, and the change in the Cronbach's alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=341-342}}

====Initial transformations====
After assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements, one might decide to impute missing data, or to perform initial transformations of one or more variables, although this can also be done during the main analysis phase.{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|p=344}}&lt;br /&gt;
Possible transformations of variables are:&lt;ref&gt;Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007, p. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Square root transformation (if the distribution differs moderately from normal)
*Log-transformation (if the distribution differs substantially from normal)
*Inverse transformation (if the distribution differs severely from normal)
*Make categorical (ordinal / dichotomous) (if the distribution differs severely from normal, and no transformations help)

====Did the implementation of the study fulfill the intentions of the research design?====
One should check the success of the [[randomization]] procedure, for instance by checking whether background and substantive variables are equally distributed within and across groups. &lt;br /&gt;
If the study did not need or use a randomization procedure, one should check the success of the non-random sampling, for instance by checking whether all subgroups of the population of interest are represented in sample.&lt;br /&gt;
Other possible data distortions that should be checked are:
*[[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]] (this should be identified during the initial data analysis phase)
*Item [[Response rate (survey)|nonresponse]] (whether this is random or not should be assessed during the initial data analysis phase)
*Treatment quality (using [[manipulation check]]s).{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=344-345}}

====Characteristics of data sample====
In any report or article, the structure of the sample must be accurately described. It is especially important to exactly determine the structure of the sample (and specifically the size of the subgroups) when subgroup analyses will be performed during the main analysis phase.&lt;br /&gt;
The characteristics of the data sample can be assessed by looking at:
*Basic statistics of important variables
*Scatter plots
*Correlations and associations
*Cross-tabulations{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|p=345}}

====Final stage of the initial data analysis====
During the final stage, the findings of the initial data analysis are documented, and necessary, preferable, and possible corrective actions are taken.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, the original plan for the main data analyses can and should be specified in more detail or rewritten.&lt;br /&gt; In order to do this, several decisions about the main data analyses can and should be made:
*In the case of non-[[Normal distribution|normal]]s: should one [[Data transformation (statistics)|transform]] variables; make variables categorical (ordinal/dichotomous); adapt the analysis method?
*In the case of [[missing data]]: should one neglect or impute the missing data; which imputation technique should be used?
*In the case of [[outlier]]s: should one use robust analysis techniques?
*In case items do not fit the scale: should one adapt the measurement instrument by omitting items, or rather ensure comparability with other (uses of the) measurement instrument(s)?
*In the case of (too) small subgroups: should one drop the hypothesis about inter-group differences, or use small sample techniques, like exact tests or [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]]?
*In case the [[randomization]] procedure seems to be defective: can and should one calculate [[Propensity score matching|propensity scores]] and include them as covariates in the main analyses?{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=345-346}}

====Analysis====
Several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase:{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=346-347}}
*Univariate statistics (single variable)
*Bivariate associations (correlations)
*Graphical techniques (scatter plots)

It is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses, as special statistical techniques are available for each level:{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=349-353}}

*Nominal and ordinal variables
**Frequency counts (numbers and percentages)
**Associations
***circumambulations (crosstabulations)
***hierarchical loglinear analysis (restricted to a maximum of 8 variables)
***loglinear analysis (to identify relevant/important variables and possible confounders)
**Exact tests or bootstrapping (in case subgroups are small)
**Computation of new variables
*Continuous variables
**Distribution
***Statistics (M, SD, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
***Stem-and-leaf displays
***Box plots

====Nonlinear analysis====
Nonlinear analysis will be necessary when the data is recorded from a [[nonlinear system]]. Nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamic effects including [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]], [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[harmonics]] and [[subharmonics]] that cannot be analyzed using simple linear methods.  Nonlinear data analysis is closely related to [[nonlinear system identification]].&lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main data analysis===
In the main analysis phase analyses aimed at answering the research question are performed as well as any other relevant analysis needed to write the first draft of the research report.{{sfn|Adèr|2008b|p=363}}

====Exploratory and confirmatory approaches====
In the main analysis phase either an exploratory or confirmatory approach can be adopted. Usually the approach is decided before data is collected. In an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data, and the data is searched for models that describe the data well. In a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested.

[[Exploratory data analysis]] should be interpreted carefully. When testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant, but this can be due to a [[type 1 error]]. It is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with, for example, a [[Bonferroni correction]]. Also, one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset. An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory, but not to test that theory as well. When a model is found exploratory in a dataset, then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same [[type 1 error]] that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place. The confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis.{{sfn|Adèr|2008b|pp=361-362}}

====Stability of results====
It is important to obtain some indication about how generalizable the results are.{{sfn|Adèr|2008b|pp=361-371}} While this is hard to check, one can look at the stability of the results. Are the results reliable and reproducible? There are two main ways of doing this:
* [[Cross-validation (statistics)|Cross-validation]]: By splitting the data in multiple parts we can check if an analysis (like a fitted model) based on one part of the data generalizes to another part of the data as well.
* [[Sensitivity analysis]]: A procedure to study the behavior of a system or model when global parameters are (systematically) varied. One way to do this is with bootstrapping.

====Statistical methods====
Many statistical methods have been used for statistical analyses. A very brief list of four of the more popular methods is:
* [[General linear model]]: A widely used model on which various methods are based (e.g. [[t test]], [[ANOVA]], [[ANCOVA]], [[MANOVA]]). Usable for assessing the effect of several predictors on one or more continuous dependent variables.
* [[Generalized linear model]]: An extension of the general linear model for discrete dependent variables.
* [[Structural equation modelling]]: Usable for assessing latent structures from measured manifest variables.
* [[Item response theory]]: Models for (mostly) assessing one latent variable from several binary measured variables (e.g. an exam).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8429">In [[linear algebra]], given a [[vector space]] ''V'' with a basis ''B'' of vectors indexed by an [[index set]] ''I'' (the [[cardinality]] of ''I'' is the dimensionality of ''V''), its '''dual set''' is a set ''B''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; of vectors in the [[dual space]] ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; with the same index set ''I'' such that ''B'' and ''B''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; form a [[biorthogonal system]]. The dual set is always [[linearly independent]] but does not necessarily span ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. If it does span ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''B''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''dual basis''' or '''reciprocal basis''' for the basis ''B''.

Denoting the indexed vector sets as &lt;math&gt;B = \{v_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^{*} = \{v^i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt;, being biorthogonal means that the elements pair to have an [[inner product]] equal to 1 if the indexes are equal, and equal to 0 otherwise. Symbolically, evaluating a dual vector in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; on a vector in the original space ''V'':
:&lt;math&gt;
v^i\cdot v_j = \delta^i_j =
\begin{cases}
  1 &amp; \text{if } i = j\\
  0 &amp; \text{if } i \ne j\text{,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] symbol.

==A categorical and algebraic construction of the dual space==

Another way to introduce the dual space of a vector space ([[Module (mathematics)|module]]) is by introducing it in a categorical sense. To do this, let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a module defined over the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an object in the category &lt;math&gt;R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}&lt;/math&gt;). Then we define the dual space of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;A^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;, to be &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}_R(A,R)&lt;/math&gt;, the module formed of all &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-linear module homomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Note then that we may define a dual to the dual, referred to as the double dual of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;A^{\ast\ast}&lt;/math&gt;, and defined as &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}_R(A^{\ast},R)&lt;/math&gt;.

To formally construct a basis for the dual space, we shall now restrict our view to the case where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a finite-dimensional free (left) &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ring of unity. Then, we assume that the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. From here, we define the Kronecker Delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; over the basis &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{xy}=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{xy}=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x\ne y&lt;/math&gt;. Then the set &lt;math&gt; S = \lbrace f_x:F \to R \; | \; f_x(y)=\delta_{xy} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; describes a linearly independent set with each &lt;math&gt;f_x \in \text{Hom}_R(F,R)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional, the basis &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is of finite cardinality. Then, the set &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is a basis to &lt;math&gt;F^\ast&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is a free (right) &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module.

==Existence and uniqueness==
The dual set always exists and gives an injection from ''V'' into ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, namely the mapping that sends ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''. This says, in particular, that the dual space has dimension greater or equal to that of ''V''.

However, the dual set of an infinite-dimensional ''V'' does not span its dual space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, consider the map ''w'' in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; from ''V'' into the underlying scalars ''F'' given by {{nowrap|1=''w''(''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 1}} for all ''i''. This map is clearly nonzero on all ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. If ''w'' were a finite linear combination of the dual basis vectors ''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'', say &lt;math&gt;w=\sum_{i\in K}\alpha_iv^i&lt;/math&gt; for a finite subset ''K'' of ''I'', then for any ''j'' not in ''K'', &lt;math&gt;w(v_j)=\left(\sum_{i\in K}\alpha_iv^i\right)\left(v_j\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the definition of ''w''. So, this ''w'' does not lie in the span of the dual set.

The dual of an infinite-dimensional space has greater dimensionality (this being a greater infinite cardinality) than the original space has, and thus these cannot have a basis with the same indexing set. However, a dual set of vectors exists, which defines a subspace of the dual isomorphic to the original space. Further, for [[topological vector space]]s, a [[continuous dual space]] can be defined, in which case a dual basis may exist.

===Finite-dimensional vector spaces===

In the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces, the dual set is always a dual basis and it is unique. These bases are denoted by {{nowrap|1=''B'' = { ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''B''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = { ''e''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. If one denotes the evaluation of a covector on a vector as a pairing, the biorthogonality condition becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle e^i, e_j \right\rangle = \delta^i_j.&lt;/math&gt;

The association of a dual basis with a basis gives a map from the space of bases of ''V'' to the space of bases of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, and this is also an isomorphism. For [[topological field]]s such as the real numbers, the space of duals is a [[topological space]], and this gives a [[homeomorphism]] between the [[Stiefel manifold]]s of bases of these spaces.

==Introduction==
To perform operations with a vector, we must have a straightforward method of calculating its components. In a Cartesian frame the necessary operation is the dot product of the vector and the base vector.{{sfn|Lebedev|Cloud|Eremeyev|2010|p=12}} E.g.,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = x^1 \mathbf{i}_1 + x^2 \mathbf{i}_2 + x^3 \mathbf{i}_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the bases in a Cartesian frame.The components of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; can be found by

: &lt;math&gt;x^k = \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{i}_k&lt;/math&gt;

In a non-Cartesian frame, we do not necessarily have &lt;var&gt;'''e'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; · {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;'''e'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} for all {{nowrap|i ≠ j}}. However, it is always possible to find a vector &lt;var&gt;'''e'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;x^i = \mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}^i \qquad  (i = 1, 2, 3)&lt;/math&gt;.

the equality holds when &lt;var&gt;'''e'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the dual base of &lt;var&gt;'''e'''&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

In a Cartesian frame, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^k = \mathbf{e}_k = \mathbf{i}_k&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
For example, the standard basis vectors of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the [[Cartesian plane]]) are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2\right\} = \left\{
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 \\
      0 
    \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 \\
     1 
    \end{pmatrix}
  \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the standard basis vectors of its dual space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;* are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left\{\mathbf{e}^1, \mathbf{e}^2\right \} = \left\{
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 &amp; 0 
    \end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 &amp; 1 
    \end{pmatrix}
    \right\}\text{.}
&lt;/math&gt;

In 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], for a given basis {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}, you can find the biorthogonal (dual) basis {'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;} by formulas below:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}^1 = \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}_2 \times \mathbf{e}_3}{V}\right)^\mathsf{T},\ 
  \mathbf{e}^2 = \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}_3 \times \mathbf{e}_1}{V}\right)^\mathsf{T},\ 
  \mathbf{e}^3 = \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}_1 \times \mathbf{e}_2}{V}\right)^\mathsf{T}.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Maybe, this formula can illustrate, why dual basis is also called biorthogonal... --&gt;

where {{math|{{sup|T}}}} denotes the [[transpose]] and

:&lt;math&gt;
  V                                                   \,=\,
  \left(\mathbf{e}_1;\mathbf{e}_2;\mathbf{e}_3\right) \,=\,
  \mathbf{e}_1\cdot(\mathbf{e}_2\times\mathbf{e}_3)   \,=\,
  \mathbf{e}_2\cdot(\mathbf{e}_3\times\mathbf{e}_1)   \,=\,
  \mathbf{e}_3\cdot(\mathbf{e}_1\times\mathbf{e}_2)
&lt;/math&gt;

is the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] formed by the basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1,\,\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">'''Sir Edward Thomas Ffrench Bromhead, 2nd Baronet''' [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (26 March 1789 – 14 March 1855) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] landowner and [[mathematician]] best remembered as patron of the mathematician and physicist [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]].

==Life==
Born the son of [[Gonville Bromhead]], 1st Baronet Bromhead (grandfather of the British second in command of the same name at [[Rorke's Drift]]) and Lady Jane Ffrench, Baroness Ffrench, in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=database/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783-2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Bromhead was educated at the [[University of Glasgow]] and later at [[Caius College, Cambridge]] ( B.A. 1812, M.A. 1815) before taking up the study of law at the [[Inner Temple]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{acad|id=BRMT808ET|name=Bromhead, Edward Thomas Ffrench}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1817.  Returning to Lincolnshire, he became [[High steward (civic)|High Steward]] of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. He became the 2nd [[Bromhead baronets|Bromhead baronet]], of Thurlby Hall in 1822.

While at Cambridge, Bromhead was a founder of the [[Analytical Society]], a precursor of the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cambridgeforecast.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/from-the-analytical-society-to-the-philosophical-breakfast-club/ From the Analytical Society to the Philosophical Breakfast Club: Science and the Making of the Modern World] Cambridge Forecast Group, March 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[John Herschel]], [[George Peacock]] and [[Charles Babbage]], with whom he maintained a close and lifelong friendship.  While he was, by all accounts, a gifted mathematician in his own right (although ill-health prevented him from pursuing his studies further), his greatest contribution to the subject is at second hand: having subscribed to the first publication of self-taught mathematician and physicist [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]], he encouraged Green to continue his research and to write further papers (which Bromhead sent on to be published in the [[Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]] and those of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]).

Bromhead repeated his success by encouraging the young [[George Boole]] from [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. Bromhead was President of the Lincoln Mechanics Institute in the [[Lincoln Greyfriars]], where George Boole's father was the curator. Boole came to notice when he gave a lecture on the work of Sir [[Isaac Newton]] on 5 February 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/sochistastro/lincolnshire.htm Society for the History of Astronomy], Lincoln, retrieved 20 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The young Boole's development was fed by books that Bromhead supplied.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;A.

Bromhead lost his sight when he was old and he died unmarried at his home of Thurlby Hall in [[Thurlby, North Kesteven]] on 14 March 1855.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Elias ω coding''' or '''Elias omega coding''' is a [[universal code (data compression)|universal code]] encoding the positive integers developed by [[Peter Elias]]. Like [[Elias gamma coding]] and [[Elias delta coding]], it works by prefixing the integer with a representation of its [[order of magnitude]] in a universal code. Unlike those other two codes, however, Elias omega recursively encodes that prefix; thus, they are sometimes known as '''recursive Elias codes'''.

Omega coding is used in applications where the largest encoded value is not known ahead of time, or to [[Data compression|compress]] data in which small values are much more frequent than large values.

To code a [[number]] ''N'':
#Place a "0" at the end of the code.
#If ''N''&amp;nbsp;= 1, stop; encoding is complete.
#Prepend the [[binary numeral system|binary]] representation of ''N'' to the beginning of the code. This will be at least two bits, the first bit of which is a 1.
#Let ''N'' equal the number of bits just prepended, minus one.
#Return to step 2 to prepend the encoding of the new ''N''.

To decode an Elias omega-coded integer:
#Start with a variable ''N'', set to a value of 1.
#If the next bit is a "0", stop.  The decoded number is ''N''.
#If the next bit is a "1", then read it plus ''N'' more bits, and use that binary number as the new value of ''N''.  Go back to step 2.

==Examples==
Omega codes can be thought of as a number of "groups". A group is either a single 0 bit, which terminates the code, or two or more bits beginning with 1, which is followed by another group.

The first few codes are shown below. Included is the so-called ''implied distribution'', describing the distribution of values for which this coding yields a minimum-size code; see [[Universal code (data compression)#Relationship to practical compression|Relationship of universal codes to practical compression]] for details.

The encoding for 1 [[googol]], 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;, is 11 1000 101001100 (15 bits of length header) followed by the 333-bit binary representation of 1 googol, which is 10010 01001001 10101101 00100101 10010100 11000011 01111100 11101011 00001011 00100111 10000100 11000100 11001110 00001011 11110011 10001010 11001110 01000000 10001110 00100001 00011010 01111100 10101010 10110010 01000011 00001000 10101000 00101110 10001111 00010000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 and a trailing 0, for a total of 349 bits.

A googol to the hundredth power (10&lt;sup&gt;10000&lt;/sup&gt;) is a 33220-bit binary number. Its omega encoding is 33,243 bits long: 11 1111 1000000111000100 (22 bits), followed by 33,220 bits of the value, and a trailing 0.  Under [[Elias delta coding]], the same number is 33,250 bits long: 000000000000000 1000000111000100 (31 bits) followed by 33,219 bits of the value. As log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;10000&lt;/sup&gt;) = 33219.28, so in this instance, omega and delta coding are, respectively, only 0.07% and 0.09% longer than optimal.

                    num |= 1;
            }
        }
        intwriter.putInt(num);           // write out the value
    }
    bitreader.close();
    intwriter.close();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Generalizations ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Elias gamma coding]] --&gt;
Elias omega coding does not code zero or negative integers.
One way to code all non negative integers is to add 1 before coding and then subtract 1 after decoding.
One way to code all integers is to set up a [[bijection]], mapping all integers (0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ...) to strictly positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...) before coding.

An '''equally spaced polynomial''' (ESP) is a [[polynomial]] used in [[finite field]]s, specifically GF(2) ([[binary numeral system|binary]]).

An s-ESP of degree ''sm'' can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
ESP(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{m} x^{si}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i = 0, 1, \ldots, m
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
ESP(x) = x^{sm} + x^{s(m-1)} + \cdots + x^s + 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
Over GF(2) the ESP has many interesting properties, including:
* The [[Hamming weight]] of the ESP is ''m'' + 1.

A 1-ESP is known as an [[all one polynomial]] and has additional properties including the above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3745">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], the '''exponential formula''' (called the '''polymer expansion''' in [[physics]]) states that the exponential generating function for structures on finite sets is the exponential of the exponential generating function for connected structures.
The exponential formula is a power-series version of a special case of [[Faà di Bruno's formula]].

==Statement==
For any [[formal power series]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=a_1 x+{a_2 \over 2}x^2+{a_3 \over 6}x^3+\cdots+{a_n \over n!}x^n+\cdots\,&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;\exp f(x)=e^{f(x)}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty {b_n \over n!}x^n,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;b_n=\sum_{\pi=\left\{\,S_1,\,\dots,\,S_k\,\right\}} a_{\left|S_1\right|}\cdots a_{\left|S_k\right|}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the index {{pi}} runs through the list of all [[partition of a set|partitions]] { ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; } of the set { 1, ..., ''n'' }. (When ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the product is [[Empty product|empty]] and by definition equals 1.)

One can write the formula in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = B_n(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n),&lt;/math&gt;
and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty {a_n \over n!} x^n \right) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {B_n(a_1,\dots,a_n) \over n!} x^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the ''n''th complete [[Bell polynomial]].

==Examples==
* &lt;math&gt;b_3=B_3(a_1,a_2,a_3)=a_3+3a_2 a_1 + a_1^3,&lt;/math&gt; because there is one partition of the set { 1, 2, 3 } that has a single block of size 3, there are three partitions of { 1, 2, 3 } that split it into a block of size 2 and a block of size 1, and there is one partition of { 1, 2, 3 } that splits it into three blocks of size 1.
* If ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''(''n''&amp;minus;1)/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of graphs whose vertices are a given ''n''-point set, then ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of connected graphs whose vertices are a given ''n''-point set.
*There are numerous variations of the previous example where the graph has certain properties: for example, if ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; counts graphs without cycles, then ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; counts trees (connected graphs without cycles).
*If ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; counts directed graphs whose ''edges'' (rather than vertices) are a given ''n'' point set, then ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; counts connected directed graphs with this edge s

==Applications==
In applications, the numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; often count the number of some sort of "connected" structure on an ''n''-point set, and the numbers ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; count the number of (possibly disconnected) structures. The numbers ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''! count the number of isomorphism classes of structures on ''n'' points, with each structure being weighted by the reciprocal of its automorphism group, and the numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''! count isomorphism classes of connected structures in the same way.

In quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]s ''Z'', or more generally [[correlation function]]s, are given by a formal sum over [[Feynman diagram]]s. The exponential formula shows that log(''Z'') can be written as a sum over connected Feynman diagrams, in terms of [[connected correlation function]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">In mathematics, the '''Feferman–Schütte ordinal''' Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[large countable ordinal]].
It is the [[proof theoretic ordinal]] of several mathematical theories, such as [[arithmetical transfinite recursion]].
It is named after [[Solomon Feferman]] and [[Kurt Schütte]].

It is sometimes said to be the first impredicative ordinal,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Schütte, ''Proof theory'', Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, Band 225, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1977, xii + 302 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; though this is controversial, partly because there is no generally accepted precise definition of "[[predicativity|predicative]]". Sometimes an ordinal is said to be predicative if it is less than Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is no standard notation for ordinals at and beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, so there are several ways of representing it, some of which use [[ordinal collapsing function]]s: &lt;math&gt;\psi(\Omega^\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi_\Omega(0)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==
The Feferman–Schütte ordinal can be defined as the smallest ordinal that cannot be obtained by starting with 0 and using the operations of ordinal addition and the [[Veblen function]]s φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(β). That is, it is the smallest α such that φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = α.

[[Image:Hyperbolic orthogonal dodecahedral honeycomb.png|thumb|A perspective projection of a [[Hyperbolic small dodecahedral honeycomb|dodecahedral tessellation]] in '''[[Hyperbolic 3-manifold|H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]'''. Note the recursive structure: each pentagon contains smaller pentagons, which contain smaller pentagons. This is an example of a subdivision rule arising from a finite universe (i.e. a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).]]

In mathematics, a '''finite subdivision rule''' is a recursive way of dividing a [[polygon]] or other two-dimensional shape into smaller and smaller pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of [[fractals]]. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals.&lt;ref name="finite" /&gt; Subdivision rules have been used in architecture, biology, and computer science, as well as in the study of [[hyperbolic manifold]]s. [[Substitution tiling]]s are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.

==Definition==
A subdivision rule takes a [[Tiling (mathematics)|tiling]] of the plane by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing''' '''each polygon into smaller polygons. It is '''finite '''if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a '''tile type'''. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many '''edge types'''. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that are made up of polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called '''subdivision complexes''' for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide it over and over again to get a sequence of tilings.

For instance, '''binary subdivision''' has one tile type and one edge type:
[[File:The binary subdivision rule.png|frameless|none|The binary subdivision rule]]

Since the only tile type is a quadrilateral, binary subdivision can only subdivide tilings made up of quadrilaterals. This means that the only subdivision complexes are tilings by quadrilaterals. The tiling can be [[Regular tiling|regular]], but doesn't have to be:

[[File:BinarySubdivisionComplex2.png|frameless|none|We start with a complex with four quadrilaterals and subdivide twice. All squares are type A tiles.]]

Here we start with a complex made of four quadrilaterals and subdivide it twice. All quadrilaterals are type A tiles.

==Examples of finite subdivision rules==

[[Barycentric subdivision]] is an example of a subdivision rule with one edge type (that gets subdivided into two edges) and one tile type (a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex.&lt;ref name="finite"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''[http://www.ams.org/ecgd/2001-05-08/S1088-4173-01-00055-8/S1088-4173-01-00055-8.pdf Finite subdivision rules]''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 5 (2001), pp. 153&amp;ndash;196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Penrose tiling]] can be generated by a subdivision rule on a set of four tile types (the curved lines in the table below only help to show how the tiles fit together):

Certain [[rational mapping|rational maps]] give rise to finite subdivision rules.&lt;ref name="rational"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''[https://www.ams.org/ecgd/2007-11-10/S1088-4173-07-00167-1/S1088-4173-07-00167-1.pdf Constructing subdivision rules from rational maps]''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 11 (2007), pp. 128&amp;ndash;136.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes most [[Lattès map]]s.&lt;ref name="rationalB"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. ''Lattès maps and subdivision rules''. Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 14 (2010, pp. 113&amp;ndash;140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every prime, non-split alternating [[knot complement|knot or link complement]] has a subdivision rule, with some tiles that do not subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement.&lt;ref name="Alternating"&gt;B. Rushton. ''[http://www.ams.org/journals/ecgd/2010-14-01/S1088-4173-09-00205-7/S1088-4173-09-00205-7.pdf Constructing subdivision rules from alternating links]''. Conform. Geom. Dyn. 14 (2010), 1&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a [[knot complement]]; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not [[simply connected]]), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.

The subdivision rule looks different for different geometries. This is a subdivision rule for the [[trefoil knot]], which is not a [[hyperbolic knot]]:

And this is the subdivision rule for the [[Borromean rings]], which is hyperbolic:
	 
[[File:Borromean subdivision rule.png|none|300px|Borromean subdivision rule]] 
	
In each case, the subdivision rule would act on some tiling of a sphere (i.e. the night sky), but it is easier to just draw a small part of the night sky, corresponding to a single tile being repeatedly subdivided. This is what happens for the trefoil knot:

==Subdivision rules in higher dimensions==

Subdivision rules can easily be generalized to other dimensions.&lt;ref name="Torus"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rushton | first1 = B. | doi = 10.1007/s10711-012-9802-5 | title = A finite subdivision rule for the n-dimensional torus | journal = Geometriae Dedicata | volume = 167 | pages = 23–34 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1110.3310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[barycentric subdivision]] is used in all dimensions. Also, binary subdivision can be generalized to other dimensions (where [[hypercube]]s get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].

==Rigorous definition==
[[File:FourTorusSubdivision.svg|thumb|A subdivision rule for the four-torus. The faces of the B tiles that subdivide can only touch C tiles, and the faces of the B tiles that don't only touch A tiles.]]
A '''finite subdivision rule''' &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; consists of the following.&lt;ref name="finite" /&gt;

1. A finite 2-dimensional [[CW complex]] &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''subdivision complex''', with a fixed cell structure such that &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; is the union of its closed 2-cells. We assume that for each closed 2-cell &lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; there is a CW structure &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; on a closed 2-disk such that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; has at least two vertices, the vertices and edges of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are contained in &lt;math&gt;\partial s&lt;/math&gt;, and the characteristic map &lt;math&gt;\psi_s:s\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt; which maps onto &lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}&lt;/math&gt; restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell.

2. A finite two dimensional CW complex &lt;math&gt;R(S_R)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a subdivision of &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

3.A continuous cellular map &lt;math&gt;\phi_R:R(S_R)\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt; called the '''subdivision map''', whose restriction to every open cell is a homeomorphism onto an open cell.

Each CW complex &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the definition above (with its given characteristic map &lt;math&gt;\psi_s&lt;/math&gt;) is called a '''tile type'''.

An &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-complex for a subdivision rule &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a 2-dimensional CW complex &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which is the union of its closed 2-cells, together with a continuous cellular map &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt; whose restriction to each open cell is a homeomorphism. We can subdivide &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a complex &lt;math&gt;R(X)&lt;/math&gt; by requiring that the induced map &lt;math&gt;f:R(X)\rightarrow R(S_R)&lt;/math&gt; restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell. &lt;math&gt;R(X)&lt;/math&gt; is again an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-complex with map &lt;math&gt;\phi_R \circ f:R(X)\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt;. By repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of subdivided &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-complexes &lt;math&gt;R^n(X)&lt;/math&gt; with maps &lt;math&gt;\phi_R^n\circ f:R^n(X)\rightarrow S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

Binary subdivision is one example:&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt;

[[File:The binary subdivision rule.png|frameless|none|The binary subdivision rule.]]

The subdivision complex can be created by gluing together the opposite edges of the square, making the subdivision complex &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; into a [[torus]]. The subdivision map &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the doubling map on the torus, wrapping the meridian around itself twice and the longitude around itself twice. This is a four-fold [[covering map]]. The plane, tiled by squares, is a subdivision complex for this subdivision rule, with the structure map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow R(S_R)&lt;/math&gt; given by the standard covering map. Under subdivision, each square in the plane gets subdivided into squares of one-fourth the size.

==Quasi-isometry properties==
[[File:CantorHistoryGraph.png|thumb|The history graph of the [[Cantor set|middle thirds]] subdivision rule.]]

Subdivision rules can be used to study the [[quasi-isometry]] properties of certain spaces.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt; Given a subdivision rule &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and subdivision complex &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] called the '''history graph''' that records the action of the subdivision rule. The graph consists of the [[dual graph]]s of every stage &lt;math&gt;R^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;, together with edges connecting each tile in &lt;math&gt;R^n(X)&lt;/math&gt; with its subdivisions in &lt;math&gt;R^{n+1}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

The quasi-isometry properties of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to [[hyperbolic space]] exactly when the subdivision rule is '''conformal''', as described in the [[combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem]].&lt;ref name = "RM" /&gt;

Islamic [[Girih]] tiles in Islamic architecture are self-similar tilings that can be modeled with finite subdivision rules.&lt;ref name="Girih"/&gt; In 2007, [[Peter Lu|Peter J. Lu]] of [[Harvard University]] and Professor [[Paul Steinhardt|Paul J. Steinhardt]] of [[Princeton University]] published a paper in the journal ''Science'' suggesting that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with [[self-similar]] [[fractal]] [[quasicrystalline]] tilings such as [[Penrose tiling]]s (presentation 1974, predecessor works starting in about 1964) predating them by five centuries.&lt;ref name="Girih"&gt;{{cite journal | first1= Peter J. | last1=Lu | first2= Paul J. | last2= Steinhardt | year = 2007 | title = Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 315 | pages = 1106–1110 | url = http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.1135491 | pmid = 17322056 | issue = 5815 | bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1106L | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091007024019/http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007.pdf | archivedate = 2009-10-07 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |title=Supporting Online Material |url=http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326095515/http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subdivision surface]]s in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the [[Catmull-Clark subdivision surface]]) take a [[polygon mesh]] (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas.&lt;ref name="surface"&gt;D. Zorin. ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.2714&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Subdivisions on arbitrary meshes: algorithms and theory]''. Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Singapore) Lecture Notes Series. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision of the old mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).

Subdivision rules were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.&lt;ref name="biol"&gt;J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZHyqUli9y8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22james+w.+cannon%22+maths&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RP1svsBqga&amp;sig=kxyEXFBqOG5NnJncng9HHniHyrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA65,M1 ''Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry''.] Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65&amp;ndash;82. World Scientific, 2000. {{ISBN|981-02-3792-8}}, {{ISBN|978-981-02-3792-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt; Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt; They suggested that the "negatively curved" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt; In particular they suggested that such "negatively curved" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.&lt;ref name="biol"/&gt;

==Cannon's conjecture==

[[James W. Cannon|Cannon]], [[William Floyd (mathematician)|Floyd]], and [[Walter Parry|Parry]] first studied finite subdivision rules in an attempt to prove the following conjecture:

'''Cannon's conjecture''': Every [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Gromov]] [[hyperbolic group]] with a 2-sphere at infinity [[Geometric group action|acts geometrically]] on [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]].&lt;ref name="RM"&gt;James W. Cannon. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9w0608p039151254/ ''The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem''.] [[Acta Mathematica]] 173 (1994), no. 2, pp. 155&amp;ndash;234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a geometric action is a cocompact, properly discontinuous action by isometries. This conjecture was partially solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] in his proof&lt;ref name="perelman200211"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha |title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications |eprint = math.DG/0211159 | date = 11 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelman200303"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=[[Ricci flow with surgery]] on three-manifolds |eprint=math.DG/0303109 | date = 10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelman200307"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds |eprint=math.DG/0307245 |date = 17 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Geometrization conjecture]], which states (in part) than any Gromov hyperbolic group that is a 3-manifold group must act geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space. However, it still remains to show that a Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity is a 3-manifold group.

Cannon and Swenson showed &lt;ref name="CS"&gt;J. W. Cannon and E. L. Swenson, ''Recognizing constant curvature discrete groups in dimension 3''. [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] 350 (1998), no. 2, pp. 809&amp;ndash;849.&lt;/ref&gt; that a hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity has an associated subdivision rule. If this subdivision rule is conformal in a certain sense, the group will be a 3-manifold group with the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space.&lt;ref name="RM" /&gt;

==Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem==

Subdivision rules give a sequence of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an [[Riemann surface|analytic structure]] on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt;

Its statement needs some background. A tiling &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a closed annulus) gives two invariants, &lt;math&gt;M_{sup} (R,T)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{inf} (R,T)&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Extremal length#Discrete extremal length|approximate moduli]]. These are similar to the classical [[Extremal length#extremal distance in an annulus|modulus of a ring]]. They are defined by the use of '''weight functions'''. A weight function &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; assigns a non-negative number called a '''weight''' to each tile of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Every path in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be given a length, defined to be the sum of the weights of all tiles in the path. Define the '''height''' &lt;math&gt;H(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; to be the infimum of the length of all possible paths connecting the inner boundary of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to the outer boundary. The '''circumference''' &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the infimum of the length of all possible paths circling the ring (i.e. not nullhomotopic in R). The '''area'''&lt;math&gt;A(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the sum of the squares of all weights in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then  define

 &lt;math&gt;M_{sup} (R,T)=\sup \frac{H(\rho)^2}{A(\rho)}&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;m_{inf} (R,T)=\inf \frac{A(\rho)}{C(\rho)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that they are invariant under scaling of the metric.

A sequence &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2,...&lt;/math&gt; of tilings is '''conformal (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;)''' if mesh approaches 0 and:

# For each ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the approximate moduli &lt;math&gt;M_{sup}(R,T_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{inf}(R,T_i)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large, lie in a single interval of the form &lt;math&gt;[r,Kr]&lt;/math&gt;; and
# Given a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the surface, a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and an integer &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, there is a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; separating x from the complement of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, such that for all large &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; the approximate moduli of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are all greater than &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt;

===Statement of theorem===

If a sequence &lt;math&gt;T_1,T_2,...&lt;/math&gt; of tilings of a surface is conformal (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) in the above sense, then there is a [[conformal structure]] on the surface and a constant &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; in which the classical moduli and approximate moduli (from &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large) of any given annulus are &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt;-comparable, meaning that they lie in a single interval &lt;math&gt;[r,K'r]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="RM"/&gt;

===Consequences===

The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem implies that a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts geometrically on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^3&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is Gromov hyperbolic, it has a sphere at infinity, and the natural subdivision rule on the sphere gives rise to a sequence of tilings that is conformal in the sense above. Thus, Cannon's conjecture would be true if all such subdivision rules were conformal.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5472">A '''Goodman–Nguyen–van Fraassen algebra''' is a type of [[conditional event algebra]] (CEA) that embeds the standard [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of unconditional events in a larger algebra which is itself Boolean. The goal (as with all CEAs) is to equate the [[conditional probability]] ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') / ''P''(''A'') with the probability of a conditional event, ''P''(''A'' → ''B'') for more than just trivial choices of ''A'', ''B'', and ''P''.

==Construction of the algebra==

Given set Ω, which is the set of possible outcomes, and set ''F'' of subsets of Ω&amp;mdash;so that ''F'' is the set of possible events&amp;mdash;consider an infinite [[Cartesian product]] of the form ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ×  … × ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; × Ω × Ω × Ω ×  …, where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are members of ''F''. Such a product specifies the set of all infinite sequences whose first element is in ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, whose second element is in ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, and whose ''n''th element is in ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and all of whose elements are in Ω. Note that one such product is the one where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = … = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = Ω, i.e., the set Ω × Ω ×  Ω ×  Ω × …. Designate this set as &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;; it is the set of all infinite sequences whose elements are in Ω.

A new Boolean algebra is now formed, whose elements are subsets of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. To begin with, any event which was formerly represented by subset ''A'' of Ω is now represented by &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; = ''A'' × Ω × Ω × Ω × ….

Additionally, however, for events ''A'' and ''B'', let the conditional event ''A'' → ''B'' be represented as the following infinite union of disjoint sets: 

:[(''A'' ∩ ''B'') ×  Ω ×  Ω ×  Ω × …] ∪  
:[''A''′ × (''A'' ∩ ''B'') × Ω × Ω ×  Ω × …] ∪ 
:[''A''′ × ''A'' ′ × (''A'' ∩ ''B'') ×  Ω × Ω ×  Ω × …] ∪ …. 

The motivation for this representation of conditional events will be explained shortly. Note that the construction can be iterated; ''A'' and ''B'' can themselves be conditional events.

Intuitively, unconditional event ''A'' ought to be representable as conditional event Ω → ''A''. And indeed: because Ω ∩ ''A'' = ''A'' and Ω′ = ∅, the infinite union representing Ω → ''A'' reduces to ''A'' ×  Ω ×  Ω ×  Ω × ….

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{F}&lt;/math&gt; now be a set of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, which contains representations of all events in ''F'' and is otherwise just large enough to be closed under construction of conditional events and under the familiar [[Algebra of sets|Boolean operations]]. &lt;math&gt;\hat{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a Boolean algebra of conditional events which contains a Boolean algebra corresponding to the algebra of ordinary events.

==Definition of the extended probability function==

Corresponding to the newly constructed logical objects, called conditional events, is a new definition of a probability function, &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt;, based on a standard [[probability function]] ''P'': 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt;(''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × … ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; × Ω × Ω × Ω × …) = ''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)⋅''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)⋅ … ⋅''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)⋅''P''(Ω)⋅''P''(Ω)⋅''P''(Ω)⋅ … = ''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)⋅''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)⋅ … ⋅''P''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), since ''P''(Ω) = 1.

It follows from the definition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;) = ''P''(''A''). Thus &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' over the domain of ''P''.

==''P''(''A'' → ''B'') = ''P''(''B''|''A'')==

Now comes the insight that motivates all of the preceding work. For ''P'', the original probability function, ''P''(''A''′) = 1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''P''(''A''), and therefore ''P''(''B''|''A'') = ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') / ''P''(''A'') can be rewritten as ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') / [1 – ''P''(''A''′)]. The factor 1 / [1 – ''P''(''A''′)], however, can in turn be represented by its [[Taylor series|Maclaurin series expansion]], 1 + ''P''(''A''′) + ''P''(''A''′)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; …. Therefore, ''P''(''B''|''A'') = ''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') + ''P''(''A''′)''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') + ''P''(''A''′)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') + ….

The right side of the equation is exactly the expression for the probability &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; of ''A'' → ''B'', just defined as a union of carefully chosen disjoint sets. Thus that union can be taken to represent the conditional event ''A''→ ''B'', such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt;(''A'' → ''B'') = ''P''(''B''|''A'') for any choice of ''A'', ''B'', and ''P''. But since &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' over the domain of ''P'', the hat notation is optional. So long as the context is understood (i.e., conditional event algebra), one can write ''P''(''A'' → ''B'') = ''P''(''B''|''A''), with ''P'' now being the extended probability function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7737">'''Gunther Schmidt''' (born 1939, [[Rüdersdorf]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] who works also in [[informatics]].

== Life ==
Schmidt began studying Mathematics in 1957 at [[Göttingen University]], studying with [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]] who had returned to Göttingen after spending time in the [[United States]] during 
WWII. In 1960 he transferred to [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]] where he studied [[functions of several complex variables]] with [[Karl Stein (mathematician)|Karl Stein]]. Schmidt wrote a thesis on [[analytic continuation]] of such functions.

In 1962 Schmidt began work at [[TU München]] with students of Robert Sauer, in the beginning in labs and tutorials, later in mentoring and administration. Schmidt's interests turned toward programming when he collaborated with Hans Langmaack on [[rewriting]] and the [[braid group]] in 1969. [[Friedrich L. Bauer]] and [[Klaus Samelson]] were establishing [[software engineering]] at the university and Schmidt joined their group in 1974. In 1977 he submitted his [[Habilitation]] "Programs as partial graphs".&lt;ref&gt;R. Berghammer and M. Winter (2004) "Gunther Schmidt’s Life as a mathematician and computer scientist", [[Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming]] 83: 300 to 308&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[professor]] in 1980. Shortly after that, he was appointed to hold the chair of the late [[Klaus Samelson]] for one and a half years. From 1988 until his retirement in 2004, he held a professorship at the Faculty for Computer Science of the [[Universität der Bundeswehr München]]. He was a classroom instructor for beginners courses as well as special courses in [[mathematical logic]], semantics of [[programming language]]s, construction of [[compiler]]s, and [[algorithmic language]]s. Working with Thomas Strohlein, he authored a [[textbook]] on [[binary relation|relations]] and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, published in German in 1989 and English in 1993.

The [[calculus of relations]] had a relatively low profile among mathematical topics in the twentieth century, but Schmidt and others have raised that profile. The [[partial order]] of binary relations can be organized by grouping through [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]. In 2018 Schmidt and Michael Winter published ''Relational Topology'' to exhibit [[topologies]] of relations using [[algebraic logic]].

In 2001 he became involved in a large project (17 nations) with the [[European Cooperation in Science and Technology]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cost.eu/about_cost about the European Cooperation in Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt was chairman of project COST 274 TARSKI (Theory and Application of Relational Structures as Knowledge Instruments).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ict/Actions/274 COST 274 TARSKI]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)''' ({{sq|Instituti i Statistikës}}), is the statistical agency of [[Albania]]. It was established in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-International-Defence-Directory/Institute-of-Statistics--INSTAT-Albania.html Institute of Statistics – INSTAT (Albania) – Jane's International Defence Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first statistical office in Albania was opened in 1924. At the time it collected economic data on the Ministry of Public Affairs and Agriculture of Albania. The activity of this office was limited to agriculture inventories that consisted in registration of the number of farmers, type of land and the use of agriculture livestock plants, as well as in a few statistics on industry, trade, export-import and prices.

The statistical service was for the first time institutionalized by the decision no. 121, dated. 8 April 1940. The statistical service system was established by the decision no. 35, dated 13/01/1945 with the creation of Statistics Department under the authority of the Council of Ministers of Albania. This Department was put later under the authority of The State Plan Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instat.gov.al/en/about-us.aspx Short History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the institute operates under the direct authority of the Council of Ministers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39269">[[File:PI constant.svg|thumb|240px|The mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]] is an irrational number that is much represented in popular culture.]]
[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|right|thumb|240px|The number [[Square root of 2|{{radic|2}}]] is irrational.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''irrational numbers''' are all the [[real number]]s which are not [[rational number]]s, the latter being the numbers constructed from ratios (or [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s) of [[integer]]s. When the [[ratio]] of lengths of two line segments is an irrational number, the line segments are also described as being ''[[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]]'', meaning that they share no "measure" in common, that is, there is no length ("the measure"), no matter how short, that could be used to express the lengths of both of the two given segments as integer multiples of itself.

Among irrational numbers are the ratio [[Pi|{{pi}}]] of a circle's circumference to its diameter, Euler's number [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']], the golden ratio [[Golden ratio|''φ'']], and the [[square root of two]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/Pickover/trans.html The 15 Most Famous Transcendental Numbers]. by [[Clifford A. Pickover]]. URL retrieved 24 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html; URL retrieved 24 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Irrational Number|urlname=IrrationalNumber}} URL retrieved 26 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact all square roots of [[natural number]]s, other than of [[square number|perfect square]]s, are irrational.

It can be shown that irrational numbers, when expressed in a positional numeral system (e.g. as [[decimal number]]s, or with any other [[natural number|natural]] basis), do not terminate, nor do they [[repeating decimal|repeat]], i.e., do not contain a subsequence of digits, the repetition of which makes up the tail of the representation. For example, the decimal representation of the number {{pi}} starts with 3.14159, but no finite number of digits can represent {{pi}} exactly, nor does it repeat. The proof that the decimal expansion of a rational number must terminate or repeat is distinct from the proof that a decimal expansion that terminates or repeats must be a rational number, and although elementary and not lengthy, both proofs take some work. Mathematicians do not generally take "terminating or repeating" to be the definition of the concept of rational number.

Irrational numbers may also be dealt with via [[Continued fraction#Infinite continued fractions and convergents|non-terminating continued fractions]].

As a consequence of [[Cantor's diagonal argument|Cantor's proof]] that the real numbers are [[uncountable]] and the [[rational number|rationals]] countable, it follows that [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cantor|first=Georg|year=1955|origyear=1915|title=Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers|url=https://archive.org/details/contributionstot003626mbp|editor=[[Philip Jourdain]]|place=New York|publisher=Dover|isbn= 978-0-486-60045-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
&lt;!-- [[History of irrational numbers]] links here --&gt;
[[File:Set of real numbers (diagram).svg|thumb|Set of real numbers (R), which include the rationals (Q), which include the integers (Z), which include the natural numbers (N). The real numbers also include the irrationals (R\Q).]]

=== Ancient Greece ===
The first proof of the existence of irrational numbers is usually attributed to a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] (possibly [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; who probably discovered them while identifying sides of the [[pentagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R. Choike|year=1980|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The then-current Pythagorean method would have claimed that there must be some sufficiently small, indivisible unit that could fit evenly into one of these lengths as well as the other. However, Hippasus, in the 5th century BC, was able to deduce that there was in fact no common unit of measure, and that the assertion of such an existence was in fact a contradiction. He did this by demonstrating that if the [[hypotenuse]] of an [[isosceles right triangle]] was indeed [[Commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] with a leg, then one of those lengths measured in that unit of measure must be both odd and even, which is impossible. His reasoning is as follows:
* Start with an isosceles right triangle with side lengths of integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. The ratio of the hypotenuse to a leg is represented by ''c'':''b''.
* Assume ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are in the smallest possible terms  (''i.e.'' they have no common factors).
* By the [[Pythagorean theorem]]: ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (Since the triangle is isosceles, ''a'' = ''b'').
* Since ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is divisible by 2, and therefore even.
* Since ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even, ''c'' must be even.
* Since ''c'' is even, dividing ''c'' by 2 yields an integer. Let ''y'' be this integer (''c'' = 2''y'').
* Squaring both sides of ''c'' = 2''y'' yields ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (2''y'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Substituting 4''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the first equation (''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) gives us 4''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;= 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Dividing by 2 yields 2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Since ''y'' is an integer, and 2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is divisible by 2, and therefore even.
* Since ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even, ''b'' must be even.
* We have just shown that both ''b'' and ''c'' must be even.   Hence they have a common factor of 2.  However this contradicts the assumption that they have no common factors.  This contradiction proves that ''c'' and ''b'' cannot both be integers, and thus the existence of a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline|Kline, M.]] (1990). ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press. (Original work published 1972). p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] termed this ratio of incommensurable magnitudes ''alogos'', or inexpressible. Hippasus, however, was not lauded for his efforts: according to one legend, he made his discovery while out at sea, and was subsequently thrown overboard by his fellow Pythagoreans “…for having produced an element in the universe which denied the…doctrine that all phenomena in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios.”&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend states that Hippasus was merely exiled for this revelation. Whatever the consequence to Hippasus himself, his discovery posed a very serious problem to Pythagorean mathematics, since it shattered the assumption that number and geometry were inseparable&amp;ndash;a foundation of their theory.

The discovery of incommensurable ratios was indicative of another problem facing the Greeks: the relation of the discrete to the continuous. Brought into light by [[Zeno of Elea]], who questioned the conception that quantities are discrete and composed of a finite number of units of a given size. Past Greek conceptions dictated that they necessarily must be, for “whole numbers represent discrete objects, and a commensurable ratio represents a relation between two collections of discrete objects.”&lt;ref name="Kline 1990, p.34"&gt;Kline 1990, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; However Zeno found that in fact “[quantities] in general are not discrete collections of units; this is why ratios of incommensurable [quantities] appear….[Q]uantities are, in other words, continuous.”&lt;ref name="Kline 1990, p.34"/&gt; What this means is that, contrary to the popular conception of the time, there cannot be an indivisible, smallest unit of measure for any quantity. That in fact, these divisions of quantity must necessarily be [[Infinity|infinite]]. For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on. This process can continue infinitely, for there is always another half to be split. The more times the segment is halved, the closer the unit of measure comes to zero, but it never reaches exactly zero. This is just what Zeno sought to prove. He sought to prove this by formulating [[Zeno's paradoxes|four paradoxes]], which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in the mathematical thought of the time. While Zeno’s paradoxes accurately demonstrated the deficiencies of current mathematical conceptions, they were not regarded as proof of the alternative. In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.

The next step was taken by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who formalized a new theory of proportion that took into account commensurable as well as incommensurable quantities. Central to his idea was the distinction between magnitude and number. A magnitude “...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously. Magnitudes were opposed to numbers, which jumped from one value to another, as from 4 to 5.”&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers are composed of some smallest, indivisible unit, whereas magnitudes are infinitely reducible. Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio in terms of its magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios. By taking quantitative values (numbers) out of the equation, he avoided the trap of having to express an irrational number as a number. “Eudoxus’ theory enabled the Greek mathematicians to make tremendous progress in geometry by supplying the necessary logical foundation for incommensurable ratios.”&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9.

As a result of the distinction between number and magnitude, geometry became the only method that could take into account incommensurable ratios. Because previous numerical foundations were still incompatible with the concept of incommensurability, Greek focus shifted away from those numerical conceptions such as algebra and focused almost exclusively on geometry. In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometrical terms. This may account for why we still conceive of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as x squared and x cubed instead of x second power and x third power. Also crucial to Zeno’s work with incommensurable magnitudes was the fundamental focus on deductive reasoning that resulted from the foundational shattering of earlier Greek mathematics. The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory. Out of this necessity, Eudoxus developed his [[method of exhaustion]], a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]] that “…established the deductive organization on the basis of explicit axioms…” as well as “…reinforced the earlier decision to rely on deductive reasoning for proof.”&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of exhaustion is the first step in the creation of calculus.

[[Theodorus of Cyrene]] proved the irrationality of the [[Nth root|surds]] of whole numbers up to 17, but stopped there probably because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Theodorus' Irrationality Proofs|author=Robert L. McCabe|journal=Mathematics Magazine|year=1976|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] developed a theory of proportion that took into account irrational as well as rational ratios that a strong mathematical foundation of irrational numbers was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The historical development of the calculus|author=Charles H. Edwards|year=1982|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Geometrical and mathematical problems involving irrational numbers such as square roots were addressed very early during the [[Vedic period]] in India. There are references to such calculations in the ''[[Samhita]]s'', ''[[Brahmana]]s'', and the ''[[Shulba Sutras]]'' (800 BC or earlier). (See Bag, Indian Journal of History of Science, 25(1-4), 1990).

It is suggested that the concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] since the 7th century BC, when [[Manava]] (c. 750 &amp;ndash; 690 BC) believed that the [[square root]]s of numbers such as 2 and 61 could not be exactly determined.&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Puttaswamy, "The Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians", pp. 411&amp;ndash;2, in {{Cite book|title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-western Mathematics|editor1-first=Helaine|editor1-last=Selin|editor1-link=Helaine Selin|editor2-first=Ubiratan|editor2-last=D'Ambrosio|year=2000|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1-4020-0260-2|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] writes that "such claims are not well substantiated and unlikely to be true".&lt;ref name="Boyer 208"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=A History of Mathematics|edition=2nd|year=1991|chapter=China and India|quote=It has been claimed also that the first recognition of incommensurables appears in India during the ''Sulbasutra'' period, but such claims are not well substantiated. The case for early Hindu awareness of incommensurable magnitudes is rendered most unlikely by the lack of evidence that Indian mathematicians of that period had come to grips with fundamental concepts.|page=208| isbn=0471093742| oclc=414892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also suggested that Aryabhata (5th century AD), in calculating a value of pi to 5 significant figures, used the word āsanna (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational).

Later, in their treatises, Indian mathematicians wrote on the arithmetic of surds including addition, subtraction, multiplication, rationalization, as well as separation and extraction of square roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Datta| first1=Bibhutibhusan| last2=Singh| first2=Awadhesh Narayan| title=Surds in Hindu mathemathics| url=https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol28_3_2_BDatta.pdf| journal=Indian Journal of History of Science| volume=28| issue=3| pages=253-264| year=1993| access-date=18 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003062219/https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol28_3_2_BDatta.pdf| archive-date=2018-10-03| dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians like Brahmagupta (in 628 AD) and Bhaskara I (in 629 AD) made contributions in this area as did other mathematicians who followed. In the 12th century Bhaskara II evaluated some of these formulas and critiqued them, identifying their limitations.

During the 14th to 16th centuries, [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] and the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] discovered the [[infinite series]] for several irrational numbers such as ''[[pi|π]]'' and certain irrational values of [[trigonometric functions]]. [[Jyeṣṭhadeva]] provided proofs for these infinite series in the ''[[Yuktibhāṣā]]''.&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;Katz, V. J. (1995), "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'' (Mathematical Association of America) '''68''' (3): 163&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle ages]], the development of [[algebra]] by [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Muslim mathematicians]] allowed irrational numbers to be treated as ''algebraic objects''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|class=HistTopics|id=Arabic_mathematics|title=Arabic mathematics: forgotten brilliance?|year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Middle Eastern mathematicians also merged the concepts of "[[number]]" and "[[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]" into a more general idea of [[real number]]s, criticized Euclid's idea of [[ratio]]s, developed the theory of composite ratios, and extended the concept of number to ratios of continuous magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matvievskaya|first=Galina|year=1987|title=The Theory of Quadratic Irrationals in Medieval Oriental Mathematics|journal=[[New York Academy of Sciences|Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]]|volume=500|pages=253&amp;ndash;277 [254]|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37206.x|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary on Book 10 of the ''Elements'', the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Al-Mahani]] (d. 874/884) examined and classified [[quadratic irrational]]s and cubic irrationals. He provided definitions for rational and irrational magnitudes, which he treated as irrational numbers. He dealt with them freely but explains them in geometric terms as follows:&lt;ref name="Matvievskaya-259"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matvievskaya|first=Galina|year=1987|title=The Theory of Quadratic Irrationals in Medieval Oriental Mathematics|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=500|pages=253&amp;ndash;277 [259]|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37206.x|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It will be a rational (magnitude) when we, for instance, say 10, 12, 3%, 6%, etc., because its value is pronounced and expressed quantitatively. What is not rational is irrational and it is impossible to pronounce and represent its value quantitatively. For example: the roots of numbers such as 10, 15, 20 which are not squares, the sides of numbers which are not cubes ''etc.''"}}

In contrast to Euclid's concept of magnitudes as lines, Al-Mahani considered integers and fractions as rational magnitudes, and square roots and [[cube root]]s as irrational magnitudes. He also introduced an [[arithmetic]]al approach to the concept of irrationality, as he attributes the following to irrational magnitudes:&lt;ref name="Matvievskaya-259"/&gt;

{{quote|"their sums or differences, or results of their addition to a rational magnitude, or results of subtracting a magnitude of this kind from an irrational one, or of a rational magnitude from it."}}

The [[Egypt]]ian mathematician [[Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam]] (c. 850 &amp;ndash; 930) was the first to accept irrational numbers as solutions to [[quadratic equation]]s or as [[coefficient]]s in an [[equation]], often in the form of square roots, cube roots and [[Nth root|fourth roots]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Sesiano, "Islamic mathematics", p. 148, in {{Cite book|title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-western Mathematics|first1=Helaine|last1=Selin|first2=Ubiratan|last2=D'Ambrosio|year=2000|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1-4020-0260-2|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century, the [[Iraq]]i mathematician Al-Hashimi provided general proofs (rather than geometric demonstrations) for irrational numbers, as he considered multiplication, division, and other arithmetical functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matvievskaya|first=Galina|year=1987|title=The Theory of Quadratic Irrationals in Medieval Oriental Mathematics|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=500|pages=253&amp;ndash;277 [260]|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37206.x|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian mathematician, [[Abū Ja'far al-Khāzin]] (900&amp;ndash;971) provides a definition of rational and irrational magnitudes, stating that if a definite [[quantity]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matvievskaya|first=Galina|year=1987|title=The Theory of Quadratic Irrationals in Medieval Oriental Mathematics|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=500|pages=253&amp;ndash;277 [261]|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37206.x|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each time when this (latter) magnitude comprises a half, or a third, or a quarter of the given magnitude (of the unit), or, compared with (the unit), comprises three, five, or three fifths, it is a rational magnitude. And, in general, each magnitude that corresponds to this magnitude (''i.e.'' to the unit), as one number to another, is rational. If, however, a magnitude cannot be represented as a multiple, a part (l/''n''), or parts (''m''/''n'') of a given magnitude, it is irrational, ''i.e.'' it cannot be expressed other than by means of roots."}}

Many of these concepts were eventually accepted by European mathematicians sometime after the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]]. [[Al-Hassār]], a Moroccan mathematician from [[Fes|Fez]] specializing in [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence]] during the 12th century, first mentions the use of a fractional bar, where [[numerator]]s and denominators are separated by a horizontal bar. In his discussion he writes, "..., for example, if you are told to write three-fifths and a third of a fifth, write thus, &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 \quad 1}{5 \quad 3}&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cajori|first=Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations (Vol.1)|publisher=The Open Court Publishing Company|year=1928|place=La Salle, Illinois}} pg. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; This same fractional notation appears soon after in the work of [[Leonardo Fibonacci]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cajori|1928|loc=pg.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
The 17th century saw [[imaginary number]]s become a powerful tool in the hands of [[Abraham de Moivre]], and especially of [[Leonhard Euler]]. The completion of the theory of [[complex number]]s in the 19th century entailed the differentiation of irrationals into algebraic and [[transcendental numbers]], the proof of the existence of transcendental numbers, and the resurgence of the scientific study of the theory of irrationals, largely ignored since [[Euclid]]. The year 1872 saw the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil Ernst Kossak), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal]]'', 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]]. Méray had taken in 1869 the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method has been completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Salvatore Pincherle |title = Saggio di una introduzione alla teoria delle funzioni analitiche secondo i principii del prof. C. Weierstrass |journal = Giornale di Matematiche |year = 1880 |p=178-254,317-320 |ref = harv |url=https://archive.org/stream/giornaledimatem07unkngoog#page/n198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and the endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of all [[rational number]]s, separating them into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker]] (Crelle, 101), and [[Charles Méray]].

[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of Euler, and at the opening of the 19th century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. Dirichlet also added to the general theory, as have numerous contributors to the applications of the subject.

[[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] proved (1761) that π cannot be rational, and that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational if ''n'' is rational (unless ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendentes, circulaires et logarithmiques |journal = Mémoires de l'Académie royale des sciences de Berlin |author = J.

[[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] (1794), after introducing the [[Bessel&amp;ndash;Clifford function]], provided a proof to show that π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational,  whence it follows immediately that π is irrational also. The existence of [[transcendental number]]s was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851).  Later, [[Georg Cantor]] (1873) proved their existence by a [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|different method]], which showed that every interval in the reals contains transcendental numbers. [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) first proved ''e'' transcendental, and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882), starting from Hermite's conclusions, showed the same for π. Lindemann's proof was much simplified by Weierstrass (1885), still further by [[David Hilbert]] (1893), and was finally made elementary by [[Adolf Hurwitz]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and [[Paul Gordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Transcendenz von ''e'' und π |first = Paul |last = Gordan |journal = [[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume = 43 |number = 2-3 |pages = 222--224 |year = 1893 |publisher = Teubner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

=== Square roots ===
The [[square root of 2]] was the first number proved irrational, and that article contains a number of proofs. The [[golden ratio]] is another famous quadratic irrational and there is a simple proof of its irrationality in its article. The square roots of all natural numbers which are not [[perfect squares]] are irrational and a proof may be found in [[quadratic irrational]]s.

===General roots===
The proof above for the square root of two can be generalized using the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. This asserts that every integer has a [[unique factorization]] into primes. Using it we can show that if a rational number is not an integer then no integral power of it can be an integer, as in [[lowest terms]] there must be a [[Prime number|prime]] in the denominator that does not divide into the numerator whatever power each is raised to. Therefore, if an integer is not an exact ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power of another integer, then that first integer's ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root is irrational.

=== Logarithms ===
Perhaps the numbers most easy to prove irrational are certain [[logarithm]]s. Here is a [[proof by contradiction]] that log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 is irrational. Notice that log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 ≈&amp;nbsp;1.58&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

Assume log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 is rational. For some positive integers ''m'' and ''n'', we have

: &lt;math&gt;\log_2 3 = \frac{m}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

: &lt;math&gt;2^{m/n}=3&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(2^{m/n})^n = 3^n&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;2^m=3^n.&lt;/math&gt;

However, the number 2 raised to any positive integer power must be even (because it is divisible by&amp;nbsp;2) and the number&amp;nbsp;3 raised to any positive integer power must be odd (since none of its [[prime factor]]s will be&amp;nbsp;2).  Clearly, an integer cannot be both odd and even at the same time: we have a contradiction. The only assumption we made was that log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 is rational (and so expressible as a quotient of integers ''m''/''n'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0). The contradiction means that this assumption must be false, i.e. log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 is irrational, and can never be expressed as a quotient of integers ''m''/''n'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0.

Cases such as log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 can be treated similarly.

== Transcendental and algebraic irrationals ==
[[Almost all]] irrational numbers are transcendental and all real [[transcendental number]]s are irrational (there are also complex transcendental numbers): the article on transcendental numbers lists several examples. So ''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; and π&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; are irrational for all nonzero rational&amp;nbsp;''r'', and, e.g., ''e''&lt;sup&gt;π&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;is irrational, too.

Irrational numbers can also be found within the [[countable set|countable]] set of real [[algebraic number]]s (essentially defined  as the real [[zero of a function|roots]] of [[polynomial]]s with integer coefficients), i.e., as real solutions of polynomial equations

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0\;, &lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are integers and &lt;math&gt;a_n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. [[rational root theorem|Any rational root]] of this polynomial equation must be of the form ''r'' /''s'', where ''r'' is a [[divisor]] of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s'' is a divisor of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. If a real root &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is not among these finitely many possibilities, it must be an irrational algebraic number. An exemplary proof for the existence of such algebraic irrationals is by showing that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; is an irrational root of a polynomial with integer coefficients: it satisfies (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 and hence ''x''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and this latter polynomial has no rational roots (the only candidates to check are&amp;nbsp;±1, and&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, being greater than&amp;nbsp;1, is neither of these), so&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an irrational algebraic number.

Because the algebraic numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|subfield]] of the real numbers, many irrational real numbers can be constructed by combining transcendental and algebraic numbers. For example, 3{{pi}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, {{pi}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{radic|2}} and ''e''{{radic|3}} are irrational (and even transcendental).

==Decimal expansions==
The decimal expansion of an irrational number never repeats or terminates (the latter being equivalent to repeating zeroes), unlike any rational number. The same is true for [[Binary numeral system|binary]], [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] expansions, and in general for expansions in every [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system|notation]] with [[natural number|natural]] bases.

To show this, suppose we divide integers ''n'' by ''m'' (where ''m'' is nonzero). When [[long division]] is applied to the division of ''n'' by ''m'', only ''m'' remainders are possible. If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion terminates. If 0 never occurs, then the algorithm can run at most ''m'' − 1 steps without using any remainder more than once. After that, a remainder must recur, and then the decimal expansion repeats.

Conversely, suppose we are faced with a [[repeating decimal]], we can prove that it is a fraction of two integers. For example, consider:

:&lt;math&gt;A=0.7\,162\,162\,162\,\cdots .&lt;/math&gt;

Here the repetend is 162 and the length of the repetend is 3. First, we multiply by an appropriate power of 10 to move the decimal point to the right so that it is just in front of a repetend. In this example we would multiply by 10 to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;10A = 7.162\,162\,162\,\cdots .&lt;/math&gt;

Now we multiply this equation by 10&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''r'' is the length of the repetend. This has the effect of moving the decimal point to be in front of the "next" repetend. In our example, multiply by 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;10,000A=7\,162.162\,162\,\cdots .&lt;/math&gt;

The result of the two multiplications gives two different expressions with exactly the same "decimal portion", that is, the tail end of 10,000''A'' matches the tail end of 10''A'' exactly. Here, both 10,000''A'' and 10''A'' have .162162162 ... at the end.

Therefore, when we subtract the 10''A'' equation from the 10,000''A'' equation, the tail end of 10''A'' cancels out the tail end of 10,000''A'' leaving us with:

:&lt;math&gt;9990A=7155.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;A= \frac{7155}{9990},&lt;/math&gt;

is a ratio of integers and therefore a rational number, as required for the proof.

== Irrational powers ==
Dov Jarden gave a simple non-[[constructive proof]] that there exist two irrational numbers ''a'' and ''b'', such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; is rational:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://condor.depaul.edu/mash/atotheamg.pdf|title=Philosophies of mathematics| first1=Alexander |last1=George |first2=Daniel J. |last2=Velleman |isbn=0-631-19544-0 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2002 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider {{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;; if this is rational, then take ''a'' = ''b'' = {{radic|2}}.  Otherwise, take ''a'' to be the irrational number {{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b'' = {{radic|2}}.  Then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ({{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; = {{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}·{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; = {{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2, which is rational.

Although the above argument does not decide between the two cases, the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] shows that {{radic|2}}&lt;sup&gt;{{radic|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], hence irrational. This theorem states that if ''a'' and ''b'' are both [[algebraic number]]s, and ''a'' is not equal to 0 or 1, and ''b'' is not a rational number, then any value of ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; is a transcendental number (there can be more than one value if [[Exponentiation#Powers of complex numbers|complex number exponentiation]] is used).

An example that provides a simple constructive proof is&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Nick, "Maths bite: irrational powers of irrational numbers can be rational", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 92, November 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^{\log_{\sqrt{2}}3}=3.&lt;/math&gt;

The base of the left side is irrational and the right side is rational, so one must prove that the exponent on the left side, &lt;math&gt;\log_{\sqrt{2}}3&lt;/math&gt;, is irrational. This is so because, by the formula relating logarithms with different bases,

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{\sqrt{2}}3=\frac{\log_2 3}{\log_2 \sqrt{2}}=\frac{\log_2 3}{1/2} = 2\log_2 3&lt;/math&gt;

which we can assume, for the sake of establishing a [[proof by contradiction|contradiction]], equals a ratio ''m/n'' of positive integers. Then &lt;math&gt;\log_2 3 = m/2n&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;math&gt;2^{\log_2 3}=2^{m/2n}&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;math&gt;3=2^{m/2n}&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;math&gt;3^{2n}=2^m&lt;/math&gt;, which is a contradictory pair of prime factorizations and hence violates the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] (unique prime factorization).

A stronger result is the following:&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, Ash J., and Tan, Yiren, "A rational number of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''a'' irrational", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 96, March 2012, pp. 106-109.&lt;/ref&gt; Every rational number in the interval &lt;math&gt;((1/e)^{1/e}, \infty)&lt;/math&gt; can be written either as ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; for some irrational number ''a'' or as ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some natural number ''n''. Similarly,&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; every positive rational number can be written either as &lt;math&gt;a^{a^a}&lt;/math&gt; for some irrational number ''a'' or as &lt;math&gt;n^{n^n}&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number ''n''.

== Open questions ==
It is not known whether &lt;math&gt;\pi+e&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\pi-e&lt;/math&gt;) is irrational. In fact, there is no pair of non-zero integers &lt;math&gt;m, n&lt;/math&gt; for which it is known whether &lt;math&gt;m\pi+ n e&lt;/math&gt; is irrational. Moreover, it is not known whether or not the set &lt;math&gt;\{\pi, e\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;.

It is not known whether &lt;math&gt;\pi e,\ \pi/e,\ 2^e,\ \pi^e,\ \pi^\sqrt{2},\ \ln\pi,&lt;/math&gt; [[Catalan's constant]], or the [[Euler–Mascheroni gamma constant]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are irrational.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|Pi|Pi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|IrrationalNumber|Irrational Number}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=John| last=Albert| url=http://www.math.ou.edu/~jalbert/courses/openprob2.pdf|title=Some unsolved problems in number theory|publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Oklahoma}} (Senior Mathematics Seminar, Spring 2008 course)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is not known if either of the [[tetration]]s &lt;math&gt;^n\pi&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;^n e&lt;/math&gt; is rational for some integer &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Set of all irrationals ==
Since the reals form an [[uncountable]]
set, of which the rationals are a [[Countable set|countable]] subset, the complementary set of
irrationals is uncountable.

Under the usual ([[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]]) distance function d(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''|, the real numbers are a [[metric space]] and hence also a [[topological space]].  Restricting the Euclidean distance function gives the irrationals the structure of a metric space.  Since the subspace of irrationals is not closed,
the induced metric is not [[complete (topology)|complete]].  However, being a [[G-delta set]]&amp;mdash;i.e., a countable intersection of open subsets&amp;mdash;in a complete metric space, the space of irrationals is [[completely metrizable]]: that is, there is a metric on the irrationals inducing the same topology as the restriction of the Euclidean metric, but with respect to which the irrationals are complete.  One can see this without knowing the aforementioned fact about G-delta sets: the [[continued fraction]] expansion of an irrational number defines a homeomorphism from the space of irrationals to the space of all sequences of positive integers, which is easily seen to be completely metrizable.

Furthermore, the set of all irrationals is a disconnected metrizable space. In fact, the irrationals have a basis of [[clopen set]]s so the space is zero-dimensional.

In [[graph theory]], the '''Krackhardt kite graph''' is a [[simple graph]] with ten nodes. The graph is named after [[David Krackhardt]], a researcher of [[social network theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html#sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.M22Graph |title=Common Graphs |at=function "KrackhardtKiteGraph" |publisher=Sage Math |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Krackhardt Kite |id=KrackhardtKite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krackhardt introduced the graph in 1990 to distinguish different concepts of [[centrality]]. It has the property that the vertex with maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] (labeled 3 in the figure, with degree 6), the vertex with maximum [[betweenness centrality]] (labeled 7), and the two vertices with maximum [[closeness centrality]] (labeled 5 and 6) are all different from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Assessing the Political Landscape: Structure, Cognition, and Power in Organizations|first=David|last=Krackhardt|authorlink=David Krackhardt|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=35|issue=2|date=June 1990|pages=342–369|doi=10.2307/2393394|jstor=2393394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11834">'''[[Abstract algebra]]''' is the subject area of [[mathematics]] that studies [[algebraic structure]]s, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The phrase '''abstract algebra''' was coined at the turn of the 20th century to distinguish this area from what was normally referred to as '''algebra''', the study of the rules for manipulating formulae and algebraic expressions involving unknowns and [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex number]]s, often now called ''[[elementary algebra]]''. The distinction is rarely made in more recent writings.

==Basic language==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16553">'''Machine epsilon''' gives an upper bound on the [[Approximation error|relative error]] due to [[rounding]] in [[floating point arithmetic]]. This value characterizes [[computer arithmetic]] in the field of [[numerical analysis]], and by extension in the subject of [[computational science]].  The quantity is also called '''macheps''' or '''unit roundoff''', and it has the symbols Greek [[epsilon]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; or bold Roman '''u''', respectively.

==Formal definition==

''Rounding'' is a procedure for choosing the representation of a [[real number]] in a [[floating point]] number system.  For a [[number system]] and a rounding procedure, machine epsilon is the maximum [[relative error]] of the chosen rounding procedure.

Some background is needed to determine a value from this definition. A floating point number system is characterized by a [[radix]] which is also called the base, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and by the [[precision (computer science)|precision]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the number of radix &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; digits of the [[significand]] (including any leading implicit bit). All the numbers with the same [[exponent]], &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, have the spacing, &lt;math&gt;b^{e-(p-1)}&lt;/math&gt;. The spacing changes at the numbers that are perfect powers of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;; the spacing on the side of larger [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] is &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; times larger than the spacing on the side of smaller magnitude.

Since machine epsilon is a bound for relative error, it suffices to consider numbers with exponent &lt;math&gt;e=0&lt;/math&gt;. It also suffices to consider positive numbers. For the usual round-to-nearest kind of rounding, the absolute rounding error is at most half the spacing, or &lt;math&gt;b^{-(p-1)}/2&lt;/math&gt;. This value is the biggest possible numerator for the relative error. The [[denominator]] in the relative error is the number being rounded, which should be as small as possible to make the relative error large. The worst relative error therefore happens when rounding is applied to numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;1+a&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is between &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^{-(p-1)}/2&lt;/math&gt;. All these numbers round to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; with relative error &lt;math&gt;a/(1+a)&lt;/math&gt;. The maximum occurs when &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is at the upper end of its range. The &lt;math&gt;1+a&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator is negligible compared to the numerator, so it is left off for expediency, and just &lt;math&gt;b^{-(p-1)}/2&lt;/math&gt; is taken as machine epsilon. As has been shown here, the relative error is worst for numbers that round to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, so machine epsilon also is called ''unit roundoff'' meaning roughly "the maximum error that can occur when rounding to the unit value".

Thus, the maximum spacing between a normalised floating point number, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and an adjacent normalised number is &lt;math&gt;2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; x &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicholas | last=Higham |title=Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms (2 ed)| publisher=SIAM|year=2002 | pages=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arithmetic model==

Numerical analysis uses machine epsilon to study the effects of rounding error. The actual errors of machine arithmetic are far too complicated to be studied directly, so instead, the following simple model is used. The IEEE arithmetic standard says all floating point operations are done as if it were possible to perform the infinite-precision operation, and then, the result is rounded to a floating point number. Suppose (1) &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are floating point numbers, (2) &lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is an arithmetic operation on floating point numbers such as addition or multiplication, and (3) &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the infinite precision operation. According to the standard, the computer calculates:

:&lt;math&gt;x \bullet y = \mbox {round} (x \circ y)&lt;/math&gt;

By the meaning of machine epsilon, the relative error of the rounding is at most machine epsilon in magnitude, so:

:&lt;math&gt;x \bullet y = (x \circ y)(1 + z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; in absolute magnitude is at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; or '''u'''. The books by Demmel and Higham in the references can be consulted to see how this model is used to analyze the errors of, say, Gaussian elimination.

==Variant definitions==
The IEEE standard does not define the terms ''machine epsilon'' and ''unit roundoff'', so differing definitions of these terms are in use, which can cause some confusion.

The definition given here for ''machine epsilon'' is the one used by Prof. [[James Demmel]] in lecture scripts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture21/lecture21.html|title=Basic Issues in Floating Point Arithmetic and Error Analysis|date=21 Oct 1999|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the ''LAPACK'' linear algebra package,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node74.html|title=LAPACK Users' Guide Third Edition|date=22 August 1999 |accessdate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; numerics research papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Goldberg: What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic, ACM Computing Surveys, Vol 23, No 1, March 1991|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~kbeach/phys420_580_2010/docs/ACM-Goldberg.pdf|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some scientific computing software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.scilab.org/docs/5.3.3/en_US/number_properties.html|title=Scilab documentation - number_properties - determine floating-point parameters|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most numerical analysts use the words ''machine epsilon'' and ''unit roundoff'' interchangeably with this meaning.

The following different definition is much more widespread outside academia: ''Machine epsilon is defined as the difference between 1 and the next larger floating point number.''  By this definition, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; equals the value of the [[unit in the last place]] relative to 1, i.e. &lt;math&gt;b^{-(p-1)}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;note that here p is defined as the precision, i.e. the total number of bits in the significand including implicit leading bit, as used in the table above&lt;/ref&gt; and the unit roundoff is '''u'''&lt;math&gt;= \epsilon/2&lt;/math&gt;, assuming round-to-nearest mode.  The prevalence of this definition is rooted in its use in the ISO C Standard for constants relating to floating-point types&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Derek M.|year=2009|url=http://www.coding-guidelines.com/cbook/cbook1_2.pdf|title=The New C Standard - An Economic and Cultural Commentary|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cfloat/|title=float.h reference at cplusplus.com|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponding constants in other programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/limits/numeric_limits/|title=std::numeric_limits reference at cplusplus.com|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html|title=Python documentation - System-specific parameters and functions|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also widely used in scientific computing software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/$MachineEpsilon.html|title=Mathematica documentation: $MachineEpsilon|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/ref/eps.html|title=Matlab documentation - eps - Floating-point relative accuracy|accessdate=11 Apr 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807071540/http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/ref/eps.html|archivedate=2013-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://octave.sourceforge.net/octave/function/eps.html|title=Octave documentation - eps function|accessdate=11 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the numerics and computing literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicholas | last=Higham |title=Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms (2 ed)| publisher=SIAM|year=2002 | pages=27–28  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Numerical Mathematics|last1=Quarteroni|first1=Alfio|last2=Sacco|first2=Riccardo|last3=Saleri|first3=Fausto|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=0-387-98959-5|page=49|url=http://www.techmat.vgtu.lt/~inga/Files/Quarteroni-SkaitMetod.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Numerical Recipes|page=890|last1=Press|first1=William H.|last2=Teukolsky|first2=Saul A.|last3=Vetterling|first3=William T.|last4=Flannery|first4=Brian P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Numerik-Algorithmen|first1=Gisela|last1=Engeln-Müllges|first2=Fritz|last2=Reutter|year=1996|isbn=3-18-401539-4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==How to determine machine epsilon==

Where standard libraries do not provide precomputed values (as &lt;[[float.h]]&gt; does with &lt;code&gt;FLT_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DBL_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LDBL_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt; for C and &lt;[[C++ Standard Library#Language support|limits]]&gt; does with &lt;code&gt;std::numeric_limits&lt;&lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;&gt;::epsilon()&lt;/code&gt; in C++), the best way to determine machine epsilon is to refer to the table, above, and use the appropriate power formula.  Computing machine epsilon is often given as a textbook exercise. The following examples compute machine epsilon in the sense of the spacing of the floating point numbers at 1 rather than in the sense of the unit roundoff.

Note that results depend on the particular floating-point format used, such as '''float''', '''double''', '''long double''', or similar as supported by the programming language, the compiler, and the runtime library for the actual platform.

Some formats supported by the processor might not be supported by the chosen compiler and operating system. Other formats might be emulated by the runtime library, including [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] available in some languages and libraries.

In a strict sense the term ''machine epsilon'' means the '''1+eps''' accuracy directly supported by the processor (or coprocessor), not some '''1+eps''' accuracy supported by a specific compiler for a specific operating system, unless it's known to use the best format.

[[IEEE 754]] floating-point formats have the property that, when reinterpreted as a two's complement integer of the same width, they monotonically increase over positive values and monotonically decrease over negative values (see [[Single-precision floating-point format#IEEE 754 single-precision binary floating-point format: binary32|the binary representation of 32 bit floats]]). They also have the property that 0 &lt; |''f''(''x'')| &lt; ∞, and |''f''(''x''+1) − ''f''(''x'')| ≥ |''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''x''−1)| (where ''f''(''x'') is the aforementioned integer reinterpretation of ''x''). In languages that allow [[type punning]] and always use IEEE 754-1985, we can exploit this to compute a machine epsilon in constant time. For example, in C:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
typedef union {
  long long i64;
  double d64;
} dbl_64;
double machine_eps (double value)
{
    dbl_64 s;
    s.d64 = value;
    s.i64++;
    return s.d64 - value;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This will give a result of the same sign as value. If a positive result is always desired, the return statement of machine_eps can be replaced with:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
    return (s.i64 &lt; 0 ? value - s.d64 : s.d64 - value);
&lt;/source&gt;

64-bit doubles give 2.220446e-16, which is 2&lt;sup&gt;−52&lt;/sup&gt; as expected.

===Approximation===
The following simple algorithm can be used to approximate the machine epsilon, to within a factor of two (one [[order of magnitude]]) of its true value, using a [[linear search]].

 epsilon = 1.0;
 
 while (1.0 + 0.5 * epsilon) &amp;ne; 1.0:
     epsilon = 0.5 * epsilon

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3705">In [[mathematics]], a '''median algebra''' is a set with a [[ternary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle&lt;/math&gt; satisfying a set of axioms which generalise the notion of median or [[majority function]], as a [[Boolean function]].

The axioms are 
#   &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,y \rangle = y&lt;/math&gt;
#   &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle = \langle z,x,y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;  
#   &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle = \langle x,z,y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;    
#   &lt;math&gt;\langle \langle x,w,y\rangle ,w,z \rangle = \langle x,w, \langle y,w,z \rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The second and third axioms imply [[commutativity]]: it is possible (but not easy) to show that in the presence of the other three, axiom (3) is redundant.  The fourth axiom implies associativity.
There are other possible axiom systems: for example the two
*  &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,y \rangle = y&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;\langle u,v, \langle u,w,x \rangle\rangle = \langle u,x, \langle w,u,v \rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
also suffice.

In a [[Boolean algebra (introduction)|Boolean algebra]], or more generally a [[distributive lattice]], the median function &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle = (x \vee y) \wedge (y \vee z) \wedge (z \vee x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies these axioms, so that every Boolean algebra and every distributive lattice forms a median algebra.

Birkhoff and Kiss showed that a median algebra with elements &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\langle0,x,1 \rangle = x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[distributive lattice]].

==Relation to median graphs==
A [[median graph]] is an [[undirected graph]] in which for every three vertices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique vertex &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle&lt;/math&gt; that belongs to [[shortest path]]s between any two of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. If this is the case, then the operation &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle&lt;/math&gt; defines a median algebra having the vertices of the graph as its elements.

Conversely, in any median algebra, one may define an ''interval'' &lt;math&gt;[x, z]&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of elements &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y,z \rangle = y&lt;/math&gt;. One may define a graph from a median algebra by creating a vertex for each algebra element and an edge for each pair &lt;math&gt;(x, z)&lt;/math&gt; such that the interval &lt;math&gt;[x, z]&lt;/math&gt; contains no other elements. If the algebra has the property that every interval is finite, then this graph is a median graph, and it accurately represents the algebra in that the median operation defined by shortest paths on the graph coincides with the algebra's original median operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">In [[mathematics]], '''Vector multiplication''' refers to one of several techniques for the [[multiplication]] of two (or more) [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] with themselves. It may concern any of the following articles:
* [[Dot product]] &amp;mdash; also known as the "scalar product", an operation that takes two vectors and returns a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] quantity. The dot product of two vectors can be defined as the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. Alternatively, it is defined as the product of the projection of the first vector onto the second vector and the magnitude of the second vector. Thus,
:::                    '''A ⋅ B''' = ||'''A'''|| ||'''B'''|| cos θ.
 
* [[Cross product]] &amp;mdash; also known as the "vector product", a binary operation on two vectors that results in another [[Euclidean vector|vector]]. The cross product of two vectors in 3-space is defined as the vector perpendicular to the plane determined by the two vectors whose magnitude is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of the angle between the two vectors. So, if '''n''' is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane determined by vectors '''A''' and '''B''',
:::                    '''A × B''' = ||'''A'''|| ||'''B'''|| sin θ '''n'''.

* [[Triple product]]s &amp;mdash; products involving three vectors.
* [[Multiple cross products]] &amp;mdash; products involving more than three vectors.

In [[number theory]], two positive [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be '''multiplicatively independent'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bès|first=Alexis|title=A survey of Arithmetical Definability|url=http://130.203.133.150/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.2.2136|accessdate=27 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121128154616/http://130.203.133.150/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.2.2136|archivedate=28 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; if their only common integer power is&amp;nbsp;1. That is, for all integer ''n'' and ''m'', &lt;math&gt;a^n=b^m&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;n=m=0&lt;/math&gt;. Two integers which are not multiplicatively independent are said to be multiplicatively dependent.

For example, 36 and 216 are multiplicatively dependent since &lt;math&gt;36^3=(6^2)^3=(6^3)^2=216^2&lt;/math&gt; and 6 and 12 are multiplicatively independent

== Properties ==

Being multiplicatively independent admits some other characterizations. ''a'' and ''b'' are multiplicatively independent if and only if &lt;math&gt;\log(a)/\log(b)&lt;/math&gt; is irrational. This property holds independently of the base of the [[logarithm]]. 

Let &lt;math&gt; a = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b = q_1^{\beta_1}q_2^{\beta_2} \cdots q_l^{\beta_l}  &lt;/math&gt; be the [[Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic#Canonical_representation_of_a_positive_integer|canonical representations]] of ''a'' and ''b''. The integers ''a'' and ''b'' are multiplicatively dependent if and only if ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''l'', &lt;math&gt;p_i=q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha_i}{\beta_i}=\frac{\alpha_j}{\beta_j}&lt;/math&gt;  for all ''i'' and&amp;nbsp;''j''.

==Applications==
[[Büchi arithmetic]] in base ''a'' and ''b'' define the same sets if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' are multiplicatively dependent. 

Let ''a'' and ''b'' be multiplicatively dependent integers, that is, there exists ''n,m&gt;1'' such that &lt;math&gt;a^n=b^m&lt;/math&gt;.   The integers ''c''  such that the length of its  expansion in [[radix|base]] ''a'' is at most ''m'' are exactly  the integers such that the length of their expansion in base ''b'' is at most ''n''. It implies that computing the base ''b'' expansion of a number, given its base ''a'' expansion, can be done by transforming consecutive sequences of ''m''  base ''a'' digits into consecutive sequence of ''n'' base ''b'' digits.

'''Natural population increase''' (in contrast to [[Population growth|total population increase]]) happens as people are born (in contrast to immigration) into a country, and decrease as people die (in contrast to emigrate). Rates of population growth, usually expressed as a percentage, vary greatly. 
The immigrating population has increased by a huge margin in the past few years. Due to this rising trend of migration it is important that we look into how migration has affected the population, and the trends that follow with it. The countries that are to be looked into are Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The Western European countries under discussion are England, Wales, France, the Netherlands, Scotland, Switzerland, and Italy from Southern Europe. During the whole conducted study it appears that six different countries had negative conclusions for net migration. Every Nordic country other than Denmark, Italy, and Scotland had values that are close to zero. The countries that had a positive migrating population are Denmark, England, Wales, Netherlands, France, and Switzerland. In the early 19th century it appeared all countries had an outflow of immigrants leaving the country but in the 20th century it became a positive inflow. Due to this push and pull these countries experienced during the 21st century there was a positive flow of immigration into the countries. 

Due to this increased migrating population soon countries will begin to start persuading individuals to move into a more rural area other countries because the big cities will begin to start see an overcrowding population. For example Australia is beginning to see this overcrowding that would soon follow for other countries. Because of this Australia has begun to place a cap on the amount of citizens allowed into the bigger cities which will force citizens to live in the less populated rural areas. This idea is called the Strategic Plan which sets a cap on the amount of population that is allowed in certain cities. This is a prime example of what will happen to other countries due to the exceeding immigrant population growth they will soon start to experience. Caps will be placed on big cities and force those who are already living in the city to be moved to the rural areas.

In '''[[economics]]''', '''non-convexity''' refers to violations of the [[convexity in economics|convexity assumptions of elementary economics]]. Basic economics textbooks concentrate on consumers with [[convex preferences]] (that do not prefer extremes to in-between values) and convex [[budget set]]s and on producers with convex [[production set]]s; for convex models, the predicted economic behavior is well understood.&lt;ref name="MCNC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenHeller" &gt;{{cite book|first1=Jerry|last1=Green|first2=Walter&amp;nbsp;P.|last2=Heller|chapter=1 Mathematical&amp;nbsp;analysis and&amp;nbsp;convexity with applications to economics|pages=15–52|doi=10.1016/S1573-4382(81)01005-9|title=Handbook of mathematical&amp;nbsp;economics, Volume&amp;nbsp;'''I'''|editor1-link=Kenneth Arrow |editor1-first=Kenneth&amp;nbsp;Joseph|editor1-last=Arrow|editor2-first=Michael&amp;nbsp;D&lt;!-- . --&gt;|editor2-last=Intriligator|series=Handbooks in economics|volume=1|publisher=North-Holland Publishing&amp;nbsp;Co.|location=Amsterdam|year=1981|isbn=0-444-86126-2|mr=634800|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with [[market failure]]s,&lt;ref name="MarketFailure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SalanieDefinition" &gt;{{harvtxt|Salanié|2000|p=36|}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[supply and demand]] differ or where [[market equilibrium|market equilibria]] can be [[Pareto efficiency|inefficient]].&lt;ref name="MCNC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SalanieDefinition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laffont"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starrett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuesnerieNonConvex"/&gt; Non-convex economies are studied with [[subderivative|nonsmooth analysis]], which is a generalization of [[convex analysis]].&lt;ref name="GuesnerieNonConvex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mordukhovich2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=M.&amp;nbsp;Ali|chapter=Perfect competition|title=The New&amp;nbsp;Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|editor-first=Steven&amp;nbsp;N.|editor-last=Durlauf|editor2-first=Lawrence&amp;nbsp;E.,&amp;nbsp;ed.|editor2-last=Blume|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|edition=Second|pages=|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000056|doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1267|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

==Demand with many consumers==
If a preference set is ''non-convex'', then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two ''separate'' optimal-baskets. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion. Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.
[[File:NonConvex.gif|thumb|right|When consumer preferences have concavities, then the linear budgets need not support an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]: Consumers can jump between two separate allocations (of equal [[utility function|utility]]).]]

When the consumer's preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer's demand is not [[connected space|connected]]; A disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer, as discussed by [[Harold Hotelling]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others are essentially unobservable. They can be detected only by the discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth. The concave portions of the indifference curves and their many-dimensional generalizations, if they exist, must forever remain in
unmeasurable obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The difficulties of studying non-convex preferences were emphasized by [[Herman Wold]]&lt;ref&gt;Pages 231 and 239 (Figure 10 a–b: Illustration of lemma 5 [page 240]): {{cite news|last=Wold|first=Herman|authorlink=Herman Wold|year=1943b|title=A synthesis of pure demand analysis&amp;nbsp;'''II'''|journal=Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift [Scandinavian Actuarial Journal]|volume=26|pages=220–263&lt;!-- Diewert gives wrong pages, according to Math Rev and my inspection of the article and of Wold's book with Jureen --&gt;|mr=11939|ref=harv}}&lt;p&gt;Exercise 45, page 146: {{cite book|last1=Wold|first1=Herman|authorlink=Herman Wold|last2=Juréen|first2=Lars (in association with Wold)|chapter=8 Some further applications of preference fields (pp.&amp;nbsp;129–148)|title=Demand analysis: A study in econometrics|location=New York|publisher=John Wiley and Sons,&amp;nbsp;Inc. Stockholm: Almqvist and Wiksell|series=Wiley publications in statistics|year=1953|pages=xvi+358|mr=64385|ref=harv}}&lt;p&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and again by [[Paul Samuelson]], who wrote that non-convexities are "shrouded in eternal {{nowrap|darkness&amp;nbsp;...",}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Samuelson|1950|pp=359–360}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It will be noted that any point where the indifference curves are convex rather than concave cannot be observed in a competitive market. Such points are shrouded in eternal darkness—unless we make our consumer a monopsonist and let him choose between goods lying on a very convex "budget curve" (along which he is affecting the price of what he buys). In this monopsony case, we could still deduce the slope of the man's indifference curve from the slope of the observed constraint at the equilibrium point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, non-linear pricing or bargaining may overcome the failures of markets with competitive pricing; in other cases, regulation may be justified.

===Optimization over time===

{{See also|Bellman equation|Optimal control|dynamic programming}}
The previously mentioned applications concern non-convexities in finite-dimensional [[vector space]]s, where points represent commodity bundles. However, economists also consider dynamic problems of optimization over time, using the theories of [[differential equation]]s, [[dynamic systems]], [[stochastic process]]es, and [[functional analysis]]: Economists use the following optimization methods:
* [[calculus of variations]], following [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramsey |first=F. P. |year=1928 |title=A Mathematical Theory of Saving |journal=[[Economic Journal]] |volume=38 |issue=152 |pages=543–559 |jstor=2224098 |doi=10.2307/2224098}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harold Hotelling]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hotelling |first=Harold |title=The Economics of Exhaustible Resources |year=1931 |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy|JPE]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=137–175 |jstor=1822328 |doi=10.1086/254195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[dynamic programming]], following [[Richard Bellman]] and Ronald Howard;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Adda|first1=Jerome|last2=Cooper|first2=Russell|year=2003|url=http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~cooper/dynprog/dynprog1.html|title=Dynamic Economics|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald A. |last=Howard |title=Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes |publisher=The M.I.T. Press |year=1960 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sethi |first=S. P. |authorlink2=Gerald L. Thompson |last2=Thompson |first2=G.

In these theories, regular problems involve convex functions defined on convex domains, and this convexity allows simplifications of techniques and economic meaningful interpretations of the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Troutman|first1=John L.|editor=With the assistance of William Hrusa|title=Variational calculus and optimal control: Optimization with elementary convexity|edition=Second|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|year=1996|pages=xvi+461|isbn=0-387-94511-3|mr=1363262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=1349574|last=Craven|first=B.

Muth for work on [[inventory theory]] and [[consumption theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Martin |last=Beckmann |first2=Richard F. |last2=Muth |year=1954 |title=On the solution to the fundamental equation of inventory theory |work=Cowles Commission Discussion Paper |volume=2116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert C. Merton used dynamic programming in his 1973 article on the [[ICAPM|intertemporal capital asset pricing model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merton | first1 = Robert C. | authorlink = Robert C. Merton | year = 1973 | title = An Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model | url = | journal = Econometrica | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 867–887 | doi=10.2307/1913811}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Merton's portfolio problem]]). In Merton's model, investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, and their solution is found via dynamic programming. Stokey, Lucas &amp; Prescott use dynamic programming to solve problems in economic theory, problems involving stochastic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Nancy Stokey |first=Nancy |last=Stokey |authorlink2=Robert E.

Press |isbn=0-674-75096-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic programming has been used in optimal [[economic growth]], [[resource extraction]], [[principal–agent problem]]s, [[public finance]], business [[investment]], [[asset pricing]], [[factor of production|factor]] supply, and [[industrial organization]]. Ljungqvist &amp; Sargent apply dynamic programming to study a variety of theoretical questions in [[monetary policy]], [[fiscal policy]], [[taxation]], economic growth, [[search theory]], and [[labor economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Lars Ljungqvist |first=Lars |last=Ljungqvist |authorlink2=Thomas Sargent |first2=Thomas |last2=Sargent |year=2004 |title=Recursive Macroeconomic Theory |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-12274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixit &amp; Pindyck used dynamic programming for [[capital budgeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Avinash Dixit |first=Avinash |last=Dixit |first2=Robert |last2=Pindyck |year=1994 |title=Investment Under Uncertainty |publisher=Princeton Univ. Press |isbn=0-691-03410-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For dynamic problems, non-convexities also are associated with market failures,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dasgupta|Heal|1979|pp=96–97, 285, 404, 420, 422, and 429}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as they are for fixed-time problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dasgupta|Heal|1979|pp=51, 64–65, 87, and 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonsmooth analysis===
Economists have increasingly studied non-convex sets with [[subderivative|nonsmooth analysis]], which generalizes [[convex&amp;nbsp;analysis]]. Convex analysis centers on convex sets and convex functions, for which it provides powerful ideas and clear results, but it is not adequate for the analysis of non-convexities, such as increasing returns to scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heal|1999|p=4 in preprint}}: {{cite book|first=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3030">In [[mathematics]], and more particularly in [[analytic number theory]], '''Perron's formula''' is a formula due to [[Oskar Perron]] to calculate the sum of an arithmetical function, by means of an inverse [[Mellin transform]].

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\{a(n)\}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[arithmetic function]], and let

:&lt;math&gt; g(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}} &lt;/math&gt;
 
be the corresponding [[Dirichlet series]]. Presume the Dirichlet series to be [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] for &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Then Perron's formula is

:&lt;math&gt; A(x) = {\sum_{n\le x}}' a(n)
=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} g(z)\frac{x^{z}}{z}  dz.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the prime on the summation indicates that the last term of the sum must be multiplied by 1/2 when ''x'' is an integer. The integral is not a convergent Lebesgue integral, it is understood as the [[Cauchy principal value]]. The formula requires ''c'' &gt; 0, ''c'' &gt; σ, and ''x'' &gt; 0 real, but otherwise arbitrary.

==Proof==
An easy sketch of the proof comes from taking [[Abel's summation formula|Abel's sum formula]]

:&lt;math&gt; g(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a(n)}{n^{s} }=s\int_{1}^{\infty}  A(x)x^{-(s+1) } dx. &lt;/math&gt;

This is nothing but a [[Laplace transform]] under the variable change &lt;math&gt;x=e^t.&lt;/math&gt; Inverting it one gets Perron's formula.

==Examples==
Because of its general relationship to Dirichlet series, the formula is commonly applied to many number-theoretic sums. Thus, for example, one has the famous integral representation for the [[Riemann zeta function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)=s\int_1^\infty \frac{\lfloor x\rfloor}{x^{s+1}}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

and a similar formula for [[Dirichlet L-function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;L(s,\chi)=s\int_1^\infty \frac{A(x)}{x^{s+1}}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;A(x)=\sum_{n\le x} \chi(n)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\chi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dirichlet character]]. Other examples appear in the articles on the [[Mertens function]] and the [[von Mangoldt function]].

==Generalizations==

Perron's formula is just a special case of the Mellin discrete convolution

&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a(n)f(n/x)= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}F(s)G(s)x^{s}ds &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(s)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; F(s)= \int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)x^{s-1}dx &lt;/math&gt; the Mellin transform. The Perron formula is just the special case of the test function &lt;math&gt; f(1/x)=\theta (x-1) &lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt; \theta(x) &lt;/math&gt; the [[Heaviside step function]].

'''''Philosophy of Arithmetic''''' ('''''PA'''''; {{lang-de|Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische untersuchungen}}) is an 1891 book by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Husserl's first published book, it is a synthesis of his studies in mathematics, under [[Karl Weierstrass]], with his studies in philosophy and psychology, under [[Franz Brentano]], to whom is dedicated, and [[Carl Stumpf]].

==Structure==

The ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' constitutes the first volume of a work which Husserl intended to comprise two volumes, of which the second was never published. Comprehensively it would have encompassed four parts and an Appendix.

The first volume is divided in two parts, in the first of which Husserl purports to analyse the "Proper concepts of multiplicity, unity and amount" (''Die eigentliche Begriffe von Vielheit, Einheit und Anzahl'') and in the second "The symbolic amount-concepts and the logical sources of amount-arithmetic" (''Die symbolischen Anzahlbegrife und die logischen Quellen der Anzahlen-Arithmetik'').

==Content==

The basic issue of the book is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] analysis of the concept of [[number]], which is the most basic concept on which the entire edifice of [[arithmetic]] and [[mathematics]] can be founded. In order to proceed with this analysis, Husserl, following Brentano and Stumpf, uses the tools of [[psychology]] to look for the "origin and content" of the concept of number. He begins with the classical definition, already given by [[Euclid]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], that "number is a multiplicity of unities" and then asks himself: what is multiplicity and what is unity? Anything that we can think of, anything we can present, can be considered at its most basic level to be "something". Multiplicity is then the "collective connection" of "something and something and something etc." In order to get a number instead of a mere quantity, we can also think of these featureless, abstract "somethings" as "ones" and then get "one and one and one etc." as basic definition of number ''in abstracto''. However, these are just the proper numbers, i.e. number which we can conceive of properly, without the help of instruments or symbols. Psychologically we are limited to just the very first few numbers if we want to conceive of them properly, with higher numbers our short term memory is not enough to think of them all together, but still as identical to themselves and different from all others. Hence, Husserl says, we have to move on to the analysis of symbolically conceived numbers, which are effectively those that are used in mathematics.

==History==

The book is a product of his years of study with Weierstrass (in Berlin) and his student [[Leo Königsberger]] (in Vienna) on the mathematical side and his studies with Brentano (in Vienna) and Stumpf (in Halle) on the psychological/philosophical side. The book is mostly based on his [[habilitation]]sschrift of 1887 "On the Concept of Number" (''Über den Begriff der Zahl''). Husserl also lectured on the concept of number between 1889 and 1891, much in the same vein. He continued working on the second volume up to at least 1894.

[[Gottlob Frege]] was critical of ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'', and accused Husserl of relying too much on the metaphysical and not enough on the logical aspects of mathematics. Frege’s criticisms influenced negatively the young mathematician’s career as a professor. Husserl’s ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' secured his reputation ten years later, but Frege and others never accepted Husserl as a practitioner of true logic.

In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''probabilistically checkable proof''' ('''PCP''') is a type of [[mathematical proof|proof]] that can be checked by a [[randomized algorithm]] using a bounded amount of randomness and reading a bounded number of bits of the proof. The algorithm is then required to accept correct proofs and reject incorrect proofs with very high probability. A standard proof (or [[Certificate (complexity)|certificate]]), as used in the [[Formal verification|verifier]]-based definition of the [[complexity class]] [[NP (complexity)|NP]], also satisfies these requirements, since the checking procedure deterministically reads the whole proof, always accepts correct proofs and rejects incorrect proofs. However, what makes them interesting is the existence of probabilistically checkable proofs that can be checked by reading only a few bits of the proof using randomness in an essential way.

Probabilistically checkable proofs give rise to many complexity classes depending on the number of queries required and the amount of randomness used. The class '''PCP'''[''r''(''n''),''q''(''n'')] refers to the set of [[decision problem]]s that have probabilistically checkable proofs that can be verified in polynomial time using at most ''r''(''n'') random bits and by reading at most ''q''(''n'') bits of the proof.{{r|ab07}} Unless specified otherwise, correct proofs should always be accepted, and incorrect proofs should be rejected with probability greater than 1/2. The [[PCP theorem]], a major result in computational complexity theory, states that '''PCP'''[O(log ''n''),O(1)]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''.

== Definition ==
Given a [[computational problem|decision problem]] ''L''(or a language L with its alphabet set Σ), a '''probabilistically checkable proof system''' for ''L'' with  completeness ''c''(''n'') and soundness ''s''(''n''), where 0 ≤ ''s''(''n'') ≤ ''c''(''n'') ≤ 1, consists of a prover and a verifier. Given a claimed solution x with length n, which might be false, the prover produces a proof ''π'' which states ''x'' solves L (''x'' ∈ ''L'', the proof is a string  ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;). And the verifier is a randomized [[oracle machine|oracle Turing Machine]] ''V'' (the ''verifier'') that checks the proof ''π'' for the statement that ''x'' solves ''L''(or ''x'' ∈ ''L'') and decides whether to accept the statement. The system has the following properties:
* '''Completeness''': For any ''x'' ∈ ''L'', given the proof ''π'' produced by the prover of the system, the verifier accepts the statement with probability at least ''c''(''n''),
* '''Soundness''': For any ''x'' ∉ ''L'', then for any proof ''π'', the verifier mistakenly accepts the statement with probability at most ''s''(''n'').

For the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the verifier, we have the ''randomness complexity'' ''r''(''n'') to measure the maximum number of random bits that ''V'' uses over all ''x'' of length ''n'' and the ''query complexity'' ''q''(''n'') of the verifier is the maximum number of queries that ''V'' makes to π over all ''x'' of length ''n''.

In the above definition, the length of proof is not mentioned since usually it includes the alphabet set and all the witness. By the way, for the prover, we do not mention how it gets to know the solution to the problem. We only care how can it writes down a proof of it.

The verifier is said to be ''non-adaptive'' if it makes all its queries before it receives any of the answers to previous queries.

The complexity class '''PCP'''&lt;sub&gt;''c''(''n''),&amp;nbsp;''s''(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;[''r''(''n''),&amp;nbsp;''q''(''n'')] is the class of all decision problems having probabilistically checkable proof systems over binary alphabet of completeness ''c''(''n'') and soundness ''s''(''n''), where the verifier is nonadaptive, runs in polynomial time, and it has randomness complexity ''r''(''n'') and query complexity ''q''(''n'').

The shorthand notation '''PCP'''[''r''(''n''),&amp;nbsp;''q''(''n'')] is sometimes used for '''PCP'''&lt;sub&gt;1,&amp;nbsp;½&lt;/sub&gt;[''r''(''n''),&amp;nbsp;''q''(''n'')].  The complexity class '''PCP''' is defined as '''PCP'''&lt;sub&gt;1,&amp;nbsp;½&lt;/sub&gt;[O(log&amp;nbsp;''n''),&amp;nbsp;O(1)].

== History and significance ==
The theory of probabilistically checkable proofs studies the power of probabilistically checkable proof systems under various restrictions of the parameters (completeness, soundness, randomness complexity, query complexity, and alphabet size).  It has applications to [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] (in particular [[hardness of approximation]]) and [[cryptography]].

The definition of a probabilistically checkable proof was explicitly introduced by Arora and Safra in 1992,{{r|as92}} although their properties were studied earlier.  In 1990 Babai, Fortnow, and Lund proved that '''PCP'''[poly(''n''), poly(''n'')] = '''[[NEXP]]''', providing the first nontrivial equivalence between standard proofs ('''NEXP''') and probabilistically checkable proofs.{{r|bfl90}}  The [[PCP theorem]] proved in 1992 states that '''PCP'''[O(log ''n''),O(1)]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''.{{r|as92|almss}}

The theory of [[hardness of approximation]] requires a detailed understanding of the role of completeness, soundness, alphabet size, and query complexity in probabilistically checkable proofs.

== Properties ==
From computational complexity point of view, for extreme settings of the parameters, the definition of probabilistically checkable proofs is easily seen to be equivalent to standard [[complexity classes]].  For example, we have the following:
*'''PCP'''[0, 0] = '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''' ('''P''' is defined to have no randomness and no access to a proof.)
*'''PCP'''[O(log(''n'')), 0] = '''P''' (A logarithmic number of random bits doesn't help a polynomial time Turing machine, since it could try all possibly random strings of logarithmic length in polynomial time.)
*'''PCP'''[0,O(log(''n''))] = '''P''' (Without randomness, the proof can be thought of as a fixed logarithmic sized string. A polynomial time machine could try all possible logarithmic sized proofs in polynomial time.)
*'''PCP'''[poly(''n''), 0] = '''[[RP (complexity)|coRP]]''' (By definition of '''coRP'''.)
*'''PCP'''[0, poly(''n'')] = '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' (By the verifier-based definition of NP.)

The PCP theorem and [[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]] = NEXP can be characterized as follows:
*'''PCP'''[O(log ''n''),O(1)]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP''' (the PCP theorem)
*'''PCP'''[poly(''n''),O(1)]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''PCP'''[poly(''n''),poly(''n'')]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NEXP''' (MIP = NEXP).

It is also known that '''PCP'''[''r''(''n''),&amp;nbsp;''q''(''n'')] ⊆ [[NTIME]](poly(n,2&lt;sup&gt;O(''r''(''n''))&lt;/sup&gt;''q''(''n''))).  
In particular, '''PCP'''[log ''n'', poly(''n'')] = '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]'''. 
On the other hand, if '''NP''' ⊆ '''PCP'''[o(log ''n''),o(log ''n'')] then [[P = NP]].{{r|as92}}

== Linear PCP ==
Linear PCP is one such that given query q, the oracle does only linear operation on the proof &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. That's to say the response from the oracle to the query q is a linear function &lt;math&gt;f(q,\pi)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10054">The term '''quantifier variance''' refers to claims there is no uniquely best ontological language with which to describe the world.&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; According to Hirsch, it is an outgrowth of ''Urmson's dictum'':
{{quote|“If two sentences are equivalent to each other, then while the use of one rather than the other may be useful for some philosophical purposes, it is not the case that one will be nearer to reality than the other...We can say a thing this way, and we can say it that way, sometimes...But it is no use asking which is the logically or metaphysically right way to say it.”&lt;ref name=Urmson/&gt;|James Opie Urmson|Philosophical Analysis, p. 186}}

The term "quantifier variance" rests upon the philosophical term 'quantifier', more precisely [[existential quantifier]]. A 'quantifier' is an expression like "there exists at least one ‘such-and-such’".&lt;ref name=quantifier/&gt;

==Quantifiers==
{{Main|Existential quantification|Quantification (logic)}}
The word ''quantifier'' in the introduction refers to a variable used in a [[domain of discourse]], a collection of objects under discussion. In daily life, the domain of discourse could be 'apples', or 'persons', or even everything.&lt;ref name=Hausman/&gt; In a more technical arena, the domain of discourse could be 'integers', say. The quantifier variable ''x'', say, in the given domain of discourse can take on the 'value' or designate any object in the domain. The presence of a particular object, say a 'unicorn' is expressed in the manner of [[symbolic logic]] as:
::∃ ''x''; ''x'' is a unicorn.

Here the [[List of logic symbols|'turned ''E'' ']] or ∃ is read as "there exists..." and is called the symbol for  existential quantification. Relations between objects also can be expressed using quantifiers. For example, in the domain of integers (denoting the quantifier by ''n'', a customary choice for an integer) we can indirectly identify '5' by its relation with the number '25':
::∃ ''n''; ''n'' × ''n'' = 25.

If we want to point out specifically that the domain of integers is meant, we could [[Table of mathematical symbols|write]]:
::∃ ''n'' ∈ ℤ; ''n'' × ''n'' = 25.

Here, ∈ = ''is a member of...'' and ∈ is called the symbol for [[set membership]]; and ℤ denotes the set of integers.

There are a variety of expressions that serve the same purpose in various ontologies, and they are accordingly all quantifier expressions.&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; Quantifier ''variance'' is then one argument concerning exactly what expressions can be construed as quantifiers, and just which arguments of a quantifier, that is, which substitutions for ‘such-and-such’, are permissible.&lt;ref name=Sider/&gt;

==Usage, not 'existence'?==
Hirsch says the notion of quantifier variance is a concept concerning how languages work, and is not connected to the ontological question of what 'really' exists.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1/&gt; That view is not universal.&lt;ref name=Wasserman/&gt;

The thesis underlying quantifier variance was stated by Putnam:
{{quote|The logical primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object and existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one absolute 'meaning'.&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;|Hilary Putnam|Truth and Convention, p. 71}}
Citing this quotation from Putnam, Wasserman states: "This thesis – the thesis that there are many meanings for the existential quantifier that are equally neutral and equally adequate for describing all the facts – is often referred to as ‘the doctrine of quantifier variance’".&lt;ref name=Wasserman/&gt;

Hirsch's quantifier variance has been connected to [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s idea of a linguistic framework as a 'neo'-Carnapian view, namely, "the view that there are a number of equally good meanings of the logical quantifiers; choosing one of these frameworks is to be understood analogously to choosing a Carnapian framework."&lt;ref name= Beebee/&gt; Of course, not all philosophers (notably [[Willard Quine|Quine]] and the 'neo'-Quineans) subscribe to the notion of multiple linguistic frameworks.&lt;ref name=Beebee/&gt; See [[meta-ontology]].

Hirsch himself suggests some care in connecting ''his version'' of quantifier variance with Carnap: "Let's not call any philosophers quantifier variantists unless they are clearly committed to the idea that (most of) the things that exist are completely independent of language." In this connection Hirsch says "I have a problem, however, in calling Carnap a quantifier variantist, insofar as he is often viewed as a verificationist [[Antirealism|anti-realist]]."&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; Although Thomasson does not think Carnap is properly considered to be an antirealist, she still disassociates Carnap from Hirsch's version of quantifier variance: "I’ll argue, however, that Carnap in fact is not committed to quantifier variance in anything like Hirsch’s sense, and that he [Carnap] does not rely on it in his ways of deflating metaphysical debates."&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt;

A 'quantifier' in [[symbolic logic]] originally was the part of statements involving the [[logic symbols]] ∀ (''for all'') and ∃ (''there exists'') as in an expression like "for all‘such-and-such’ ''P'' is true" (∀ x: P(x)) or  "there exists at least one ‘such-and-such’ such that ''P'' is true" (∃ x: P(x)) where ‘such-and-such’, or ''x'', is an element of a set and ''P'' is a proposition or assertion. However, the idea of a quantifier has since been generalized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5186">In [[mathematics]], a sequence of ''n'' [[real number]]s can be understood as a [[point (geometry)|location]] in ''n''-[[dimension|dimensional]] space. When ''n'' = 7, the set of all such locations is called '''7-dimensional space'''. Often such a space is studied as a [[vector space]], without any notion of distance. Seven-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is seven-dimensional space equipped with a [[Euclidean metric]], which is defined by the [[dot product]].{{disputed-inline|date=November 2014}}

More generally, the term may refer to a seven-dimensional vector space over any [[field (mathematics)|field]], such as a seven-dimensional [[complex number|complex]] vector space, which has 14 real dimensions. It may also refer to a seven-dimensional [[manifold]] such as a [[7-sphere]], or a variety of other geometric constructions.

Seven-dimensional spaces have a number of special properties, many of them related to the [[octonion]]s. An especially distinctive property is that a [[cross product]] can be defined only in three or seven dimensions. This is related to [[Hurwitz's theorem (composition algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]], which prohibits the existence of algebraic structures like the [[quaternion]]s and octonions in dimensions other than 2, 4, and 8. The first [[exotic sphere]]s ever discovered were seven-dimensional.

===7-polytope===
{{Main|Uniform 7-polytope}}

A [[polytope]] in seven dimensions is called a 7-polytope. The most studied are the [[regular polytope]]s, of which there are only [[List of regular polytopes#Convex 4|three in seven dimensions]]: the [[7-simplex]], [[7-cube]], and [[7-orthoplex]]. A wider family are the [[uniform 7-polytope]]s, constructed from fundamental symmetry domains of reflection, each domain defined by a [[Coxeter group]]. Each uniform polytope is defined by a ringed [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The [[7-demicube]] is a unique polytope from the D&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; family, and [[3 21 polytope|3&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[2 31 polytope|2&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[1 32 polytope|1&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;]] polytopes from the E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; family.

===6-sphere===
The [[n-sphere|6-sphere]] or hypersphere in seven-dimensional Euclidean space is the six-dimensional surface equidistant from a point, e.g. the origin. It has symbol {{math|''S&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, with formal definition for the 6-sphere with radius ''r'' of

:&lt;math&gt;S^6 = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^7 : \|x\| = r\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of the space bounded by this 6-sphere is

: &lt;math&gt;V_7\,=\frac{16 \pi^3}{105}\,r^7&lt;/math&gt;

which is 4.72477 × ''r''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, or 0.0369 of the [[7-cube]] that contains the 6-sphere.

==Applications==

===Cross product===

{{main|Seven-dimensional cross product}}
A cross product, that is a vector-valued, [[bilinear map|bilinear]], [[anticommutativity|anticommutative]] and [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] product of two vectors, is defined in seven dimensions. Along with the more usual [[cross product]] in three dimensions it is the only such product, except for trivial products.

===Exotic spheres===

{{main|Exotic sphere}}
In 1956, [[John Milnor]] constructed an [[exotic sphere]] in 7 dimensions and showed that there are at least 7 differentiable structures on the 7-sphere. In 1963 he showed that the exact number of such structures is 28.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">In [[graph theory]], the '''Shannon capacity of a graph''' is a [[graph invariant]] defined from the number of [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]]s of [[strong graph product]]s. It measures the [[Shannon capacity]] of a [[communications channel]] defined from the graph, and is upper bounded by the [[Lovász number]], which can be computed in [[polynomial time]]. However, the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the Shannon capacity itself remains unknown.

==Graph models of communication channels==
[[File:Cycle graph C5.png|thumb|240px|A five-vertex cycle, modeling a set of five values that can be transmitted across a noisy communications channel and the pairs of values that can be confused with each other]]
The Shannon capacity models the amount of information that can be transmitted across a noisy communication channel in which certain signal values can be confused with each other. In this application, the '''confusion graph'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Combinatorics | volume=78 | series=Discrete Mathematics and Optimization | first=Martin J. | last=Erickson | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2014 | page=134 | isbn=1118640217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''confusability graph''' describes the pairs of  values that can be confused. For instance, suppose that a communications channel has five discrete signal values, any one of which can be transmitted in a single time step. These values may be modeled mathematically as the five numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 in [[modular arithmetic]] modulo&amp;nbsp;5. However, suppose that when a value ''i'' is sent across the channel, the value that is received is ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''&amp;xi;''&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;5) where ''&amp;xi;'' represents the noise on the channel and may be any real number in the open interval &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;xi;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. Thus, if the recipient receives a value such as 3.6, it is impossible to determine whether it was originally transmitted as a&amp;nbsp;3 or as a&amp;nbsp;4; the two values 3 and 4 can be confused with each other. This situation can be modeled by a graph, a [[cycle graph|cycle]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; of length&amp;nbsp;5, in which the vertices correspond to the five values that can be transmitted and the edges of the graph represent values that can be confused with each other.

For this example, it is possible to choose two values that can be transmitted in each time step without ambiguity, for instance, the values 1 and 3. These values are far enough apart that they can't be confused with each other: when the recipient receives a value ''x'' in the range 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2, it can deduce that the value that was sent must have been 1, and when the recipient receives a value ''x'' in the range 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4, it can deduce that the value that was sent must have been 3. In this way, in ''n'' steps of communication, the sender can communicate up to 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; different messages. Two is the maximum number of values that the recipient can distinguish from each other: every subset of three or more of the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 includes at least one pair that can be confused with each other. Even though the channel has five values that can be sent per time step, effectively only two of them can be used with this coding scheme.

However, more complicated coding schemes allow a greater amount of information to be sent across the same channel, by using codewords of length greater than one. For instance, suppose that in two consecutive steps the sender transmits one of the five [[code word]]s "11", "23", "35", "54", or "42". (Here, the quotation marks indicate that these words should be interpreted as [[string (computer science)|strings]] of symbols, not as decimal numbers.) Each pair of these code words includes at least one position where its values differ by two or more modulo&amp;nbsp;5; for instance, "11" and "23" differ by two in their second position, while "23" and "42" differ by two in their first position. Therefore, a recipient of one of these code words will always be able to determine unambiguously which one was sent: no two of these code words can be confused with each other. By using this method, in ''n'' steps of communication, the sender can communicate up to 5&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt; messages, significantly more than the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that could be transmitted with the simpler one-digit code. The effective number of values that can be transmitted per unit time step is (5&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{radic|5}}.
In graph-theoretic terms, this means that the Shannon capacity of the 5-cycle is at least {{radic|5}}. As {{harvtxt|Lovász|1979}} showed, this bound is tight: it is not possible to find a more complicated system of code words that allows even more different messages to be sent in the same amount of time, so the Shannon capacity of the 5-cycle is exactly&amp;nbsp;{{radic|5}}.

==Relation to independent sets==
If a graph ''G'' represents a set of symbols and the pairs of symbols that can be confused with each other, then a subset ''S'' of symbols avoids all confusable pairs if and only if ''S'' is an [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] in the graph, a subset of vertices that does not include both endpoints of any edge. The maximum possible size of a subset of the symbols that can all be distinguished from each other is the [[independence number]] ''&amp;alpha;''(''G'') of the graph, the size of its [[maximum independent set]]. For instance, ''&amp;alpha;''(''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2: the 5-cycle has independent sets of two vertices, but not larger.

For codewords of longer lengths, one can use independent sets in larger graphs to describe the sets of codewords that can be transmitted without confusion. For instance, for the same example of five symbols whose confusion graph is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, there are 25 strings of length two that can be used in a length-2 coding scheme. These strings may be represented by the vertices of a graph with 25 vertices. In this graph, each vertex has eight neighbors, the eight strings that it can be confused with. A subset of length-two strings forms a code with no possible confusion if and only if it corresponds to an independent set of this graph. The set of code words {"11", "23", "35", "54", "42"} forms one of these independent sets, of maximum size.

If ''G'' is a graph representing the signals and confusable pairs of a channel, then the graph representing the length-two codewords and their confusable pairs is ''G''&amp;nbsp;⊠&amp;nbsp;''G'', where the symbol "⊠" represents the [[strong product of graphs]]. This is a graph that has a vertex for each pair (''u'',''v'') of a vertex in the first argument of the product and a vertex in the second argument of the product. Two distinct pairs (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are adjacent in the strong product if and only if ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are identical or adjacent, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are identical or adjacent. More generally, the codewords of length&amp;nbsp;''k'' can be represented by the graph ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''k''-fold strong product of ''G'' with itself, and the maximum number of codewords of this length that can be transmitted without confusion is given by the independence number ''&amp;alpha;''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The effective number of signals transmitted per unit time step is the ''k''th root of this number, ''&amp;alpha;''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Using these concepts, the Shannon capacity may be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
 \Theta(G)
 = \sup_k \sqrt[k]{\alpha(G_k)}
 = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[k]{\alpha(G_k)},
&lt;/math&gt;
the limit (as ''k'' becomes arbitrarily large) of the effective number of signals per time step of arbitrarily long confusion-free codes.

==Computational complexity==
{{unsolved|mathematics|What is the Shannon capacity of a 7-cycle?}}
The [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the Shannon capacity is unknown, and even the value of the Shannon capacity for certain small graphs such as ''C''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (a [[cycle graph]] of seven vertices) remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rough problems|work=Gödel's Lost Letter and P=NP|first=Kenneth W.|last=Regan|date=July 10, 2013|url=http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/rough-problems/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/shannon_capacity_of_the_seven_cycle|title=Shannon capacity of the seven-cycle|work=Open Problem Garden|date=February 19, 2009|author=tchow}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural approach to this problem would be to compute a finite number of powers of the given graph ''G'', find their independence numbers, and infer from these numbers some information about the limiting behavior of the sequence from which the Shannon capacity is defined. However (even ignoring the computational difficulty of computing the independence numbers of these graphs, an [[NP-hard]] problem) the unpredictable behavior of the sequence of independence numbers of powers of ''G'' implies that this approach cannot be used to accurately approximate the Shannon capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Shannon capacity of a graph and the independence numbers of its powers|arxiv=cs/0608021|first1=Noga|last1=Alon|author1-link=Noga Alon|first2=Eyal|last2=Lubetzky|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=52|year=2006|pages=2172–2176|doi=10.1109/tit.2006.872856}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper bounds==
In part because the Shannon capacity is difficult to compute, researchers have looked for other graph invariants that are easy to compute and that provide bounds on the Shannon capacity.

===Lovász number===
The [[Lovász number]] ϑ(''G'') is a different graph invariant, that can be computed numerically to high accuracy in [[polynomial time]] by an algorithm based on the [[ellipsoid method]]. The Shannon capacity of a graph ''G'' is bounded from below by α(''G''), and from above by ϑ(''G'').&lt;ref name="l79"&gt;{{citation | first = László | last = Lovász | authorlink = László Lovász | title = On the Shannon Capacity of a Graph | journal = [[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = IT-25 | issue = 1 | year = 1979 | zbl=0395.94021 | doi=10.1109/TIT.1979.1055985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, ϑ(''G'') and the Shannon capacity coincide; for instance, for the graph of a [[pentagon]], both are equal to {{sqrt|5}}. However, there exist other graphs for which the Shannon capacity and the Lovász number differ.&lt;ref name="h79"&gt;{{citation | first = Willem H. | last = Haemers | title = On Some Problems of Lovász Concerning the Shannon Capacity of a Graph | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume = 25 |pages = 231–232  | year = 1979 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3083183_On_Some_Problems_of_Lovasz_Concerning_the_Shannon_Capacity_of_a_Graph | doi=10.1109/tit.1979.1056027 | zbl=0402.94029 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haemers' bound===
Haemers provided another upper bound on the Shannon capacity, which is sometimes better than Lovász bound:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Willem H. | last = Haemers | title = An upper bound for the Shannon capacity of a graph | journal = Colloquia Mathematica Societatis János Bolyai | volume = 25 | pages = 267–272 | year = 1978 | url = https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/997000/UPPER___.PDF}}. The definition here corrects a typo in this paper.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 \Theta(G) \leq R(G) = \min_{B} \operatorname{rank}(B),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''B'' is an ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix over some [[field (mathematics)|field]], such that ''b&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and ''b&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 if vertices ''i'' and ''j'' are not adjacent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1791">In [[probability theory]], '''Slepian's lemma''' (1962), named after [[David Slepian]], is a Gaussian comparison inequality. It states that for Gaussian random variables &lt;math&gt;X = (X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y = (Y_1,\dots,Y_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;E[X] = E[Y] = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;E[X_i^2]=E[Y_i^2]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,n, \text{ and } \ E[X_iX_j] \le E[Y_i Y_j] &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;,

the following inequality holds for all real numbers &lt;math&gt;u_1,...,u_n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P[X_1 \le u_1, \dots, X_n \le u_n] \le P[Y_1 \le u_1, \dots, Y_n \le u_n ] &lt;/math&gt;.

While this intuitive-seeming result is true for Gaussian processes, it is not in general true for other random variables&amp;mdash;not even those with expectation 0.

As a corollary, if &lt;math&gt;(X_t)_{t \ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; is a centered [[Stationary process|stationary]] Gaussian process such that &lt;math&gt;E[X_0X_t] \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it holds for any real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;P\left[\sup_{t \in [0,T+S]} X_t \leq c\right] \ge P\left[\sup_{t \in [0,T]} X_t \leq c\right] P\left[\sup_{t \in [0,S]} X_t \leq c\right], \quad T,S &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
Slepian's lemma was first proven by Slepian in 1962, and has since been used in [[reliability theory]], [[extreme value theory]] and areas of pure probability. It has also been re-proven in several different forms.

'''SolveIT Software Pty Ltd''' is a provider of [[advanced planning and scheduling]] [[enterprise software]] for [[supply and demand]] optimisation and [[predictive modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdsinternational.com/Blog/Details/36/SolveIT-Software-to-Attend-the-Next-Generation-Oil|title=SolveIT Software to Attend the Next Generation Oil &amp; Gas Summit, ANZ 2012|publisher=GDS International|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], 70% of its turnover is generated from software deployed in the [[mining]] and [[bulk material handling]] sectors.&lt;ref name=Mine/&gt;

==History==
The company was set up in 2005 by four academics who were also experienced business people, all recent immigrants to [[Australia]]. The team was headed by ex-[[Ernst and Young]] consultant [[Matthew Michalewicz]], who had moved to Adelaide in 2004 after selling his last company, [[NuTech]].&lt;ref name=AdNowRec/&gt; The other three partners were [[Zbigniew Michalewicz | Zbigniew Michalewicz Ph.D]], Martin Schmidt and Constantin Chiriac, all four of which were co-authors of the book ''Adaptive Business Intelligence®''.&lt;ref name=ABI&gt;{{cite book|title=Adaptive Business Intelligence®|author=Zbigniew Michalewicz, Martin Schmidt, [[Matthew Michalewicz]], Constantin Chiriac|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|date=10 Nov 2006|ISBN=3540329285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company first developed an optimization and predictive modeling platform based on [[Artificial Intelligence]],&lt;ref name=ABI/&gt; and then built its supply chain applications for planning, scheduling, and demand forecasting on this platform. Early customers included [[Orlando Wines]], [[ABB Grain]], the [[Treasury Wine Estates|Fosters wine brands]] and later [[Pernod Ricard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istart.com.au/index/HM20/AL211017/AR211607|title=Pernod Ricard picks SolveIT Software for planning and scheduling|publisher=iStart.com.au|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that were also located in the [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley region]].&lt;ref name=AdNowRec/&gt;

In 2008, [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] [[Iron Ore]] asked the company to improve its mining planning and scheduling operations based at [[Pilbara]]. SolveIT succeeded in applying its advanced planning and scheduling product, based on non-linear optimization, to the Rio Tinto mine scheduling problem, after many other vendors had failed over a period of ten years.&lt;ref name=AdNowRec/&gt;

With 30 employees at this point, it then won an additional contract in the mining sector with [[BHP Billiton]]/[[Mitsubishi]] Alliance Coal,&lt;ref name=AdNowRec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mine/&gt; leading to subsequent tender wins in the sector, including: [[BHP Billiton]]; [[CBH Group]]; [[Fortescue Metals Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/412582|title=SolveIT Software Goes Live on Time and on Budget at Fortescue Metals Group for Mine-to-Port Supply Chain Optimisation|publisher=pr.com|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hills Holdings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsholdings.com.au/en/News/SolveIT|title=Team Poly signs contract with SolveIT Software for Transportation |publisher=[[Hills Holdings]]|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pacific National|Pacific National Coal]];&lt;ref name=ABI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adaptivebusinessintelligence.com/|title=Adaptive Business Intelligence®|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|date=10 Nov 2006|accessdate=2012-07-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721034826/http://www.adaptivebusinessintelligence.com/|archivedate=21 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xstrata Coal]].&lt;ref name=AdNowRec/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutUs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-279242381.html|title=SolveIT Software Pty Ltd signs contract with Xstrata Coal Queensland|publisher=International Resource News|date=7 February 2012|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2012, SolveIT announced it was acquired by [[Schneider Electric]], a global specialist in energy management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schneider-electric-acquires-solveit-software-168332406.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Headquartered in Adelaide, the company has over 150 staff based across operational offices in:&lt;ref name=AboutUs/&gt; [[Melbourne]]; [[Brisbane]]; [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]; and [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].&lt;ref name=Contact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solveitsoftware.com/contact_us/contact|title=Contact Us|publisher=SolveIT Software|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company develops [[advanced planning and scheduling]] business optimisation software, which helps manage complex operations using artificial intelligence. Most of the products were initially developed around the key [[South Australia]]n industries of [[wine]] and [[grain]] handling, and today SolveIt has a specialist [[mining]] division due to early adoption of the company's software within the mining market.&lt;ref name=Mine/&gt; The software helps companies accurately predict and plan their [[Production (economics)|production]], [[supply chain]], [[shipping]] and [[currency]] [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].&lt;ref name=AdNowRec/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solveitsoftware.com/Company/about|title=About Us|publisher=SolveIT Software|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the scientific optimisation components embedded in the company’s software products, it sometimes uses a prize-based system to [[recruitment|recruit]] the required high-level of talent. In 2011, the company used a [[Magic square]] problem, won by [[University of Nottingham]] graduate Yuri Bykov, who developed a program which solved a constrained version of a 2600 by 2600 magic square within a minute.&lt;ref name=AdNowRec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/solveit-software-is-wining-and-mining/story-e6frede3-1226239867515|title=SolveIT Software is wining and mining|author=Cameron England|publisher=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=9 January 2012|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the company won the Australian National iAward in the e-Logistics and Supply Chain category for its [[Supply Chain]] Network Optimiser (SCNO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logisticsmagazine.com.au/news/solveit-software-wins-the-national-iaward-for-e-lo|title=SolveIT Software wins the National iAward for e-Logistics and Supply Chain Management|publisher=Logistics &amp; Materials Handling magazine|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, SolveIT and [[Schneider Electric]] became co-organisers of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120414105633/http://www.ipos2012.com/ Integrated Planning and Optimisation Summit], held at the [[Adelaide Convention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tia.asn.au/news/media-activity/schneider,-solveit-to-host-planning-and-optimisation-summit|title=Schneider, SolveIT to host Planning and Optimisation Summit|publisher=Technology Industry Association|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4266">In [[mathematics]], especially in the areas of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[universal algebra]], [[group theory]], [[ring theory]], and [[module theory]], a '''subdirect product''' is a [[subalgebra]] of a [[direct product]] that depends fully on all its factors without however necessarily being the whole direct product.  The notion was introduced by [[Garrett Birkhoff|Birkhoff]] in 1944 and has proved to be a powerful generalization of the notion of direct product.

==Definition==
A '''subdirect product''' is a [[subalgebra]] (in the sense of [[universal algebra]]) ''A'' of a [[direct product]] Π''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that every induced projection (the composite ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;s'': ''A'' → ''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a projection ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;: Π''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the subalgebra inclusion ''s'': ''A'' → Π''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') is [[surjective]].

A '''direct''' ('''subdirect''') '''representation''' of an algebra ''A'' is a direct (subdirect) product isomorphic to ''A''.

An algebra is called [[Subdirectly irreducible algebra|subdirectly irreducible]] if it is not subdirectly representable by "simpler" algebras.  Subdirect irreducibles are to subdirect product of algebras roughly as primes are to multiplication of integers.

==Examples==
* Any [[distributive lattice]] ''L'' is subdirectly representable as a subalgebra of a direct power of the two-element distributive lattice.  This can be viewed as an algebraic formulation of the representability of ''L'' as a set of sets closed under the binary operations of union and intersection, via the interpretation of the direct power itself as a power set.  In the finite case such a representation is direct (i.e. the whole direct power) if and only if ''L'' is a [[complemented lattice]], i.e. a Boolean algebra.
* The same holds for any [[semilattice]] when "semilattice" is substituted for "distributive lattice" and "subsemilattice" for "sublattice" throughout the preceding example.  That is, every semilattice is representable as a subdirect power of the two-element semilattice.
* The chain of natural numbers together with infinity, as a [[Heyting algebra]], is subdirectly representable as a subalgebra of the direct product of the finite linearly ordered Heyting algebras.  The situation with other Heyting algebras is treated in further detail in the article on [[subdirect irreducible]]s.
* The [[group (mathematics)|group]] of integers under addition is subdirectly representable by any (necessarily infinite) family of arbitrarily large finite [[cyclic group]]s.  In this representation, 0 is the sequence of identity elements of the representing groups, 1 is a sequence of generators chosen from the appropriate group, and integer addition and negation are the corresponding group operations in each group applied coordinate-wise.  The representation is faithful (no two integers are represented by the same sequence) because of the size requirement, and the projections are onto because every coordinate eventually exhausts its group.
* Every [[vector space]] over a given field is subdirectly representable by the one-dimensional space over that field, with the finite-dimensional spaces being directly representable in this way.  (For vector spaces, as for [[abelian group]]s, direct product with finitely many factors is synonymous with direct sum with finitely many factors, whence subdirect product and subdirect sum are also synonymous for finitely many factors.)
* Subdirect products are used to represent many small [[perfect group]]s in {{harv|Holt|Plesken|1989}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14104">The '''system size expansion''', also known as '''van Kampen's expansion''' or the '''Ω-expansion''', is a technique pioneered by [[Nico van Kampen]]&lt;ref name = "vankampen"&gt;van Kampen, N. G. (2007) "Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry", North-Holland Personal Library&lt;/ref&gt; used in the analysis of [[stochastic processes]]. Specifically, it allows one to find an approximation to the solution of a [[master equation]] with nonlinear transition rates. The leading order term of the expansion is given by the '''linear noise approximation''', in which the master equation is approximated by a [[Fokker–Planck equation]] with linear coefficients determined by the [[Markov process|transition rates]] and [[stoichiometry]] of the system.

Less formally, it is normally straightforward to write down a mathematical description of a system where processes happen randomly (for example, radioactive atoms randomly [[Radioactive decay|decay]] in a physical system, or genes that are [[cellular noise|expressed stochastically]] in a cell). However, these mathematical descriptions are often too difficult to solve for the study of the systems statistics (for example, the [[Mean (statistics)|mean]] and [[variance]] of the number of atoms or proteins as a function of time). The system size expansion allows one to obtain an approximate statistical description that can be solved much more easily than the master equation.

== Preliminaries ==

Systems that admit a treatment with the system size expansion may be described by a [[probability distribution]] &lt;math&gt;P(X, t)&lt;/math&gt;, giving the probability of observing the system in state &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be, for example, a [[Tuple|vector]] with elements corresponding to the number of molecules of different chemical species in a system. In a system of size &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (intuitively interpreted as the volume), we will adopt the following nomenclature: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of macroscopic copy numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{X}/\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of concentrations, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of deterministic concentrations, as they would appear according to the rate equation in an infinite system. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; are thus quantities subject to stochastic effects.

A [[master equation]] describes the time evolution of this probability.&lt;ref name = "vankampen" /&gt; Henceforth, a system of chemical reactions&lt;ref name = "elf"&gt;Elf, J. and Ehrenberg, M. (2003) "Fast Evaluation of Fluctuations in Biochemical Networks With the Linear Noise Approximation", ''Genome Research'', 13:2475–2484.&lt;/ref&gt; will be discussed to provide a concrete example, although the nomenclature of "species" and "reactions" is generalisable. A system involving &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; species and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; reactions can be described with the master equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d P(\mathbf{X}, t)}{dt} = \Omega \sum_{j = 1}^R \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \mathbb{E}^{-S_{ij}} - 1 \right) f_j (\mathbf{x}, \Omega) P (\mathbf{X}, t). &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the system size, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] which will be addressed later, &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the stoichiometric matrix for the system (in which element &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometry_matrix|stoichiometric coefficient]] for species &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; given a state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and system size &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^{-S_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; is a step operator,&lt;ref name = "vankampen" /&gt; removing &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th element of its argument. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^{-S_{23}} f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = f(x_1, x_2 - S_{23}, x_3)&lt;/math&gt;. This formalism will be useful later.

The above equation can be interpreted as follows. The initial sum on the RHS is over all reactions. For each reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the brackets immediately following the sum give two terms. The term with the simple coefficient −1 gives the probability flux away from a given state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; due to reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; changing the state. The term preceded by the product of step operators gives the probability flux due to reaction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; changing a different state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X'}&lt;/math&gt; into state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;. The product of step operators constructs this state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X'}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example ===

For example, consider the (linear) chemical system involving two chemical species &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; and the reaction &lt;math&gt;X_1 \rightarrow X_2&lt;/math&gt;. In this system, &lt;math&gt;N = 2&lt;/math&gt; (species), &lt;math&gt;R = 1&lt;/math&gt; (reactions). A state of the system is a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \{ n_1, n_2 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2&lt;/math&gt; are the number of molecules of &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Let &lt;math&gt;f_1(\mathbf{x}, \Omega) = \frac{n_1}{\Omega} = x_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the rate of reaction 1 (the only reaction) depends on the concentration of &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;. The stoichiometry matrix is &lt;math&gt;(-1, 1)^T&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the master equation reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \frac{d P(\mathbf{X}, t)}{dt} &amp; = \Omega \left( \mathbb{E}^{-S_{11}} \mathbb{E}^{-S_{21}} - 1 \right) f_1 \left( \frac{\mathbf{X}}{\Omega} \right) P(\mathbf{X}, t) \\
&amp; = \Omega \left( f_1 \left( \frac{\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{\Delta X}}{\Omega} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{\Delta X}, t \right)  - f_1 \left( \frac{\mathbf{X}}{\Omega} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}, t \right) \right),\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta X} = \{1, -1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the shift caused by the action of the product of step operators, required to change state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; to a precursor state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Linear noise approximation ==

If the master equation possesses [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] transition rates, it may be impossible to solve it analytically. The system size expansion utilises the [[ansatz]] that the [[variance]] of the steady-state probability distribution of constituent numbers in a population scales like the system size. This ansatz is used to expand the master equation in terms of a small parameter given by the inverse system size.

Specifically, let us write the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, the copy number of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, as a sum of its "deterministic" value (a scaled-up concentration) and a [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, scaled by &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; X_i = \Omega \phi_i + \Omega^{1/2} \xi_i. &lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; can then be rewritten in the vector of random variables &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; P(\mathbf{X}, t) = P(\Omega \mathbf{\phi} + \Omega^{1/2} \mathbf{\xi}) = \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t). &lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider how to write reaction rates &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the step operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of this new random variable. [[Taylor expansion]] of the transition rates gives:

:&lt;math&gt; f_j (\mathbf{x}) = f_j (\mathbf{\phi} + \Omega^{-1/2} \mathbf{\xi}) = f_j( \mathbf{\phi} ) + \Omega^{-1/2} \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial f_j(\mathbf{\phi})}{\partial \phi_i} \xi_i + O(\Omega^{-1}). &lt;/math&gt;

The step operator has the effect &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} f(n) \rightarrow f(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} f(\xi) \rightarrow f(\xi + \Omega^{-1/2})&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i = 1}^{N}\mathbb{E}^{-S_{ij}} \simeq 1 - \Omega^{-1/2} \sum_i S_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{\Omega^{-1}}{2} \sum_i \sum_k S_{ij} S_{kj} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k} + O(\Omega^{-3/2}). &lt;/math&gt;

We are now in a position to recast the master equation.

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} &amp; {} \quad \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial t} - \Omega^{1/2} \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i} \\
&amp; = \Omega \sum_{j = 1}^R \left( -\Omega^{-1/2} \sum_i S_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{\Omega^{-1}}{2} \sum_i \sum_k S_{ij} S_{kj} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k} + O(\Omega^{-3/2}) \right) \\
&amp; {} \qquad \times \left( f_j(\mathbf{\phi}) + \Omega^{-1/2} \sum_i \frac{\partial f_j(\mathbf{\phi})}{\partial \phi_i} \xi_i + O(\Omega^{-1}) \right) \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t). \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This rather frightening expression makes a bit more sense when we gather terms in different powers of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. First, terms of order &lt;math&gt;\Omega^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; give

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i} = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij} f_j (\mathbf{\phi}) \frac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i}. &lt;/math&gt;

These terms cancel, due to the [[Rate equation|macroscopic reaction equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} = \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij} f_j (\mathbf{\phi}). &lt;/math&gt;

The terms of order &lt;math&gt;\Omega^0&lt;/math&gt; are more interesting:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial t} = \sum_j \left( \sum_{ik} -S_{ij} \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial \phi_k} \frac{\partial (\xi_k \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t) )}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{1}{2} f_j \sum_{ik} S_{ij} S_{kj} \frac{\partial^2 \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Pi (\mathbf{\xi}, t)}{\partial t} = -\sum_{ik} A_{ik} \frac{\partial (\xi_k \Pi)}{\partial \xi_i} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ik} [\mathbf{BB}^T]_{ik} \frac{\partial^2 \Pi}{\partial \xi_i \, \partial \xi_k}, &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ik} = \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij} \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial \phi_k} = \frac{\partial (\mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{f})}{\partial \phi_k}, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; [ \mathbf{BB}^T ]_{ik} = \sum_{j = 1}^R S_{ij}S_{kj} f_j (\mathbf{\phi}) = [ \mathbf{S} \, \mbox{diag}(f(\mathbf{\phi})) \, \mathbf{S}^T ]_{ik}. &lt;/math&gt;

The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is then governed by the linear [[Fokker–Planck equation]] with coefficient matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{BB}^T&lt;/math&gt; (in the large-&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; limit, terms of &lt;math&gt;O(\Omega^{-1/2})&lt;/math&gt; may be neglected, termed the '''linear noise approximation'''). With knowledge of the reaction rates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; and stoichiometry &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the moments of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated.

==  Software ==

The linear noise approximation has become a popular technique for estimating the size of [[Cellular noise|intrinsic noise]] in terms of [[Coefficient of variation|coefficients of variation]] and [[Fano factor]]s for molecular species in intracellular pathways. The second moment obtained from the linear noise approximation (on which the noise measures are based) are exact only if the pathway is composed of first-order reactions. However bimolecular reactions such as [[Enzyme kinetics|enzyme-substrate]], [[Protein-protein interaction|protein-protein]] and [[Protein-DNA interaction|protein-DNA]] interactions are ubiquitous elements of all known pathways; for such cases, the linear noise approximation can give estimates which are accurate in the limit of large reaction volumes. Since this limit is taken at constant concentrations, it follows that the linear noise approximation gives accurate results in the limit of large molecule numbers and becomes less reliable for pathways characterized by many species with low copy numbers of molecules. 

A number of studies have elucidated cases of the insufficiency of the linear noise approximation in biological contexts by comparison of its predictions with those of stochastic simulations.&lt;ref name="hayot"&gt;Hayot, F. and Jayaprakash, C. (2004), "The linear noise approximation for molecular fluctuations within cells", ''Physical Biology'', 1:205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ferm"&gt;Ferm, L. Lötstedt, P. and Hellander, A. (2008), "A Hierarchy of Approximations of the Master Equation Scaled by a Size Parameter", ''Journal of Scientific Computing'', 34:127&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the investigation of higher order terms of the system size expansion that go beyond the linear approximation. These terms have been used to obtain more accurate moment estimates for the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] concentrations and for the [[variance]]s of the concentration fluctuations in intracellular pathways. In particular, the leading order corrections to the linear noise approximation yield corrections of the conventional [[rate equation]]s.&lt;ref name = "grima2010"&gt;Grima, R. (2010) "An effective rate equation approach to reaction kinetics in small volumes: Theory and application to biochemical reactions in nonequilibrium steady-state conditions", ''The Journal of Chemical Physics'', 132:035101&lt;/ref&gt; Terms of higher order have also been used to obtain corrections to the [[variance]]s and [[covariance]]s estimates of the linear noise approximation.&lt;ref name="grima2011"&gt;Grima, R. and Thomas, P. and Straube, A.V. (2011), "How accurate are the nonlinear chemical Fokker-Planck and chemical Langevin equations?", ''The Journal of Chemical Physics'', 135:084103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grima2012"&gt;Grima, R. (2012), "A study of the accuracy of moment-closure approximations for stochastic chemical kinetics", ''The Journal of Chemical Physics'', 136: 154105&lt;/ref&gt; The linear noise approximation and corrections to it can be computed using the open source software [[intrinsic Noise Analyzer]]. The corrections have been shown to be particularly considerable for [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric]] and non-allosteric enzyme-mediated reactions in [[Cellular compartment|intracellular compartments]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">'''Systems medicine''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks at the systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions. Systems medicine draws on [[systems science]] and [[systems biology]], and considers complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's [[genomics]], behavior and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994–996 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest uses of the term ''systems medicine'' appeared in 1992, in an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by B.J. Zeng &lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper on systems biomedicine by T. Kamada.&lt;ref&gt;Kamada T. ,System biomedicine: a new paradigm in biomedical engineering. Front Med Biol Eng. 1992;4(1):1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important topic in systems medicine and [[systems biomedicine]] is the development of computational models that  describe disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2237">In [[mathematics]], the (right) '''Ziegler spectrum''' of a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is a [[topological space]] whose points are (isomorphism classes of) [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] [[algebraically compact|pure-injective]] right modules. Its [[Closed set|closed subsets]] correspond to theories of modules closed under arbitrary products and direct summands. Ziegler spectra are named after Martin Ziegler, who first defined and studied them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ziegler (1984). Model theory of modules. ''Ann. Pure Appl. Logic'', 26:2 149–213&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Let ''R'' be a ring. A (right) '''pp-n-formula''' is a formula in the language of (right) ''R''-modules of the form

: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\exists \overline{y} \ (\overline{y},\overline{x}) A=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell,n,m&lt;/math&gt; are natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;(\ell+n)\times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix with entries from ''R'', and &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-tuple of variables and &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuple of variables.

The (right) Ziegler spectrum, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Zg}_R&lt;/math&gt;, of ''R'' is the topological space whose points are isomorphism classes of indecomposable pure-injective right modules, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pinj}_R&lt;/math&gt;; The topology
has the sets

: &lt;math display="block"&gt;(\varphi/\psi) = \{N\in\operatorname{pinj}_R \mid \varphi(N) \supsetneq \psi(N)\cap\varphi(N)\}&lt;/math&gt;

as [[subbasis]] of open sets, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi&lt;/math&gt; range over
(right) pp-1-formulae. One can show that these sets form a basis.

== Properties ==

Ziegler spectra are rarely [[Hausdorff space|hausdorff]] and often fail to have the [[Kolmogorov space|&lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;]]-property. However they are always [[compact space|compact]] and have a basis of compact open sets given by the sets &lt;math&gt;(\varphi/\psi)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi&lt;/math&gt; are pp-1-formulae.

When the ring ''R'' is countable &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Zg}_R&lt;/math&gt; is [[Sober space|sober]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Herzog (1993). Elementary duality of modules. ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'', 340:1 37–69&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently known if all Ziegler spectra are sober.
