      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6967">[[File:Adelma von Vay.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Baroness Adelma Vay de Vaya]]
Baroness '''Adelma Vay''' or '''von Vay''' (also '''Vay de Vaya'''), born Countess Adelaide von [[Wurmbrand-Stuppach]] (October 21, 1840 &amp;ndash; May 24, 1925), was a [[Mediumship|medium]] and pioneer of [[spiritualism]] in [[Slovenia]] and [[Hungary]].

== Life and work ==
Vay was the elder daughter of Count Ernst von Wurmbrand-Stuppach and his wife, Countess Rosa Teleki von Szék (later wife of Friedrich, Prince of [[Solms-Baruth]]).

She was born at Tarnopol, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], today [[Ternopil]],  [[Ukraine]],  where her father Count Ernst von Wurmbrand-Stuppach was serving as [[First Lieutenant]] in the local [[garrison]]. In her early youth she lived on the family estate near [[Schwarzau]], [[Lower Austria]]. Her father died in 1846; when her mother married again in 1851 she left [[Austria]] and moved with her to [[Prussia]] for 10 years.&lt;ref name="DSS9"&gt;Adelma von Vay: ''Duh, sila, snov'' (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 1860, she married baron Ödön (Edmond, Eugen or Otto) Vay de Vaya, a Hungarian [[magnate]].&lt;ref name="DSS9" /&gt; They enjoyed 60 years of marriage, but without having children. The couple lived at first at [[Tiszalök]] for some years, near the Hungarian-Ukrainian border, and later moved to [[Slovenske Konjice]] (Gonobitz), where they bought a mansion at Prevrat, still known as "Baronvaj" ("Baron Vay's").&lt;ref name="DSS10"&gt;Adelma von Vay: Duh, sila, snov (Jan Ciglenečki: ''Štajerska Pitija'', page 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ödön was a retired senior officer of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army. On August 9, 1877, the "Militar-Veteranen-Verein in Gonobitz" (Association of Army Veterans in Gonobitz) was founded, primarily for ex-soldiers regardless of nationality. The association's first president was [[prince]] Hugo Veriand von [[Windisch-Graetz]], and his deputy was [[baron]] Vay de Vaya.&lt;ref name="Pajk"&gt;Ožinger Anton, Pajk Ivan: ''Konjiško ob 850-letnici pražupnije''&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple were both members of the local [[Red Cross Society]] committee, which in 1897 built a hospital named the "Christiane-Lazarett" after Christiane Habsburg, president of the Austro-Hungarian Red Cross Society.&lt;ref name="DSS18"&gt;Adelma von Vay: ''Duh, sila, snov'' (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 18)&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Vay de Vaya decided in 1908 to have another building constructed (at his own cost) specifically for infectious disease patients. The hospital continued in operation until the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Pajk" /&gt;

Adelma was well known as a great humanitarian, and never charged for her medical advice and assistance, being always prepared to help both poor and rich people.&lt;ref name="DSS18" /&gt;

[[File:Adelma Vay de Vaya grave.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Adelma Vay's grave in St. Anna's cemetery, [[Slovenske Konjice]]]]
On March 1, 1921, Ödön died at [[Mali Lošinj]], where the couple had a summer [[villa]].&lt;ref name="DSS10" /&gt; After his death, the widowed Adelma continued to live in the mansion, surrounded by servants. She died on May 24, 1925, at her home. Although she was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], the Roman Catholic parish priest Franc Hrastelj approved her burial in the churchyard of St. Anna's in [[Slovenske Konjice]].&lt;ref name="Pajk" /&gt;

== Spiritualism ==
Adelma had the reputation of possessing mystical powers, probably inherited from her mother. She was reputed to have [[prophet]]ic gifts and to be [[clairvoyant]]. She wrote, spoke and drew in an apparent trance-like state. She was a famous [[homeopath]] and attempted to cure people using [[magnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nena Židov: ''An overview of the history of homeopathy in Slovenia in the 19th century''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 she and her husband founded at [[Budapest]] the ''Verein spiriter Forscher'' (Hungarian Spiritualist Association), of which they became the first presidents.&lt;ref name="Pajk" /&gt;

As knowledge and practice of spiritualism grew, Vay did great pioneer work. In ''An Encyclopaedia of Occultism'' (1920) by [[Lewis Spence]] (1874–1955), she was noted as the initiator of spiritualism in [[Austria-Hungary]], with a decisive role also ascribed to the ''Verein spiriter Forscher''.

Adelma von Vay once described her book ''Spirit, Power And Matter''&lt;ref&gt;Adelma von Vay: ''Duh, sila, snov'' (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija)&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of pure [[Christian Spiritualism]]. The newly formed association was not thought of as a dogmatic Spiritualistic sect but was instead anchored solidly in a framework of Christian religion, as testified by its statute of association.&lt;ref&gt;Adelma von Vay: ''Duh, sila, snov'' (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Vay was author of many books, written in [[German language|German]] and translated into English:

'''Ahuna Vairya''' (Avestan: ''𐬀𐬵𐬎𐬥𐬀 𐬬𐬀𐬌𐬭𐬌𐬌𐬀‎)'' is the [[Avestan language]] name of [[Zoroastrianism]]'s first of four Gathic Avestan formulas. The text, which appears in ''[[Yasna]]'' 27.13, is also known after its opening words '''yatha ahu vairyo'''. In Zoroastrian tradition, the formula is also known as the ''ahun(a)war''.

Numerous translations and interpretations exist, but the overall meaning of the text remains obscure. The Ahuna Vairya and ''[[Ashem Vohu]]'' (the second most sacred formula at ''Yasna'' 27.14) are together "very cryptic formulas, of a pronounced magical character."{{sfn|Humbach|1991|p=1}} The Ahunavaiti [[Gatha]] (chapters 28-34 of the ''Yasna''), is named after the Ahuna Vairya formula. 

==In relation to the other formulas==
Like the other three formulas (''[[Ashem Vohu|Ashem vohu]]'', ''[[Yenghe hatam]]'', ''[[Airyaman ishya]]''), the ''Ahuna Vairya'' is part of the Gathic canon, that is, part of the group of texts composed in the more archaic dialect of the Avestan language. Together with the other three formulas, the ''Ahuna Vairya'' is part of the 'envelope' that liturgically encloses the [[Gatha]]s, i.e. the hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself. One of the formulas, the ''Airyaman ishya'' (''Yasna'' 54.1) follows the Gathas, while the other three formulas -- ''Ahuna Vairya'', ''Ashem vohu'' and ''Yenghe hatam'' (together at ''Yasna'' 27.13-27.15) -- precede them.

Unlike the third and fourth formula, the first two formulas -- the ''Ahuna Vairya'' and the ''Ashem vohu'' -- are part of the Kusti prayers. Unlike the third and fourth formula, the first two do not express wishes and are technically purificatory and meditational declarations (''asti'', "it is"&lt;!-- Humbach "Western Approach", p. 51 for Y 27.14 --&gt;).

==In scripture==
The ''Ahuna Vairya'' is already a subject of theological exegesis in scripture itself, in particular in ''[[Yasna]]'' 19, where "this utterance is a thing of such a nature, that if all the corporeal and living world should learn it, and learning hold fast by it, they would be redeemed from their mortality." &lt;!-- Y19 == Mills translation of the commentary --&gt; (19.10) In ''Yasna'' 19.3 and 4.8, the formula is described as having been a primordial utterance of [[Ahura Mazda]], articulated immediately after the creation of the spiritual world (and before the material world), and that its efficacy in aiding the righteous is due to its primordial nature.{{sfn|Brunner|1984|p=695}}

As a primordial utterance, the ''Ahura Vairya'' is described to have talismanic virtues: the power to aid mortals in distress, and inversely as a potent weapon against the demonic ''[[daeva]]''s. Elsewhere in the Avesta, the ''Ahuna Vairya'' is described as the "most victorious" (''Yasht'' 11.13), as the "veracious word" (''Yasna'' 8.1), as the "sacred gift" (''Yasna'' 27.7). In ''Vendidad'' 11.3, in addition to being "most healing", frequent recitation of the ''Ahura Vairya'' is prescribed as an act of hygiene to "protect the body". In ''Yasna'' 9.14, [[Zoroaster]] is given credit as the first mortal to recite it.

==In tradition==
The hymn's supremacy among sacred Zoroastrian formulae is well developed in the 9th-11th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition. 

In the ''[[Denkard]]'' ('Acts of Religion', 9th century), four of the twenty-one ''nask''s are described to have expounded on the efficacy of the hymn (8.44.1), and each volume of the ''nask''s is said to have been initially assigned its title from a word in the ''Ahuna Vairya'' prayer (''Denkard'' intro, 6, 8, 17, 18, 9.1.4). The formula's potency to smite demons and protect life and property are described at length (4.38-45, 8.43.81, 9.1.4), and the formula's primordial nature is seen as the root and summation of the belief in Ahura Mazda, "the seed of seeds of the reckoning of the religion." (8.45.1)

The ''[[Bundahishn]]'', an 11th/12th century narrative of Zoroastrian cosmogonical myths, continues and embellishes the Avesta's description of the ''Ahuna Vairya'' as a primordial utterance. In that tradition, ''Ahuna Vairya'' is not only an utterance of Mazda following the creation of the spiritual world. Additionally, in ''Bundahishn'' 12.13-14, the spirit of the ''yatha ahu vairyo'' is the first manifestation of the luminaries that Ahura Mazda created, i.e. the spirit of the formula is the first of the material creations, and is at the same time the "fire form" force from which the material world is created. Moreover, in articulating the formula, Ahura Mazda made his ultimate triumph evident to "the evil spirit" ([[Angra Mainyu]]), who then fell back "confounded and impotent as to the harm he caused the creatures of Ahuramazd" (1.29-30).

The ''Vendidad'''s prescription of recitation of the formula as an act of hygiene is reiterated in the ''Sayast ne Sayast'', which prescribes recitation when sneezing or coughing (12.32), and recommends invocation when pouring potable liquids (10.7). The ''Sayast ne Sayast'' additionally notes that a mumbling of the prayer is particularly offensive. (10.25) The ''Denkard'' additionally suggests the formula be uttered when entering a house (9.18.5).

While the Avesta's ''Yasna'' 19 sees the subject of the Ahuna Vairya formula as referring to Zoroaster, and possibly to his successors, later tradition  (''Denkard'' 9.24.1, also ''Zatspram'' 1.13.19) infers no such connection, and applies it evenly to all followers of Zoroaster's teaching.{{sfn|Brunner|1984|p=695}}

==Text, translation and interpretation==
Like all Gathic Avestan verses, the prayer is altogether ambiguous and translations vary significantly.
Even though several translations and interpretations exist, the overall meaning of the prayer remains obscure. The terseness of the prose, elaborate arrangement and poetical techniques make a translation from the [[Avestan language|Old Avestan]] difficult (See also: difficulties in translating the [[Gathas]]). Given its syntactic density, scholarly agreement on a definitive translation, or even close approximation of its meaning, remains unlikely.&lt;!-- what kind of sourcing is "&lt;ref&gt;Russell, "A Zoroastrian Mantra" (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;" ???? --&gt; Translations based on [[Middle Persian]] translations (and commentaries) of the hymn also exist and can differ greatly from those based on the Avestan original.

The version found in the Avesta edition of Geldner reads:

:''&lt;big&gt;yaϑā ahū vairyō aϑā ratuš aṣ̌āt̰cīt̰ hacā&lt;/big&gt;''
:''&lt;big&gt;vaŋhə̄uš dazdā manaŋhō š́yaoϑananąm aŋhə̄uš mazdāi&lt;/big&gt;''
:''&lt;big&gt;xṣ̌aϑrəmcā ahurāi ā yim drigubyō dadat̰ vāstārəm&lt;/big&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Karl F. Geldner, Avesta, the Sacred Books of the Parsis, Stuttgart, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avesta.org/yasna/yasna_mithra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are transliterations available with differences concerning certain words. 
Transliteration of Helmut Humbach:

:''&lt;big&gt;yaϑā ahū vairyō¹,    aϑā ratuš aṣ̌āt̰cīt̰ hacā&lt;/big&gt;''
:''&lt;big&gt;vaŋhə̄uš dazdā manaŋhō, š́yaoϑənanąm² aŋhə̄uš mazdāi&lt;/big&gt;''
:''&lt;big&gt;xšaϑrəmcā ahurāi.ā, yim³ drigubyō dadat̰ vāstārəm&lt;/big&gt;'' 

:''¹ "vairiyō" in "Zarathushtra and His Antagonists" (Faiss &amp; Humbach)
:''² other versions are "š́yaoϑananąm" (Geldner) and "š́yaoϑnanąm" (West, Mills)
:''³ this is the younger avestan form, old avestan is "yəm"&lt;ref&gt;https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/aveol/40&lt;/ref&gt; or "yə̄m"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avestan-language#pt2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Iranica Vol. III, Fasc. 1, pp. 47-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Dastur Dhalla also notes that a corrupt form of the prayer is commonly used:
:''athāu veryo thāre tose sāde chide chāvanghoise dezdā manengho sotthenanām''
:''anghyos Mazdāe khosetharamchāe orāe āiyem daregobyo daredar vāstārem'

All translation attempts done by scholars do not give an authentic translation of the original with all its possible more deeper significance(s), because they all differ significantly.

Translation by Boyce essentially derived from that of S. Insler:
:As the master, so is the judge to be chosen in accord with truth.
:Establish the power of acts arising from a life lived with good purpose,
:for Mazda and for the Lord whom they made pastor for the poor.

A simple translation from the [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian]] by Darmesteter:
:the will of the Lord is the law of righteousness.
:the gifts of the Good Mind to the deeds done in this world for Mazda.
:he who relieves the poor makes Ahura king.

A translation from the Avestan by Windfuhr:
:Whereas he shall be chosen by the world, so, according to Truth,
:the judgement of deeds done by the world in Good Faith (Mind) is yielded to Mazda,
:and the Power of the Ahura whom they shall assign as pastor to the poor.

Humbach, Elefenbein and Skjærvø translate it as:

:As judgment is to be chosen by the world,
::so the judgment (which is) in accord with the truth,
:(which is to be passed) on the actions of good throughout the world,
::is assigned to the Wise (Lord) (''Mazdāi''),
:and the power (is assigned) to the (Wise) Lord (''ahurāi'')
::whom they established as shepherd to the needy.


The essence of truth arises from the primordial nature of existence
Wield this as your tool as a king of lands
He is a true king who loves those whom he serves 
Other interpretations are listed in the [[#Further reading|further reading]] section below. &lt;!-- A similarly simple, but more recent, interpretation by Brunner: 
:As a temporal lord is chosen, so is a spiritual lord, according to Truth, as an establisher of the works of Good Mind in the world – and the sovereignty is Ahura Mazda's – whom they have bestowed on the humble as a shepherd. --&gt;

'''Aristo of [[Chios]]''' ({{lang-el|Ἀρίστων ὁ Χῖος}} ''Ariston ho Chios''; fl. c. 260 BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher and colleague of [[Zeno of Citium]]. He outlined a system of Stoic philosophy that was, in many ways, closer to earlier [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy. He rejected the [[logic]]al and [[physics|physical]] sides of philosophy endorsed by Zeno and emphasized [[ethics]]. Although agreeing with Zeno that [[Virtue]] was the supreme good, he rejected the idea that morally indifferent things such as [[health]] and [[wealth]] could be ranked according to whether they are naturally preferred. An important philosopher in his day, his views were eventually marginalized by Zeno's successors.

==Life==
Aristo, son of Miltiades, was born on the island of [[Chios]] sometime around 300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;His date of birth is uncertain.  He attended lectures by Zeno (born 333 BC, lectured between c. 302-264), and also became his most significant Stoic rival. He also attended lectures by Polemo (died 270/269 BC). 290 BC is the latest we can say he was born, but the late 4th century is quite probable.&lt;/ref&gt; He came to [[Athens]] where he attended the lectures of [[Zeno of Citium]], and also, for a time, the lectures of [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemo]],&lt;ref name="diog162"&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (the head of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] from 314 to 269). Although he was a member of Zeno's circle he soon departed from Zeno's teachings, largely rejecting the two non-ethical parts of Stoic philosophy&amp;nbsp;– physics and logic&amp;nbsp;– endorsed by Zeno.

A man of persuasive eloquence, Aristo was such a good speaker that he was called ''the Siren''. He was also called ''Phalanthus'', from his baldness. He set up his own school in the [[Cynosarges]] gymnasium&lt;ref name="diog161"&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (a place associated with [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy) and attracted many pupils, so much so that when he was accused of exposing the dignity of philosophy by his freedom to all-comers, he answered, that "he wished that Nature had given understanding to wild beasts, that they too might be capable of being his hearers."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3052 ''Lives: That a Philosopher Ought to Converse with Great Men''].&lt;/ref&gt; His followers called themselves Aristonians and included the scientist [[Eratosthenes]]&lt;ref name="athen1"&gt;Athenaeus, [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/Literature/subcollections/DeipnoSubAbout.shtml ''Deipnosophists''], Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoics: [[Apollophanes of Antioch|Apollophanes]], Diphilus, and Miltiades.&lt;ref name="diog161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athen1"/&gt;

Aristo engaged in much debate with [[Arcesilaus]], the leader of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]], defending Stoic [[epistemology]] against Arcesilaus's [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] views.&lt;ref name="diog162"/&gt; On one occasion he accused Arcesilaus of being: "[[Plato]] the head of him, [[Pyrrho]] the tail, midway [[Diodorus Cronus|Diodorus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 35}}; and Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism''.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that Arcesilaus presented himself as a Platonist, the substance of what he taught was the dialectics of Diodorus, but his actual philosophy was that of [[Pyrrhonism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Arcesilaus ... does indeed seem to me to share the Pyrrhonean arguments, so that his Way is almost the same as ours.... he made use of the dialectic of Diodorus, but he was an outwardly Platonist." Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' Book I, Chapter 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his old age, he apparently lapsed from the Stoic ideal, and would at times indulge in pleasure.&lt;ref name="athen1"/&gt; It is not known when he died,&lt;ref&gt;He was a vigorous opponent of Arcesilaus (head of the Academy from 265 to 241) and he also taught Eratosthenes (born 276), so he was presumably alive in the 250's and perhaps beyond.&lt;/ref&gt; but he is supposed to have died from [[sunstroke]] on account of his [[baldness]].&lt;ref name="diog164"&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] divided [[philosophy]] into three parts: [[Logic]] (which was a very wide subject including [[rhetoric]], [[grammar]], and the theories of [[perception]] and [[thought]]); [[Physics]] (including not just [[science]], but the [[divinity|divine]] nature of the universe as well); and [[Ethics]], the end goal of which was to achieve happiness through the right way of living according to Nature.  It is impossible to describe in full Aristo's philosophical system because none of his writings survived intact, but from the fragments preserved by later writers, it is clear that Aristo was heavily influenced by earlier [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy:

===Logic===
Aristo regarded Logic as unimportant, saying that it had nothing to do with us.&lt;ref name="diog161"/&gt; "[[Dialectic]] reasonings," he said, "were like cobwebs, artificially constructed, but otherwise useless."&lt;ref name="diog161"/&gt;  It is unlikely that he rejected all Logic,&lt;ref&gt;"Crude sentences of the form 'x rejects logic' are unsatisfying, ... it is one thing to decline to study the subject of logic, and quite another to decline to produce arguments. No ancient philosopher is accused of abjuring reason."{{Cite book|last=Barnes|first=Johnathan|title=Logic and the imperial Stoa|page=8|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004108289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is notable that Zeno, too, compared the skills of dialecticians "to right measures that do not measure wheat or anything else worthwhile but chaff and dung."&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, 2.22, 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Stephen Menn]], Aristo recognized the need to add '''''somehow disposed in relation to something''''' to the [[Stoic Categories]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Physics===
Aristo also rejected Physics, saying that it was beyond us.&lt;ref name="diog161"/&gt;  This is reflected in his views concerning God:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristo holds that no form of God is conceivable, and denies him sensation, and is in a state of complete uncertainty as to whether he is, or is not, animate.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=539 ''De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)''], 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This was in marked opposition to Zeno to whom "the universe was animate and possessed of reason."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=539 ''De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)''], 2, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, agree with Zeno that Nature was comprehensible, arguing against the Academics.  He once asked an Academic "Do you not even see the man who is sitting next to you?", and when the Academic replied, "I do not," Aristo said: "Who then has blinded you; who has robbed you of your eyes?"&lt;ref name="diog163"&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
For Aristo, Ethics was the only true branch of philosophy, but he also limited this category, removing its practical side: advice concerning individual actions was largely useless:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He holds that it does not sink into the mind, having in it nothing but old wives' precepts, and that the greatest benefit is derived from the actual dogmas of philosophy and from the definition of the Supreme Good. When a man has gained a complete understanding of this definition and has thoroughly learned it, he can frame for himself a precept directing what is to be done in a given case.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', 94. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For Aristo, only the sage makes flawless decisions and does not need advice, for everybody else with clouded minds, advice is ineffective:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For [[precepts]] will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only when the cloud is dispersed will it be clear what one's duty is in each case. Otherwise, you will merely be showing the sick man what he ought to do if he were well, instead of making him well.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', 94. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The purpose of life was to seek the Supreme Good, and here Aristo set up a challenge to Zeno.  While agreeing with Zeno that [[Virtue]] was the supreme good, he totally rejected the idea that external advantages (health, wealth, etc.), although morally "indifferent", could be ranked in terms of whether they are naturally preferred or not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristo of Chios denied that health, and everything similar to it, is a preferred indifferent. To call it a preferred indifferent is equivalent to judging it a good, and different practically in name alone; For without exception things indifferent as between virtue and vice have no difference at all, nor are some of them preferred by nature while others are dispreferred, but in the face of the different circumstances of the occasions, neither those said to be preferred prove to be unconditionally preferred, nor are those said to be dispreferred of necessity dispreferred; For if healthy men had to serve a tyrant and be destroyed for this reason, while the sick had to be released from the service and, therewith also, from destruction, the wise man would rather choose sickness in this circumstance than health.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Professors'', 11. 64-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Zeno would have agreed that there could be circumstances when one might choose illness for the good of the world, but for Zeno, health is a naturally preferred state; Aristo rejected this.  For Aristo, not only are there times when illness might be preferred over health, (health cannot always be unconditionally preferred), but health is not even a natural advantage, and one can ''never'' assume that it is better than illness. Although the sage can (and often must) choose between various indifferent things, he should never make the error of assuming that they could be naturally preferred.

For Zeno, the chief good was to live according to Nature; for Aristo, the chief good was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to live in perfect indifference to all those things that are of an intermediate character between virtue and vice; making not the slightest difference between them, but regarding them all on a footing of equality. For that the wise man resembles a good actor; who, whether he is filling the part of [[Agamemnon]] or [[Thersites]], will perform them both equally well.&lt;ref name="diog160"&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The highest good is thus to follow virtue as the supreme good, avoid vice as the supreme evil, and to live in a state of perfect indifference towards everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', 94. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristo did, however, agree with Zeno on the unity of virtue, even if it is often labelled as different things:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristo made virtue one thing in its essence, and called it health; but in what it is somehow related to, he made the virtues differentiated and plural, just as if one wanted to call our vision in grasping light-colored things light-sight, but dark-sight in grasping dark-colored ones.  For virtue in considering things to be done and not to be done is called wisdom, but it is called temperance in bringing order to our appetites and defining what is measured and timely in pleasures, and justice in busying itself with joint enterprises and contracts with other people.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch - ''On Moral Virtue'', 440e-441a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The problem remains of how one can achieve a virtuous state if one can not make rational choices between which things in life are preferred and dispreferred and has only an abstract goal of perfect virtue.  Aristo left the question unanswered, and [[Cicero]] writing in the first century BC gave what has been the standard view of Aristo's philosophy ever since:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For if we maintained that all things were absolutely indifferent, the whole of life would be thrown in confusion, as it is by Aristo, and no function or task could be found for wisdom, since there would be absolutely no distinction between the things that pertain to the conduct of life, and no choice need be exercised among them.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://www.molloy.edu/sophia/cicero/finibus3.htm ''De Finibus (On Ends)''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106030712/http://www.molloy.edu/sophia/cicero/finibus3.htm |date=January 6, 2009 }}, 3. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Whether or not this view is correct,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bénatouïl has, for example, argued that for Aristo, uniform indifference was the consequence of, rather than the path to achieving perfect virtue.  See the [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2007/2007-04-64.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2007.04.64]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristo clearly thought he was doing something more positive than playing the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] and trying to undermine the roots of the Stoic system:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He who has equipped himself for the whole of life does not need to be advised concerning each separate item, because he is now trained to meet his problem as a whole; for he knows not merely how he should live with his wife or his son, but how he should live aright.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', 94. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Aristo came to be regarded as a marginal figure in the history of Stoicism, but in his day, he was an important philosopher whose lectures drew large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eratosthenes]], who lived in Athens as a young man, claimed that Aristo and [[Arcesilaus]] were the two most important philosophers of his age.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1B1*.html ''Geography''], 1.2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  But it was the more moderate Zeno, not the radical Aristo, whose views would win out.  [[Chrysippus]], (head of the Stoic school from c. 232-c. 206 BC), systemized Stoicism along the lines set down by Zeno, and in doing so, was forced to repeatedly attack Aristo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To maintain that the only Good is Moral Worth is to do away with the care of one's health, the management of one's estate, participation in politics, the conduct of affairs, the duties of life; nay, to abandon that Moral Worth itself, which according to you is the be-all and the end-all of existence; objections that were urged most earnestly against Aristo by Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://www.molloy.edu/sophia/cicero/finibus4.htm ''De Finibus (On Ends)''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015175032/http://www.molloy.edu/sophia/cicero/finibus4.htm |date=October 15, 2008 }}, 4. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And yet, Aristo never quite went away, as can be seen by the repeated references to his views by later writers. By outlining a version of Stoicism rooted in Cynic philosophy, he provided fruitful food for thought for both the supporters and the opponents of Stoicism ever since.

The '''Association of Classical and Christian Schools''' ('''ACCS''') is an organization founded in 1994 to encourage the formation of [[Christian schools]] using a model of [[classical education movement|classical education]].  The association's website lists over 200 members schools. 

The [[classical Christian education]] movement was launched by the publication in 1991 of a book entitled ''[[Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning]]'' by [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Doug Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = Doug | title = Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-89107-583-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also the founder of one of the first classical Christian schools in [[Moscow, Idaho]], [http://www.logosschool.com Logos School].  The classical Christian education movement has also been influenced by ''Norms and Nobility'' by [[David V. Hicks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hicks | first = David | title = Norms and Nobility | publisher = University Press of America | location = Washington | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7618-1467-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [http://circeinstitute.org CiRCE Institute], founded by [[Andrew Kern]], which exists to promote classical Christian education.

Wilson himself had drawn inspiration from an earlier article published by [[Dorothy Sayers]] entitled "The Lost Tools of Learning" (1948). Sayers was a colleague of C.S. Lewis and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. In this article she derided modern education methods and called for a return to the ancient classical [[Trivium (education)|trivium]].

The {{Nihongo|'''''Bake-kujira'''''|化鯨||literally "ghost whale"}} is a [[myth]]ical Japanese ''[[yōkai]]'' ([[ghost]], phantom, or strange [[apparitional experience|apparition]]) from [[Japanese dialects#Eastern and Western Japanese|western Japan]].

It is supposedly a large ghostly skeleton [[whale]] and is said to be accompanied by strange birds and fish.

== Legends ==
In one story a fisherman tries to catch it with his harpoon but the harpoon sailed right through it and the Bake-kujira floated away. In other stories people say that the Bake-kujira brings a curse and general misfortune to the area where it is spotted.

'''Boleskine House''' ({{lang-gd|Taigh Both Fhleisginn}}) is a manor on the south-east side of [[Loch Ness]] in the Scottish Highlands. It is notable for having been the home of author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]], and [[Led Zeppelin]] guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]]. It suffered significant fire damage in December 2015.

Boleskine House is {{convert|21|mi|km}} south of [[Inverness]], on the opposite side of Loch Ness from the [[Meall Fuar-mhonaidh]], and halfway between the villages of [[Foyers]] and [[Inverfarigaig]].&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/house-of-the-unholy-1-700265|title=House of the unholy|work=The Scotsman|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/19/boleskin-bay-sale-satanism|title=For sale on Loch Ness: Aleister Crowley's centre of dark sorcery|first=Paul|last=Kelbie|work=The Guardian|date=19 April 2009|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area has a history of strange happenings long before Aleister Crowley moved in. The [[parish]] of Boleskine was formed in the 13th Century.&lt;ref name="4gen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southlochnessheritage.co.uk/BB%2028%20Sept%202004.pdf|title=Celebrating Four Generations|publisher=The Boleskine Bulletin|date=Autumn 2004|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Kirk]] and [[Cemetery|graveyard]] were built in the parish around this time. A succession of Ministers ran Boleskine Parish and would travel the area on horseback or on foot in all weather conditions. Minister Thomas Houston (1648-1705) was said to have had the task of hastily laying animated corpses back in their graves after a devious local wizard had raised the dead in Boleskine graveyard.&lt;ref name="4gen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spookyisles.com/2012/06/aleister-crowley-the-beast-of-boleskine/|title=Aleister Crowley, The Beast of Boleskine|publisher=|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boleskine House was built on the site of the [[kirk]], which, according to legend, caught fire during congregation and killed everyone inside.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2012|p=167}}&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt; The house was constructed in the 1760s by [[Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat|Colonel Archibald Fraser]] as a hunting lodge.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt;{{sfn|Redfern|2013|p=120}}&lt;ref name="inverness"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/Features/Profile/A-rock-legend-and-black-arts-figured-in-Malcolms-life-1327.htm|title=FA rock legend and black arts figured in Malcolm's life|first=Calum|last=Macleod|work=Inverness Courier|date=3 November 2006|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Archibald Fraser apparently chose the site specifically to irritate [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]] in retribution for his support of the English during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] as Lord Lovat's land surrounded the site of Boleskine.&lt;ref name="ledzep229"&gt;{{harvnb |Wall|2008| page=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original hunting lodge was expanded continuously by the Fraser family until c. 1830. All the rooms were situated on one floor, with 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, lounge, drawing room, and a library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-1849-boleskine-house-boleskine-and-abertarff|title=Boleskine House and Abertaff|publisher=|date=|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even a tunnel linking the house to the graveyard.&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;{{sfn|Redfern|2004|p=205}}

==Aleister Crowley's ownership (1899–1913)==
[[File:Aleister Crowley, Magus.png|thumb|right|upright|Crowley in ceremonial garb, 1912]]
Crowley purchased Boleskine House from the Fraser family in 1899. The House at that time was known as the Manor of Boleskine and Abertarff after the name of the local parish.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions. ''ibidem.''&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley believed the location was ideal to sequester himself to perform a series of operations known as the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, taken from a [[grimoire]] called ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds J, Grant K (eds), ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' Penguin 1979:184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Book of Abramelin]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Crowley, in his book ''The Confessions of Aleister Crowley'', in order to perform the operations "the first essential is a house in a more or less secluded situation. There should be a door opening to the north from the room of which you make your oratory. Outside this door, you construct a terrace covered with fine river sand. This ends in a 'lodge' where the spirits may congregate."&lt;ref name="Confession"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|first=Aleister|last=Crowley|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=1969|isbn= 0-80903-591-X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of this ritual is to invoke one's [[Guardian Angel]].&lt;ref name="Abramelin"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage|first=S.L|last=Macgregor Mathers|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1975|isbn=0-85030-255-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It requires at least 6 months of preparation, celibacy and abstinence from alcohol. However, it also includes the summoning of the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell, to bind them and remove their negative influences from the magician's life.&lt;ref name="Abramelin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Whilst Crowley was in the process of performing the lengthy ritual, he was called to Paris by the leader of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]]. According to legend, he never banished the demons he had summoned, leading to strange happenings occurring in and around Boleskine House.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrified BBC Call Exorcist To House Of Satan|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TERRIFIED+BBC+CALL+EXORCIST+TO+HOUSE+OF+SATAN%3B+Horror+after+insect...-a060956190|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley became infamous for stories of conducting [[black magic]] and various other rituals while residing at the house;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; one of his pseudonyms was "Lord Boleskine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aleister Crowley's Rites of Eleusis'|first=J. F.|last=Brown|journal=[[The Drama Review]]|volume=22|issue=2|year=1978|pages=3–26|jstor=1145199|doi=10.2307/1145199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sorcerer and His Apprentice: Aleister Crowley and the Magical Exploration of Edwardian Subjectivity|first=Alex|last=Owen|journal=[[Journal of British Studies]]|volume=36|issue=1|year=1997|pages=99–133|jstor=175904|doi=10.1086/386129}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lodge keeper, Hugh Gillies, suffered a number of personal tragedies, including the loss of two children.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Crowley later claimed that his experiments with black magic had simply got out of hand.{{sfn|Redfern|2004|p=205}}

Crowley described the house as a "long low building. I set apart the south-western half for my work. The largest room has a bow window and here I made my door and constructed the terrace and lodge. Inside the room I set up my oratory proper. This was a wooden structure, lined in part with the big mirrors which I brought from London."&lt;ref name="Confession" /&gt;

He left the property in 1913, moving to a modest cottage for sometime in [[Dennyloanhead]] near [[Falkirk]].

==1913–1970==
After the First World War, Hollywood actor [[George Raft]] was involved in a scandal selling shares for a pig farm supposedly built on the grounds of Boleskine - except the farm didn't exist.&lt;ref name="ledzep229"/&gt; After the Second World War the house was owned by a Major Edward Grant. In 1965, Grant committed suicide in Crowley's bedroom with a shotgun.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jimmyscots"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/jimmy-page-and-his-black-magic-highland-home-1-3975377|title=Jimmy Page and his black magic Highland home|first=Alison|last=Campsie|work=The Scotsman|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this a newly married couple moved into the house. The wife was blind, and after a month the man walked out, leaving the woman wandering around unable to see.&lt;ref name="ledzep232"&gt;{{harvnb |Wall|2008| page=232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 [[Kenneth Anger]], an experimental filmmaker with an interest in the occult, learned that the house was on the market and rented it for a few months.&lt;ref name="ledzep229" /&gt; When Jimmy Page heard about this, he bought the house in 1970.&lt;ref name="ledzep230"&gt;{{harvnb |Wall|2008| page=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jimmy Page's ownership (1970–1992)==
[[File:Jimmy Page 2008.jpg|thumb|lright|upright|Jimmy Page in 2008]]
Jimmy Page was a collector of Crowley memorabilia who "had read a lot of Crowley and&amp;nbsp;... was fascinated by his ideas".{{sfn|Case|2007|p=98}}{{sfn|Hoskyns|2012|p=xxvi}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cults and Cosmic Consciousness: Religious Vision in the American 1960s|first=Camille|last=Paglia|journal=[[Arion (journal)|Arion]]|series=3|volume=10|issue=3|year=2003|pages=57–111|jstor=20163901}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Page bought the house it was in a state of decay, but he felt it would be a good atmosphere in which to write songs.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2012|p=167}} However, after arranging for the house to be restored he spent little time at Boleskine, leaving things in the care of his friend Malcolm Dent (1944-2011).

When asked why he was chosen, Dent explained "Jimmy Page caught me at a time in my life when I wasn't doing a great deal and asked me to come up and run the place. I never did establish why he fixed on me."&lt;ref name="dentinver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/Features/Profile/A-rock-legend-and-black-arts-figured-in-Malcolms-life-1327.htm|title=A rock legend and black arts figured in Malcolm's life|work=|date=3 November 2006|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dent moved into the house "it was a wreck ... It had been more or less abandoned. There'd been at least one fire there, parts of the building were missing and it had been badly patched up. The grounds, which at one time had been very nicely laid out were gone to hell".&lt;ref name="dentinver" /&gt;

Although Dent was a sceptic of the paranormal he soon started to experience strange occurrences. After a few weeks, he heard strange rumblings from the hallway which stopped when he investigated, but resumed after he closed the bedroom door.  After researching the house he discovered the rumbling in the hall was supposedly the head of Lord Lovat, even though he was executed in London. Dent explains "above Boleskine there's a place called [[Errogie]] which is supposed to be the geographical centre of the Highlands. Boleskine was then the nearest consecrated ground to Errogie and it's thought his soul, or part of it, ended here."&lt;ref name="ledzep230" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dentinver" /&gt;

Dent also experienced the "most terrifying night of my life" at Boleskine.&lt;ref name="ledzep230" /&gt; He awoke one night to hear what sounded like a wild animal snorting and banging outside his bedroom door. It went on for some time and it wasn't until morning that Dent dared open the door, and there was nothing there. Dent added "whatever was there was pure evil."&lt;ref name="ledzep230" /&gt; Another friend who stayed at Boleskine awoke one night claiming she had been attacked by "some kind of devil".&lt;ref name="ledzep231"&gt;{{harvnb |Wall|2008| page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other occurrences, such as chairs switching places, doors slamming open and closed for no reason and carpets and rugs rolling up inexplicably, failed to deter Dent from staying.&lt;ref name="ledzep230" /&gt; Dent met his wife at Boleskine and raised his family there.

Although Jimmy Page never spent a great length of time there, he did everything he could to return the house to how it would have looked during Crowley's ownership.&lt;ref name="ledzep231" /&gt;  For example, he commissioned an artist, Charles Pace, to paint some Crowley-esque murals on the walls. These were based on the murals in Crowley's [[Abbey of Thelema]] in Sicily discovered by Kenneth Anger in 1955.&lt;ref name="ledzep231" /&gt;

==MacGillivray family (1992–2002)==
The house was put on the market for £250,000 in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Muir|first=Alan|title= Whole Lotta Cheek|publisher= Scottish Sun|page=5 |date=11 July 1991|language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased by Ronald and Annette MacGillivray in 1992.&lt;ref name="macg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/music/aleister-crowley-s-inverness-mansion-destroyed-by-fire-1-3983595|title=Aleister Crowley’s Inverness mansion destroyed by fire|work=The Scotsman|date=23 December 2015|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mrs. MacGillivray, when they bought the house it was in a very bad state.&lt;ref name="macg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="visittob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leshtal.com/2167-old-article/|title=A Visit to Boleskine|work=|date=26 February 2005|accessdate=10 May 2016}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacGillivrays "spent a lot of money stripping it back to the bare walls and re-roofing it. It had four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a huge drawing room, dining room, library and various smaller rooms".&lt;ref name="macg"/&gt; The house was then converted into a hotel.&lt;ref name="visittob"/&gt;

Ronald MacGillivray died in 2002.&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12139093.Ronald_MacGillivray//|title=Ronald MacGillivray|work=|date=18 February 2002|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to hate any reference to the house's dark past when it was home to Crowley.&lt;ref name="ron"/&gt;

When asked whether she had experienced any mysterious occurrences at Boleskine House, his wife states that she experienced— "absolutely none. I am a non-believer and didn't listen to all that rubbish. We had a great time there."&lt;ref name="macg" /&gt;

==Private ownership (2002–2015)==
Following Ronald MacGillivray's death, Boleskine House was put up for sale again.&lt;ref name="teleburn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/12067588/Former-home-of-most-evil-man-in-Britain-burns-down.html|title=Former Home of Most Evil Man in Britain burns Down|publisher=Telegraph|date=23 December 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Dutch owners, who have remained anonymous, converted the house back into a private residence and used it as a holiday home.&lt;ref name="nightmare"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/inverness/788749/fire-nightmare-before-christmas/|title=Owner "distraught" after Highland mansion gutted in blaze|publisher=Press and Journal|date=26 December 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a {{convert|1.9|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot on the former estate was put on the market for £176,000 with plans to build a three-bedroom log house. The sale also included {{convert|140|ft}} of foreshore on Loch Ness.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Conflagration (2015)==
At approximately 1:40&amp;nbsp;pm on 23 December 2015, a motorist on the [[A82 road]] reported flames and smoke coming from Boleskine House.&lt;ref name="macg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teleburn"/&gt; When fire crews attended, it is estimated up to 60 per cent of the building had already been incinerated, with flames rising up to {{convert|20|ft|0}} high. The fire reportedly started in the kitchen of the building.&lt;ref name="nightmare"/&gt; The firefighters concentrated on the west wing of the house, as the rest of the building had been severely damaged.&lt;ref name="BBCN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-35171061|title=Firefighters called to historic Boleskine House on Loch Ness|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2015-12-23|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The owner's partner and daughter had gone shopping and returned to find the house ablaze.&lt;ref name="nightmare"/&gt; The fire was thought to have started in the kitchen, however nobody was believed to be in the house at the time of the fire and there were no casualties.&lt;ref name="nightmare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCN"/&gt;

==Today==
The interior of the house was almost totally destroyed by the fire. Part of the roof and the outer walls survive, but the former owner, Mrs. MacGillivray, has said that since the extent of the damage is so bad it "is unlikely it will ever be rebuilt unless there is someone out there with an interest in the occult wanting to spend a lot of money."&lt;ref name="macg"/&gt; It is believed that the house was due to go on the market.&lt;ref name="macg"/&gt;

Boleskine House is a Category B [[listed building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boleskine House (Ref:1849)|url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:1849|website=Listed building report|publisher=Historic Scotland|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the adjacent stables and gate lodge.

==In literature==
Boleskine House is described and recognisable in [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'' where it is called "Skene". Crowley considered Maugham's book to be plagiarism and wrote an article under the name of Oliver Haddo (the name of a character taken from Maugham's book) for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' as a witty riposte. (For details, see Crowley's autobiography, ''Confessions'', listed above.)

'''The British Sikh Report''', ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਬ੍ਰਿਟਿਸ਼ ਸਿੱਖ ਰਿਪੋਰਟ) also known as the BSR, is an annual report launched in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] every year about [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikhs in the United Kingdom]]. The report is meant to assess the views of Sikhs living in the UK and to provide this information to the government, non-governmental organisations, companies and other groups. It is one of the largest projects to study the needs and wants of Sikhs in the UK.

An [[Indian religion]], Buddhism encompasses a variety of [[tradition]]s, [[belief]]s and [[spiritual practice]]s largely based on [[Original Teachings of the Buddha|original teachings]] attributed to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] and resulting [[Buddhist philosophy|interpreted philosophies]]. Buddhism originated in [[ancient India]] as a [[Sramana]] tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, spreading through much of [[Asia]]. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: [[Theravada]] ([[Pali]]: "The School of the Elders") and [[Mahayana]] ([[Sanskrit]]: "The Great Vehicle").

All Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming [[dukkha|suffering]] and the [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|cycle of death and rebirth]], either by the attainment of [[Nirvana]] or through the [[Bodhisattva|path of Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Gethin |1998|pp=27–28, 73–74}}{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC&amp;pg=PA392|date=2007|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=[[Ithaca, New York]]|isbn=978-1-55939-282-2|pages=392–93, 415|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]] vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation, the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various [[Buddhist texts]], and their specific teachings and practices.{{sfn|Williams|1998|pp=275ff}}{{sfn|Robinson |1998|p=xx}} Widely observed practices include taking [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dharma]] and the [[Sangha]], observance of [[Buddhist ethics|moral precepts]], [[Buddhist monasticism|monasticism]], [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], and the cultivation of the [[Paramitas]] (virtues).

[[Theravada]] Buddhism has a widespread following in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] and [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]]. Mahayana, which includes the traditions of [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], [[Zen]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]], [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] and [[Tiantai]] ([[Tendai]]), is found throughout [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asia]].

[[Vajrayana]], a body of teachings attributed to [[mahasiddha|Indian adepts]], may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism.&lt;ref name="White 2000 21"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=White |editor-first=David Gordon |year=2000 |page=21 |title=Tantra in Practice |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC&amp;pg=PA21| isbn=0-691-05779-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India, is practiced in the countries of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan region]], [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC&amp;pg=PA392|date=2007|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=[[Ithaca, New York]]|isbn=978-1-55939-282-2|pages=26–27|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kalmykia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Candles in the Dark: A New Spirit for a Plural World" by Barbara Sundberg Baudot, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Early texts have his personal name as "Gautama" or "Gotama" (Pali) without any mention of "Siddhārtha," ("Achieved the Goal") which appears to have been a kind of honorific title when it does appear. The details of Buddha's life are mentioned in many [[Early Buddhist Texts]] but are inconsistent, and his social background and life details are difficult to prove, the precise dates uncertain.{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=13–14}}{{Refn|group=note|Buddhist texts such as the [[Jataka tales]] of the Theravada Buddhist tradition, and early biographies such as the ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', the [[Lokottaravāda|Lokottaravādin]] ''[[Mahāvastu]]'', the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'', give different accounts about the life of the Buddha; many include stories of his many rebirths, and some add significant embellishments.{{sfn|Swearer|2004|p=177}}{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=15–24}} Keown and Prebish state, "In the past, modern scholars have generally accepted 486 or 483 BCE for this [Buddha's death], but the consensus is now that they rest on evidence which is too flimsy.{{Sfn|Keown|Prebish|2010|pp=105–106}} Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life.

The evidence of the early texts suggests that he was born as [[Siddhārtha Gautama]] in [[Lumbini]] and grew up in Kapilavasthu,{{refn|group=note|The exact identity of this ancient place is unclear. Please see [[Gautama Buddha]] article for various sites identified.}} a town in the plains region of the modern Nepal-India border, and that he spent his life in what is now modern [[Bihar]]{{Refn|group=note|Bihar is derived from ''Vihara'', which means monastery.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=49}}}} and [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=49}}{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=13–14}} Some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini gardens.&lt;ref name="Thomas2013p16"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward J.

For example, Buddhist texts assert that Buddha described himself as a ''kshatriya'' (warrior class), but states Gombrich, little is known about his father and there is no proof that his father even knew the term ''kshatriya''.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=50}} Mahavira, whose teachings helped establish another major ancient religion [[Jainism]], is also claimed to be ''ksatriya'' by his early followers. Further, early texts of both Jainism and Buddhism suggest they emerged in a period of urbanization in ancient India, one with city nobles and prospering urban centres, states, agricultural surplus, trade and introduction of money.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=50–51}}}} Some of the stories about Buddha, his life, his teachings, and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=18–19, 50–51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurt Tropper |title=Tibetan Inscriptions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKFbFXQSqqUC |year=2013|publisher=Brill Academic |isbn=978-90-04-25241-7 |pages=60–61 with footnotes 134–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le grand départ.jpg|thumb|right|alt=stone relief sculpture of horse and men |"The Great Departure", relic depicting Gautama leaving home, first or second century ([[Guimet Museum|Musée Guimet]])]]
According to the Buddhist sutras, Gautama was moved by the innate suffering of humanity and its [[Samsara|endless repetition]] due to rebirth. He set out on a quest to end this repeated suffering. Early Buddhist canonical texts and early biographies of Gautama state that Gautama first studied under [[Vedas|Vedic]] teachers, namely Alara Kalama (Sanskrit: Arada Kalama) and Uddaka Ramaputta (Sanskrit: Udraka Ramaputra), learning meditation and ancient philosophies, particularly the concept of "nothingness, emptiness" from the former, and "what is neither seen nor unseen" from the latter.&lt;ref name="Wynne2007p8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Wynne |title=The Origin of Buddhist Meditation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZ9AgAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-09740-1 |pages=8–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura |title=Gotama Buddha: A Biography Based on the Most Reliable Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nt8QAQAAIAAJ |year=2000|publisher=Kosei |isbn=978-4-333-01893-2 |pages=127–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Doubts about the historicity of these claims in early Buddhist texts have emerged in modern scholarship because later Buddhist texts do not mention that Buddha learnt these concepts from more ancient teachers.&lt;ref name="Wynne2007p8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-811-5 |pages=19–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Wynne, the evidence suggests that Buddha studied under various teachers and they "almost certainly" taught him, but the details of his education are unclear.&lt;ref name="Wynne2007p8"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hirakawa|Groner|1993|pp=22–26}}}}

Finding these teachings to be insufficient to attain his goal, he turned to the practice of [[asceticism]]. This too fell short of attaining his goal, and then he turned to the practice of ''dhyana'', meditation, which he had already discovered in his youth. He famously sat in [[meditation]] under a ''[[Ficus religiosa]]'' tree now called the [[Bodhi Tree]] in the town of [[Bodh Gaya]] in the Gangetic plains region of South Asia. He gained insight into the workings of karma and his former lives, and attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]], certainty about the [[Middle Way]] (Skt. ''madhyamā-pratipad''){{sfn|Kohn|1991|p=143}} as the right path of spiritual practice to end suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') from rebirths in [[Saṃsāra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaX58-E5-3MC |year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-20140-8 |pages=233–237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a [[Buddhahood#Samyaksambuddha|fully enlightened Buddha]] (Skt. ''{{IAST|samyaksaṃbuddha}}''), he attracted followers and founded a ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]'' (monastic order).{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=49–51}} Now, as the Buddha, he spent the rest of his life teaching the [[Dharma]] he had discovered, and [[Parinirvana|died]] at the age of 80 in [[Kushinagar]], India.{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=267}}{{Sfn|Keown|Prebish|2010|pp=105–106}}

The truth of ''[[dukkha]]'' is the basic insight that life in this mundane world, with its clinging and craving to [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|impermanent states and things]]{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}} is ''dukkha'', and unsatisfactory.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74–75}}{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=147}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths" /&gt; ''Dukkha'' can be translated as "incapable of satisfying,"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm Ajahn Sumedho, ''The First Noble Truth''] (nb: links to index-page; click "The First Noble Truth" for correct page.&lt;/ref&gt; "the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|conditioned phenomena]]"; or "painful."{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}} ''Dukkha'' is most commonly translated as "suffering," but this is inaccurate, since it refers not to episodic suffering, but to the intrinsically unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences.{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=46}}{{Refn|group=note|As opposite to ''sukha'', "pleasure," it is better translated as "pain."{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|pp=26–31}}}} We expect happiness from states and things which are impermanent, and therefore cannot attain real happiness.

In Buddhism, dukkha is one of the [[three marks of existence]], along with [[impermanence]] and [[anattā]] (non-self).{{Sfn| Gombrich|2006|p=47, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."}} Buddhism, like other major Indian religions, asserts that everything is impermanent (anicca), but, unlike them, also asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in living beings (''anattā'').&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br /&gt;[b] Gombrich (2006), p. 47, '''Quote:''' "(...)

''Dukkha'' [[Samudaya sacca|arises]] when we crave (Pali: ''[[tanha]]'') and cling to these changing phenomena. The clinging and craving produces [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]], which ties us to samsara, the round of death and rebirth.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=loc. 791–809}}&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1&gt;[http://www.beyondthenet.net/dhamma/fourNoble.htm ''The Four Noble Truths'' – By Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|This explanation is more common in commentaries on the Four Noble Truths within the [[Theravada]] tradition: e.g. Ajahn Sucitta (2010); Ajahn Sumedho (ebook); Rahula (1974); etc.}} Craving includes ''kama-tanha'', craving for sense-pleasures; ''[[bhava]]-tanha'', craving to continue the cycle of life and death, including rebirth; and ''vibhava-tanha'', craving to not experience the world and painful feelings.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=loc. 791–809}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=70}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle loc. 943–946}}

''Dukkha'' ceases, or can be confined,{{sfn|Brazier|2001}} when craving and clinging cease or are confined. This also means that no more karma is being produced, and rebirth ends.&lt;!--** START OF NOTE ("NIRODHA") **--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Nirodha"|Ending rebirth:&lt;br /&gt;* Graham Harvey: "The Third Noble Truth is nirvana.

Makransky: "The third noble truth, cessation (''nirodha'') or nirvana, represented the ultimate aim of Buddhist practice in the Abhidharma traditions: the state free from the conditions that created samsara. Nirvana was the ultimate and final state attained when the supramundane yogic path had been completed. It represented salvation from samsara precisely because it was understood to comprise a state of complete freedom from the chain of samsaric causes and conditions, i.e., precisely because it was unconditioned (''asamskrta'')."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;br /&gt;* Walpola Rahula: "Let us consider a few definitions and descriptions of Nirvana as found in the original Pali texts [...] 'It is the complete cessation of that very thirst (tanha), giving it up, renouncing it, emancipation from it, detachment from it.'

By following the Buddhist path to ''[[moksha]]'', liberation,{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=136}} one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things.

====Saṃsāra====
{{Main|Saṃsāra (Buddhism)}}
''Saṃsāra'' means "wandering" or "world", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change.{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}}{{Sfn|Juergensmeyer|Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} It refers to the theory of rebirth and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence", a fundamental assumption of Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions.{{Sfn|Juergensmeyer|Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=58, '''Quote:''' "Buddhism shares with Hinduism the doctrine of Samsara, whereby all beings pass through an unceasing cycle of birth, death and rebirth until they find a means of liberation from the cycle. However, Buddhism differs from Hinduism in rejecting the assertion that every human being possesses a changeless soul which constitutes his or her ultimate identity, and which transmigrates from one incarnation to the next.}} Samsara in Buddhism is considered to be ''[[dukkha]]'', unsatisfactory and painful,{{sfn|Wilson|2010}} perpetuated by desire and ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]'' (ignorance), and the resulting [[karma]].{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|McClelland|2010|pp=172, 240}}{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|pp=18–19, chapter 1}}

The theory of rebirths, and realms in which these rebirths can occur, is extensively developed in Buddhism, in particular Tibetan Buddhism with its wheel of existence (''Bhavacakra'') doctrine.{{Sfn|Wilson|2010}} Liberation from this cycle of existence, ''nirvana'', has been the foundation and the most important historical justification of Buddhism.{{Sfn|Conze|2013|p=71, '''Quote:''' "Nirvana is the ''raison d'être'' of Buddhism, and its ultimate justification."}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}

The later Buddhist texts assert that rebirth can occur in six realms of existence, namely three good realms (heavenly, demi-god, human) and three evil realms (animal, hungry ghosts, hellish).{{refn|group=note|name=realms2|Earlier Buddhist texts refer to five realms rather than six realms; when described as five realms, the god realm and demi-god realm constitute a single realm.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|pp=711–712}}}} Samsara ends if a person attains [[nirvana]], the "blowing out" of the desires and the gaining of true insight into [[impermanence]] and [[anatta|non-self]] reality.{{sfn|Buswell|Gimello|1992|pp=7–8, 83–84}}{{sfn|Choong|1999|pp=28–29, Quote: "Seeing (''passati'') the nature of things as impermanent leads to the removal of the view of self, and so to the realisation of nirvana."}}{{sfn|Rahula|2014|pp=51-58}}

Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient life]], each running from conception to death.{{sfn|Keown|1996|p=107}} In Buddhist thought, this rebirth does not involve any soul, because of its doctrine of [[anatta|anattā]] (Sanskrit: ''anātman'', no-self doctrine) which rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Leaman2002p23"&gt;{{cite book|author= Oliver Leaman|title= Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vK-GAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-68919-4 |pages=23–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self in any being or any essence in any thing.&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|page=51 }}, '''Quote:''' "(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality.

====Karma====
{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}
[[Karma in Buddhism|In Buddhism]], [[karma]] (from [[Sanskrit]]: "action, work") drives [[saṃsāra]] – the endless cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being. Good, skilful deeds (Pali: "kusala") and bad, unskilful deeds (Pāli: "akusala") produce "seeds" in the unconscious receptacle (''ālaya'') that mature later either in this life or in a subsequent [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=131, 32–34}}{{sfn|Kasulis |2006|pp=1–12}} The existence of karma is a core belief in Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions, it implies neither fatalism nor that everything that happens to a person is caused by karma.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=40–41}}{{Refn|group=note|Diseases and suffering induced by the disruptive actions of other people are examples of non-karma suffering.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=40–41}}}}

A central aspect of Buddhist theory of karma is that intent ([[cetanā]]) matters and is essential to bring about a consequence or ''[[phala]]'' "fruit" or [[vipāka]] "result".{{sfn|Krishan|1997|pages=59–78 }}{{Refn|group=note|The emphasis on intent in Buddhism marks its difference from the karma theory of Jainism where karma accumulates with or without intent.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=40}}{{sfn|Krishan|1997|pp=47, 55 }} The emphasis on intent is also found in Hinduism, and Buddhism may have influenced karma theories of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C.

While Buddhism considers the liberation from [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]] as the ultimate spiritual goal, in traditional practice, the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists has been to seek and accumulate merit through good deeds, donations to monks and various Buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael D.

While the Noble Eightfold Path is best-known in the west, a wide variety of practices and stages have been used and described in the Buddhist traditions. Basic practices include ''sila'' (ethics), ''samadhi'' (meditation, ''dhyana'') and ''prajna'' (wisdom), as described in the Noble Eightfold Path. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. [[Buddhist devotion|Devotion]] is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualizations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded differently in the various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance.

===Refuge in the Three Jewels===

{{Main|Refuge (Buddhism)|Three Jewels}}

Traditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking Three Refuges, also called the Three Jewels ([[Sanskrit]]: ''triratna'', [[Pali]]: ''tiratana'') as the foundation of one's religious practice.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=249}} Pali texts employ the [[Hinduism|Brahmanical]] motif of the triple refuge, found in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' 9.97.47, ''Rigveda'' 6.46.9 and ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' 2.22.3–4.{{sfn|Shults|2014|p=108}} Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the ''[[lama]]''. The three refuges are believed by Buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=249}}

The Three Jewels are:{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=244–245}}
* The [[Gautama|Gautama Buddha]], the historical Buddha, the Blessed One, the Awakened with true knowledge
* The [[Dharma]], the precepts, the practice, the Four Truths, the Eightfold Path
* The [[Sangha]], order of monks, the community of Buddha's disciples

Reciting the three refuges is considered in Buddhism not as a place to hide, rather a thought that purifies, uplifts and strengthens.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=244–245}}

===The Buddhist path===

====Theravada – Noble Eightfold Path====
[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=ship's wheel with eight spokes represents the Noble Eightfold Path|The ''[[Dharmachakra]]'' represents the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].]]
{{Main|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist Paths to liberation}}

An important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the [[Middle Way]] (''madhyamapratipad''). It was a part of Buddha's first sermon, where he presented the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] that was a 'middle way' between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=23, 81}}{{Sfn|Keown|1996|pp=24, 59}} In Buddhism, states Harvey, the doctrine of "dependent arising" (conditioned arising, ''pratītyasamutpāda'') to explain rebirth is viewed as the 'middle way' between the doctrines that a being has a "permanent soul" involved in rebirth (eternalism) and "death is final and there is no rebirth" (annihilationism).{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=72}}{{Sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=49, ''antagrahadrsti''}}

In the Theravada canon, the Pali-suttas, various often irreconcilable sequences can be found. According to Carol Anderson, the Theravada canon lacks "an overriding and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=131}} Nevertheless, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], or "Eightfold Path of the Noble Ones", has become an important description of the Buddhist path. It consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when developed together, lead to the cessation of [[dukkha]].{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=87–88}} These eight factors are: Right View (or Right Understanding), Right Intention (or Right Thought), Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.

This Eightfold Path is the fourth of the [[Four Noble Truths]], and asserts the path to the cessation of ''dukkha'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=81–83}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64–65}} The path teaches that the way of the enlightened ones stopped their craving, clinging and [[karma|karmic]] accumulations, and thus ended their endless cycles of rebirth and suffering.{{Sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=253–255 }}{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|pp=1–13}}{{Sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|p=52}}

The Noble Eightfold Path is grouped into [[Three disciplines of Buddhism|three basic divisions]], as follows:{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=12–13}}{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=83–85}}{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|pp=47–48}}

====Mahayana – Bodhisattva-path and the six paramitas====

[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a [[Bodhisattva]].{{Sfn|Nattier |2003|pp=137–138, 142–146}} A ''Bodhisattva'' refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood.{{sfn|Gyatso|1995|p=1}} The term ''Mahāyāna'' was originally a synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'' or "Bodhisattva Vehicle."{{sfn|Nattier|2003|p=174}}{{sfn|Hirakawa|Groner |1993|p=297}}{{sfn|Conze|2001|p=2001}}

In the earliest texts of Mahayana Buddhism, the path of a bodhisattva was to awaken the ''bodhicitta''.{{Sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=99}} Between the 1st and 3rd century CE, this tradition introduced the ''Ten Bhumi'' doctrine, which means ten levels or stages of awakening.{{Sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|p=99}} This development was followed by the acceptance that it is impossible to achieve Buddhahood in one (current) lifetime, and the best goal is not nirvana for oneself, but Buddhahood after climbing through the ten levels during multiple rebirths.{{Sfn|Nattier |2003|pp= 142–152}} Mahayana scholars then outlined an elaborate path, for monks and laypeople, and the path includes the vow to help teach Buddhist knowledge to other beings, so as to help them cross samsara and liberate themselves, once one reaches the Buddhahood in a future rebirth.{{Sfn|Nattier |2003|pp=137–138, 142–146}} One part of this path are the ''[[Pāramitā]]'' (perfections, to cross over), derived from the ''Jatakas'' tales of Buddha's numerous rebirths.{{Sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|pp=101–102}}{{Sfn|Buswell|2004|pp=631–632}}

The Mahayana texts are inconsistent in their discussion of the ''Paramitas'', and some texts include lists of two, others four, six, ten and fifty-two.{{Sfn|Nattier |2003|pp= 151–154}}{{Sfn|Keown|2003|p=212}}&lt;ref name="Ichimura2001p28"/&gt; The six paramitas have been most studied, and these are:{{Sfn|Robinson|Johnson|1997|pp=101–102}}&lt;ref name="Ichimura2001p28"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shōhei Ichimura |title=Buddhist Critical Spirituality: Prajñā and Śūnyatā |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTW6XNxOxbkC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1798-2 |pages=28–29 with footnotes 56, 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gyatso|1995|pp=4–12}}

In Mahayana Sutras that include ten ''Paramitas'', the additional four perfections are "skillful means, vow, power and knowledge".{{Sfn|Keown|2003|p=212}} The most discussed ''Paramita'' and the highest rated perfection in Mahayana texts is the "Prajna-paramita", or the "perfection of insight".{{Sfn|Keown|2003|p=212}} This insight in the Mahayana tradition, states Shōhei Ichimura, has been the "insight of non-duality or the absence of reality in all things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shōhei Ichimura |title=Buddhist Critical Spirituality: Prajñā and Śūnyatā |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTW6XNxOxbkC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1798-2 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson |title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRp-AixBLKUC |year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-3778-8|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Śīla'' (Sanskrit) or ''sīla'' (Pāli) is the concept of "moral virtues", that is the second group and an integral part of the Noble Eightfold Path.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=83–84}} It consists of right speech, right action and right livelihood.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=83–84}}

''Śīla'' appear as ethical precepts for both lay and ordained Buddhist devotees. It includes the Five Precepts for laypeople, Eight or Ten Precepts for monastic life, as well as rules of Dhamma (''Vinaya'' or ''Patimokkha'') adopted by a monastery.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"/&gt;{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–193}}

==== Precepts ====
{{main|Five precepts}}
Buddhist scriptures explain the five precepts ({{lang-pi|italic=yes|pañcasīla}}; {{lang-sa|italic=yes|pañcaśīla}}) as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality.{{sfn |Gowans |2013 |page=440}} It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the [[Patimokkha|monastic rules]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodman |first1=Charles |title=Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708233552/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-date=8 July 2010 |dead-url=no |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]] |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five precepts apply to both male and female devotees, and these are:&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |pages=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |page=387 with footnote 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Abstain from killing ([[Ahimsa#Buddhism|Ahimsa]]);
# Abstain from stealing;
# Abstain from sensual (including sexual) misconduct;
# Abstain from lying;
# Abstain from intoxicants.

Undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}).{{sfn|Keown|2013 |page=616}} The [[Pali Canon]] recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pages=33, 71 }} Compassion and a belief in [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic retribution]] form the foundation of the precepts.{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=241 }}{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=276}} Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} They are sometimes referred to as the ''[[śrāvakayāna]] precepts'' in the [[Mahāyāna]] tradition, contrasting them with the [[bodhisattva Precepts|''bodhisattva'' precepts]].{{sfn |Funayama|2004 |page=105}}

The five precepts are not commandments and transgressions do not invite religious sanctions, but their power has been based on the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in the afterlife. Killing in Buddhist belief leads to rebirth in the hell realms, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Adultery, similarly, invites a rebirth as prostitute or in hell, depending on whether the partner was unmarried or married.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} Within the Buddhist doctrine, the precepts are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}


The monastic life in Buddhism has additional precepts as part of ''patimokkha'', and unlike lay people, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion from ''sangha'' follows any instance of killing, engaging in sexual intercourse, theft or false claims about one's knowledge. Temporary expulsion follows a lesser offence.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} The sanctions vary per monastic fraternity (''nikaya'').{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=192–193}}

Lay people and novices in many Buddhist fraternities also uphold eight (''asta shila'') or ten (''das shila'') from time to time. Four of these are same as for the lay devotee: no killing, no stealing, no lying, and no intoxicants.&lt;ref name=gombrichpreceptsp76/&gt; The other four precepts are:{{sfn|Morgan|2007|pp=62–63}}&lt;ref name=gombrichpreceptsp76&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich |title=Buddhist Precept &amp; Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqp4LuZQnHsC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-15623-6 |pages=76–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# No sexual activity;
# Abstain from eating at the wrong time (e.g. only eat solid food before noon);
# Abstain from jewellery, perfume, adornment, entertainment;
# Abstain from sleeping on high beds. This, states Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]], means to sleep on a mat on the ground.

All eight precepts are sometimes observed by lay people on ''[[uposatha]]'' days: full moon, new moon , the first and last quarter following the lunar calendar.&lt;ref name=gombrichpreceptsp76/&gt; The ten precepts also include to abstain from accepting money.&lt;ref name=gombrichpreceptsp76 /&gt;

In addition to these precepts, Buddhist monasteries have hundreds of rules of conduct, which are a part of its ''patimokkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Orzech |author2=Henrik Sørensen |author3=Richard Payne |title=Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0XNX3N1a2AC |year=2011|publisher=Brill Academic |isbn=90-04-18491-0 |pages=1013–1014, 1019–1020 }}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/dasasila.html The Ten Precepts], Dasa Sila, The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volume I, Thanissaro Bhikkhu&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|The hundreds of rules vary by the ''sangha''; 11th-century Chinese monastic texts include rules such as only reciting the [[buddhavacana|Buddha's Word]] alone, not near commonplace people; not eating prohibited foods such as meat, fish, cheese, onions, garlic, animal fat; abstain from anything that can lead to sensual thoughts; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yifa (Translator)|author2=Zongze Chanyuan Qinggui |title=The Origins of Buddhist Monastic Codes in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91OPcSUTFQ0C |year=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-2494-5 |pages=114–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Vinaya====
[[File:Chinese Buddhist Monks Ceremony Hangzhou.jpeg|thumb|alt=Buddhist monks in saffron robes standing performing a ceremony in Hangzhou, China|Monks performing a ceremony in [[Hangzhou]], China]]

[[Vinaya]] is the specific code of conduct for a ''sangha'' of monks or nuns. It includes the [[Patimokkha]], a set of 227 offences including 75 rules of decorum for monks, along with penalties for transgression, in the Theravadin tradition.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=109}} The precise content of the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'' (scriptures on the Vinaya) differs in different schools and tradition, and different monasteries set their own standards on its implementation. The list of ''pattimokkha'' is recited every fortnight in a ritual gathering of all monks.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=109}} Buddhist text with vinaya rules for monasteries have been traced in all Buddhist traditions, with the oldest surviving being the ancient Chinese translations.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=93}}

Monastic communities in the Buddhist tradition cut normal social ties to family and community, and live as "islands unto themselves".{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=89–92}} Within a monastic fraternity, a ''sangha'' has its own rules.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=89–92}} A monk abides by these institutionalized rules, and living life as the vinaya prescribes it is not merely a means, but very nearly the end in itself.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=89–92}} Transgressions by a monk on ''Sangha'' vinaya rules invites enforcement, which can include temporary or permanent expulsion.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=101–107}}

===''Samadhi'' (''dhyana'') – meditation===
[[File:Rank celebration of Thai Buddhist monk 1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Bhikkhus in saffron robes kneeling in Thailand|[[Bhikkhu]]s in Thailand]]
{{Main|Buddhist meditation|Samadhi|Samatha|Rupajhana}}

A wide range of meditation practices has developed in the Buddhist traditions, but "meditation" primarily refers to the practice of ''dhyana'' c.q. ''jhana''. It is a practice in which the attention of the mind is first narrowed to the focus on one specific object, such as the breath, a concrete object, or a specific thought, mental image or mantra. After this initial focussing of the mind, the focus is coupled to mindfulness, maintaining a calm mind while being aware of one's surroundings.{{sfn|Gombrich|2007}} The practice of ''dhyana'' aids in maintaining a calm mind, and avoiding disturbance of this calm mind by mindfulness of disturbing thoughts and feelings.{{sfn|Williams|2000|pp=45-46}}{{refn|group=note|Williams refers to Frauwallner (1973) p.155}}

====Origins====
The earliest evidence of yogis and their meditative tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the [[Keśin]] hymn 10.136 of the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=karelwernerkesinrv&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karel |last=Werner |date=1977 |title=Yoga and the Ṛg Veda: An Interpretation of the Keśin Hymn (RV 10, 136) |work=Religious Studies |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=289–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; While evidence suggests [[meditation]] was practised in the centuries preceding the Buddha,{{sfn|Carrithers|1986|p=30}} the meditative methodologies described in the Buddhist texts are some of the earliest among texts that have survived into the modern era.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|p=44}}{{sfn|Miller|1996|p=8}} These methodologies likely incorporate what existed before the Buddha as well as those first developed within Buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=1–17}}{{Refn|group=note|Many ancient [[Upanishad]]s of Hinduism describe [[yoga]] and meditation as a means to liberation.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=199}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark Singleton (2010), Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-539534-1}}, pp. 25–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =White|first =David Gordon|title =Yoga, Brief History of an Idea |year =2011| publisher =Princeton University Press|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Bronkhorst, the ''Four Dhyanas'' was a Buddhist invention.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99}} Bronkhorst notes that the Buddhist canon has a mass of contradictory statements, little is known about their relative chronology, and "there can be no doubt that the canon – including the older parts, the Sutra and Vinaya Pitaka – was composed over a long period of time".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=xvii}} Meditative practices were incorporated from other [[Śramaṇa|sramanic]] movements;{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} the Buddhist texts describe how Buddha learnt the practice of the formless dhyana from Brahmanical practices, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|pp=50–56}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=24}} The Buddhist canon also describes and criticizes alternative dhyana practices, which likely mean the pre-existing mainstream meditation practices of Jainism and Hinduism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=xvii, Part I: 1–3, 10–11, 24, Part II: 20–28}}

Buddha added a new focus and interpretation, particularly through the Four Dhyanas methodology,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=Part I: page 5}} in which mindfulness is maintained.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2007}} Further, the focus of meditation and the underlying theory of liberation guiding the meditation has been different in Buddhism.{{sfn|Carrithers|1986|p=30}}{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}} For example, states Bronkhorst, the verse 4.4.23 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with its "become calm, subdued, quiet, patiently enduring, concentrated, one sees soul in oneself" is most probably a meditative state.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=Chapter 9, page 86}} The Buddhist discussion of meditation is without the concept of soul and the discussion criticizes both the ascetic meditation of Jainism and the "real self, soul" meditation of Hinduism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=Chapter 8 page 74; Conclusion, page 102}}

[[File:Buddhist Monuments in the Horyu-ji Area-122502.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monuments in the [[Buddhist Monuments in the Hōryū-ji Area|Horyu-ji Area]]]]
For Nirvana, Buddhist texts teach various meditation methodologies, of which ''rupa-jhana'' (four meditations in the realm of form) and ''arupa-jhana'' (four meditations in the formless realm) have been the most studied.&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p81"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |date=1984 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=81–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are described in the Pali Canon as trance-like states in the world of desirelessness.&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title=Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=80–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four dhyanas under ''rupa-jhanas'' are:&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p80"/&gt;
# First dhyana: detach from all sensory desires and sinful states that are a source of unwholesome karma. Success here is described in Buddhist texts as leading to discursive thinking, deliberation, detachment, ''sukha'' (pleasure) and ''priti'' (rapture).&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p81"/&gt;{{Refn|group=note|The state is described in a number of additional characteristics in different Buddhist texts. For example, success in the First Dhyana leads to a gem-like outer light emanating from the body, according to ''Samahitabhumi'' by Asanga; the nature of emanating light from one's body changes as the meditation successfully progresses from the first to the fourth Dhyana.&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p81"/&gt;}}
# Second dhyana: cease deliberation and all discursive thoughts.&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p80"/&gt; Success leads to one-pointed thinking, serenity, pleasure and rapture.&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p81"/&gt;
# Third dhyana: lose feeling of rapture. Success leads to equanimity, mindfulness and pleasure, without rapture.&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p81"/&gt;

The ''arupa-jhanas'' (formless realm meditation) are also four, which are entered by those who have mastered the ''rupa-jhanas'' ([[Arhat]]s).&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |date=1984 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=86–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formless dhyana gets to infinite space without form or colour or shape, the second to infinity of perception base of the infinite space, the third formless dhyana transcends object-subject perception base, while the fourth is where he dwells in nothing-at-all where there are no feelings, no ideas, nor are there non-ideas, unto total cessation.&lt;ref name="Wayman1984p86"/&gt; The four ''rupa-dhyanas'' in Buddhist practice lead to rebirth in successfully better ''rupa'' Brahma heavenly realms, while ''arupa-dhyanas'' lead into arupa heavens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruno Petzold |title=The Classification of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZH29oiIuIkC |year=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-03373-2 |pages=502–503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis Hodous |author2=William E.

Richard Gombrich notes that the sequence of the four ''rupa-jhanas'' describes two different cognitive states. The first two describe a narrowing of attention, while in the third and fourth jhana attention is expanded again.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "I know this is controversial, but it seems to me that the third and fourth jhanas are thus quite unlike the second."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}}}&lt;ref&gt;Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Wynne further explains that the ''dhyana''-scheme is poorly understood.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as ''sati'', ''sampajāno'', and ''upekkhā'', are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}}{{refn|group=note|Wynne: "Thus the expression ''sato sampajāno'' in the third ''jhāna'' must denote a state of awareness different from the meditative absorption of the second ''jhāna'' (''cetaso ekodibhāva''). It suggests that the subject is doing something different from remaining in a meditative state, i.e., that he has come out of his absorption and is now once again aware of objects. The same is true of the word ''upek(k)hā'': it does not denote an abstract 'equanimity', [but] it means to be aware of something and indifferent to it [...] The third and fourth ''jhāna-s'', as it seems to me, describe the process of directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|pp=106-107}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gombrich, "the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}}}

The Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] (meditation, Pali ''jhāna'').{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} There is a tradition that stresses attaining [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (insight, [[bodhi]], [[kenshō]], [[vipassana]]) as the means to awakening and liberation.

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vihāra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to "living with Brahman" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as "living with Brahman" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|pp=84–85}} According to Gombrich, "the Buddha taught that kindness – what Christians tend to call love – was a way to salvation."{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}

====Visualizations: deities, mandalas====
{{See also|Generation stage|Mandala}}

[[File:Mandala zel-tary.jpg|thumb|Mandala are used in Buddhism for initiation ceremonies and visualization.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=88–89}}]]
Idols of deity and icons have been a part of the historic practice, and in Buddhist texts such as the 11th-century ''Sadanamala'', a devotee visualizes and identifies himself or herself with the imagined deity as part of meditation.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis Gomez|editor=Donald S. Lopez Jr. |title=Buddhism in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaC4CgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-8007-2 |pages=236–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly popular in Vajrayana meditative traditions, but also found in Mahayana and Theravada traditions, particularly in temples and with Buddha images.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=86–87}}

In Tibetan Buddhism tradition, mandala are mystical maps for the visualization process with cosmic symbolism.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=88–89}} There are numerous deities, each with a mandala, and they are used during initiation ceremonies and meditation.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=88–89}} The mandalas are concentric geometric shapes symbolizing layers of the external world, gates and sacred space. The meditation deity is in the centre, sometimes surrounded by protective gods and goddesses.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=88–89}} Visualizations with deities and mandalas in Buddhism is a tradition traceable to ancient times, and likely well established by the time the 5th-century text ''Visuddhimagga'' was composed.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=88–89}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ray Sarbacker |title=Samadhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZlhZLLb3PMC |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-8281-0 |pages=117–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Practice: monks, laity====
According to Peter Harvey, whenever Buddhism has been healthy, not only ordained but also more committed lay people have practised formal meditation.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=319}} Loud devotional chanting however, adds Harvey, has been the most prevalent Buddhist practice and considered a form of meditation that produces "energy, joy, lovingkindness and calm", purifies mind and benefits the chanter.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp= 243–244, 257–258, 318–319}}

Throughout most of Buddhist history, meditation has been primarily practised in Buddhist monastic tradition, and historical evidence suggests that serious meditation by lay people has been an exception.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2013|p=502}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Wilson|title=Mindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPD8AwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-938357-3|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Powers| title=The Buddhist World| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeuoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT787|year=2015| publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-42016-3| page=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent history, sustained meditation has been pursued by a minority of monks in Buddhist monasteries.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2013|pp=502–504}} Western interest in meditation has led to a revival where ancient Buddhist ideas and precepts are adapted to Western mores and interpreted liberally, presenting Buddhism as a meditation-based form of spirituality.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2013|pp=502–504}}

''Prajñā'' (Sanskrit) or ''paññā'' (Pāli) is insight or knowledge of the true nature of existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of ''dukkha'' and ''samsara''. By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the non-self nature of reality,{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn|Conze|2013|pp=39–40}} and this develops dispassion for the objects of [[upādāna|clinging]], and liberates a being from ''dukkha'' and ''saṃsāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler |title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC |year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=49–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|author2=Frank E.

The doctrines of no-self and impermanence are thus the keystones of ''dhammic'' order."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=73–75, 146–159, 243}} ''Prajñā'' is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the wisdom about the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self in anyone or anything, and dependent origination.{{Sfn|Buswell|2004|pp=664–665}}

====Origins====
The origins of "liberating insight" are unclear. Buddhist texts, states Bronkhorst, do not describe it explicitly, and the content of "liberating insight" is likely not original to Buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=74–75, section 8.4, Quote: These three points go a long way to show that the explicit descriptions of the content of liberating insight are not original to Buddhism, and were added under the influence of mainstream [Jainism, Hinduism] meditation.}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of "liberating insight" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for ''[[moksha]]'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54–55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation," that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54–55, 96, 99}}}}

Bronkhorst suggests that the conception of what exactly constituted "liberating insight" for Buddhists developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified as an insight, later on the Four Noble Truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=100–101}}
{{quote|Other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself"; "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas"; "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').
|Lambert Schmithausen{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

In the Pali Canon liberating insight is attained in the fourth dhyana.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102 section 8.4.3}} However, states Vetter, modern scholarship on the Pali Canon has uncovered a "whole series of inconsistencies in the transmission of the Buddha's word", and there are many conflicting versions of what constitutes higher knowledge and samadhi that leads to the liberation from rebirth and suffering.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxv}} Even within the Four Dhyana methodology of meditation, Vetter notes that "penetrating abstract truths and penetrating them successively does not seem possible in a state of mind which is without contemplation and reflection."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxvii}} According to Vetter, ''dhyāna'' itself constituted the original "liberating practice".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|name="Vetter-dhyana"}}

Carol Anderson notes that insight is often depicted in the Vinaya as the opening of the Dhamma eye, which sets one on the Buddhist path to liberation.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=131–167}}

====Theravada====

=====Vipassanā=====
{{Main|Vipassanā}}

In Theravada Buddhism, but also in Tibetan Buddhism, two types of meditation Buddhist practices are being followed, namely [[samatha]] (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''śamatha''; "calm") and vipassana (insight).{{sfn|Welch|1967|p=396}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theravada Buddhism?|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html|work=Access to Insight|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samatha is also called "calming meditation", and was adopted into Buddhism from pre-Buddha Indian traditions. ''Vipassanā'' meditation was added by Buddha, and refers to "insight meditation". Vipassana does not aim at peace and tranquillity, states Damien Keown, but "the generation of penetrating and critical insight (panna)".{{Sfn|Keown|1996|pp=106–107, context: Chapter 7}}

The focus of Vipassana meditation is to continuously and thoroughly know [[impermanence]] of everything (''annica''), [[anatta|no-Self]] in anything (''anatta'') and the ''dukkha'' teachings of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ba Khin|author2=Pierluigi Confalonieri |title=The Clock of Vipassana Has Struck |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXOsAAAAQBAJ |year=1999|publisher=Pariyatti |isbn=978-0-9649484-6-4 |pages=113–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George D. Chryssides |title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&amp;pg=PA36 |year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8108-6194-7 |pages=363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Theravada orthodoxy regards samatha as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation. In contrast, the Vipassana Movement argues that insight levels can be discerned without the need for developing samatha further due to the risks of going out of the course when strong samatha is developed.{{sfn|Bond|1992|p=167}}

=====Dependent arising=====
{{Main|Pratītyasamutpāda|Twelve Nidānas}}
''Pratityasamutpada'', also called "dependent arising, or dependent origination", is the Buddhist theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}} All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease.{{sfn|Bowker|1997}}

The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus ''Pratityasamutpada'' is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of [[ontology]], not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self ([[Brahman]]) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=64, Quote: In the ''Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta'' the Buddha [stresses] that things originate in dependence upon causal conditioning, and this emphasis on causality describes the central feature of Buddhist ontology. All elements of samsara exist in some sense or another relative to their causes and conditions.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Neville |editor=Jeremiah Hackett|others=Jerald Wallulis|title= Philosophy of Religion for a New Century: Essays in Honor of Eugene Thomas Long|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEER8fGxCfMC |year=2004|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-2073-5 |pages=257 }}, Quote: "[Buddhism's ontological hypotheses] that nothing in reality has its own-being and that all phenomena reduce to the relativities of pratitya samutpada. The Buddhist ontological hypothesese deny that there is any ontologically ultimate object such a God, Brahman, the Dao, or any transcendent creative source or principle."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddhist thought does not understand causality in terms of Newtonian mechanics, rather it understands it as conditioned arising.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=153–155}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Debrock |editor=Paul B. Scheurer|others=G. Debrock|title=Newton's Scientific and Philosophical Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y18yBwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-2809-1 |page=376 with note 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, dependent arising is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate a phenomenon within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of the realms of existence for another lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Genjun Sasaki |title=Linguistic Approach to Buddhist Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUBPAzlxJPUC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0038-0 |pages=67–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=151–152}}

Buddhism applies the dependent arising theory to explain origination of endless cycles of ''dukkha'' and rebirth, through its [[Twelve Nidānas]] or "twelve links" doctrine. It states that because [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Avidyā]] (ignorance) exists [[Saṅkhāra|Saṃskāras]] (karmic formations) exists, because Saṃskāras exists therefore [[Vijñāna]] (consciousness) exists, and in a similar manner it links [[Nāmarūpa]] (sentient body), [[Ṣaḍāyatana]] (six senses), [[Sparśa]] (sensory stimulation), [[Vedanā]] (feeling), [[Taṇhā]] (craving), [[Upādāna]] (grasping), [[Bhava]] (becoming), [[Jāti (Buddhism)|Jāti]] (birth), and [[Jarāmaraṇa]] (old age, death, sorrow, pain).{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=65–72}}{{Sfn| Emmanuel|2015|pp=51–66}}

By breaking the circuitous links of the Twelve Nidanas, Buddhism asserts that liberation from these endless cycles of rebirth and dukkha can be attained.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54, Quote: "The main concrete application of the abstract principle is in the form of a series of conditioned links (''nidanas''), culminating in the arising of dukkha." (...) "This [doctrine] states the principle of conditionality, that all things, mental and physical, arise and exist due to the presence of certain conditions, and cease once their conditions are removed: nothing (except ''Nibbana'') is independent.

=====Emptiness=====
{{Main|Śūnyatā|Madhyamaka}}

[[Śūnyatā]], or "emptiness", is a central concept in [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Madhyamaka]] school, and widely attested in the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] sutras. It brings together key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]], to refute the metaphysics of [[Sarvastivada]] and [[Sautrāntika]] (extinct non-Mahayana schools). Not only sentient beings are empty of [[Ātman (Buddhism)|ātman]]; all phenomena ([[dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]]) are without any [[svabhava]] (literally "own-nature" or "self-nature"), and thus without any underlying essence, and  "empty" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997|p=324}}

=====Representation-ony c.q. mind-only=====
{{Main|Yogachara|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra}}
Sarvastivada teachings, which were criticized by Nāgārjuna, were reformulated by scholars such as [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Asanga]] and were adapted into the [[Yogachara]] school. One of the main features of Yogācāra philosophy is the concept of ''vijñapti-mātra''. It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object to this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only'',{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}} while an alternative translation for ''citta'' (mind, thought) ''mātra'' (only, exclusively) has not been proposed.

While the Mādhyamaka school held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate, some later exponents of Yogachara asserted that the mind and only the mind is ultimately real (a doctrine known as ''cittamatra''). Vasubandhu and Asanga however did not assert that mind was truly existent, or the basis of all reality.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|last=Lusthaus |first=Dan |title=What is and isn't Yogacara |publisher= |url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331102337/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahayana metaphysics in the Indo-Tibetan tradition.

=====Buddha-nature=====
{{Main|Buddha-nature}}

Buddha-nature is a concept found in some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts, such as the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]''. This concept has been controversial in Buddhism, but has a following in East Asian Buddhism.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|pp=103–109, 161}}{{Sfn|Hookham|1991|pp=100–104}} These [[Sutra]]s suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core inner nature, Self'.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=104}}{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=107}}}} The ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine, at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and it contradicts the Anatta doctrine (non-Self) in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|pp=104–105, 108–109; '''Quote:''' "...&amp;nbsp;[The ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra''] refers to the Buddha using the term "Self" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}, '''Quote:''' "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddhist text ''Ratnagotravibhāga'' states that the "Self" implied in ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine is actually "not-Self".{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=112}}{{Sfn|Hookham|1991|p=96}}

Buddhism, like all Indian religions, was an oral tradition in ancient times.&lt;ref name="lopez2004busc1"/&gt; The Buddha's words, the early doctrines and concepts, and the interpretations were transmitted from one generation to the next by the word of mouth in monasteries, and not through written texts. The first Buddhist canonical texts were likely written down in Sri Lanka, about 400 years after the Buddha died.&lt;ref name="lopez2004busc1"/&gt; The texts were part of the ''Tripitakas'', and many versions appeared thereafter claiming to be the words of the Buddha. Scholarly Buddhist commentary texts, with named authors, appeared in India, around the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name="lopez2004busc1"/&gt; These texts were written in Pali or Sanskrit, sometimes regional languages, as [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s, birch bark, painted scrolls, carved into temple walls, and later on paper.&lt;ref name="lopez2004busc1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike what the [[Bible]] is to [[Christianity]] and the [[Quran]] is to [[Islam]], but like all major ancient Indian religions, there is no consensus among the different Buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="lopez2004busc1"/&gt; The general belief among Buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xii–xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|2008|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Eliot|1935|p=16}} This corpus includes the ancient ''Sutras'' organized into ''Nikayas'', itself the part of three basket of texts called the ''Tripitakas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xiii–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts of India. The Chinese Buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the Tibetan canon comprises 1108 texts — all claimed to have been spoken by the Buddha — and another 3461 texts composed by Indian scholars revered in the Tibetan tradition.&lt;ref name=lopez2004busc2&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist textual history is vast; over 40,000 manuscripts — mostly Buddhist, some non-Buddhist — were discovered in 1900 in the Dunhuang Chinese cave alone.&lt;ref name=lopez2004busc2/&gt;

===Pāli Tipitaka===
{{Main|Pāli Canon}}
{{PaliCanon|abbrev=1}}

The Pāli Tipitaka (Sanskrit: ''Tripiṭaka'', three pitakas), which means "three baskets", refers to the ''Vinaya Pitaka'', the ''Sutta Pitaka'', and the ''Abhidhamma Pitaka''. These constitute the oldest known canonical works of Buddhism. The ''[[Vinaya|Vinaya Pitaka]]'' contains disciplinary rules for the Buddhist monasteries. The ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'' contains words attributed to the Buddha. The ''[[Abhidhamma|Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'' contain expositions and commentaries on the Sutta, and these vary significantly between Buddhist schools.

The Pāli Tipitaka is the only surviving early Tipitaka. According to some sources, some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven pitakas.{{sfn|Skilling|1992|p=114}} Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically "Theravadin", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, it contains material at odds with later Theravadin orthodoxy. He states: "The Theravadins, then, may have ''added'' texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=9}}

===Theravada texts===
In addition to the Pali Canon, the important commentary texts of the Theravada tradition include the 5th-century ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' by [[Buddhaghosa]] of the Mahavihara school. It includes sections on shila (virtues), samadhi (concentration), panna (wisdom) as well as Theravada tradition's meditation methodology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Visuddhimagga Visuddhimagga], Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana sutras===
{{Main|Mahayana sutras}}
[[File:Korea-Haeinsa-Tripitaka Koreana-01.jpg|thumb|alt=Tripiṭaka Koreana in South Korea, over 81,000 wood printing blocks stored in racks|The [[Tripitaka Koreana|Tripiṭaka Koreana]] in South Korea, an edition of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] carved and preserved in over 81,000 wood printing blocks]]

The [[Mahayana sutras]] are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings (including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought){{sfn|Kalupahana|1966|pp=94–105}} and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha, and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding.

The Mahayana sutras often claim to articulate the Buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for those who follow the [[bodhisattva]] path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name ''Mahāyāna'' (lit., ''the Great Vehicle''). The Theravada school does not treat the Mahayana Sutras as authoritative or authentic teachings of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=karlpotter1996p26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Powers |title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC |year=2007|publisher=Snow Lion|isbn=978-1-55939-835-0|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, scholars conclude that the Mahayana scriptures were composed from the 1st century CE onwards: "Large numbers of Mahayana sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century".{{sfn|Buswell |2004|p=494}}

===Śālistamba Sutra===
{{Main|Salistamba Sutra}}
Many ancient Indian texts have not survived into the modern era, creating a challenge in establishing the historic commonalities between Theravada and Mahayana. The texts preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, with parallel Chinese translations, have provided a breakthrough. Among these is the Mahayana text ''Śālistamba Sutra'' which no longer exists in a Sanskrit version, but does in Tibetan and Chinese versions. This Mahayana text contains numerous sections which are remarkably the same as the Theravada Pali Canon and Nikaya Buddhism.&lt;ref name=karlpotter1996p26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N. Ross Reat|title=Buddhism: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4MEAAAAYAAJ |year=1994|publisher=Asian Humanities Press |isbn=978-0-87573-001-1 |page=30, for context: 25–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Śālistamba Sutra'' was cited by Mahayana scholars such as the 8th-century Yasomitra to be authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Sponberg |title=Maitreya, the Future Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pz6okTs7wdAC |year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-34344-2 |pages=68–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Buddhist literature of different traditions shared a common core of Buddhist texts in the early centuries of its history, until Mahayana literature diverged about and after the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name=karlpotter1996p26/&gt;

=====Tracing the oldest teachings=====
Information of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin Pāli Canon and other texts.{{refn|group=note|The surviving portions of the scriptures of [[Sarvastivada]], [[Mulasarvastivada]], [[Mahīśāsaka]], [[Dharmaguptaka]] and other schools,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{sfn|Warder|1999}} and the Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] and other surviving portions of other early canons.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}}} The reliability of these sources, and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxxvii}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1990}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{refn|group=note|Exemplary studies are the study on descriptions of "liberating insight" by Lambert Schmithausen,{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} the overview of early Buddhism by Tilmann Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} the philological work on the four truths by K.R. Norman,{{sfn|Norman|1992}} the textual studies by Richard Gombrich,{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} and the research on early meditation methods by Johannes Bronkhorst.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997}}}}

According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# "Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;"{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponents of the first position are [[A. K. Warder]]{{refn|group=subnote|According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out.{{sfn|Warder|1999}} According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder||1999|inside flap}}}} and [[Richard Gombrich]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=viii}}{{refn|group=subnote|Richard Gombrich: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius. By "the main edifice" I mean the collections of the main body of sermons, the four Nikāyas, and of the main body of monastic rules."{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}}}}}
# "Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"{{refn|group=note|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson.{{refn|group=subnote|Ronald Davidson: "While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historic Buddha."{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}}}
# "Cautious optimism in this respect."{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponents of the third position are J.W. de Jong,{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}{{refn|group=subnote|name="Jong"|J.W. De Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}}} Johannes Bronkhorst{{refn|group=subnote|Bronkhorst: "This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek nay find, even if no success is guaranteed."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=vii}}}} and Donald Lopez.{{refn|group=subnote|Lopez: "The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct."{{sfn|Lopez|1995|p=4}}}}}}

=====Core teachings=====
[[File:Buddhist Chakras at ASI Museum, Amaravathi.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Buddhist Chakras at ASI Museum, Amaravathi]]
According to Mitchell, certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, which has led most scholars to conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]], the [[three marks of existence]], the [[Skandha|five aggregates]], [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]], [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{sfn|Mitchell|2002|p=34}} Yet critical analysis reveals discrepancies, which point to alternative possibilities.{{sfn|Skorupski|1990|p=5}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|pp=4, 11}}{{sfn|Schopen|2002|pp=}}

Bruce Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka,{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} [[Lambert Schmithausen|Schmithausen]] has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology."{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|pp=206–207}}}} According to Vetter, "the Buddha at first sought "the deathless" (''amata/amrta''), which is concerned with the here and now. Only later did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}} [[Johannes Bronkhorst|Bronkhorst]] disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha "introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=16}} According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=14}}

Another core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} Schmithausen states that the four noble truths as "liberating insight", may be a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=77–78, Section 8.4.3}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5, Quote: [T]hey do not teach that one is released by knowing the four noble truths, but by practising the fourth noble truth, the eightfold path, which culminates in right samadhi}}

According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the [[Four Noble Truths]] became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=99–100, 102–111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhānas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} The four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Gotama's teachings may have been personal, "adjusted to the need of each person."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}

The [[three marks of existence]] – Dukkha, Annica, Anatta – may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. [[K. R. Norman|K.R. Norman]] supposes that these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to his hearers.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=26}} According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way".{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Similarly nibbāna is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, yet many other terms can be found throughout the Nikāyas, which are not specified.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xv}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: "I am especially thinking here of MN 26 (I p.163,32; 165,15; 166,35) ''kimkusalagavesi anuttaram santivarapadam pariyesamano'' (searching for that which is beneficial, seeking the unsurpassable, best place of peace) and again MN 26 (passim), ''anuttaramyagakkhemam nibbiinam pariyesati'' (he seeks the unsurpassable safe place, the nirvana). ''Anuppatta-sadattho'' (one who has reached the right goal) is also a vague positive expression in the Arhatformula in MN 35 (I p, 235), see chapter 2, footnote 3, Furthermore, ''satthi'' (welfare) is important in e.g. SN 2.12 or 2.17 or Sn 269; and ''sukha'' and ''rati'' (happiness), in contrast to other places, as used in Sn 439 and 956. The oldest term was perhaps ''amata'' (immortal, immortality) [...] but one could say here that it is a negative term."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xv}}}}

====Early Buddhist schools====
{{Main|Early Buddhist schools|Buddhist councils|Theravada}}
[[File:固原须弥山石窟第5窟大佛楼.JPG|thumb|Buddha at [[Xumishan Grottoes]], ca. 6th century CE&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Steinhardt (2011), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23075959 The Sixth Century in East Asian Architecture, Ars Orientalis], Vol. 41, pp. 27–71&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to the scriptures, soon after the [[Parinirvana|{{IAST|parinirvāṇa}}]] (from Sanskrit: "highest extinguishment") of Gautama Buddha, the [[first Buddhist council]] was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. [[Richard Gombrich]] states that the monastic assembly recitations of the Buddha's teaching likely began during Buddha's lifetime, similar to the First Council, that helped compose Buddhist scriptures.{{sfn|Williams|2005|pp=175–176}}

The [[Second Buddhist council]] resulted in the first schism in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], probably caused by a group of reformists called [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthaviras]] who split from the conservative majority [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=89–90}} After unsuccessfully trying to modify the [[Vinaya]], a small group of "elderly members", i.e. ''sthaviras'', broke away from the majority [[Mahāsāṃghika]] during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the Sthavira Nikaya.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. pp. 49, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sthaviras gave rise to several schools, one of which was the [[Theravada]] school. Originally, these schisms were caused by disputes over monastic disciplinary codes of various fraternities, but eventually, by about 100 CE if not earlier, schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=74–75}} Buddhist monks of different fraternities became distinct schools and stopped doing official Sangha business together, but continued to study each other's doctrines.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=74–75}}

Following (or leading up to) the schisms, each Saṅgha started to accumulate their own version of [[Tripiṭaka]] (Pali Canons, triple basket of texts).&lt;ref name=britannicatipitaka&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Tipitaka Tipitaka] Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall2012p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Crandall|title=Gender and Religion, 2nd Edition: The Dark Side of Scripture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zq7UAwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-4871-1 |pages=56–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their Tripiṭaka, each school included the Suttas of the Buddha, a Vinaya basket (disciplinary code) and added an [[Abhidharma]] basket which were texts on detailed scholastic classification, summary and interpretation of the Suttas.&lt;ref name=britannicatipitaka/&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=90–91}} The doctrine details in the Abhidharmas of various Buddhist schools differ significantly, and these were composed starting about the third century BCE and through the 1st millennium CE.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=90–93}}&lt;ref&gt;"Abhidhamma Pitaka".

Several scholars have suggested that the [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] tradition started in south India (modern [[Andhra Pradesh]]), and it is there that [[Prajnaparamita]] sutras, among the earliest [[Mahayana sutras]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul.

''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65–66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krsna River."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993).

''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that "historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as [[Nagarjuna]], [[Dignāga]], [[Chandrakirti]], [[Aryadeva]], and [[Bhāviveka]], among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in Āndhra."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree.

Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no evidence that Mahayana ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.{{sfn|Nattier|2003|pp=193–194}} Initially it was known as ''Bodhisattvayāna'' (the "Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas").{{sfn|Keown|1996|pp=58, 61}} Paul Williams states that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[Vinaya]] or ordination codes from the early schools of Buddhism.{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=4–5}} Records written by Chinese monks visiting India indicate that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks could be found in the same monasteries, with the difference that Mahayana monks worshipped figures of Bodhisattvas, while non-Mahayana monks did not.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=97}}

Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts. These Mahayana teachings were first propagated into China by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], the first translator of Mahayana sutras into Chinese during the 2nd century CE.{{refn|group=note|name=China Buswell 2004|"The most important evidence – in fact the only evidence – for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Zürcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema."{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=492}}}} Some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] to include the very first versions of the [[Prajnaparamita]] series, along with texts concerning [[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]], which were probably composed in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.{{sfn|Hirakawa|Groner |1993|pp=253, 263, 268}}{{refn|group=note|name=South|"The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana Sutras" Warder{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=335}}}}

====Late Mahayana Buddhism====
During the period of Late Mahāyāna, four major types of thought developed: [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogachara]], [[Buddha-nature|Tathagatagarbha]], and [[Indian logic#Buddhist logic|Buddhist logic]] as the last and most recent.{{sfn|Hirakawa|Groner |1993|pp=8, 9}} In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahayana were the Madhyamaka and the later Yogachara.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=95}} According to [[Dan Lusthaus]], Madhyamaka and Yogachara have a great deal in common, and the commonality stems from early Buddhism.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|pp=236–237}} There were no great Indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=113}}

====Vajrayana (Esoteric Buddhism)====
{{main|Vajrayana}}

Scholarly research concerning [[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]] is still in its early stages and has a number of problems that make research difficult:{{sfn|Hirakawa|Groner |1993|p=9}}

# Vajrayana Buddhism was influenced by [[Hinduism]], and therefore research must include exploring Hinduism as well.
# The scriptures of Vajrayana have not yet been put in any kind of order.
# Ritual must be examined as well, not just doctrine.

===Spread of Buddhism===
{{Main|Timeline of Buddhism}}
{{double image|right|Asoka̠ Buddhist Missions.png|118|Asoka Kaart.gif|200|The spread of Buddhism within [[South Asia]] and beyond.}}

Buddhism may have spread only slowly in India until the time of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]], who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more [[stupa|stūpas]] (Buddhist religious memorials) and to its spread throughout the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya empire]] and into neighbouring lands such as [[Central Asia]] and to the island of [[Sri Lanka]]. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, Korea and Japan, and in the second case, to the emergence of Sinhalese [[Theravada|Theravāda Buddhism]] and its spread from [[Sri Lanka]] to much of Southeast Asia.

This period marks the first known spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]], emissaries were sent to various countries west of India to spread Buddhism (Dharma), particularly in eastern provinces of the neighbouring [[Seleucid Empire]], and even farther to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of the Mediterranean. It is a matter of disagreement among scholars whether or not these emissaries were accompanied by Buddhist missionaries.{{Sfn| Gombrich|2006|p=135}} 
[[File:MenandrosCoin.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin depicting Indo-Greek king Menander facing right with headband|Coin depicting [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I|Menander]], who, according to Buddhist tradition records in the [[Milinda Panha]], converted to the Buddhist faith and became an [[arhat]] in the 2nd century BCE ([[British Museum]])]]
In central and west Asia, Buddhist influence grew, through Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs and ancient Asian trade routes. An example of this is evidenced in Chinese and Pali Buddhist records, such as ''[[Milinda Panha|Milindapanha]]'' and the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. The ''Milindapanha'' describes a conversation between a Buddhist monk and the 2nd-century BCE Greek king [[Menander I|Menander]], after which Menander abdicates and himself goes into monastic life in the pursuit of nirvana.{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=103, 119}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Neelis |title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-18159-8 |pages=102–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have questioned the ''Milindapanha'' version, expressing doubts whether Menander was Buddhist or just favourably disposed to Buddhist monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Heirman |author2=Stephan Peter Bumbacher |title=The Spread of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kr_M1e7yImoC |year=2007|publisher=Brill Academic |isbn=90-04-15830-8|pages=139–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] (mid 1st–3rd century CE) came to control the Silk Road trade through Central and South Asia, which brought them to interact with ancient Buddhist monasteries and societies involved in trade in these regions. They patronized Buddhist institutions, and Buddhist monastery influence, in turn, expanded into a world religion, according to Xinru Liu.&lt;ref name="Liu2010p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinru Liu|title=The Silk Road in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ8RDAAAQBAJ|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533810-2|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism spread to [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] and China, eventually to other parts of the far east.&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the earliest written documents of the Buddhist faith are the [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]], dating from about the 1st century CE, and connected to the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. These texts are written in the [[Kharosthi]] script, a script that was predominantly used in the [[Greco-Bactrian]] and [[Indo-Greek]] kingdoms of northern India and that played a prominent role in the coinage and inscriptions of their kings.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 278"&gt;Warder, A.K.

During the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&amp;#x2013;907), [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]] was introduced from India and [[Chan Buddhism]] (Zen) became a major religion.&lt;ref&gt;McRae, John (2003), Seeing Through Zen, The University Press Group Ltd, p 13, 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orzech, Charles D.

During the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and [[Mongolia]]. Johannes Bronkhorst states that the esoteric form was attractive because it allowed both a secluded monastic community as well as the social rites and rituals important to laypersons and to kings for the maintenance of a political state during succession and wars to resist invasion.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaX58-E5-3MC |year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-20140-8 |pages=242–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, Buddhism slowly declined in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Powell |title=Living Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XO-qSUMphgC |year=1989|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20410-2 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it vanished from Persia and Central Asia as Islam became the state religion.&lt;ref name="larsfogelin6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lars Fogelin |title=An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yPZzBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-994823-9 |pages=6–11, 218, 229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sheila Canby | title=Depictions of Buddha Sakyamuni in the Jami al-Tavarikh and the Majma al-Tavarikh | journal=Muqarnas | volume=10 | year=1993 | pages=299–310 | doi=10.2307/1523195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theravada]] school arrived in Sri Lanka sometime in the 3rd century BCE.

=== Modern Era ===

[[File:Bodh Gaya 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Mahabodhi temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] as it appeared in 1899 after its restoration.]]
{{Further information|Buddhist modernism}}In the [[Modern history|modern era]], Buddhism faced various changes and challenges. These include the colonization of Buddhist states by Christian countries, persecution under modern states, the growth of modern consumer culture and the findings of modern science. One response to some of these challenges has come to be called [[Buddhist modernism]], which was one of the responses to the threat of colonialism and christian proselytism in [[Sri Lanka]]. Buddhist modernist figures such as the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]] (1832– 1907) and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]]  (1864–1933) promoted Buddhism as a scientific and rational religion which they saw as compatible with modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures of Buddhist modernist revival include [[B. R. Ambedkar]] (1891–1956), leader of the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]], who urged low caste Indian [[Dalit|Dalits]] to convert to Buddhism as well as the Thai [[Mongkut|King Mongkut]] (r. 1851–68), and his son [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]] (r. 1868–1910), who were responsible for modern reforms of [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Another modern development was the development of the [[Vipassana movement]] which promoted [[Buddhist meditation]] practices among laypersons and became very popular in the West. 

[[East Asian Buddhism]] meanwhile suffered under various wars which ravaged China during the modern era, such as the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping rebellion]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]] (which also affected [[Korean Buddhism]]). During the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican period]] (1912-49), a new movement called [[Humanistic Buddhism]] was developed by figures such as [[Taixu]] (1899–1947), and though Buddhist institutions were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76), there has been a revival of the religion in China after 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 409-10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] also went through a period of modernization during the [[Meiji period|Meiji Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Central Asia]] meanwhile, the arrival of [[Communism|Communist]] repression to [[Tibet]] (1966-1980) and [[Mongolia]]  (between 1924-1990) had a strong negative impact on Buddhist institutions, though the situation has improved somewhat since the 80s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 414-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spread to Western world ====
{{Further information|Western Buddhism}}
[[File:1893parliament.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|1893 [[World Parliament of Religions]] in [[Chicago]]]]
One of the most significant events of the modern era was the spread of all major [[Schools of Buddhism|forms of Buddhism]] to the [[Western world]] ([[Americas]], [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]]). While there were some encounters between Western travelers or missionaries such as St. [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Ippolito Desideri]] and Buddhist cultures, it was not until the 19th century that Buddhism began to be properly understood by Western scholars. It was the work of pioneering scholars such as [[Eugène Burnouf]], [[Max Müller]], [[Hermann Oldenberg]] and [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] that paved the way for modern [[Buddhist studies]] in the West. It was also during the 19th century that large numbers of Asian Buddhist immigrants (mainly from China and Japan) first began to arrive in Western countries such as the United States and Canada, bringing with them their Buddhist religion. This period also saw the first Westerners to formally convert to Buddhism, [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Prothero, ''The White Buddhist,'' 175. Olcott’s approach to Buddhism and the terminology of Protestant Buddhism and “creolization” (Prothero) is extensively discussed in K. A. McMahan,“ ‘Creolization’ in American Religious History. The Metaphysical Nature of Henry Steel Olcott, PhD dissertation, unpublished manuscript (Ann Arbor 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; An important event in the introduction of Buddhism to the West was the 1893 [[World Parliament of Religions]], which for the first time saw well publicized speeches by major Buddhist leaders alongside other religious leaders. The 20th century saw a prolific growth of new Buddhist institutions in Western countries, including the [[Buddhist Society, London]] (1924), [[Das Buddhistische Haus]] (1924) and [[Datsan Gunzechoinei]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]. The publication and translations of Buddhist literature in Western languages also increased exponentially. After the [[World War II|second world war]], further immigration from Asia, globalization, the breakdown of the [[Secularization|hegemony of Christianity]] on Western Culture as well a renewed interest in Buddhism among the 60s [[counterculture]] led to further growth in Buddhist institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James William, ''The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition'', Oxford University Press, p. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential figures on post-war [[Buddhism in the West|Western Buddhism]] include [[Shunryu Suzuki]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], and the [[Tenzin Gyatso|14th Dalai Lama]].

==Schools and traditions==
{{Main|Schools of Buddhism|Buddhahood}}
[[File:Buddhist sects.png|thumb|alt=color map showing Buddhism is a major religion worldwide|upright=1.35|Distribution of major Buddhist traditions]]
Buddhists generally classify themselves as either [[Theravada]] or [[Mahayana]].{{sfn|Keown|1996|p=12}} This classification is also used by some scholars{{sfn|Smith|2006|pp=}} and is the one ordinarily used in the English language.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhism |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=2004 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tibetan%20buddhism |accessdate=2007-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609051748/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tibetan%20buddhism |archivedate=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative scheme used by some scholars{{refn|group=note|name=alternative scheme|(Harvey 1990),(Gombrich,1984); Gethin (1998), pp. 1–2, identifies "three broad traditions" as: (1) "The Theravāda tradition of Sri Lanka and South-East Asia, also sometimes referred to as 'southern' Buddhism"; (2) "The East Asian tradition of China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, also sometimes referred to as 'eastern' Buddhism"; and, (3) "The Tibetan tradition, also sometimes referred to as 'northern' Buddhism."; Robinson &amp; Johnson (1982) divide their book into two parts: Part One is entitled "The Buddhism of South Asia" (which pertains to Early Buddhism in India); and, Part Two is entitled "The Development of Buddhism Outside of India" with chapters on "The Buddhism of Southeast Asia", "Buddhism in the Tibetan Culture Area", "East Asian Buddhism" and "Buddhism Comes West"; ''Penguin Handbook of Living Religions'', 1984, p. 279; Prebish &amp; Keown, ''Introducing Buddhism'', ebook, Journal of Buddhist Ethics, 2005, printed ed, Harper, 2006}} divides Buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas: [[Theravada]], [[East Asian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].
[[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|alt=monks in orange robes on stone steps in Cambodia|Young monks in [[Cambodia]]]]

Some scholars{{refn|group=note|name=other schemes|See e.g. the multi-dimensional classification in ''Encyclopedia of Religion''{{sfn|Eliade|1987|pp=440ff}}}} use other schemes. Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes. [[Hinayana]] (literally "lesser or inferior vehicle") is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged, but as the Hinayana term is considered derogatory, a variety of other terms are used instead, including [[Shravakayana|Śrāvakayāna]], Nikaya Buddhism, early Buddhist schools, sectarian Buddhism and conservative Buddhism.&lt;ref name=kwmorganp410&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth W. Morgan |title=The Path of the Buddha: Buddhism Interpreted by Buddhists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6OHBCgmmGAC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0030-4 |pages=410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.

&lt;!-- comparison and contrast--&gt;
Not all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook, or treat the same concepts as central. Each tradition, however, does have its own core concepts, and some comparisons can be drawn between them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erika Wilson|title=Emotions and Spirituality in Religions and Spiritual Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSUY9LqXPdQC |year=2012|publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-5950-5 |pages=137–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M Koller |title=The Indian Way: An Introduction to the Philosophies &amp; Religions of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgg3DAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-315-50740-8 |pages=157–160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both Theravada and Mahayana traditions accept [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] as the founder, Theravada considers him unique, but Mahayana considers him one of many Buddhas
* Both accept the [[Middle Way]], [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]], the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[three marks of existence]]
* Nirvana is attainable by the monks in Theravada tradition, while Mahayana considers it broadly attainable; Arhat state is aimed for in the Theravada, while Buddhahood is aimed for in the Mahayana
* Religious practice consists of meditation for monks and prayer for laypersons in Theravada, while Mahayana includes prayer, chanting and meditation for both
* Theravada has been a more rationalist, historical form of Buddhism; while Mahayana has included more rituals, mysticism and worldly flexibility in its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sarah LeVine |author2=David N Gellner |title=Rebuilding Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9C1iF3MAYgC |year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04012-0 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Theravada}}
The Theravada tradition traces its roots to the words of the Buddha preserved in the Pali Canon, and considers itself to be the more orthodox form of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann R. Kinney|author2=Marijke J. Klokke|author3=Lydia Kieven|title=Worshiping Siva and Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC |year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2779-3|page=20}}; Quote: "Orthodox forms of Buddhism are collectively called Hinayana (...). Present-day practitioners of orthodox Buddhism prefer to use the name Theravada (Buddhism of the Elders)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich |title=Buddhist Precept &amp; Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqp4LuZQnHsC| year=1995| publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-15623-6 |pages=47–48 }}; Quote: "Theravadins claim that they alone represent true Buddhist orthodoxy, and that other sects are heretics".&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada flourished in south India and Sri Lanka in ancient times; from there it spread for the first time into mainland southeast Asia about the 11th century into its elite urban centres.{{Sfn|Collins|1998|p=18}} By the 13th century, Theravada had spread widely into the rural areas of mainland southeast Asia,{{Sfn|Collins|1998|p=18}} displacing Mahayana Buddhism and some traditions of Hinduism which had arrived in places such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia around the mid-1st millennium CE. The later traditions were well established in south Thailand and Java by the 7th century, under the sponsorship of the Srivijaya dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Promsak Jermsawatdi |title=Thai Art with Indian Influences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0O9je9dECH8C |year=1979|publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-090-7 |pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sigfried J. de Laet|author2=Joachim Herrmann|title=History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C. to the seventh century A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGUz01yBumEC |year=1996|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-102812-0|pages=422–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political separation between Khmer and Sukhothai led the Sukhothai king to welcome Sri Lankan emissaries, helping them establish the first Theravada Buddhist ''sangha'' in the 13th century, in contrast to the Mahayana tradition of Khmer earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Juergensmeyer |author2=Wade Clark Roof |title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5 |pages=1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the [[Pali Canon]] as the original version of scripture. They also emphasized Theravada being rational and scientific.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|pp=16–17}}

Theravāda is primarily practised today in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Buddhism in Burma|Burma]], [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]], [[Buddhism in Cambodia|Cambodia]] as well as small portions of China, [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Malaysia|Malaysia]] and [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]. It has a growing presence in the west.

Native Mahayana Buddhism is practised today in China, Japan, [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Singapore|Singapore]], parts of Russia and most of [[Vietnam]] (also commonly referred to as "Eastern Buddhism"). The Buddhism practised in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahayana in origin, but is discussed below under the heading of Vajrayana (also commonly referred to as "Northern Buddhism"). There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism, of which "the Pure Land school of Mahayana is the most widely practised today.".{{sfn|Clarke |Beyer|2009|p=86}} In most of this area however, they are fused into a single unified form of Buddhism. [[Buddhism in Japan|In Japan in particular]], they form separate denominations with the five major ones being: [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]], peculiar to Japan; [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]]; [[Shingon]], a form of Vajrayana; [[Tendai]], and [[Zen]]. In Korea, nearly all Buddhists belong to the [[Jogye Order|Chogye school]], which is officially Son (Zen), but with substantial elements from other traditions.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|pp=430, 435}}

The goal and philosophy of the Vajrayāna remains Mahāyānist, but its methods are seen by its followers as far more powerful, so as to lead to Buddhahood in just one lifetime.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=189}} The practice of using [[mantras]] was adopted from [[Hinduism]], where they were first used in the [[Vedas]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=180}}

Zen Buddhism (禅), pronounced ''[[Chinese Chán|Chán]]'' in Chinese, ''seon'' in Korean or ''zen'' in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term ''dhyāna'', meaning "meditation") is a form of Mahayana Buddhism found in China, Korea and Japan. It lays special emphasis on meditation, and direct discovery of the Buddha-nature.&lt;ref name="chengp60"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Prebish|According to Charles S. Prebish:{{sfn|Prebish|1993|pp=244, 287}} "Although a variety of Zen 'schools' developed in Japan, they all emphasize Zen as a teaching that does not depend on sacred texts, that provides the potential for direct realization, that the realization attained is none other than the Buddha nature possessed by each sentient being ..."}}

Zen Buddhism is divided into two main schools: [[Rinzai]] (臨済宗) and [[Sōtō]] (曹洞宗), the former greatly favouring the use in meditation on the [[koan]] (公案, a meditative riddle or puzzle) as a device for spiritual break-through, and the latter (while certainly employing koans) focusing more on ''[[shikantaza]]'' or "just sitting".{{refn|group=note|name=Prebish B|Prebish comments (op. cit., p. 244): "It presumes that ''sitting in meditation itself'' (i.e. ''[[zazen]]'') is an expression of Buddha nature." The method is to detach the mind from conceptual modes of thinking and perceive Reality directly. Speaking of Zen in general, Buddhist scholar Stephen Hodge writes: "... practitioners of Zen believe that Enlightenment, the awakening of the Buddha-mind or Buddha-nature, is our natural state, but has been covered over by layers of negative emotions and distorted thoughts. According to this view, Enlightenment is not something that we must acquire a bit at a time, but a state that can occur instantly when we cut through the dense veil of mental and emotional obscurations."{{sfn|Hodge |2002|pp=12–13}}}}

Zen Buddhism is primarily found in Japan, with some presence in South Korea and Vietnam. The scholars of Japanese Soto Zen tradition in recent times have critiqued the mainstream Japanese Buddhism for ''dhatu-vada'', that is assuming things have substantiality, a view they assert to be non-Buddhist and "out of tune with the teachings of non-Self and conditioned arising", states Peter Harvey.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=145, 407–408}}

'''Chhatrapati''' ([[Devanagari]]: छत्रपति) is an [[India]]n royal title. It is often taken to be the equivalent of [[king]] or [[lord]], and was used by the [[Maratha]]. The word ‘Chhatrapati’ is a [[tatpurusha]]  [[Sanskrit]] compound of ''[[Chatra (umbrella)|chhatra]]'' (''parasol'' or ''umbrella'') and ''pati'' (''master/lord/ruler''). The parasol was considered a symbol of absolute, or even universal, sovereignty and consecrated kingship, and has been used by monarchies outside of India, as well. The title indicates a person who is a sovereign ruler over other [[Prince|princes]], and not a [[vassal]].
In contrast, the [[India]]n titles of ''[[Maharaja]]'' or ''[[Raja]]'', ''[[Yuvraj]]'', ''Rajkumar'' or ''[[Kumar]]'', and ''[[Senapati]]'', reflect a range of [[Europe]]an equivalent meanings, from [[King]], [[Crown Prince]], and [[Prince]], to [[Duke]], [[Count]], or [[Lord]]. [[Shivaji]] adopted 'Chhatrapati' it since other titles were bestowed by other lieges and [[Paramount rulers in early Philippine history|paramount rulers]], like the [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Adilshahi]] or [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

==House of Bhosle==
[[File:Shivaji Maharaj Raigad.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Raigad fort, Maharashtra]]
The following list details the Chhatrapatis of the [[Bhosle|House of Bhosle]]. The title was held by his successors, although the increasing power of the [[Peshwa|Peshwas]] and later Maratha generals reduced it to a nominal position. The [[Grand prince|Grand Princes]] of [[Satara State|Satara]] were generally considered the inheritors of the title, although the [[Kolhapur State|Rajas of Kohlapur]] did have a claim by descent, as their position began as a subsidiary title of [[Shivaji II]] due to location of his court. His mother, the Regent [[Tarabai]], established a rival regime in [[Kolhapur|Kohlapur]], challenging both the power of the [[Peshwa|Peshwas]] and the Mughal-backed claims of [[Chattrapati Shahu|Shahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/822894456|title=Textbook of medieval indian history.|last=Sailendra.|first=Sen,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=9789380607344|oclc=822894456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christ, the Messenger''''' was a lecture delivered by [[Swami Vivekananda]] in [[Los Angeles]], California in January 1900. In the same year the lecture was published as a book by The Vedanta Centre, Boston. In his lecture Vivekananda attempted to analyze the life and messages of [[Jesus]] through [[Vedanta]].{{Sfn|Jongeneel|2009|p=192}}{{Sfn|Bhide|2008|p=39}}{{Sfn|Burke|1973|p=204}}{{Sfn|Arangassery|1999|p=22}}

== Synopsis ==
In his lecture Vivekananda has compared the entire human existence to an ocean, where an individual's life is like waves. He has compared human lives with the waves rising on the ocean, and then falling down. Jesus is like a big wave that comes very rarely. Vivekananda called Jesus "The great soul, the Messenger."{{Sfn|Vivekananda|2015|p=552}}&lt;ref name=Christ&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vedanta.com/store/christ.php|title=Christ the Messenger: The Complete Text from the booklet Christ the Messenger|accessdate=27 December 2015|publisher=Vedanta Press and catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lecture==
Vivekananda in his lecture, while presenting a balanced view on Christianity, also mentioned its drawbacks. He based his arguments on his [[Hindu philosophy]] of [[Vedanta]] which was that there was only one reality in the world which was the [[Brahman]] which subsumes the core aspects of the human being, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. He said that in [[Christ]] the most profound knowledge is made available to us which is the identity of human beings and God.{{Sfn|Schouten|2008|p=92}}

Vivekananda said that the land where he was born, in a race which was the land of the Jews, was in strife with stagnation and suffering {{Sfn|Saraf|2012|p=128}} and due to differences between [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]]. This caused "about the very impetus which came out at the other end as the gigantic brain of Jesus of Nazareth." The land was in the Asian region, which has lofty mountains touching the sky and large swathes of desert land.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|2015|pp=551&amp;ndash;58}}&lt;ref name=Christ/&gt;

Vivekananda looked at Jesus Christ from the prescriptive of an Orientalist as He was born in the region of Asia and thus called Jesus as an "Oriental of Orientals," though his physical features of blue eyes and yellow hair was a picture presented by [[Europeans]].{{Sfn|Schouten|2008|p=92}}{{Sfn|Jongeneel|2009|p=192}} He made a comparison of the two religious beliefs of the west and the east - the former as a [[Greek culture]] of politics dominated by God of human passions. While the culture of the east was for what is beyond that which exists. All divine prophets were oriental like Jesus. Jesus was practical in the oriental sense.{{Sfn|Jongeneel|2009|p=192}}

Vivekananda, in his lecture, as an analogy, drew attention to the wise sayings of [[Krishna]], the Hindu god, from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] that: "Wherever thou findeth a great soul of immense power and purity struggling to raise humanity, know that he is born of My Splendour, that I am working there through him," and said that in addition to finding God in [[Jesus of Nazareth]], let us find Him through all those prophets, the man-Gods, he preceded, succeeded or yet to follow Jesus, as they are all reincarnations of the same God whom we all hold in great reverence.{{Sfn|Bhide|2008|p=39}}

Vivekananda emphasized that it was essential to worship God as man, and such a god man was Christ and hence not to give up his worship as "all our ideas of God are concentrated there". However, he mentioned the drawback of Christianity as their refusal to consider other reincarnations of God in other religions. [[Buddha]] before Christ was a reincarnation of God and like him there were many more.{{Sfn|Bhide|2008|p=39}}{{Sfn|Saraf|2012|p=128}}

Vivekananda spoke that Jesus's message to all was to pursue the ideal and achieve it in one's own way, irrespective of whether one gives credit for His teachings or not. Religion is not traded like a shop owner. What is taught by Jesus is only truth, which is nobody's proprietorial right. "Truth is God Himself."{{Sfn|Saraf|2012|p=128}}{{Sfn|Vivekananda|2015|pp=551&amp;ndash;558}}

In his "oeuvre" Vivekananda said that Christ was "intensely practical" and offered a practical religion. A significant reference made by Vivekananda was to the saying from the [[Bible]] (Mathew 8:20, Luke 9:58) to stress the message that renouncing worldly matters is the way to salvation: "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the son of Man has no place to lay his head."{{Sfn|Schouten|2008|p=94}}

== Publication ==
The lecture was first published as a book by The Vedanta Centre, Boston in 1900. It was also included in ''[[The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda]]'' ''Volume IV''.&lt;ref name="Vivekananda1900"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=Christ, the messenger: lecture delivered by Swami Vivekananda at Los Angeles, California, 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ni4-AAAAYAAJ|date=1900|publisher=The Vedanta Centre|pages=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication is based on the stenographic records of his lectures delivered in Los Angeles in January 1900 to a large audience{{Sfn|Schouten|2008|p=93}} of Christians.{{Sfn|Bhide|2008|p=39}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12243">The '''Church of Scientology Western United States''' (CoSWUS) is a [[California]]n 501(c)(3) [[non-profit corporation]], located in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22nd, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; CoSWUS is integrated within the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Church of Scientology. The corporation is composed of several individual Scientology [[organizations]] and [[entities]], among them [[church (building)|churches]], such as the "Church of Scientology of Los Angeles", which delivers services to public members of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology-losangeles.org/ Official website of the Church of Scientology of Los Angeles, retrieved on May 9th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its application for tax exemption, CoSWUS described the structure of the corporation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The CSWUS corporation houses six distinct ecclesiastical organizations that includes three churches, each of which
ministers religious services at a different level of the religious hierarchy described above; two supervisory organizations and an ecclesiastical support organization. [...] Except for the Church of Scientology of San Diego, all of these church organizations are located in Los Angeles where they share a large complex of buildings and facilities. [...]"&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"&gt;[[:Image:Application-501-CoSWUS.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Church of Scientology Western United States, Los Angeles, California, August 18th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The core of CoSWUS' organizations are located around L. Ron Hubbard Way in [[Hollywood]], where three so-called "service organizations" are located: the already mentioned "Church of Scientology of Los Angeles", the "American Saint Hill Organization" (ASHO) and the "Advanced Organization Los Angeles" (AOLA). In this area is also the former "Cedars of Lebanon" Hospital located, which was purchased by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s and which serves today as a [[dormitory]] for the Scientology [[Employment|staff members]], who work in the adjacent buildings or elsewhere in Los Angeles.

==Corporate Information==

;Basic Information
On April 8, 1971 a new Scientology organization was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in [[San Diego]] - the "Church of Scientology of Jolla".&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Incorporation-CoS-San-Diego.pdf|Articles of Incorporation of the Church of Scientology of La Jolla (San Diego), Bate Stamp 621848 (First page of the Articles), San Diego, California, April 8th, 13th &amp; 27th, 1971]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was later changed to "Church of Scientology of San Diego". Finally, on May 20, 1985, the organization was transferred and re-incorporated in Los Angeles under the new name "Church of Scientology Western United States".&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Incorporation-CoSWUS.pdf|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation for Church of Scientology Western United States, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Los Angeles, California, May 20th &amp; 21st, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors of the newly named corporation had adopted the organization's new [[Bylaws]] on May 19, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Bylaws-CoSWUS.pdf|Revised Bylaws of Church of Scientology Western United States, Los Angeles, California, May 19th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the official address of CoSWUS is 1308 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles CA 90027.

In 1993, the Church of Scientology International submitted to the Internal Revenue Service a list with all the [[corporate officers]] of the Scientology network. At this time, CoSWUS was officially managed by a [[Board of Trustees]]. Its members were Mariette Cynstein, Ivan Obolensky and Mary Pinat. The organization's [[Board of Directors]] was composed of Linda Sereda, Lawrence Lynn and Eugene Skonetski. The [[President (corporate title)|President]] of CoSWUS was Lawrence Lynn, with Linda Sereda as Secretary and Eugene Skonetski as Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:CoS-Trustees-Directors-Officers-1993.pdf|List of Trustees, Directors &amp; Officers (of Church of Scientology Entities) - Ex. I-2, CSI Prod 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151380 - 151395, Los Angeles, California, September 21st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1993, CoSWUS filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"/&gt; In the same year, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted CoSWUS' request for exemption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As of March 11, 2000 CoSWUS had the following [[board of directors|corporate officers]]: Vicki Shantz ([[Chief Executive Officer]]/President), Wayne Carnahan ([[Secretary]]) and Vincenzo Contrafatto ([[Chief Financial Officer]]/[[Treasurer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Domestic Nonprofit Corporation, Religious Technology Center, Secretary of State, State of California, Filed: Sacramento, California, March 11th, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2, 2008, CoSWUS' official [[Agent (law)|agent]] has been the attorney Jeanne Gavigan. Her official address is 6400 Canoga Park Avenue, Canoga Park, CA 91367.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C0621848 Entry for Church of Scientology Western United States, California Business Portal of the Secretary of the State of California/May 9th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Corporate Activities
The Religious Technology Center (RTC) is the holder of Scientology's [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]]. As such, RTC entered with the CoSWUS on May 23, 1985 an organizational [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], granting CoSWUS the right to sell and deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments of 6% of the monetary value of the "Advanced Technology"-services that are being delivered to the public from CoSWUS towards RTC.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Covenant-RTC-CSWUS-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Western United States &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably: Los Angeles, California, May 23rd, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology International (CSI) presents itself as the [[mother church]] of the Church of Scientology worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/religion/management/pg003.html The Church of Scientology International/What is Scientology? - official website, retrieved on March 24th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it has the right to use and sub-license various Scientology trademarks and service marks. Consequently, CSI has entered a number of agreements with other [[subordinate]] organizations in the Scientology [[hierarchy]], such as the CoSWUS:

* [[License]] Agreement. On June 15, 1982, CSI entered a license agreement with the "Church of Scientology of San Diego", which regulated the use of the service marks and trademarks by that organization. When this organization later became the "Church of Scientology Western United States", the license agreement remained valid for the newly renamed corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:License-Agreement-CSI-CoS-San-Diego.pdf|Los Angeles, California, License Agreement - CSI/Church (Marks) - License Agreement between Church of Scientology International and the Church of Scientology of San Diego, June 15th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Ecclesiastical]] Support Agreement". This agreement from January 1, 1992 acknowledges CSI's dominant role and control over all the functions and activities of CoSWUS and guarantees a steady, weekly payment of 12.5% of the organizations' net income towards CSI.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:EccSupp-CSI-CoS-WUS.pdf|Ecclesiastical Support Agreement between Church of Scientology International &amp; Church of Scientology Western United States, Los Angeles, California, January 1st, March 18th &amp; April 24th, 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Motion Picture]] Exhibition Agreement." It guarantees CSI the weekly payment of 11% of the [[revenue]] by CoSWUS for their use of Scientology training courses. It also forces the organizations to use certain equipment, such as tape recorders, which CSI provides for the same use.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Mot-Agreem-CSI-CoS-WUS.pdf|Motion Picture Exhibition Agreement (Churches) between Church of Scientology International and Church of Scientology Western United States, Los Angeles, California, July 22nd &amp; August 2nd, 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational Structure and Management==

According to its 1993 application for tax exemption, the [[corporation]] CoSWUS consisted at that time of six different sub-organizations or sub-entities:&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 1. Church of Scientology Advanced Organization of Los Angeles ('AOLA') - AOLA is one of four advanced organizations in the world and the only one located in the United States.

[...] AOLA's activities consist of the ministry of religious services and administrative and executive functions necessary to support this ministry. AOLA's staff includes auditors, case supervisors, course supervisors and other staff directly involved in administering services, as well as executive and administrative staff [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 2. American Saint Hill Organization ('ASHO') - ASHO is one of only four Saint Hill Organizations in the world [...], and the only Saint Hill Organization in the United States. Saint Hill Organizations are so named because they specialize in delivering the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course ('Briefing Coursel') and other Scientology religious services at a comparable level. The Briefing Course is a very extensive, advanced course in auditor training which includes a chronological study of the written and recorded Scientology Scriptures. ASHO also ministers other religious training and lower-level and intermediate level auditing. The religious services ministered by ASHO generally emphasize training. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Church of Scientology of San Diego - Church of Scientology of San Diego is a Class V church of Scientology and is authorized to minister Scientology auditing to the State of Clear and auditor training to the level of Class V auditor. It is a local church of Scientology for the San Diego area."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"4. Continental Liaison Office West U.S. ('CLO WUS') - CLO WUS is an intermediate level ecclesiastical management organization which acts as a liaison for CSI. [...] CLO WUS administers Church programs and provides guidance and advice to Scientology churches in the Western United States. There are 30 separate churches under CLO WUS's ecclesiastical jurisdiction [...] CLO WUS reviews operations of the Scientology churches within its ecclesiastical jurisdiction and liaises with
CSI. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 5. Commodore's Messenger Organization Pacific ('CMO PAC') -  CMO PAC oversees the execution of programs from the Commodore's Messenger Organization International of CSI and acts as a liaison between CSWUS and CSI with respect to those programs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"6. Pacific Base Crew ('PBC') - PBC is the organization responsible for maintaining the complex of Scientology buildings and other facilities used by CSWUS and other Scientology organizations in Los Angeles. PBC is responsible for renovations, some construction and most repairs to these facilities. Its staff also provides meals and berthing to the staff of all Scientology organizations located in the Scientology complex. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial''' or the '''Dr. Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Sthal''' is a museum and memorial dedicated to [[B. R. Ambedkar|Babasaheb Ambedkar]] at 26, Alipur Road in [[Delhi]]. On 13 April 2018, the 127th [[Ambedkar Jayanti|birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar]], India's Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] inaugurated the memorial. This is the place where Ambedkar breathed his last or attained ''Mahaparinirvana'' on 6 December 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/india/pm-modi-inaugurates-dr-ambedkar-national-memorial-highlights/articleshow/63750403.cms|title=PM Modi inaugurates Dr Ambedkar National Memorial: Highlights - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/the-arts/ambedkar-memorial-delhi|title=Ambedkar Memorial Gets Final Touches Ahead of Inauguration by Modi|website=The Wire|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar.jpg|right|thumb|The memorial is dedicated to [[B. R. Ambedkar]].]]
Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 at [[Mhow]] (now [[Dr. Ambedkar Nagar]]) in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and was the first [[Minister of Law and Justice]] of Independent India. After resigning from the Union Cabinet on 1st November 1951, Ambedkar started residing in the house of Maharaja of Sirohi at 26, Alipur Road, Delhi where he breathed his last and attained [[Parinirvana|Mahaparinirvana]] on 6th December 1956. In the memory of Babasaheb Ambedkar, ''Dr. Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Sthal'', 26, Alipur Road was dedicated to the Nation by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the then Prime Minister of India on 2nd December, 2003. Ambedkarites, the followers of Babasaheb believe 26, Alipur Road as Holy place where he attained Mahaparinirvana. Since this building was to be constructed as a Memorial of Babasaheb, who was the brain behind the [[Constitution of India]], hence, the building has been given the shape of a book (the ''Constitution of India''). The Foundation stone of the memorial was laid by the India's Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] on 21 March, 2016. On 13 April 2018, the eve of the 127th [[Ambedkar Jayanti|birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar]], PM [[Narendra Modi]] inaugurated Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial at 26, Alipur Road in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news+bharati-epaper-newsbhar/read+here+to+know+about+dr+ambedkar+national+memorial+pm+modi+gifts+the+epitome+for+world+to+inspire+and+contribute+towards+society-newsid-85701140|title=Read here to know about Dr Ambedkar National Memorial: PM Modi gifts the 'epitome' for world to inspire and contribute towards society - News Bharati {{!}} DailyHunt|work=DailyHunt|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/union-territory/new-delhi/news/UT-DEL-HMU-NEW-LCL-bhaskar-special-report-on-dr-br-ambedkar-national-memorial-5841462-PHO.html|title=3D में अंबेडकर को सुनेंगे ‘लाइव’, घूमते हुए दिखेंगे, टच बटन से पलटेंगे संविधान के पन्ने|work=Dainik Bhaskar|access-date=2018-11-13|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/india/prime-minister-narendra-modi-dedicated-dr-ambedkar-national-memorial-to-the-nation/articleshow/63749507.cms|title=PM मोदी ने आंबेडकर स्मारक का उद्घाटन किया-Navbharat Times|work=Navbharat Times|access-date=2018-11-13|language=hi-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family suffered great privation both during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]], in which her father was killed. Elizabeth grew up believing her father to be one of the honored war dead, until her mother revealed that he had actually been shot as a deserter. When she was 14 her mother was bedridden with diphtheria, forcing Elizabeth to nurse her while still attending school.

As a teenager, the KGB approached Elizabeth as a candidate for the Illegals Program. Although prohibited from telling anyone, Elizabeth surreptitiously managed to consult with her mother about her decision, who unhesitatingly told her that she must do her duty for her [[Mother Russia|motherland]]. She trained to become an undercover agent until the age of 22. During this time, she was raped by one of her captains in the KGB, Timoshev. In 1962, Elizabeth and fellow KGB agent "Phillip Jennings" (Mischa) were assigned to each other to pose as husband and wife in America. In 1965 they move to America under false identities and take up work in a travel agency. Elizabeth meets and recruits civil rights activist Gregory to the KGB and has an ongoing affair with him. She gives birth to her and Phillip's first child, Paige, in 1967, and their second child, Henry, in 1970.

===Season one===
In 1981, Elizabeth Jennings lives with her husband [[Philip Jennings (The Americans)|Philip]] in suburban [[Falls Church, Virginia]]. They are revealed to be a pair of [[sleeper agent]]s working for the [[KGB]]. They have two U.S.-born children, Paige and Henry, both of whom are completely unaware of their parents' true identities. The Jenningses run a small travel agency in [[Dupont Circle]] as a cover for their illegal activities.

After a failed deportation, Elizabeth and Philip kidnap Timoshev, a defected KGB agent, who raped Elizabeth when she was in training. At the time of Timoshev's kidnapping, counter-intelligence FBI agent [[Stan Beeman]] moves next door, causing Philip to suggest defecting themselves. Elizabeth declines and Philip murders Timoshev when he finds out he raped her. Despite a marriage arranged by the KGB, Elizabeth tells Philip that she is beginning to feel love for him for the first time in their 16-year relationship and they try to become a real married couple. However, Philip is hurt upon discovering Elizabeth had an ongoing affair with Gregory Thomas ([[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]]), a black militant.

After planting a bug in [[Caspar Weinberger]]'s study, the Jenningses listen for vital intelligence. When the KGB begin to suspect a mole in their midst, they send operatives posing as FBI agents to kidnap and torture Elizabeth and Philip in order to test their loyalty. Elizabeth is hurt and angry that the people to whom she has devoted her life could treat her with such distrust, while Philip accuses Elizabeth of incurring the KGB's suspicions by reporting to them he had considered defecting. She denies this, admitting only that she had told their handlers that he liked living in the U.S. more than he should. Elizabeth and Philip later reconcile, but subsequently separate when Elizabeth discovers Philip had an affair with his former girlfriend, Irina. Philip moves out and into a motel.

Philip accidentally murders Stan's partner, Amador, during a botched operation, which causes Gregory to fall under the suspicion of the FBI regarding his involvement in the killing. Unwilling to go along with the KGB's plan to send him out of the country, Gregory spends a final night with Elizabeth and then commits [[suicide by cop]] to deflect attention from her. Later, Elizabeth's mentor, General Victor Zhukov, is assassinated under orders from a CIA officer, whom Elizabeth and Philip track down. Elizabeth brings him into a bathroom for sex, and she and Philip kidnap him and bring him to a warehouse, but Elizabeth, still upset about Zhukov's death, decides to let him go, whereupon the CIA officer gives the FBI a vague description of her and Philip.

Elizabeth learns from her informant, Sanford Prince, that he has secured a meeting with a [[United States Air Force]] colonel who has information on the SDI project. The FBI learn of the bug in Weinberger's study and provide the KGB with [[disinformation]] through it. Philip is unsure of the meeting with the Colonel and attends in her place (against her wishes), while Elizabeth goes to pick up the Weinberger tape. Philip finds out Elizabeth's mission is compromised and picks her up just as the FBI are closing in on her, but she is shot by Stan when the FBI begin firing on them. After Elizabeth's surgery, she tells Philip in Russian to "come home".

===Season two===
Elizabeth recovers at a remote safe-house and returns home in time for Henry's 11th birthday. However, the celebration is cut short, as she and Philip must go meet the Connors, another spy couple, but promise a "birthday weekend" at an amusement park. The Connors surprise Philip by involving him (and, unwittingly, Henry) in a supposedly safe mission during their visit, handing him a key to their hotel room to rendezvous when the operation is complete. When Elizabeth and Philip find all but one of the Connors family shot to death in their room, they become paranoid. Elizabeth locks down the house and suggests Philip tries to glean information from Martha, his FBI informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Comrades |episodelink=Comrades (The Americans) |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |series= The Americans |serieslink=The Americans (2013 TV series) |network=FX |date=February 26, 2014 |season=Two |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Elizabeth learns that her daughter, Paige, has become deeply involved in a church that is active in liberal political causes. Elizabeth's reactions are mixed; on the one hand, she is pleased with Paige's growing awareness, but remains uncomfortable with its religious overtones. Upon discovering that her daughter has given all her savings to the church, Elizabeth punishes her by waking her up at 2 AM on a school night and forcing her to clean the house.

In the [[Echo (The Americans)|season finale]], Elizabeth is shocked to learn of the Center's plans to create a second generation of illegals composed of the U.S.-born children of KGB operatives indoctrinated and trained to infiltrate the American security agencies. The Connors' son, Jared, was the first to be contacted, with disastrous results—when his parents strenuously objected to his involvement in their espionage work, he killed them and his sister to protect his mission. Despite this tragedy, the Center tells the Jennings that it intends to continue with the program and that it expects them to begin grooming Paige. Both of the Jennings are horrified at first, but Elizabeth begins to warm to the idea, reasoning that Paige needs a cause to devote her life to and that she should know her parents' true identities and, by extension, her own.

==Personality==
Elizabeth grew up in poverty, and she developed a hard and icy exterior like her mother. The first 15 years of her marriage with Philip were relatively loveless. Elizabeth finally opens up to him after he kills her rapist. Initially, her newfound love for Philip is a conflict of interest to her because she has trouble constructively expressing and making sense of her own emotions. When Philip feels betrayed by her, they become dishonest with one another and briefly separate. It's only when Elizabeth is shot that she realizes how important Philip is in her life, and she realizes she can trust him with anything. She is intelligent, physically fit, and attractive. She is willing to use these qualities to manipulate people into giving her the information she needs.

Even though Elizabeth struggles to find a balance between making decisions with her newfound emotion versus the logic that has gotten her so far in her career, Philip is able to help her reach a collaborative decision; as they have become close friends and confidants as the show has progressed. Paige's adolescence is challenging for Elizabeth, particularly due to Paige becoming curious about her parents' activities. Elizabeth is a protective mother, and is around for her kids when they need her most despite being absent from the house most of the day working for the KGB. Elizabeth doesn't seem to have many hobbies, but she does enjoy bowling.

==Casting==
Former ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' star Russell spoke about the decision to work on another television series: "I thought the pilot script was just so interesting. It was so far from a [[Procedural drama|procedural]]. And [originally,] I didn't know that I wanted to do it. I always say no to everything. I never want to do anything. [Laughs.] But I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I read it...and I kept trying to figure it out, because it's so not clear. It's still not clear to me. But there's so many different levels to it."&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/the-americans-premiere-keri-russell-matthew-rhys_n_2584664.html |title='The Americans' Premiere: Keri Russell And Matthew Rhys Talk Sex, Spy Games And America Vs.

==Reception==
For her portrayal, Russell has been nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Drama]], the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] twice, three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s for [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series|Best Actress in a Drama Series]], one [[Satellite Award]] for [[Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama|Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama]], one [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television|Best Actress on Television]], and the [[Television Critics Association Award]] for [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama|Individual Achievement in Drama]].

'''Ernst Peter Wilhelm Troeltsch''' ({{IPA-de|tʁœltʃ|lang}}; 17 February 1865 – 1 February 1923) was a German [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] [[Protestant theologian]], writer on the [[philosophy of religion]] and the [[philosophy of history]], and a [[classical liberal]] politician. He was a member of the [[history of religions school]]. His work was a synthesis of a number of strands, drawing on [[Albrecht Ritschl]], [[Max Weber]]'s conception of [[sociology]], and the [[Baden school]] of [[Neo-Kantianism]].

His ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Church'' (''Die Soziallehren der christlichen Kirchen und Gruppen'', 1912)&lt;ref&gt;Two volume edition in translation by Harper Row, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; is a seminal work in theology.

==Life==
Troeltsch was born into a Lutheran family to a doctor but went to a Catholic school in a predominantly Catholic area before attending university at the [[University of Erlangen]] and then at the [[University of Göttingen]]. His ordination in 1889 was followed in 1891 by a post teaching theology at Göttingen. In 1892, he moved on to teach at the [[University of Bonn]]; in 1894, he moved on again to [[Heidelberg University]]. Finally, in 1915, he transferred to teach at what is now the [[University of Berlin]] where he took the title of professor of philosophy and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639|page=1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Throughout Troeltsch's life, he wrote frequently of his belief that changes in society posed a threat to Christian religion, that "the disenchantment of the world" as described by sociologist [[Max Weber]] was under way. At an academic conference that took place in 1896, following a paper on the doctrine of ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'', Troeltsch responded by saying "Gentlemen, everything is tottering!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crisis in consciousness: The Thought of Ernst Troeltsch|author=Robert J. Rubanowice|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Tallahassee|page=9|year=1982|isbn=0813007216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troeltsch sought to explain the decline of religion in the modern era through a description of the historical evolution of the role of religion in society. He described European civilisation as having three periods: [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[medieval]] and [[Modern history|modern]]. Troeltsch's understanding of the border between the medieval and modern periods is revisionary: instead of claiming that modernity starts with the rise of [[Protestantism]], Troeltsch argues that early Protestantism should be understood as a continuation of the medieval period. The modern period starts much later on his account, beginning only in the seventeenth century. The Renaissance in Italy and the scientific revolution planted the seeds for the arrival of the modern period, and Protestantism delayed rather than heralded its onset. Protestantism, Troeltsch argued, was "in the first place, simply a modification of Catholicism, in which the Catholic formulation of the problems was retained, while a different answer was given to them".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rubanowice, p. 21, from ''Protestantism and Progress'' (translated by W. Montgomery, 1958), p. 59. Original title: ''Die Bedeutung des Protestantismus für die Entstehung de modernen Welt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Troeltsch saw this distinction between early and late (or "neo-") Protestantism as "the presupposition for any historical understanding of Protestantism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Cite book|author=Toshimasa Yasukata|title=Ernst Troeltsch: Systematic Theologian of Radical Historicality|year=1986|isbn=1555400698|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, Georgia|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
Troeltsch developed three principles pertaining to critical [[historiography]]. Each of the principles served as a philosophical retort for the issue of the preconceived notions sustained by the historian. Troeltsch's three principles - the principle of criticism, the principle of analogy, and the principle of correlation - were determined to account for the issue surrounding the biases of the historian. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historian and The Believer: The Morality of Historical Knowledge and Christian Faith|last=Harvey|first=Van Austin|publisher=Macmillan Company|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principle of criticism ===
Troeltsch's claim in this principle concludes that absolutes within history cannot exist. Troeltsch surmised that judgments about the past must be varied. In such, the absolute truth of historical reality could not exist, rather, he claimed historical situation could only be examined as more likely or less likely to have happened. In this, Troeltsch understood to never create a finite and non-revisable claim. 

=== Principle of analogy ===
This principle pertains to averting the historian from applying anachronism to the past. Troeltsch understands that the probability in the former principle can only be validated if a historians present situation, when assessing the probability, is not radically different from the past. In this, Troeltsch expects that human nature has been fairly constant throughout time, however this clause is still included as a form of accountability for the historian's narrative. 

=== Principle of correlation ===
In regards to a historical events, Troeltsch determined, through this principle, humanity's historical life is interdependent upon each individual. This understanding applies a casual nature to all events, equaling thus, an effect. Any radical event, the historian should assume, effected the historical nexus immediately surrounding that event. Troeltsch determines that in historical explanation it is important to include antecedents and consequences of events. This is in an effort to maintain historical events in their conditioned time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gesammelte Schriften II|last=Troeltsch|first=Ernst|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=729-753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Troeltsch was politically a [[classical liberal]] and served as a member of the Parliament of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. In 1918, he joined the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). He strongly supported Germany's role in [[World War I]]: "Yesterday we took up arms. Listen to the [[ethos]] that resounds in the splendour of heroism: To your weapons, To your weapons!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/ernst-troeltsch-and-the-power-of-the-pen/a-17547502|title=Ernst Troeltsch and the power of the pen|publisher=DW.de|date=9 April 2014|author=Emma Wallis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the immediate aftermath of Troeltsch's death, his work was considered passé and irrelevant. This was part of a wider rejection of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] thought with the rise of [[Neo-Orthodoxy]] in Protestant theology, especially with the prominence of [[Karl Barth]] in the German speaking world. From 1960 onwards though, Troeltsch's thought has seen a revival of interest in academic circles with a variety of books being published on Troeltsch's theological and sociological work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/article/why-troeltsch-why-today-theology-for-the-21st-century/|title=Why Troeltsch?

She was caught in deceptive trickery as early as 1895, and the results were published. Yet believers continued to support her genuineness, as some do today, even though in an American investigation in 1910, her trickery was abundantly exposed.

Her [[Warsaw]] [[séance]]s at the turn of 1893–94 inspired several colorful scenes in the [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]'', which [[Bolesław Prus]] began writing in 1894.

==Early life==
Palladino was born into a peasant family in [[Minervino Murge]], [[Province of Bari|Bari Province]], Italy. She received little, if any, formal education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985).

University of Illinois Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-252-03564-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphaned as a child, she was taken in as a nursemaid by a family in Naples. In her early life, she was married to a travelling conjuror and theatrical artist Raphael Delgaiz whose store she helped to manage.&lt;ref&gt;Baron Johan Liljencrants. (1918).

Oxford University Press. p. 610. {{ISBN|978-0198163879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
Palladino visited [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], on two occasions.  Her first and longer visit was when she came at the importunities of the [[psychologist]], Dr. [[Julian Ochorowicz]], who hosted her from November 1893 to January 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''[[Bolesław Prus]]'', pp. 440, 443, 445–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the phenomena demonstrated at Palladino's [[séance]]s, Ochorowicz concluded against the spirit hypothesis and for a hypothesis that the phenomena were caused by a "fluidic action" and were performed at the expense of the medium's own powers and those of the other participants in the [[séance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Shepard.

Ochorowicz introduced Palladino to the journalist and [[novelist]] [[Bolesław Prus]], who attended a number of her séances, wrote about them in the [[newspaper|press]], and incorporated several [[Spiritualist]]-inspired scenes into his [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.

On 1 January 1894 Palladino called on Prus at his apartment. As described by Ochorowicz,

{{blockquote|"In the evening she visited Prus, whom she always adored.  Though their conversation was original, because the one did not know Polish and the other Italian, when ''il Prusso'' entered she went mad with joy and they somehow managed to communicate with one another.  So she saw it as her obligation to pay him a New Year's visit."&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''[[Bolesław Prus]]'', p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Palladino subsequently visited [[Warsaw]] in the second half of May 1898, on her way from [[St. Petersburg]] to [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].  At that time, Prus attended at least two of the three [[séances]] that she conducted (the two séances were held in the apartment of [[Ludwik Krzywicki]]).&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''[[Bolesław Prus]]'', p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==
In July 1895, Palladino was invited to [[England]] to [[Frederic William Henry Myers]]'s house in [[Cambridge]] for a series of investigations into her [[mediumship]].  According to reports by the investigators Myers and [[Oliver Lodge]], all the phenomena observed in the Cambridge sittings were the result of trickery. Her fraud was so clever, according to Myers, that it "must have needed long practice to bring it to its present level of skill."&lt;ref name="McCabe1920"&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/isspiritualismba00mccarich#page/14/mode/2up ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined'']. London, Watts &amp; Co. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cambridge sittings the results proved disastrous for her mediumship. During the séances Palladino was caught cheating in order to free herself from the physical controls of the experiments.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt; Palladino was found liberating her hands by placing the hand of the controller on her left on top of the hand of the controller on her right. Instead of maintaining any contact with her, the observers on either side were found to be holding each other's hands and this made it possible for her to perform tricks.&lt;ref name="Brower2001"&gt;M. Brady Brower. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]] had observed Palladino free a hand to move objects and use her feet to kick pieces of furniture in the room. Because of the discovery of fraud, the British SPR investigators such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[Frank Podmore]] considered Palladino's mediumship to be permanently discredited, and because of her fraud she was banned from any further experiments with the SPR in Britain.&lt;ref name="Brower2001"/&gt; The magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]], who was involved in the investigation, supported Hodgson's conclusion.&lt;ref name="Christopher 1"/&gt; However, despite the evidence of fraud, [[Oliver Lodge]] considered some of her phenomena genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne; Warren H. Jones. (2014). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. p. 216. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80508-6}} "In spite of overwhelming evidence that pointed to fraud, such as was found in the case of the notorious Neapolitan medium Eusapia Palladino, Sir Oliver Lodge, another English physicist, refused to change his favorable opinion of her."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' on 29 October 1895, Maskelyne published a long exposure of Palladino's fraudulent methods. According to historian [[Ruth Brandon]] "Maskelyne concluded that everything rested on the question whether Eusapia could get a hand or foot free occasionally. She wriggled so much that it was impossible to control her properly throughout. If she could get one hand, and sometimes a foot, free, everything could be explained."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Brandon]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. pp. 258-259. {{ISBN|0-297-78249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' on 9 November 1895 an article was published titled ''Exit Eusapia!''. The article questioned the scientific legitimacy of the [[Society for Psychical Research|SPR]] for investigating Palladino a medium who had a reputation of being a fraud and imposture.&lt;ref name="BMJ1"&gt;The British Medical Journal. (Nov. 9, 1895). ''Exit Eusapia!''. Volume. 2, No. 1819. p. 1182.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the article read "It would be comic if it were not deplorable to picture this sorry Egeria surrounded by men like Professor Sidgwick, Professor Lodge, Mr. F. H. Myers, Dr. Schiaparelli, and Professor Richet, solemnly receiving her pinches and kicks, her finger skiddings, her sleight of hand with various articles of furniture as phenomena calling for serious study."&lt;ref name="BMJ1"/&gt; This caused [[Henry Sidgwick]] to respond in a published letter to the ''British Medical Journal'' of 16 November 1895. According to Sidgwick SPR members had exposed the fraud of Palladino at the Cambridge sittings. Sidgwick wrote "Throughout this period we have continually combated and exposed the frauds of professional mediums, and have never yet published in our Proceedings, any report in favour of the performances of any of them."&lt;ref name="BMJ2"&gt;The British Medical Journal. (Nov. 16, 1895). ''Exit Eusapia''. Volume 2, No. 1820. pp. 1263-1264.&lt;/ref&gt; The response from the "BMJ" questioned why the SPR wasted time investigating phenomena that were the "result of jugglery and imposture" and did not urgently concern the welfare of mankind.&lt;ref name="BMJ2"/&gt;

In 1898, Myers was invited to a series of séances in Paris with [[Charles Richet]]. In contrast to the previous séances in which he had observed fraud, he now claimed to have observed convincing phenomena.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim1985"&gt;Janet Oppenheim. (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 150-151. {{ISBN|978-0521265058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick reminded Myers of Palladino's trickery in the previous investigations as "overwhelming" but Myers did not change his position. This enraged [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], then editor of SPR publications, who banned Myers from publishing anything on his recent sittings with Palladino in the SPR journal. Hodgson was convinced Palladino was a fraud and supported Sidgwick in the "attempt to put that vulgar cheat Eusapia beyond the pale."&lt;ref name="Oppenheim1985"/&gt; It wasn't until the 1908 sittings in Naples that the SPR reopened the Palladino file.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''. Prometheus Books. p. 61. {{ISBN|978-1591020868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British psychical researcher [[Harry Price]], who studied Palladino's mediumship, wrote "Her tricks were usually childish: long hairs attached to small objects in order to produce 'telekinetic movements'; the gradual substitution of one hand for two when being controlled by sitters; the production of 'phenomena' with a foot which had been surreptitiously removed from its shoe and so on."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]], ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research'', chapter XI: The Mechanics of Spiritualism, F&amp;W Media International, Ltd, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychical researcher [[Charles Richet]] with Oliver Lodge, [[Frederic William Henry Myers]] and [[Julian Ochorowicz]] investigated the medium Palladino in the summer of 1894 at his house in the Ile Roubaud in the Mediterranean. Richet claimed furniture moved during the séance and that some of the phenomena was the result of a supernatural agency.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt; However, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]] claimed there was inadequate control during the séances and the precautions described did not rule out trickery. Hodgson wrote all the phenomena "described could be account for on the assumption that Eusapia could get a hand or foot free." Lodge, Myers and Richet disagreed, but Hodgson was later proven correct in the Cambridge sittings as Palladino was observed to have used tricks exactly the way he had described them.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt;

In 1898, the [[France|French]] astronomer [[Eugene Antoniadi]] investigated the mediumship of Palladino at the house of [[Camille Flammarion]]. According to Antoniadi her performance was "fraud from beginning to end". Palladino tried constantly to free her hands from control and was caught lowering a letter-scale by means of a hair.&lt;ref name="McCabe1920"/&gt;

Flammarion who attended séances with Palladino believed that some of her phenomena was genuine. He produced in his book alleged levitation photographs of a table and an impression of a face in [[putty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Camille Flammarion]]. (1909). [https://archive.org/stream/mysteriouspsychi00flamuoft#page/62/mode/2up ''Mysterious Psychic Forces'']. Small, Maynard and Company. pp. 63-135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] did not find the evidence convincing. He noted that the impressions of faces in putty were always of Palladino's face and could have easily been made, and she was not entirely clear from the table in the levitation photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/isspiritualismba00mccarich#page/57/mode/2up ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?: The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined'']. London, Watts &amp; Co. p. 57. "The impressions of faces which she got in wax or putty were always her face. I have seen many of them. The strong bones of her face impress deep. Her nose is relatively flattened by the pressure. The hair on the temples is plain. It is outrageous for scientific men to think that either "John King" or an abnormal power of the medium made a human face (in a few minutes) with bones and muscles and hair, and precisely the same bones and muscles and hair as those of Eusapia. I have seen dozens of photographs of her levitating a table. On not a single one are her person and dress entirely clear of the table."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Eusapia Palladino came to Paris, where Nobel-laureate [[physicists]] [[Pierre Curie]] and [[Marie Curie]] and Nobel-laureate physiologist [[Charles Richet]] investigated her amongst other philosophers and scientists such as [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval]]. Signs of trickery were detected but they could not explain all of the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation''. Prometheus Books. p. 60. {{ISBN|978-0879751197}} "These experiments extended over three years at a cost of 25,000 francs. They were attended by the great French scientists Pierre and Marie Curie, D'Arsonval, the physicist; Henri Bergson, the philosopher; Richet the physiologist; and numerous other scientists and savants. The French committee detected many signs of trickery on Eusapia's part, but they were clearly puzzled by some of the phenomena."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the Curies' circle of scientist friends—including [[William Crookes]]; future Nobel laureate [[Jean Perrin]] and his wife Henriette; [[Louis Georges Gouy]]; and [[Paul Langevin]]—were also exploring spiritualism, as was Pierre Curie's brother Jacques, a fervent believer.&lt;ref name=goldsmith138&gt;[[Barbara Goldsmith]]. (2005). ''Obsessive Genius:  The Inner World of Marie Curie''. W. W. Norton. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0739453056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curies regarded mediumistic séances as "scientific experiments" and took detailed notes. According to historian Anna Hurwic, they thought it possible to discover in spiritualism the source of an unknown energy that would reveal the secret of radioactivity.&lt;ref name=goldsmith138/&gt; On July 24, 1905, Pierre Curie reported to his friend Gouy: "We have had a series of séances with Eusapia Palladino at the [Society for Psychical Research]."

{{blockquote|It was very interesting, and really the phenomena that we saw appeared inexplicable as trickery—tables raised from all four legs, movement of objects from a distance, hands that pinch or caress you, luminous apparitions.  All in a [setting] prepared by us with a small number of spectators all known to us and without a possible accomplice.  The only trick possible is that which could result from an extraordinary facility of the medium as a magician.  But how do you explain the phenomena when one is holding her hands and feet and when the light is sufficient so that one can see everything that happens?&lt;ref name="Quinn 1995"&gt;[[Susan Quinn]]. (1995). ''Marie Curie: A Life''. Simon and Schuster. pp. 208-226. {{ISBN|0-671-67542-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Pierre was eager to enlist Gouy. Palladino, he informed him, would return in November, and "I hope that we will be able to convince you of the reality of the phenomena or at least some of them." Pierre was planning to undertake experiments "in a methodical fashion."&lt;ref name="Quinn 1995"/&gt; [[Marie Curie]] also attended Palladino's séances, but does not seem to have been as intrigued by them as Pierre.&lt;ref name="Quinn 1995"/&gt;

On 14 April 1906, just five days before his accidental death, Pierre Curie wrote Gouy about his last séance with Palladino:  "There is here, in my opinion, a whole domain of entirely new facts and physical states in space of which we have no conception."&lt;ref name="Quinn 1995"/&gt;

Professors [[Gustave Le Bon]] and [[Albert Dastre]] of [[Paris University]] examined Palladino in 1906 and concluded that she was a cheat. They installed a secret lamp behind Palladino and, at a [[séance]], saw her release and use her foot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History From 1847''. T. F. Unwin Ltd. p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Palladino was found using a strand of her hair to move an object toward herself and it was noted by investigators that the objects were not outside of her easy reach.&lt;ref&gt;Sofie Lachapelle.

==Italy==

In the late 19th century [[Cesare Lombroso]] attended séances with Palladino and was convinced that she had [[supernatural]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation''. Prometheus Books. p. 59. {{ISBN|978-0879751197}} "Eusapia was introduced to Lombroso in 1888, and, by 1891, she had convinced him of her supernatural powers. This, it should be noted, need not have presented her with as much difficulty as might appear. Lombroso was no hidebound skeptic. In 1882, he had reported the case of a patient who, having lost the power of seeing with her eyes, saw as clearly as before with the aid of the tip of her nose and the lobe of her left ear."&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso was persuaded by Palladino's manager, [[Ercole Chiaia]], to attend her séances. Chiaia challenged the reputed scientist in an open letter in the magazine ''La Fanfulla'', pointing out that if Lombroso was unbiased and free to prejudice, he should be willing to investigate her phenomena. Lombroso's subsequent conversion was reported by the press in Italy and the world, becoming instrumental for Palladino's reaching the status of a veritable celebrity at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Supernatural Entertainments: Victorian Spiritualism and the Rise of Modern Media Culture|last = Natale|first = Simone|publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press|year = 2016|isbn = 978-0-271-07104-6|location = University Park, PA|pages = 96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extraordinary was a phenomenon that Lombroso titled "The Levitation of the Medium to the Top of the Table."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare Lombroso]]. (1909). [https://archive.org/stream/afterdeathwhat00lomb#page/49/mode/2up ''After Death — What?'']. Small, Maynard &amp; Company Publishers. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitations]] of the table were found by other investigators to be the result of fraud.&lt;ref name="Christopher 1" /&gt; According to authors William Kalush and [[Larry Sloman]], Lombroso was having a [[sexual relationship]] with Palladino.&lt;ref&gt;William Kalush, [[Larry Sloman]]. (2006). ''The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero''. Atria Books. p. 419. {{ISBN|978-0743272087}} "The most notorious medium who used her sexual charms to seduce her scientific investigators was Eusapia Palladino... [She] had no qualms about sleeping with her sitters; among them were the eminent criminologist Lombroso and the Nobel Prize—winning French Physiologist Charles Richet. After being discredited, Palladino's career was revived in 1909 when Hereward Carrington, acting as her manager, brought her to the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso's daughter Gina Ferrero wrote that during the later years of his life Lombroso suffered from [[arteriosclerosis]] and his mental and physical health was wrecked. [[Joseph McCabe]] wrote that because of this it is not surprising that Palladino managed to fool him with her tricks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920).

[[Henry Morselli|Enrico Morselli]] was also interested in mediumship and psychical research. He studied Palladino and concluded that some of her phenomena was genuine, being evidence for an unknown bio-psychic force present in all humans.&lt;ref&gt;Brancaccio, Maria Teresa. (2014).

[[File:Palladino Naples Seance Layout.png|thumb|right|Sketch showing the layout of a séance in the 1908 Naples investigation.]]
In 1908, the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) appointed a committee of three to examine Palladino in [[Naples]]. The committee comprised Mr. [[Hereward Carrington]], investigator for the American Society for Psychical Research and an amateur conjurer; Mr. [[W. W. Baggally]], also an investigator and amateur conjurer of much experience; and the Hon. [[Everard Feilding]], who had had an extensive training as investigator and "a fairly complete education at the hands of fraudulent mediums."&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2003"/&gt; Three adjoining rooms on the fifth floor of the Hotel Victoria were rented. The middle room where Feilding slept was used in the evening for the séances.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Douglas. (1982). ''Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research''. Overlook Press. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In the corner of the room was a séance cabinet created by a pair of black curtains to form an enclosed area that contained a small round table with several musical instruments. In front of the curtains was placed a wooden table. During the séances, Palladino would sit at this table with her back to the curtains. The investigators sat on either side of her, holding her hand and placing a foot on her foot.&lt;ref name="Podmore1910"&gt;[[Frank Podmore]]. (1910). [https://archive.org/stream/newerspiritualis00podmrich#page/114/mode/2up ''The Newer Spiritualism'']. Henry Holt and Company. pp. 114-44&lt;/ref&gt; Guest visitors also attended some of the séances; the Feilding report mentions that Professor Bottazzi and Professor Galeotti were present at the fourth séance, and a Mr. Ryan was present at the eighth séance.&lt;ref name="Podmore1910"/&gt;

Although the investigators caught Palladino cheating, they were convinced Palladino produced genuine [[supernatural]] phenomena such as levitations of the table, movement of the curtains, movement of objects from behind the curtain and touches from hands.&lt;ref name="Podmore1910"/&gt; Regarding the first report by Carrington and Feilding, the American scientist and philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] wrote:

{{cquote|Eusapia Palladino has been proved to be a very clever prestigiateuse and cheat, and was visited by a Mr. Carrington.... In point of fact he has often caught the Palladino creature in acts of fraud. Some of her performances, however, he cannot explain; and thereupon he urges the theory that these are supernatural, or, as he prefers it "supernormal." Well, I know how it is that when a man has been long intensely excercised and over fatigued by an enigma, his common-sense will sometimes desert him; but it seems to me that the Palladino has simply been too clever for him.... I think it more plausible that there are tricks that can deceive Mr. Carrington.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justus Buchler]]. (2000). ''The Philosophy of Peirce: Selected Writings, Volume 2''. Indiana University Press. pp. 166-167. {{ISBN|978-0253211903}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Eusapia Palladino 3.jpg|thumb|Palladino, ca. 1900]]

[[Frank Podmore]] in his book ''The Newer Spiritualism'' (1910) wrote a comprehensive critique of the Feilding report. Podmore said that the report provided insufficient information for crucial moments and the investigators representation of the witness accounts contained contradictions and inconsistencies as to who was holding Palladino's feet and hands.&lt;ref name="Podmore1910"/&gt; Podmore found accounts among the investigators conflicted as to who they claimed to have observed the incident. Podmore wrote that the report "at almost every point leaves obvious loopholes for trickery."&lt;ref name="Podmore1910"/&gt; During the séances the long black curtains were often intermixed with Palladino's long black dress. Palladino told Professor Bottazzi the black curtains were "indispensable." Researchers have suspected Palladino used the curtain to conceal her feet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 490. {{ISBN|978-1573920216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[C. E. M. Hansel]] criticized the Feilding report based on the conditions of the séances being susceptible to trickery. Hansel noted that they were performed in semi-dark conditions, held in the late night or early morning introducing the possibility of [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and the "investigators had a strong belief in the supernatural, hence they would be emotionally involved."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation''. Prometheus Books. p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0879751197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, [[Everard Feilding]] returned to Naples, without Hereward Carrington and [[W. W. Baggally]]. Instead, he was accompanied by his friend, [[William Marriott (magician)|William S. Marriott]], a magician of some distinction who had exposed psychic fraud in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2001). ''Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. p. 91. {{ISBN|978-1573928960}} "William S. Marriott was a London professional magician who performed under the name of "Dr. Wilmar" and who, for some time, interested himself in Spiritualism. In 1910 he had been asked by the SPR to take part in a series of sittings with the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino, and had concluded that all he had seen could be attributed to fakery. That same year he published four articles for ''Pearson's'' magazine in which he detailed and duplicated in photographs various tricks of self-claimed psychics and mediums."&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was to repeat the famous earlier 1908 Naples sittings with Palladino. Unlike the 1908 sittings which had baffled the investigators, this time Feilding and Marriott detected her cheating, just as she had done in the US.&lt;ref name="Christopher 2"&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]].

Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research 15: 20-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Her deceptions were obvious. Palladino evaded control and was caught moving objects with her foot, shaking the curtain with her hands, moving the cabinet table with her elbow and touching the séance sitters. [[Milbourne Christopher]] wrote regarding the exposure "when one knows how a feat can be done and what to look for, only the most skillful performer can maintain the illusion in the face of such informed scrutiny."&lt;ref name="Christopher 2"/&gt;

In 1992, [[Richard Wiseman]] analyzed the Feilding report of Palladino and argued that she employed a secret accomplice that could enter the room by a fake door panel positioned near the séance cabinet. Wiseman discovered this trick was already mentioned in a book from 1851, he also visited a carpenter and skilled magician who constructed a door within an hour with a false panel. The accomplice was suspected to be her second husband, who insisted on bringing Palladino to the hotel where the séances took place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (1997). Chapter 3 ''The Feilding Report: A Reconsideration''. In ''Deception and Self-Deception: Investigating Psychics''. Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-57392-121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Kurtz]] suggested that Carrington could have been Palladino's secret accomplice. Kurtz found it suspicious that he was raised as her manager after the séances in Naples. Carrington was also absent on the night of the last séance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985).

==America==
[[File:Hugo Munsterberg.jpg|thumb|200x200px|right|[[Hugo Münsterberg]]]]
Palladino visited America in 1909 with [[Hereward Carrington]] as her manager.&lt;ref name="Hansel 1980"/&gt; Her arrival was accompanied by a veritable campaign in the American popular press, with newspapers such as the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] and magazines such as the [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]] publishing numerous articles on the Italian medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Supernatural Entertainments: Victorian Spiritualism and the Rise of Modern Media Culture|last = Natale|first = Simone|publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press|year = 2016|isbn = 978-0-271-07104-6|location = University Park, PA|pages = 92–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magician [[Howard Thurston]] attended a séance and endorsed Palladino's levitation of a table as genuine.&lt;ref name="Christopher 1"/&gt; However, at a séance on 18 December in New York, the Harvard psychologist [[Hugo Münsterberg]] with the help of a hidden man lying under a table, caught her levitating the table with her foot.&lt;ref name="Hansel 1980"/&gt; He had also observed Palladino free her foot from her shoe and use her toes to move a guitar in the séance cabinet.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt; Münsterberg also claimed that Palladino moved the curtains from a distance in the room by releasing a jet of air from a rubber bulb that she had in her hand.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Seabrook]].

Her tricks had been exposed many times before, yet she had prospered."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Cohen (children's writer)|Daniel Cohen]]. (1972). ''In Search of Ghosts''. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. p. 109. {{ISBN|978-0396064855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposure was not taken seriously by Palladino's defenders.&lt;ref name="Notzing 1923"&gt;[[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]].

In January, 1910 a series of séance sittings were held at the physics laboratory at [[Columbia University]]. Scientists such as [[Robert W. Wood]] and [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]] attended. The magicians W. S. Davis, J. L. Kellogg, J. W. Sargent and [[Joseph Rinn]] were present in the last séance sittings in April. They discovered that Palladino had freed her left foot to perform the phenomena. Rinn gave a full account of fraudulent behavior observed in a séance of Palladino.&lt;ref name="Hansel 1980"/&gt; [[Milbourne Christopher]] summarized the exposure:

{{blockquote|Joseph F. Rinn and Warner C. Pyne, clad in black coveralls, had crawled into the dining room of Columbia professor Herbert G. Lord's house while a Palladino seance was in progress. Positioning themselves under the table, they saw the medium's foot strike a table leg to produce raps. As the table tilted to the right, due to pressure of her right hand on the surface, they saw her put her left foot under the left table leg. Pressing down on the tabletop with her left hand and up with her left foot under the table leg to form a clamp, she lifted her foot and "levitated" the table from the floor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1979). ''Search for the Soul''. Crowell. p. 47. {{ISBN|978-0690017601}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Palladino was offered $1000 by Rinn if she could perform a feat in controlled conditions that could not be duplicated by magicians. Palladino eventually agreed to the contest but did not turn up for it, and instead returned to Italy.&lt;ref name="Hansel 1980"/&gt;

==Tricks==
[[File:Joseph Jastrow.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Jastrow]], a notable skeptic of Palladino's mediumship.]]

In [[England]], [[United States of America|America]], [[France]] and [[Germany]], Palladino had been caught utilizing tricks.&lt;ref name="Jastrow1918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilgard1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2003"/&gt; Psychical researchers such as [[Hereward Carrington]] who believed some of her phenomena to be genuine, accepted that she would resort to trickery on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (1909). [https://archive.org/stream/eusapiapalladino1909carr#page/326/mode/2up ''Eusapia Palladino and Her Phenomena'']. New York: B. W. Dodge. pp. 327-328&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Peter Lamont (historian)|Peter Lamont]] has written that although Palladino's defenders accepted that she would cheat, they "pointed to the best evidence (where, they argued, fraud had been impossible), [but] critics argued that the investigators had simply missed it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Peter Lamont]]. (2013). ''Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem''. Cambridge University Press. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-1107688025}} "Palladino was no simple case: on the one hand, she was regularly caught cheating, even by those who continued to express belief; on the other hand, she was reported to have produced genuine phenomena at times, in front of experienced and (previously) sceptical observers. For proponents, she was another example of the genuine but fraudulent demonstrator of extraordinary phenomena... Critics pointed to evidence of fraud, proponents pointed to the best evidence (where, they argued, fraud had been impossible), and critics argued that the investigators had simply missed it."&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of fraud and Palladino, the philosopher and skeptic [[Paul Kurtz]] wrote:

{{blockquote|[Palladino] was caught red-handed in blatant acts of fraud by members of the Society for Psychical Research in Cambridge and by scientific teams at Columbia and Harvard Universities. She was shown to be substituting her hand or foot and using them in darkened seances to move objects so that they appeared to be levitating. Even her defenders conceded that she cheated, at least some of the time. The problem that puzzles me is this; If one finds sleight-of-hand techniques being used some of the time by such individuals, then why should one accept anything else that is presented by them as genuine?... Skeptics question the first Feilding report because in a subsequent test by Feilding and other tests by scientists, Palladino had been caught cheating.&lt;ref&gt;Vern L. Bullough; Timothy J. Madigan. (1994). ''Toward a New Enlightenment: The Philosophy of Paul Kurtz''. Transaction Publishers. p. 159. {{ISBN|978-1560001188}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In 1910, [[Stanley LeFevre Krebs]] wrote an entire book debunking Palladino and exposing the tricks she had used throughout her career, ''Trick Methods of Eusapia Paladino''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley LeFevre Krebs]]. (1910). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89090346453#page/333/mode/1up ''Trick Methods of Eusapia Paladino''].&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Joseph Jastrow]], in his book ''The Psychology of Conviction'' (1918), included a chapter exposing Palladino's tricks.&lt;ref name="Jastrow1918"/&gt;

Magicians such as [[Harry Houdini]] and Joseph Rinn have claimed all her feats were conjuring tricks.&lt;ref name="Houdini 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rinn 1950"/&gt; According to Houdini "Palladino cheated at Cambridge, she cheated in l'Aguélas, and she cheated in New York and yet each time that she was caught cheating the Spiritualists upheld her, excused her, and forgave her. Truly their logic sometimes borders on the humorous."&lt;ref name="Houdini 2011"/&gt;

[[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]] noted that "Palladino was caught cheating times without number even by those who believed in her, and she made no bones about admitting it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]]. (1938). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 127. {{ISBN|978-1111354879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have suspected that Palladino's first husband a travelling conjuror taught her séance tricks.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawcliffe 1988"/&gt; The magician [[Milbourne Christopher]] demonstrated Palladino's fraudulent techniques in his stage performances and on [[Johnny Carson]]'s "Tonight Show".&lt;ref name="Christopher 1"/&gt;

Palladino dictated the [[lighting]] and "controls" that were to be used in her mediumistic [[séance]]s. The fingertips of her right hand rested upon the back of the hand of one "controller."  Her left hand was grasped at the wrist by a second controller seated on her other side. Her feet rested on top of the feet of her controllers, sometimes beneath them. A controller's foot was in contact with only the toe of her shoe. Occasionally her ankles were tied to the legs of her chair, but they were given a play of four inches. During the sitting in semi-darkness, her ankles would become free. Generally she was unbound. In one instance, a controller cut her free so that phenomena might occur.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandon 1983"&gt;[[Ruth Brandon]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0394527406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Lipps]] who attended a séance sitting in 1898 in [[Munich]] noticed that, instead of Palladino's hand, he held the hand of the sitter controlling the left side of the medium. In this way Palladino had freed both hands. She was also discovered using trickery by others in Germany.&lt;ref name="Notzing 1923"/&gt; [[Max Dessoir]] and [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] of [[Berlin]] detected the precise substitution tricks that were used by Palladino. Dessoir and Moll wrote: "The main point is cleverly to distract attention and to release one or both hands or one or both feet. This is Paladino's chief trick".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]]. (1918). [https://archive.org/stream/psychologyofconv00jast#page/110/mode/2up ''The Psychology of Conviction'']. Houghton Mifflin Company. pp. 100-111. "Both Dr. Moll and Dr. Dessoir, of Berlin, detected the precise substitution-tricks that were used in New York. The main point is cleverly to distract attention and to release one or both hands or one or both feet. This is Paladino's chief trick. Dr. Moll records the throwing out of the curtain to cover the hand substitution; and notes that, by watching for it, he could detect the exact moment when the hand or foot was freed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladino normally refused to allow someone beneath the table to hold her feet with his hands. She refused to levitate the table from a standing position. The table being rectangular, she had to sit only at a short side. No wall of any kind could stand between Palladino and the table. The weight of the table was seventeen pounds. The table levitated to a height of 3 to 10 inches for a maximum of 2–3 seconds.&lt;ref name="Podmore 2"&gt;[[Frank Podmore]]. (1910). [https://archive.org/stream/newerspiritualis00podmrich#page/87/mode/2up ''The Newer Spiritualism'']. Henry Holt and Company. pp. 87-113&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert at freeing a hand or foot to produce phenomena. She chose to sit at the short side of the table so that her controllers on each side had to sit closer together, making it easier to deceive them.&lt;ref name="Jastrow1918"/&gt; 
[[File:Eusapia-Palladino-fake-ectoplasm.jpg|thumb|left|Palladino with fake [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] hands.]]
Her [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] of a table began by freeing one foot, rocking the table, and then slipping her toe under one leg. Since she sat at the narrow end of the table, this was made possible.&lt;ref name="Christopher 1"/&gt; She lifted the table by rocking back on the heel of this foot. She made the "spirit" raps by striking a leg of the table with a free foot.&lt;ref name="Christopher 1"/&gt;

A photograph, taken in the dark, of a small stool that was alleged to have levitated was revealed to be sitting on Palladino's head. After she saw this photo, the stool remained immobile on the floor. A plaster impression taken of a spirit hand matched Palladino's hand. She was caught using a hair to move a [[Weighing scale|scale]]. In the dim light, her fist, wrapped in a handkerchief, became a materialized spirit.&lt;ref name="Podmore 2"/&gt;

Science historian [[Sherrie Lynne Lyons]] wrote that the glowing or light-emitting hands in séances could easily be explained by the rubbing of oil of [[phosphorus]] on the hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherrie Lynne Lyons]]. (2010). ''Species, Serpents, Spirits, and Skulls: Science at the Margins in the Victorian Age''. State University of New York Press. p. 95. {{ISBN|978-1438427980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 an article was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' titled "Paladino Used Phosphorus". [[Hereward Carrington]] confessed to having painted Palladino's arm with phosphorescent paint, however he claimed to have used the paint to track the movement of her arm, to detect fraud. There was publicity over the incident and Carrington claimed his comments had been misquoted by newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813FF395D12738DDDA00994D9415B898CF1D3 ''Paladino Used Phosphorus'']. November 19, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conjuror W. S. Davis published an article (with diagrams) exposing the tricks of Palladino. Davis also speculated that she used a piece of wire that she hid in her dress to tilt the séance table. Davis noted that when an attempt had been made to place a screen between her and the table she protested. Davis wrote she could not lift the table unless her dress was in contact with it and there is no obstruction between herself and the table.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. (1909). [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/11/21/106723441.pdf ''Sidelights on the Paladino Delusion'']. November 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Physician [[Leonard Keene Hirshberg]] who attended a séance, observed Palladino to have "hook[ed] her skirt and foot into a tiny reed table behind her" he also noted that he heard a noise that sounded like "a piece of wire, pin, or toe-nail groping its way under the table."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Keene Hirshberg|Hirshberg, Leonard Keene]]. (1910). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059416050;view=1up;seq=173 ''The Case Against Madame Eusapia Palladino'']. ''The Medical Critic and Guide'' 13: 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Millais Culpin]] wrote that Palladino was a conscious cheat but also had symptoms of [[Hysteria|hysterical]] [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] so may have deceived herself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Millais Culpin]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism and the New Psychology: An Explanation of Spiritualist Phenomena and Beliefs in Terms of Modern Knowledge''. Edward Arnold, London. pp. 143-149&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Finch editor of the ''Annals of Psychical Science'' wrote in 1909 that Palladino had "erotic tendencies" and some of her male séance sitters were deluded or "glamoured" by her presence.&lt;ref&gt;Baron Johan Liljencrants. (1918). ''Spiritism and Religion. "Can you talk to the dead?"''. Devin-Adair Publishing Company. p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deborah Blum]], Palladino had a habit of "climbing into the laps of the male" investigators.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Blum]]. (2007). ''Ghost Hunters: William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death''. Penguin Books. {{ISBN|978-0143038955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M. Lamar Keene]] noted that "observers said that Eusapia Palladino used to experience obvious orgasmic reactions during her séances and had a marked propensity for handsome male sitters."&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Lamar Keene]]. (1997). ''[[The Psychic Mafia]]''. Prometheus Books. p. 74. {{ISBN|978-1573921619}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Palladino admitted to an American reporter that she cheated in her séances, claiming her sitters had 'willed' her to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall]]. (1972). ''The Table-Rappers''. Book Club Associates. p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Dingwall]] who investigated the mediumship of Palladino came to the conclusion that she was "vital, vulgar, amorous and a cheat."&lt;ref&gt;David C. Knight. (1969). ''The ESP Reader''. Grossett &amp; Dunlap. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The case involved an employee's right to wear a religious necklace outside her clothes while working. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] awarded her damages for the UK government's failure to protect her rights.

The case has been widely reported in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[News media|media]] because various groups {{Vague|date=February 2009}} have argued that it shows either anti-[[Christian]] [[prejudice]] in the UK,&lt;ref name="Woman to sue BA in necklace row"&gt;{{cite news  | title = Woman to sue BA in necklace row  | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-10-15  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6052608.stm | accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, favouritism towards people of [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Editorial: Christian Bullies Press Their Advantage | publisher = [[National Secular Society]] | date = 2006-11-26 | url = http://www.secularism.org.uk/editorialchristianbulliespressth.html | accessdate = 2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BA needs defending from religious zealots, not the other way round | publisher = [[National Secular Society]] | date = 2008-01-18 | url = http://www.secularism.org.uk/baneedsdefendingfromreligiouszea.html | accessdate = 2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
In October 2006, Nadia Eweida, a Christian employee of British Airways, was asked to cover up a [[cross necklace]] which depicted a [[Christian cross]], and was placed on unpaid leave when she refused either to do so or to accept a position where she did not have to cover it up. She was wearing the necklace on the outside of her uniform, contravening BA's uniform policy for jewellery. Eweida planned to sue the airline for [[religious discrimination]]. Some Christian groups accused British Airways of double standards, as [[Sikh]] and [[Muslim]] employees are not prevented from wearing religious garments at work, since these are impractical to cover up.&lt;ref name="Woman to sue BA in necklace row"/&gt;  Although the wearing of garments is a requirement in some faiths, in this case, British Airways believes that wearing a cross is not necessary in Christianity, in general.

Eweida lost an initial appeal to her employers on 20 November, but publicly stated she would continue to dispute BA's policy, and that she wished to wear the cross to [[wikt:Special:Search/manifestation|manifest]] her religion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Woman loses fight to wear cross  | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-11-20  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6052608.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BBC]] quoted her as saying, "It is important to wear it to express my faith so that other people will know that [[Jesus]] loves them."&lt;ref name="Archbishop attacks BA cross rules"&gt;{{cite news | title = Archbishop attacks BA cross rules | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-11-21 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/6166746.stm | accessdate = 2006-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Secular Society]] argued it was sensible for staff handling baggage to be prohibited from wearing jewellery over their uniforms, said that Eweida was trying to [[evangelise]] in the workplace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BA Should Not Be Bullied Over Jewellery Ban, Especially by Government Ministers | publisher = [[National Secular Society]] | date = 2006-11-22 | url = http://www.secularism.org.uk/bashouldnotbebulliedoverjeweller.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that BA should have the right to insist that its uniform is neutral.&lt;ref name="Archbishop attacks BA cross rules"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Editorial: Christian Bullies Press Their Advantage | publisher = [[National Secular Society]] | date = 2006-11-26 | url = http://www.secularism.org.uk/editorialchristianbulliespressth.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BA, having had the same policy with regard to jewellery being worn with the uniform for a long time, with which other staff were comfortable, responded to pressure and  announced on 25 November a review of its uniform policy which could allow the wearing of a lapel badge.  The Archbishop of Canterbury disclosed that the issue had been raised with the Church Commissioners, who look after Anglicans' financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  BA's climbdown follows tirade from archbishop | publisher = ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' | date = 2006-11-25 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/25/ncross125.xml | accessdate = 2006-12-01 | location=London | first1=Jonathan | last1=Petre | first2=David | last2=Millward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day Eweida declared that this compromise was unacceptable to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BA cross women vows no compromise as 92-per cent of public back her |publisher=ThisisLondon.co.uk |date=2006-11-26 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23376019-details/BA%20cross%20women%20vows%20no%20compromise%20as%2092-per%20cent%20of%20public%20back%20her/article.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913144814/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23376019-details/BA%20cross%20women%20vows%20no%20compromise%20as%2092-per%20cent%20of%20public%20back%20her/article.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November, the Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], publicly stated that in his view the issue was not worth BA fighting and that it would be best for the airline "just to do the sensible thing": i.e. allow the cross to be worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  Blair chides British Airways for fighting employee over cross | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = 2006-11-28 | url = http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1958474,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 | location=London | first=Ashley | last=Seager}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair advises BA to end cross row | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2006-11-27 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6188606.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2007 BA announced that they would in future allow employees to wear a symbol of faith "openly" on a lapel pin, "with some flexibility ... to wear a symbol of faith on a chain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6280311.stm | title=BA drops ban on wearing crosses  | date=19 January 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bapress.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bapress.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_faqid=7314] {{Dead link|date=August 2011|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
===Employment Tribunal===
Although BA changed its policy, it refused to pay Eweida for the period of her suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2009/24-09-09-british-airways-attempts-to-force-freedom-of-conscience-case-out-.shtml]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic|fix-attempted=yes}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eweida opted to pursue her case against BA at an employment tribunal, citing the original BA ruling as a form of discrimination against Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = BA worker 'speechless' after losing cross case  | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | date = 9 January 2008  | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3158620.ece | accessdate = 2008-01-22  | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2008, after rejecting an out of court settlement offer reported at £8,500, Eweida lost her case. It was rejected on the grounds that she had breached the firm's regulations without good cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = BA worker loses discrimination case over cross  | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = 9 January 2008  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2237603,00.html | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | location=London | first=Lee | last=Glendinning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal commented that it was "not a tribunal of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandberg|first=Russell|year=2008|title=Eweida v British Airways|journal=Law and Justice|volume=160|pages=56–59|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribunal's report highlighted several other issues regarding Eweida's conduct at BA, including refusing to work on [[Christmas Day]] and telling a [[gay]] colleague that he could still be "redeemed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = A cross to bear  | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = 17 January 2008  | url = http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/terry_sanderson/2008/01/a_cross_to_bear.html | accessdate = 2008-01-22 | location=London | first=Terry | last=Sanderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eweida indicated that she would continue to fight her employers while retaining her position at the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = British Airways worker loses discrimination battle to wear crucifix | publisher = ''[[Daily Mail]]'' | date = 2008-01-09 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=506963&amp;in_page_id=1770 | accessdate = 2008-01-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment Appeal Tribunal===
In the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Elias J refused Ms Eweida's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;See [2009] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2008/0123_08_2011.html IRLR 78], [2009] ICR 303&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeal===
Eweida first appealed to the Court of Appeal for a costs capping order, which was shortly refused.&lt;ref&gt;See [2009] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/1025.html EWCA Civ 1025]&lt;/ref&gt; She then appealed on substantive grounds, which also failed in February, 2010.&lt;ref name="guardian_201002_coa"&gt;[[The Guardian]], 12 February 2010, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/12/christian-british-airways-worker-cross Christian BA worker loses appeal over cross]&lt;/ref&gt; Sedley LJ upheld the judgment of the EAT.&lt;ref&gt;[2010] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/80.html EWCA Civ 80]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, after the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] refused to hear her case, Ms. Eweida announced her intention to seek redress in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg, the ultimate appeal court applicable to UK law.&lt;ref name="pa_201010_echr"&gt;[[Press Association]], 22 October 2010, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5j7F-Wipi-2_Yue1BX-OWz8mHXg-Q?docId=B19608461287682275A00 Christian BA worker takes cross case to Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Court of Human Rights===
The European Court of Human Rights heard Ms. Eweida's case in September 2012, in combination with three other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9519785/The-four-Christians-accusing-their-employers-of-discrimination.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |title=The four Christians accusing their employers of discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was against the UK government for failing to provide domestic law to protect the claimed rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-4221189-5014359|title=ECtHR Chamber judgment in cases nos. 48420/10, 59842/10, 51671/10 and 36516/10|website=Hudoc.echr.coe.int|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than against BA. In January 2013, the court found that her rights had been violated under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and awarded her damages of €2,000 plus costs of €30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115881|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|website=Hudoc.echr.coe.int|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ruled this as they said British Airways had not reached a fair balance between Eweida's religious beliefs and the company's desire to have a particular corporate image.&lt;ref name="wins"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21025332|title=British Airways Christian employee Nadia Eweida wins case|date=15 January 2013|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court said the following, in weighing up the merits of the case.

{{quote|94. It is clear, in the view of the Court, that these factors combined to mitigate the extent of the interference suffered by the applicant and must be taken into account. Moreover, in weighing the proportionality of the measures taken by a private company in respect of its employee, the national authorities, in particular the courts, operate within a margin of appreciation. Nonetheless, the Court has reached the conclusion in the present case that a fair balance was not struck. On one side of the scales was Ms Eweida’s desire to manifest her religious belief. As previously noted, this is a fundamental right: because a healthy democratic society needs to tolerate and sustain pluralism and diversity; but also because of the value to an individual who has made religion a central tenet of his or her life to be able to communicate that belief to others. On the other side of the scales was the employer’s wish to project a certain corporate image. The Court considers that, while this aim was undoubtedly legitimate, the domestic courts accorded it too much weight. Ms Eweida’s cross was discreet and cannot have detracted from her professional appearance. There was no evidence that the wearing of other, previously authorised, items of religious clothing, such as turbans and hijabs, by other employees, had any negative impact on British Airways’ brand or image. Moreover, the fact that the company was able to amend the uniform code to allow for the visible wearing of religious symbolic jewellery demonstrates that the earlier prohibition was not of crucial importance.}}

==Significance==
This case highlighted some issues around the inadequacy of [[UK employment equality law]] in dealing with religion cases. There has been a suggestion from lawyers at [[Lewis Silkin LLP]] that perhaps a better approach might be for employers to have a duty to make adjustments to accommodate religion (as currently exists in the US and Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewissilkin.com/Journal/2012/September/Reinventing-indirect-discrimination.aspx|website=Lewis Silkin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924112113/http://www.lewissilkin.com/Journal/2012/September/Reinventing-indirect-discrimination.aspx |archive-date=24 September 2014 |title=Reinventing indirect discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fernsehturm''' ({{lang-en|'''Television Tower'''}}) is a [[television tower]]  in central [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

Close to [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]], the tower was constructed between 1965-69 by the government of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). It was intended to be both a symbol of Communist power and of Berlin. It remains the latter today, as it is easily visible throughout the central and some suburban districts of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv-turm.de/en/geschichte.php |title=History |publisher=Berliner Fernsehturm |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With its height of 368 metres (including antenna) it is the [[List of tallest structures in Germany|tallest structure in Germany]], and the third-tallest structure in the European Union. Of four tallest structures in Europe, it is 2 m shorter than the [[Torreta de Guardamar]], 0.5 m shorter than the [[Riga Radio and TV Tower]], and 8 m taller than the [[Trbovlje Power Station]] in 2017. The structure is also more than 220 metres higher than the old [[Funkturm Berlin |Berlin Radio Tower]] in the western part of the city, which was built in the 1920s. 

In addition to its main function as the location of several radio and television broadcasting stations, the building – internally known as "Fernmeldeturm 32" – serves as a viewing tower with observation deck including a bar at a height of 203 metres, as well as a rotating restaurant. Also, the Berlin TV Tower can be booked as a venue for events. The distinctive city landmark has undergone a radical, symbolic transformation: After German reunification, it changed from a politically charged, national symbol of the GDR into a citywide symbol of a reunited Berlin. Due to its universal and timeless design, it has increasingly been used as a trademark and is identified worldwide with Berlin and Germany. In 1979, the Berlin TV Tower received monument status by the GDR, a status which was perpetuated after the German reunification.&lt;ref name="Müller, S.148"&gt;Müller: ''Symbol mit Aussicht. Der Ost-Berliner Fernsehturm.'' S.148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower has become one of the most prominent symbols of the country and is often in the [[establishing shot]] of [[List of films set in Berlin|films set in Berlin]], alongside monuments such as the [[Brandenburg Gate]], the [[Berlin Victory Column]] and the [[Reichstag building]]. It is also one of the ten most popular attractions in Germany with more than 1,000,000 visitors every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Top 10 Sights in Germany| url=http://tourismus.meinestadt.de/deutschland/top10 | accessdate=2017-12-01| publisher=meinestadt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its location near [[Alexanderplatz]], it is occasionally called ''Alex Tower''.

==Overview==
The original total height of the tower was {{convert|365|m|ft}}, but it rose to {{convert|368|m|ft}} after the installation of a new antenna in 1997.&lt;ref name=city/&gt; The Fernsehturm is the fourth tallest freestanding structure in Europe, after [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino Tower]], the [[Kiev TV Tower]] and the [[Riga Radio and TV Tower]]. The sphere is a visitor platform and a [[revolving restaurant]] in the middle of the sphere. The visitor platform, also called panoramic floor, is at a height of about {{convert|203|m|ft}} above the ground and visibility can reach {{convert|42|km|mi}} on a clear day. The restaurant [[Telecafé]], which rotates once every 30 minutes, is a few metres above the visitors platform at {{convert|207|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Berliner Fernsehturm| url=http://www.great-towers.com/towers/berliner-fernsehturm/| accessdate=2016-02-11| publisher=The World Federation of Great Towers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web| title=Facts &amp; Figures| url=http://tv-turm.de/ecms_tvt/app/webroot/user/files/fact_figures.pdf| publisher=Berliner Fernsehturm| accessdate=2016-02-11}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When first constructed, it turned once per hour; the speed was later doubled following the tower's 1997 renovation.

Two lifts transports visitors to the sphere of the tower within 40 seconds. A stairway with 986 steps also provides access, however it is not accessible by [[wheelchair]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

To mark the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, for which the final match was played in the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Berlin Olympic Stadium]], the sphere was decorated as a [[Association football ball|football]] with [[magenta]]-coloured pentagons, reflecting the corporate colour of World Cup sponsor and owner of the Fernsehturm, [[Deutsche Telekom]].

== Location and surroundings ==
The Berlin TV Tower is located southwest of the Alexanderplatz station and northeast of the [[Marx-Engels Forum]]. The structure is often erroneously described as being part of the Alexanderplatz that lies to the northeast. Because of its proximity to the famous square, the TV Tower is sometimes referred to as the Alex Tower.

In addition to the Berlin U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines, several tram and bus lines stop at Alexanderplatz station, from which the middle exit leads to the entrance building of the TV Tower.

The Interhotel Stadt Berlin on Alexanderplatz, planned at the same time as the TV Tower and completed in 1970, is 125 metres high and is now operated as a Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz. Between 1967 and 1972, the Rathauspassagen shopping arcade was built next to the [[Red Town Hall]], directly south of the TV Tower.

==History==
=== Background ===
At the European Broadcasting Conference in Stockholm in 1952, which was responsible for the coordination of frequency waves in Europe, the GDR – not recognised politically by most countries at the time – was only allocated two frequency channels. Under these circumstances, it was impossible to cover Berlin's urban area by multiple small broadcasting stations without interferences and thus disturbances or gaps in the broadcasting signals. For comprehensive and continuous coverage, a powerful large broadcasting facility at the highest possible location was required. In the 1950s, this task was fulfilled in Berlin by the very weak makeshift stations of [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] (East German broadcasting organisation).&lt;ref name="Müller, S.19"&gt;Müller: ''Symbol mit Aussicht. Der Ost-Berliner Fernsehturm.'' S.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1952, GDR's Deutsche Post began planning a TV tower for Berlin. The plans initially involved a location in the southeast of Berlin. However, the project was interrupted after construction had started, when it transpired that the site was only eight kilometres away from the [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport]] and the tower threatened to jeopardise flight operations due to its height and location at the edge of an airport corridor. After various compromise solutions failed, the construction project was discontinued in 1956. In the following years, alternatives were sought and several sites were discussed, including in Berlin [[Friedrichshain]], but these plans also fell victim to austerity measures triggered by the high costs of building the [[Berlin Wall]]. 

In the next few years, the search for a new location was continued. Alongside its actual purpose of providing the best possible broadcasting services, the role of the tower as a new landmark of Berlin was increasingly gaining significance. For this reason, in 1964 the government demanded that the tower be built at a central location, an appeal that was supported by the SED leadership. Ultimately, the choice of location was a political decision. [[Walter Ulbricht]], leader of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] which governed East Germany, decided to allow the construction of a television tower modelled on the [[Fernsehturm Stuttgart]] and the first artificial Earth satellite, [[Sputnik]].&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web| title=Fernsehturm, Berlin| url=http://www.worldsiteguides.com/europe/germany/berlin/fernsehturm/| publisher=Worldsiteguides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various architects were involved in the planning and implementation of the tower between 1965-69 , including [[Hermann Henselmann]] and Jörg Streitparth, Fritz Dieter, Günter Franke and Werner Ahrendt, as well as Walter Herzog, Gerhard Kosel and Herbert Aust.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{cite web| title=Berlin TV Tower| publisher=City of Berlin| accessdate=2016-02-11| url=http://www.berlin.de/orte/sehenswuerdigkeiten/fernsehturm/index.en.php?lang=en| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925055351/http://www.berlin.de/orte/sehenswuerdigkeiten/fernsehturm/index.en.php?lang=en| archivedate=2015-09-25| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Tower resulted in the destruction of a huge portion of the historic centre of the capital of Germany. A medieval church stands next to the tower as a testament to the destruction of the old city. 

=== Construction of the Tower ===
Work on the foundation began on 4 August 1965 and was finished by the end of 1965. The concreting of the tower foot began on 15 March 1966. The concreting progressed rapidly, so that the 100 metre mark was exceeded on 4 October 1966. The shaft reached its final height on June 16, 1967. A total of 8,000 cubic metres of concrete was used to build the shaft, which was 248.78 metres high and weighed 26,000 tons. 

While the shaft was being erected, the preliminary work for the tower ball progressed. The working group [[Volkseigener Betrieb | VEB]] Ipro had worked out the procedure for assembling the ball on the reinforced concrete shaft, according to which the ball could be pieced together from 120 separate segments on the ground. In April 1967 a 35-metre-high replica of the shaft was erected on the construction site between [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin | Marienkirche]] and the Red Town Hall on which the ball segments were pre-assembled. This work lasted until November 1967. The construction costs had meanwhile skyrocketed from an estimated 33 million to 95 million marks, caused mainly by components and materials that had to be paid in foreign currencies, some of which were imported from West Germany. In February 1968, the assembly of the ball on the shaft was started. The last segment of the ball was finally installed on October 7. A spike was mounted on the tower structure and the antenna structure above the ball, so that work on the interior could be started the following year. 

At the beginning of 1969, water trickled into the interior of the tower, causing considerable damage; the ball had to be sealed again. Until 3 October 1969, the interior was expanded, and the entrance pavilion was completed. After 53 months of actual construction work, the tower was completed in "record-breaking" time in spite of all the adversities. The costs amounted to over 132 million marks.

The building, officially called the Fernseh- und UKW-Turm Berlin (Television and VHF Tower Berlin), was the world's second highest television tower in October 1969. The only TV tower that was taller was the Ostankino in Moscow. It was also the third-highest freestanding building of its time, after the tower in Moscow and the Empire State Building in New York.

=== Since the inauguration ===
On October 3, 1969, Walter Ulbricht, together with his wife Lotte and a delegation of high-ranking companions, including Günter Mittag, Herbert Warnke, Paul Verner, Rudolph Schulze, [[Erich Honecker]], Werner Lamberz and [[Erich Mielke]], inaugurated the television tower and gave the starting signal for GDR's second state channel, DFF 2, thus launching colour TV on two channels in the GDR. The tower has been accessible to the public since October 7, 1969, Republic Day. 

From 16 February 1970, five FM programmes were broadcast from the tower; a first television programme followed on 4 April 1970. At the beginning of 1972, the two planned pavilions for exhibitions, the Berlin Information Centre, a cinema and gastronomic facilities were completed. Overall, the restaurants offered space for around 1000 guests.  After the establishment of a legal basis for the preservation of monuments in 1975, the Berlin TV Tower was awarded this status in 1979. After the fall of the GDR, the Federal Republic of Germany enshrined the building's monument status. 

After [[German reunification]] in 1990, voices were raised in favour of the demolition of the tower. The Federal Republic of Germany decided to keep the building. As the new operator, [[Deutsche Telekom]] finally invested more than 50 million marks to overhaul the broadcasting facilities, and a number of renovations were also undertaken on the building. Among other things, the antenna received a new, more powerful tip from the height of 327 metres, increasing the tower's height from originally 365 metres to 368 metres in summer 1997. 

The TV Tower is one of the buildings in Berlin that is illuminated by a special light installation for several days during the Festival of Lights held every year in October since 2004. On the occasion of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], the tower ball was covered to make it look like a magenta football as part of an advertising campaign by the operator Telekom.

=="Pope's Revenge"==
When the sun shines on the Fernsehturm's tiled stainless steel dome, the reflection usually appears [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena|in the form of a cross]]. Berliners nicknamed the luminous cross ''Rache des Papstes'', or the "Pope's Revenge". For the same reasons, the structure was also called "St. Walter" (from [[Walter Ulbricht]]).  U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] mentioned this in his ''[[Tear down this wall]]'' speech on 12 June 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://opus.kobv.de/zlb/volltexte/2012/13210/| title=The names of the Berlin Fernsehturm| first=Ulrich| last=Dibelius| location=Berlin| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also affectionately known as the ''Toothpick'' and ''Telespargel'' (TV-asparagus) due to its shape.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

== Visitors and tourism ==
The Berlin TV Tower is not only a broadcasting tower, but also a landmark, tourist attraction and venue. The Berlin TV Tower is the highest publicly accessible building in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Berlin Television Tower: An iconic symbol of Germany’s capital city| url=https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-television-tower| accessdate=2017-12-01| publisher=Visit Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest publicly accessible observation platform in Germany. The building is expected to lose its rank in 2017 when the Rottweiler Test Tower is completed and open to public. In the first three years after its inauguration, as many as four million people visited the structure. After the German reunification, the visitor average has levelled off to approximately 1.2 million from some 90 countries a year. Of these, around 60 per cent come from abroad, with Spaniards being the biggest group, accounting for 8.1 per cent, followed by Italians (7.6 per cent) and Danes (6.7 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Press Release Fernsehturm Berlin| url=http://www.tv-turm.de/de/press-release.php?id=28| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130212062605/http://www.tv-turm.de/de/press-release.php?id=28| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2013-02-12| accessdate=2017-12-01| publisher=Berliner Fernsehturm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum admissible number of persons inside the ball is 320 persons. Of the up to 5,000 visitors daily, about 1,500 visit the tower restaurant. In GDR times, the duration of a stay in the Tele-Café was limited to 60 minutes and in the observation deck to 30 minutes.

The two visitor elevators carry 12 people each in about 40 seconds to the observation platform at 203 metres, where Berlin's highest bar is also located. From 60 windows there is a panoramic view over the whole of Berlin and the surrounding areas. The restaurant, which is located 21 steps above the observation platform at 207 metres altitude, rotates 360 degrees in an hour. For fire protection reasons, the main kitchen is located at the foot of the tower. The meals are transported by lift to the restaurant floor, where they are prepared in a small satellite kitchen. Apart from the two evacuation platforms below the tower basket, the fire protection concept includes a strict smoking ban throughout the entire structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Safety Instructions| url=https://tv-turm.de/en/notices/safety-instructions/| accessdate=2017-12-01| publisher=Berliner Fernsehturm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheelchair users and persons with current walking disabilities cannot visit the Berlin TV Tower, as they could not use the escape route in case of emergency. Animals, prams and large luggage can also not be admitted for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Accessibility| url=https://tv-turm.de/en/plan-your-visit/important-information/| accessdate=2017-12-01| publisher=Berliner Fernsehturm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2011 – almost 42 years after the inauguration – the then Governing Mayor [[Klaus Wowereit]] welcomed the 50 millionth visitor. The entire city can be viewed from the observation deck of the TV Tower. If there is good visibility, the view reaches to the recreational park [[Tropical Islands Resort]], at a distance of almost 60 kilometres.

The TV Tower, which is open all year to the public, has seasonal opening times. The last ascent to the observation platform is daily at 11.30 pm, the last admission to the restaurant is at 11 pm. The public area can be rented for special events, parties, receptions and other events with a maximum of 200 guests. Civil weddings can also be celebrated on the TV Tower. In this case, the bar area on the observation deck is reserved for an hour for the bridal couple and a wedding party of up to 30 guests.

'''Baron Guy Édouard Alphonse Paul de Rothschild''' ({{IPA-fr|baʁɔ̃ ɡi edwaːʁt‿alfɔ̃s pɔl də ʁɔt.ʃild|pron}}; 21 May 1909 – 12 June 2007) was a French banker and member of the [[Rothschild family]]. He owned the  bank [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschild Frères]] from 1967 to 1979, when it was nationalized by the French government, and maintained possessions in other French and foreign companies including [[Imerys]]. He was named to the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men ''Vanity Fair''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601052941/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men |date=2012-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Baron Guy de Rothschild was born in Paris, the  son of Baron [[Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild|Édouard de Rothschild]] (1868–1949) and his wife, the former Germaine Alice Halphen (1884–1975). He has three siblings. Guy's elder brother, Édouard Alphonse Émile Lionel (1906–1911), died at the age of four of appendicitis;&lt;ref&gt;The Whims of Fortune:  The Memoirs of Guy de Rothschild&lt;/ref&gt; he also had two younger sisters, [[Jacqueline Piatigorsky|Jacqueline]] and [[Bethsabée de Rothschild|Bethsabée]].  Half of his great-grandparents were Rothschilds.  He was a great-great grandson of the German patriarch of the Rothschild family [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1743–1812), who founded the family's banking in the 18th century in Frankfurt, Germany.

He grew up at his parents' townhouse on the corner of the [[rue de Rivoli]] and the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris (a property once occupied by [[Talleyrand]] and now the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|United States Embassy]]) and their country estate at [[Château de Ferrières]], 25 miles north-east of Paris. Château de Ferrières is a massive house built to a design by [[Joseph Paxton]] in the 1850s, based on Paxton's earlier design of [[Mentmore Towers]] for [[Baron Mayer de Rothschild]] of the English branch of the Rothschild family.

He was educated at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] and [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, and by private tutors. He undertook military service with the cavalry at [[Saumur]], and played [[golf]] for France. He won the [[Grand Prix de Sud-Ouest]] in 1948.

==Personal life==
Guy de Rothschild married twice:
*In 1937, he married a distant cousin, Baroness Alix Hermine Jeanette Schey de Koromla (1911–1982). Alix was the former wife of Kurt Krahmer and the younger daughter of Baron [[Philipp Schey von Koromla]], the first Hungarian Jew to be made an [[Austrian nobility|Austrian noble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13262-schey-philipp-baron-von-koromla Jewish Encyclopedia: SCHEY, PHILIPP, BARON VON KOROMLA] retrieved March 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child, [[David René de Rothschild]] (born 1942).  Rothschild also raised his wife's daughters from her prior marriage to Krahmer, Lili and Bettina. They divorced in 1956.
*In 1957, he married [[Marie-Hélène de Rothschild|Baroness Marie-Hélène van Zuylen van Nyevelt]] (1927–1996). Marie-Hélène's first marriage to Count [[François de Nicolay]]—with whom she had one son, Philippe de Nicolay—had been dissolved in 1956. Like his first wife, she was a distant cousin, though in this case, a [[Roman Catholic]].  They had one child, Baron [[Édouard de Rothschild]] (born 1957).

After his second marriage, Guy de Rothschild renovated the Château de Ferrières, using it to put on lavish balls in the early 1970s, before donating it to the [[University of Paris]] in 1975.  The same year, he bought the [[Hôtel Lambert]] on the [[Île Saint-Louis]] in Paris, the top floors of which became his Paris residence.

==Service in World War II==
In 1940, as a result of the [[German occupation of France in World War II]], Guy de Rothschild's parents and sister [[Bethsabée de Rothschild|Bethsabée]] fled France and made their way to safety in [[New York City]]. Guy de Rothschild had enlisted in the [[French Army]] and was a company commander in the 3rd Light Mechanised Division during the [[Battle of France]] in early 1940. After fighting the Nazis at [[Carvin]], he was part of the French Army that was forced to retreat to [[Dunkirk]]. He was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] for his actions on the beaches at Dunkirk, from where he was evacuated to England.  He immediately returned to France, landing at [[Brest, France|Brest]], and taking charge of the family's office at [[La Bourboule]], near [[Clermont-Ferrand]].

Under the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], his father and uncles were stripped of their French nationality, removed from the register of the [[Légion d'honneur]], and the family was forced to sell its possessions.  Rothschild managed to persuade the buyers to grant options under which he would later be able to buy the family's interests back.  He left France again, via Spain and Portugal, to join his parents in [[New York City]].  He joined the [[Free French Forces]] and boarded the cargo ship, ''Pacific Grove'', to travel back to Europe.  His ship was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943, and he was rescued after spending 12 hours in the waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In England, he joined the staff of General Koenig at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] near Portsmouth.

==Banking and business==
Guy de Rothschild studied law at university then joined [[de Rothschild Frères]] in 1931 when it was being run by his father and a cousin, [[Robert de Rothschild]], who died in 1946. As part of his learning to manage the family's businesses, in 1933 he joined the executive board of their [[Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord|Northern Railway Company]].

At the end of World War II, Guy de Rothschild returned to the bank's offices at [[rue Laffitte]] in Paris in 1944. On his father's death in 1949, Guy de Rothschild took formal control of the business. Years later, Rothschild was on the cover of the 20 December 1963 issue of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine in a story that said he took "over the family's French bank during the disorder of war and defeat, changed its character from stewardship of the family fortune to expansive modern banking."

Following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Guy de Rothschild served as a director of the [[Banque de France]]. On his father's death, he also inherited part of [[Château Lafite-Rothschild]] but did not run it.

[[Georges Pompidou]], who would later become [[President of France|President]] and [[Prime Minister of France]], was recruited by Guy de Rothschild from a job as a teacher, and worked for him from 1953 to 1962, during which time he became the general manager of the Rothschild bank.  The bank diversified, from investment management under De Rothschild Frères to the deposit-taking Banque de Rothschild, with branches throughout France.  Guy was its president from 1968 to 1978.  In 1968 Guy de Rothschild became a partner at [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]], [[London]], while cousin [[Evelyn Robert de Rothschild|Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] was appointed a director of [[de Rothschild Frères|Banque Rothschild]], Paris.

===Imetal S.A.===
In France, Rothschild developed the country's largest private [[uranium mining]] company, the Compagnie Française des Minerais d'Uranium.
In 1961, Guy de Rothschild took over as Chairman of [[Imerys|Imetal S.A.]] in which the family had a substantial stake. His involvement marked the first time any Rothschild had personally participated in the management of the business. Among its holdings, the international mining conglomerate owned [[Société Le Nickel]] (SLN) in [[New Caledonia]]. In 1969, SLN acquired [[Pennaroya Mining|Peñarroya]], a [[Chile]]an based company which mined and processed [[lead]], [[zinc]] and [[copper]]. Two years later SLN took over La Compagnie de Mokta, which specialized in [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and [[uranium]]. Rothschild restructured the family's various mining interests, including Peñarroya which became part of SLN.

===Nationalization===
In the early 1970s the government of France began [[Nationalization|nationalizing]] a number of industries and after declaring nickel to be a vital market commodity, SLN's assets were nationalized in 1974 and placed under a new company, Société Metallurgique. The result left the Rothschild's SLN as a holding company with a fifty percent interest in Société Metallurgique.

When the Rothschild's bank was nationalized in 1981 by the socialist government of [[François Mitterrand]], a discouraged Guy de Rothschild left France and moved temporarily to New York City. "A Jew under [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]], a [[:wikt:pariah|pariah]] under Mitterrand, that's enough!" ({{lang-fr|Juif sous Pétain, paria sous Mitterrand, cela suffit!}}) he wrote in a frontpage op-ed in ''[[Le Monde]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/les-rothschild-rois-des-banquiers_474046.html |title=Les Rothschild, rois des banquiers |date=December 19, 2007 |newspaper=L'Express }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following another change in government policy, in 1987 a new banking business was established by his son [[David René de Rothschild|David]] and nephew [[Éric de Rothschild|Éric]], who founded [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]].

{{Shia Islam|History}}
'''Shi‘a Islam''', also known as '''Shi‘ite Islam''' or '''Shi‘ism''', is the second largest branch of [[Islam]] after [[Sunni Islam]]. Shias adhere to the teachings of [[Muhammad]] and the religious guidance of his family (who are referred to as the [[Ahl al-Bayt]]) or his descendants known as [[Shia Imam]]s. Muhammad's bloodline continues only through his daughter [[Fatima Zahra]] and cousin [[Ali]] who alongside Muhammad's grandsons comprise the Ahl al-Bayt. Thus, Shias consider Muhammad's descendants as the true source of guidance. Shia Islam, like Sunni Islam, has at times been divided into many branches; however, only three of these currently have a significant number of followers, and each of them has a separate trajectory.

From a political viewpoint the history of the Shia was in several stages. The first part was the emergence of the Shia, which starts after Muhammad's death in 632 and lasts until [[Battle of Karbala]] in 680. This part coincides with the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamah]] of Ali, [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Hussain ibn Ali|Hussain]]. The second part is the differentiation and distinction of the Shia as a separate [[Madhab|sect]] within the Muslim community, and the opposition of the Sunni caliphs. This part starts after the Battle of Karbala and lasts until the formation of the Shia states about 900. During this section Shi'ism divided into several branches. The third section is the period of Shia states. The first Shia state was the [[Idrisid dynasty]] (780–974) in [[Maghreb]]. Next was the [[Alavid]] dynasty (864–928) established in [[Mazandaran]] (Tabaristan), north of [[Iran]]. These dynasties were local, but they were followed by two great and powerful dynasties. The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] formed in [[Ifriqiya]] in 909, and ruled over varying areas of the [[Maghreb]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Levant]] until 1171. The [[Buyid dynasty]] emerged in [[Daylaman]], north of Iran, about 930 and then ruled over central and western parts of Iran and [[Iraq]] until 1048. In [[Yemen]], Imams of various dynasties usually of the Zaidi sect established a theocratic political structure that survived from 897 until 1962.

==From Saqifa to Karbala==
{{main|Succession to Muhammad}}
{{see also|Saqifah|Rashidun|First Fitna|Second Fitna|Battle of Karbala}}
Muhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. While [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, the tribal leaders of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] held a secret gathering at [[Saqifah]] to decide who would succeed [[Muhammad]] as head of the Muslim state, disregarding what the earliest Muslims, the [Muhajirun], regarded as [[Muhammad]]'s appointment of [[Ali]] as his successor at [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]]. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad and was first person to congratulate Ali on event of Ghadeer , nominated [[Abu Bakr]]. Others, after initial refusal and bickering, settled on Abu Bakr who was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by Muhammad's earliest companions, who held that [[Ali]] had been designated his successor. According to [[Sunni]] accounts, Muhammad died without having appointed a successor, and with a need for leadership, they gathered and voted for the position of [[caliph]]. Shi'a accounts differ by asserting that Muhammad had designated Ali as his successor on a number of occasions, including on his death bed. Ali was supported by [[Muhammad]]'s family and the majority of the [[Muhajirun]], the initial Muslims, and was opposed by the tribal leaders of Arabia who included [[Muhammad]]'s initial enemies, including, naturally, the [[Banu Umayya]].&lt;ref name="Brother"&gt;{{cite book| last = Chirri| first = Mohammad | title = The Brother of the Prophet Mohammad | publisher = Islamic Center of America, Detroit, MI| year = 1982| id = Alibris ID 8126171834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Bakr]]'s election was followed by a raid on [[Ali]]'s house led by [[Umar]] and [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] (see [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]).

The [[succession to Muhammad]] is an extremely contentious issue. Muslims ultimately divided into two branches based on their political attitude towards this issue, which forms the primary theological barrier between the two major divisions of Muslims: Sunni and Shi'a, with the latter following Ali as the successor to Muhammad. The two groups also disagree on Ali's attitude towards Abu Bakr, and the two caliphs who succeeded him: [[Umar]] (or `Umar ibn al-Khattāb) and [[Uthman]] or (‘Uthmān ibn ‘Affān). Sunnis tend to stress Ali's acceptance and support of their rule, while the Shi'a claims that he distanced himself from them, and that he was being kept from fulfilling the religious duty that Muhammad had appointed to him. The Sunni Muslims say that if Ali was the rightful successor as ordained by God Himself, then it would have been his duty as the leader of the Muslim nation to make war with these people (Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman) until Ali established the decree. Shia claim, however, that Ali did not fight Abu Bakr, Umar or Uthman, because firstly he did not have the military strength and if he decided to, it would have caused a civil war amongst the Muslims, which was still a nascent community throughout the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/057.sbt.html#005.057.050 5.57.50]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiation and distinction==
Shia Islam and Sunnism split in the aftermath of the death of Muhammad based on the politics of the early caliphs. Due to the Shi'a belief that Ali should have been the first caliph, the three caliphs that preceded him, Abu Bakr, Umar, and Usman, were considered illegitimate usurpers. Because of this, any [[hadith]] that were narrated by these three caliphs (or any of their supporters) were not accepted by Shi'a hadith collectors. 

Due to this, the number of hadith accepted by Shi'a is far less than the hadith accepted by Sunnis, with many of the non-accepted hadith being ones that had to deal with integral aspects of Islam, such as prayer and marriage. In the absence of a clear hadith for a situation, the Shi'a prefer the sayings and actions of the Imams (Prophet's family members) on the similar level as the hadith of the Prophet himself over other ways, which in turn led to the theological elevation of the Imams as being infallible.&lt;ref name="LIH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alkhateeb|first1=Firas|title=Lost Islamic History|date=2014|publisher=Hurst Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781849043977|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle East"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochsenwald|first1=William|author-link1=William L.

[[File:Oromo Irrecha.jpg|thumb|Irrecha Festival 2014]]
'''Irreecha''' ([[Afaan Oromo]]: also called Irreessa, is [[Thanksgiving]] holiday of the [[Oromo people|Oromo People]] in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oromocentre.org/gadaa/what-is-irreecha/ ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oromo people|Oromo People]] celebrate Irreecha to thank Waaqa (God) for the blessings and mercies they have received throughout the previous year. The thanksgiving is celebrated at the sacred grounds of [[Hora Harsadi|Hora Harsadi (Lake Harsadi)]], [[Bishoftu]], [[Oromia]]. The Irreecha festival is celebrated every year at the beginning of Birraa (Spring), new season after the dark and rainy winter season. Irrecha is celebrated in [[East Shewa Zone]] and around the world where diaspora [[Oromo people|Oromos]] live especially North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waaqeffannaa.org/irreecha/invitation-to-Oromo-National-Thanksgiving-day/|title=Irreecha: The Oromo National Thanksgiving Day|website=Waaqeffannaa.org|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oromo people|Oromo People]] consider the winter rainy season of June to September as the time of difficulty. The heavy rain brings with it lots of things like swelling rivers and floods that may drown people, cattle, crop, and flood homes. Also, family relationship will severe during winter rain as they can't visit each other because of swelling rivers. In addition, winter time could be a time of hunger for some because of the fact that previous harvest collected in January is running short and new harvest is not ripe yet. Because of this, some families may endure food shortages during the winter. In Birraa (Spring in Oromoland), this shortage ends as many food crops especially [[maize]] is ripe and families can eat their fill. Other crops like [[potato]], [[barley]], etc. will also be ripe in Birraa. Some disease types like [[malaria]] also break out during rainy winter time. Because of this, the [[Oromo people|Oromos]] see winter as a difficult season. It does not mean the [[Oromo people|Oromo People]] hate rain or winter season at all. Even when there is shortage of rain, they pray to Waaqa (God) for rain.

The [[Oromo people|Oromo People]] celebrate Irreecha not only to thank Waaqa (God) but also to welcome the new season of plentiful harvests after the dark and rainy winter season associated with nature and creature. On Irreecha festivals, friends, family, and relatives gather together and celebrate with joy and happiness. Irreecha festivals bring people closer to each other and make social bonds.

Moreover, the [[Oromo people|Oromo People]] celebrate this auspicious event to mark the end of rainy season, known as Ganna, was established by Oromo forefathers, in the time of Gadaa Melbaa in Mormor, [[Oromia]]. The auspicious day on which this last Mormor Day of Gadaa Melbaa - the Dark Time of starvation and hunger- was established on the Sunday of last week of September or the Sunday of the 1st week of October according to the Gadaa lunar calendar has been designated as National Thanksgiving Day by modern-day [[Oromo people|Oromo People]].

In Waqeffannaa religion thanksgiving-Irreecha, the Qaalluus (spiritual leaders) and the Abbaa Malkaas (lineal chiefs of the areas) are at the top hierarchies. In the Qaallu religio-ethics, the Qaalluus give religious instructions and directives of the where-about and the time of the implementation of the rituals.

Furthermore, in the Irreecha ritual ceremony, the Abbaa Malkaas and Abbaa Gadaas have vital roles. They lead the participating communities who follow them carrying bunch of straw and daisies in their hands praising, blessing and praying Waaqa in their songs. They order the participants what to say in the praise and prayer.

Although this thanksgiving rituals and prayers would be accomplished at different places and time governed by its own system and portrayed by its own ritual practices, it is done at two major areas: Irreecha Malkaa and Irreecha Tulluu.

As water is the source of life, admiring creator and its creation, thanking God for the offers is what to be performed by being gathered around the rivers and environs. So the Oromo Culture and religion (Waaqeffanna) whose part is Irreecha has a concept that revolves around rain, peace and fertility.

The Oromos who live on the highland and semi highland areas start taking their cattle to Hora at this geographical and climatic juncture which is the first and a new start in their work and life routines.

In different words, the Irreecha Malkaa’s festival is celebrated every year at the beginning of Birraa (Spring), new season after the dark and rainy winter season at the bank of big rivers where the Oromos live locally. The Oromos carry straw, spices and traditional food called Bexille, circular bread like that of the Israelites’ bread for the Passover to the river and eat there.

Such ritual ceremony is performed not only along the bank of a river but also around lakes and its vicinity. This Malkaa Irreecha Holiday is sometimes known as Ayyaana Birraa, the Spring Festival. It is the time when relatives, families, and clans cut apart by rivers and floods are able to meet. As a result, some still call it Xaddacha Saaquu, traditional court opening season since the judges could not sit in the court to see the cases during rainy season.

At this time particularly, mountains and meadows are covered with flowers and crops whose colors are so attractive and lavish to the farmers and pastoralists. And the season would be considered as the herald of the month of hope and prosperity. As well, it is a month of thanksgiving to Waaqa and is taken as the annually recurred culture.

After celebrating this locally, the Oromos from every corner of Oromia and other Ethiopians come together to the sacred grounds of Hora Arsadi (Lake Arsadi), Bishoftu, Oromia which is 45 kilometres South East of Finfinne (Addis Ababa). Irrecha Malkaa is celebrated nationally in Bishoftu, East Shewa Zone and around the world where diaspora Oromos and Ethiopians live especially in North America and Europe.

Ornamented with snow white interesting costumes, turbans, and hides of wild animals as well as holding spears and a special stick that bespeaks the Gada system, hundreds of thousands of celebrants from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, gather at Bishoftu, Hora Arsadi, to celebrate Irreecha festival.

Almost all celebrants from both genders carry in their hands newly cut green straw that bespeak of fertility and soak it in the lake water. The Oromo's from different parts of the country for long meet flocking to celebrate and praise their creator for his blessings.

Especially, the women sing ‘Maariyoo… Maareyoo… meaning your mercy on us and are decorated with Caaccuu (beads of different colors), traditional costumes and Siiqqee (stick traditionally handled by oromo women). The men also hold a traditional stick called haroresa as they chant the Ireecha song with women.

Children with peer groups sing a seasonal and love song as it is a season in which the youth select their mates and exchange gifts with their friends. Lovers also express their best wishes through cultural songs on the occasion.

After soaking the fresh lavish grass and the flower into the lake water and throwing the water to the participants, the Abbaa Malkaa, Abbaa Gaddaas and Qaallus bless the participants and make speeches on rules and regulations newly declared at the Gada handing over ceremony or assist to recall the preexisting laws.

At the end of the Irreecha Malkaa celebration, all participants sing together “Irreechoo yaa Irreecha Malkaa Roobaa fi Nagaa……” to mean Thanksgiving at the river for rain and peace. All singing this go to their villages.

Irreecha Malkaa marks the end of the rainy season and the beginning of spring, along with hopes for an abundant harvest. Irreecha Malkaa has been observed on the shore of Lake Hora annually for not less than a millennial.

Similarly, the Oromo People consider the winter rainy season of June to September as the time of difficulty. The heavy rain brings with it lots of things like swelling rivers and floods that may drown people, cattle, crop, and flood homes. Also, family relationship will severe during winter rain as they can't visit each other because of swelling rivers.

In addition, winter time could be a time of hunger for some because of the fact that previous harvest collected in January is running short and new harvest is not yet ripe. Because of this, some families may endure food shortages during the winter. As Birraa season approaches, this shortage ends as many food crops especially maize is ripe and families can eat their fill. Other crops like potato, barley, etc. Would also be readily available for harvest during Birraa. Some disease types like malaria also break out during rainy winter time. Because of this, the Oromos see winter as a difficult season. It does not mean the Oromo People hate rain or winter season at all. Even when there is shortage of rain, they pray to Waaqa (God) for rain.

The Oromo People celebrate Irreecha Malkaa not only to thank Waaqa (God) but also to welcome the new season of plentiful harvests after the dark and rainy winter season associated with nature and creature. On Irreecha Malkaa festivals, friends, family, and relatives gather together and celebrate with joy and happiness. Irreecha Malkaa festivals bring people closer to each other and make social bonds.

Moreover, the Oromo People celebrate this auspicious event to mark the end of rainy season, known as Ganna, which was established by Oromo forefathers, in the time of Gadaa Melbaa in Mormor, Oromia. The auspicious day on which this last Mormor Day of Gadaa Melbaa - the Dark Time of starvation and hunger- was established on the Sunday of last week of September or the Sunday of the 1st week of October according to the Gadaa lunar calendar has been designated as National Thanksgiving Day by modern-day Oromo People.

Irreecha Tullu is the thanksgiving ceremony that is performed at the top of mountains or hills during dry season, bona in Afaan Oromo. It is performed at the beginning of the spring season usually in March.

The last three months were sunny, when both men and cattle suffered from drought, especially shortage of water and grasses. So it is the time when the Oromo living in the vicinity are gathered to pray to their Waaqa, God the creator and giver, to give them rain. Especially, if there is a delay in rain and it seems that the sky seems rain cloudless, the Qalluus and Elders know it, the leaders call for Iyya Boka, Rain Screaming. All the villagers scream ‘rain’ to Waaqa, God the creator and giver, to get rain for planting crops and grasses to grow.

This particular solitary place is characterized by moisture conducive for praying. This ritual and ceremonial practice is said to have closely related to the worship practiced by the ancient settlers of peoples of the Nile Valley.

== Jhoja as Sikh surname ==
Originally, most of the '''Jhojas''' from Punjab (India) used [[Singh]] as their surname while others used Singh as their middle name and Jhoja as their surname. During the 19th century, most of the people from the community joined [[Damdami Taksal]] to become Amritdhari, and adopted [[Khalsa]] as their surname. During the [[World War II]], hundreds of thousands of Sikhs and Hindus served in the [[British Indian Army]], and hundreds of them retired &amp; migrated to the United Kingdom with their families. According to the British army service records&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/indian-army-personnel/|title=Indian Army personnel – The National Archives|last=Archives|first=The National|work=The National Archives|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a research conducted on Sikh families in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalsi|first=Sewa Singh|date=|title=THE SIKHS AND CASTE: A Study of the Sikh Community in Leeds and Bradford.|url=|journal=ULeeds|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of the Jhoja Sikh families who migrated to the UK adopted surnames such as [[Rajput]]s and Chanas whereas a few kept their original surname "Jhoja".

This is a '''list of notable Buddhists''', encompassing all the major branches of the religion (i.e. in Buddhism), and including interdenominational and eclectic Buddhist practitioners. This list includes both formal teachers of [[Buddhism]], and people notable in other areas who are publicly Buddhist or who have espoused Buddhism.

== Historical Buddhist thinkers and founders of schools ==
Individuals are grouped by nationality, except in cases where their influence was felt elsewhere. [[Gautama Buddha]] and his immediate disciples ('Buddhists') are listed separately from later Indian Buddhist thinkers, teachers and contemplatives.

The worldwide network of [[Scientology]] [[organizations]] consists of numerous [[entities]] and [[corporations]], located in the [[United States of America|United States]] as well as in other [[countries]]. All these organizations are interrelated and connected through an internal [[hierarchy]] system, which is called the "Command Channels of Scientology".

At the top of the "Command Channels" are [[management]] [[corporations]], such as the [[Religious Technology Center]], the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]], or the [[Church of Scientology International]], who own and license the [[Scientology]] [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]] to other entities and corporations within the internal hierarchy system of the network.

Within the sphere of the upper Scientology management there are also several corporations with specific functions with regard to [[publication]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Administration (business)|administration]], and [[finances]]. Examples are the Scientology-owned [[publishing house]] [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]] or the [[World Institute of Scientology Enterprises]], which promotes and sells Scientology [[tertiary sector of the economy|services]] to [[businesses]] and [[entrepreneurs]].

Below the Scientology management are Scientology service organizations ("Churches"), who deliver Scientology services to its members, and so-called [[secular]] Scientology organization, who seek to introduce the overall "[[technology]]" of the organization's [[Entrepreneur|founder]] [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in various parts of today's [[society]]. Examples are the [[Florida|Florida-based]] service organization [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]], the German "Scientology Kirche Hannover e.V.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology-hannover.org/ |title=Official website of the Church of Scientology of Hannover in Germany |publisher=Scientology-hannover.org |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or local chapters of the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]], an organization that seeks to abolish any form of [[psychiatry]]. Most of the Scientology organizations in a geographical area, secular or otherwise, are members of the [[Clear Expansion Committee]], with the goal of [[Clear (Scientology)|clearing]] the entire community and establishing a Scientology world.

In a response to questions by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) with regards  to its application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], the [[Church of Scientology International]] provided to the IRS a list of Scientology corporations and entities, categorized by their functions and activities.

According to the [[Torah]] or [[Law of Moses]], these are some of the offenses which may merit the [[death penalty]].

==Religious practices==
* [[Sacrifice|Sacrificing]] to gods other than [[YHWH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|27:29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Passing children through the fire to/as [MLK]''. The [[triconsonantal root]] ''[[Moloch|MLK]]'' has traditionally been translated as if it were the name of an otherwise unattested deity - ''[[Moloch]]'' - but may just describe a type of sacrifice. It is generally thought that this refers to a form of [[human sacrifice]] similar to that of which the [[Phoenicia]]ns (particularly in [[Carthage]]) have historically been widely accused&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:1-5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Septuagint reads "You shall not give your seed to serve a ruler", suggesting that the root M-L-K should be more properly rendered as 'king/ruler'.
* Worshiping [[Baal Peor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[False prophet|False prophecy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|13:1-10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|17:2-7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:20-22|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Necromancy]], according to the [[Masoretic Text]]; specifically those who ''are masters over ghosts'' (Hebrew: ''Ba'al ob'') and those who ''gain information from the dead'' (Hebrew: ''Yidde'oni'').&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:27|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Septuagint]] instead condemns [[Ventriloquism#Origins|gastromancy]] (Greek: ''eggastrimuthos''), and [[Incantation|enchantment]] (Greek: ''epaoidos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://septuagint.org/LXX/Leviticus/20 Leviticus 20:27 (LXX)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the Masoretic Text, practitioners of ''kashaph''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|102}}&lt;/ref&gt; - [[Incantation|incanting]] [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]. According to the [[Septuagint]] version of the same passages, ''[[pharmakeia]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://septuagint.org/LXX/Exodus/22 Exodus 22:17 (LXX)]; note that for technical reasons, verse numbering in the Septuagint doesn't correspond exactly with the masoretic text&lt;/ref&gt; - [[poison]]ers. Historically this passage has been translated into English using vague terminology, condemning ''[[witchcraft]]'' in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} (numbered as verse 17 in the [[New American Bible|NAB]], which follows Septuagint numbering)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blasphemy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|24:10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sabbath breaking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|31:14|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|35:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|15:32-36|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A foreigner (outsider) who gets close to the tabernacle&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Numbers|1:51}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|3:10|}} and {{bibleverse||Numbers|3:38|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual practices==
* [[Rape]] by a man of a [[betrothal|betrothed]] woman in the countryside&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:25-27|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being either participant in consensual sexual activity, in which a [[betrothal|betrothed]] woman consensually loses her virginity to a man&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:23-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Adultery]] with a married woman&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Loss of [[virginity]] by a woman prior to marriage, to someone other than her husband while falsely representing herself as a virgin before the marriage ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:13-21|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marrying one's wife's mother&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain forms of [[incest]], namely if it involves the father's wife or a daughter-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of incest receive lesser punishment; sexual activity with a sister/stepsister is given [[excommunication]] for a punishment;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; if it involves a brother's wife or an uncle's wife it is just cursed&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual activity with an aunt that is a blood relation is merely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Male on male sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="coogan116"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first=Michael|title=God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_gPKQEACAAJ&amp;dq=god+and+sex&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=4fbCTaPKDpGXOrq88Z0I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAQ|chapter=4.

[[Leviticus 18|The correct translation and interpretation of this passage]], and its implications for [[Homosexuality and Judaism|homosexuality in Judaism]] and [[Christianity and homosexuality|homosexuality in Christianity]], are controversial. Translations into English are wide-ranging.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bestiality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prostitution by the daughter of a priest&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
* [[Murder]], believed by Jews to apply to non-Jews as well&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|9:6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|21:12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:17-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Numbers|35:9-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Negligent homicide]], specifically by ox-goring, if already warned about the behavior of the ox. Death punishment is no longer required if the interested party requires payment of a fee. The death penalty does not apply to ox-goring of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:28-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Honor your father and your mother|Smiting a parent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cursing a parent&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A son who persists in disobeying his parents&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:18-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ehrman281"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them)||year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins e-books|isbn=9780061173943|oclc=317877487|pages=281|chapter=Eight.

I have a young friend whose evangelical parents were upset because she wanted to get a tattoo, since the Bible, after all, condemns tattoos. In the same book, Leviticus, the Bible also condemns wearing clothing made of two different kinds of fabric and eating pork. And it indicates that children who disobey their parents are to be stoned to death. Why insist on the biblical teaching about tattoos but not about dress shirts, pork chops, and stoning?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kidnapping]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Contempt of court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|17:8-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Perjury|False witness]] to a [[capital crime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:15-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Muhammad had close relations with his ally the [[Paduspanid]] Shahragim, and even married his daughter. During the reign of the [[Ilkhanid]] [[Abaqa Khan]], Muhammad and Shahrigam were ordered to aid the Ilkhanids in their siege of fortress of [[Gerdkuh]], which was held by the [[Ismailites]]. Muhammad and Shahragim disobeyed, however. Abaqa Khan responded by invading [[Mazandaran]]. The two kings were then forgiven. Muhammad then joined the armies of the Ilkhanid, but was shortly arrested because of his recklessness. After hearing about Muhammad's imprisonment, Shahragim revolted against Abaqa, which resulted in the execution of Muhammad, who was succeeded by his brother [[Ali II of Tabaristan]].

{{Shia Islam}}
[[File:Ashura in Bahrain 45.JPG|thumb|250px|A procession in [[Bahrain]].]]
The Islamic month of [[Muharram]] is a period of mourning in [[Shia Islam]] and commemorates the death of [[Imam Hussain]], the third [[The Twelve Imams|Imam]], and his companions at the [[Battle of Karbala]] in 680&amp;nbsp;AD. Processions called [[Azadari]] ({{lang-ar|عزاداری}}) are held to commemorate and remember the events that took place, these are often organised by congregation halls known as ''[[Hussainia]]''. Mourning climaxes on the tenth day of Muharram, [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]]. The mourning is sometimes referred to as the ''Remembrance of Muharram'' ({{lang-ar|ذكرى محرم or مناسبة محرم}}).

The mourning that takes place during '''Muharram in [[Bahrain]]''' has a long history in the country, having been practiced for centuries, and the month sees a massive influx of visitors from neighbouring [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]], who spectate or participate in the mourning processions.
What makes Bahrain special in the [[Persian Gulf]] area is that Hussaini processions are allowed on the streets; a reason why Shia’s in region to travel to Bahrain during Muharram.

==Background==

The event marks the anniversary of the [[Battle of Karbala]] when Imam [[Hussein ibn Ali]], the grandson of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and a [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Shia Imam]], was killed by the forces of the second [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Yazid I]]. The month-long occasion is marked by arranging a series of daily gatherings, where a cleric would to deliver sermons on Islamic teachings and Imam Hussain's life. The mourning itself reaches its climax on the tenth day of Muharram, known as [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], on which the Umayyad army killed the 72 combatants who fought, including Imam Hussain, his family and close supporters. The women and children left living were made prisoners and transported to Yazid's court in [[Damascus]].

==Commemoration in Bahrain==
[[File:Ashoora.jpg|thumb|Reenactments of the events of Ashura, in [[Manama]], Bahrain, in 2007.]]

===History===
The first outdoor Muharram procession in Bahrain is reported to have taken place in [[Manama]] in 1891, led by Mirza Muhammad Ismail, the local agent for the [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]].&lt;ref name=fuccaro106&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuccaro|first=Nelida|title=Histories of City and State in the Persian Gulf: Manama since 1800|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-511-60512-3|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-sXqAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nelida Fuccaro]] describes the event as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This was a momentuous even for Manama's Shi'is. People flocked behind a heavily armed Mirza Isma'il who proudly made his way through Manama's streets in defiance of the veto imposed by [[Al Khalifa family|the rulers]] on public manifestations of Shi'i devotion.&lt;ref name=fuccaro106 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1950s, when Bahrain saw the rise of a [[National Union Committee|nationalist movement]], the procession of the ma'tam ([[Hussainia]]) of [[Ras Rumman]] marched chanting nationalist slogans preceded by the banner of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Egypt.&lt;ref name=fuccaro169&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuccaro|first=Nelida|title=Histories of City and State in the Persian Gulf: Manama since 1800|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-511-60512-3|pages=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-sXqAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest and most distinguished of the mawatim (sing. ma'tam) in Bahrain are located in the [[Fareej el-Makharqa]] quarter of central [[Manama]] and were constructed at the turn of the 19th Century.&lt;ref name=khuri157&gt;{{cite book|last=Khuri|first=Fuad I.|title=Tribe and State in Bahrain: The Transformation of Social and Political Authority in an Arab State|year=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-43473-7|pages=157|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49926979/Tribe-and-State-in-Bahrain#page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes [[Persians in Bahrain#Matam Al-Ajam Al-Kabeer|Matam al-Ajam al-Kabeer]], [[Matam Bin Rajab]], Bin Zabar, Madan, Sallum, Al Mudaifa, Al Arrayed, Al Qassab, and al Hajj Khalaf.&lt;ref name=khuri157 /&gt;

===Practices and rituals===

[[File:Muharram procession in Bahrain, 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|A procession outside [[Persians in Bahrain#Matam Al-Ajam Al-Kabeer|Matam al-Ajam al-Kabeer]] in November 2012]]

Muharram in Bahrain is unique, as it is the only [[Arab]] country in the [[Persian Gulf]] region that has a [[Shia Muslim]] majority.&lt;ref name=BHRM&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain: a Symbol of Religious Freedoms|url=http://www.bahrainmonitor.org/events/e-024-05.html|publisher=Bahrain Human Rights Monitor|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that thousands of Gulf nationals visit Bahrain during [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] to participate in the religious processions. Although official statistics in 2009 show that only 1,100 [[Mätam|matams]] (مأتم) are officially registered in the country, it is believed that there are up to 5,000 matams, including both registered and unregistered.&lt;ref name=BHRM/&gt;

Processions ([[Azadari]]) occur on an almost-daily basis during the month. Different varieties of the processions exist: Some processions consist of participants beating the chests, others with self-[[flagellation]]s with chains and hitting oneself with swords or knives (called "Haidar"). [[Ta'zieh#Ta.27zieh and Shiism|Passion play]]s and reenactments of the [[Day of Ashura]] are also performed.

[[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] is a two-day public holiday in [[Bahrain]], occurring on the ninth and tenth days of Muharram, respectively (though dates vary on the [[Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Report: Bahrain 2010|year=2010|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=9781907065224|pages=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jipEf3jnyIoC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=Muharram%20Bahrain&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=Muharram%20Bahrain&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government sources, the [[Government of Bahrain|Bahraini government]] „actively donates food and funds” to [[Mätam|matams]] during the month-long event.&lt;ref name=BHRM/&gt;

==Notable Matams==
A matam is a Shia congregation hall, also called as a [[Hussainia]]. As matams number in the thousands, notable ones are listed below:

'''Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de la Paz y Buen Viaje}}), also known as the '''Virgin of Antipolo''' and the '''Our Lady of Antipolo''' ({{lang-fil|Birhen ng Antipolo}}), is a 17th-century [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] wooden image of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated in the [[Philippines]]. The image, a [[Black Madonna]] that represents the [[Immaculate Conception]], is enshrined in [[Antipolo Cathedral]] in the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountains east of [[Metro Manila]].&lt;ref name=cbcp/&gt;

The image was brought to the country by [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Juan Niño de Tabora]] from [[Mexico]] via the [[galleon]] ''El Almirante'' in 1626. His safe voyage across the [[Pacific Ocean]] was attributed to the image, which was given the title of "Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage".  It was substantiated later by six other successful voyages of the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]]s with the image aboard as its patroness.&lt;ref name=cbcp&gt;[http://www.cbcponline.org/antipolo/index.html "Diocese of Antipolo"]. CBCP Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orlando&gt;[http://home.catholicweb.com/mfod/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=143894&amp;From=Home "Our Lady of Antipolo (Birhen ng Antipolo)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055416/http://home.catholicweb.com/mfod/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=143894&amp;From=Home |date=2014-08-08 }}. Ministry to Filipinos, Diocese of Orlando.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is one of the most celebrated images of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in the Philippines, gaining devotees since the mid-19th century, having been mentioned by [[José Rizal]] in his writings.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; From May to July each year, the image attracts millions of pilgrims from all over the country and abroad. [[Pope Pius XI]] authorized her [[canonical coronation]] on 13 June 1925, which occurred on 28 November 1926.

==History==
On 25 March 1626, the [[galleon]] trading ship ''El Almirante'' left [[Acapulco, Mexico]], carrying the newly appointed Governor-General of the [[Spanish East Indies]], ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' [[Juan Niño de Tabora]], who brought with him the statue. He arrived in Manila on 18 July 1626, and the statue was brought to San Ignacio Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in [[Intramuros]]. When Governor Tabora died in 1632, the statue was given to the Jesuits for enshrinement in the church of Antipolo, which was then being built in the present-day [[barangay]] Santa Cruz. 

===Claims of miracles===
During construction of the Antipolo church in the 1630s, the image would mysteriously vanish several times from its shrine, only to reappear atop a ''tipolo'' (breadfruit tree; ''[[Artocarpus incisa]]''). This was taken as a celestial sign, and the church was relocated to where the ''tipolo'' tree stood. The image's pedestal is supposedly made from the trunk of that same ''tipolo'' tree,&lt;ref name=PAGV&gt;[http://www.theartistweb.net/sites/antipolo/antipolo_our_lady_peace.php "Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage"]. Antipolo, Pilgrimage City. Retrieved on 2013-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; which also gave its name to Antipolo itself.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.theartistweb.net/sites/antipolo/antipolo_history.php "Antipolo History"]. Antipolo City, the Pilgrimage City. Retrieved on 2013-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1639 the Chinese rose in revolt, burning the town and the church. Fearing for the statue's safety, Governor [[Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera|Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera]] ordered its transfer to [[Cavite]], where it was temporarily enshrined. Governor Hurtado later ordered the statue removed from its Cavite shrine in 1648, and it was shipped back to Mexico aboard the [[galleon]] ''San Luis''. At the time, the statue of a saint onboard served as a ship's [[patron saint]] or protector of the Acapulco trade.
 
The statue crossed the Pacific six times aboard the following Manila-Acapulco galleons:
* ''San Luis'' — (1648–1649)
* ''Encarnación'' — (1650)
* ''San Diego'' — (1651–1653)
* ''San Francisco Javier'' — (1659–1662)
* ''Nuestra Señora del Pilar'' — (1663)
* ''San José'' — (1746–1748)

A royal decree by [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]] on 19 May 1864 ordered that the curias of San Nicolas de Tolentino be turned over to the Jesuits in exchange for the curias of Antipolo, Taytay and Morong, which were given to the [[Augustinian Recollects]]. The latter order thus came into possession of the image.

===World War II and coronation===
In 1944, the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] invaded the town and turned it into a garrison, with the shrine being used as an arsenal. To save the image, the church's head [[sacristan]], Procopio Ángeles, wrapped it in a thick woollen blanket and placed it in an empty [[Drum (container)|petrol drum]], which he then buried in a nearby kitchen.

Fighting between Imperial Japanese troops and the combined American and Filipino forces drove Ángeles and other devotees to exhume the image and move it to Kulaiki Hill on the border with [[Angono]]. From there, it was spirited away to the lowland Barangay Santolan in [[Pasig]], and then to the town center of Pasig itself. The statue was then kept by Rosario Alejandro (''née'' Ocampo), daughter of [[Pablo Ocampo]], at the Ocampo-Santiago family residence on Hidalgo Street, [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]], before it was enshrined inside [[Quiapo Church]] for the remainder of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=PAGV/&gt;

On 15 October 1945, the statue was [[Translation (relic)|translated]] back to its church in Antipolo, where it remains today. 

The statue was [[Canonical Coronation|canonically crowned]] by the [[Archbishop of Manila]], Rev. [[Michael J. O'Doherty]], on 28 November 1926 in Luneta (present-day [[Rizal Park]]), [[Manila]].

==Cathedral shrine==
{{main|Antipolo Cathedral}}

The first missionaries in [[Antipolo]] were the [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]], who arrived in the vicinity in 1578.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The Jesuits then followed and administered the church from 1591 until May 1768, when the decree [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelling]] the Jesuits from Spanish lands reached Manila. 

The church was greatly damaged during the Chinese uprising of 1639, the [[1645 Luzon earthquake]], and the earthquakes of 1824 and 1883. Notable Filipino historians such as Pedro Chirino and Pedro Murillo Velarde (also a prominent cartographer) ministered at the church.

The [[Diocese of Antipolo]] was created on 24 January 1983 and was canonically erected on 25 June 1983 at the diocese’s new see, which bears the formal title of “Cathedral-National Shrine of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage”.

==Pilgrimage==
Pilgrimages to the image's shrine begin and peak in May, which in Catholicism is [[May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary|dedicated to the Virgin Mary]]. On 30 April&amp;mdash;the eve of [[May Day]]&amp;mdash; thousands of devotees from [[Metro Manila]] customarily perform the ''Alay Lakad'' (literally, “Walk Offering”), where pilgrims spend the night travelling on foot to the shrine, where they hear [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANTIPOLO - RIZAL TRAVEL TIPS AND GENERAL INFORMATION|url=http://info.philtravelcenter.com/rizal-festivals.php|website=Philippines Travel Information|publisher=Philippines Travel and Hotel Guide|date=2013|quote=A month-long celebration to honor the Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage. Devotees are seen taking the much-trodden pat leading to Antipolo. The image, which is already three centuries old, is said to exhibit supernatural powers. On the evenings of April 30, thousands of pilgrims from several places in Metro Manila and the nearby towns begin an annual trek on foot.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farthest official starting point of the modern pilgrimage is Quiapo Church; the custom of visiting the shrine in May, however, was already recorded by the 19th century. On 6 June 1868, a young [[José Rizal]] and his father ''Don'' Francisco Mercado, visited the shrine in thanksgiving after the boy and his mother, Teodora Alonso, survived his [[childbirth|delivery]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jose Rizal University|title=In Calamba, Laguna|url=http://www.joserizal.ph/ec01.html|website=JoseRizal.ph|accessdate=1 May 2015|date=2004|quote="6 June 1868  With his father, Rizal made a pilgrimage to Antipolo to fulfill the vow made by his mother to take the child to the Shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo should she and her child survive the ordeal of delivery which nearly caused his mother’s life."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In December 2011, the [[Eternal Word Television Network]] programme ''Mary: Mother of the Philippines'' ran an episode showcasing the statue as the “Most traveled Marian Icon in the Philippines”.

Artist Zhu Haogu created the '''''Paradise of Maitreya''''' (彌勒佛說法圖) wall painting during China’s [[Yuan Dynasty]]. The painting was originally housed in the Xinghua Si Temple of Xiaoning, [[Shanxi]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, it was disassembled and moved to the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) of [[Toronto]], Canada, where it remains today. Museum officials have undertaken a series of restorations to preserve and stabilize the painting. Currently, it can be found in the museum’s "Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art" as part of the Far Eastern Collection and is described as one of its must-see Iconic Objects.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2006_7153_1 ''The Paradise of Maitreya wall-painting''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting features the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]],&lt;ref name="ROM 2012"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://www.rom.on.ca/en/collections-research/rom-channel/iconic-paradise-meitreya ''Iconic: The Paradise of Maitreya''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a future Buddha who is foretold to appear on Earth in order to help humans achieve enlightenment through the teachings of dharma.&lt;ref name ="McBride"&gt;McBride &amp; Richard, ''Silla Buddhism and the Hwarang'', ''Korean Studies, 34, 54-89'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

As it stands today, the wall painting measures 502&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 1101&amp;nbsp;cm in length and has a symmetrical composition, notable for its high level of detail.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt; It features Buddha Maitreya in the centre of an imagined heaven, surrounded on both sides by monks and the ruling king and queen. Although Buddha Maitreya is commonly depicted as an Indian figure, all of the characters in The Paradise of Maitreya are found to be wearing Chinese robes and clothing.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

The piece foretells the coming of the coming of the Buddha Maitreya, who is said to appear on Earth in its darkest hour to save humanity from [[samsara]].&lt;ref name ="McBride" /&gt; The royal family depicted in the painting is gathering the first assembly; leading 84,000 newly converted followers into salvation. Both the king and the queen have bald, shaven heads,&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; which, in Buddhist culture, represents turning towards enlightenment and nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Eilberg-Schwartz &amp; Doniger ''Off with Her Head!: The Denial of Women's Identity in Myth, Religion and Culture'', University of California Press, page 33, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==

The famed painter and Buddhist monk, Zhu Haogu (朱好古), along with his pupil Zhang Boyuan (張伯淵), created the dry fresco painting on the southwestern portion of the Xinghua Si (興化寺) monastery during China’s Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name ="Mclean"&gt;McLean, Dziadowiec &amp; Kirinkov, [https://www.cac-accr.ca/files/pdf/EJournalVol33_abstract2.pdf "Conservation of the Chinese Temple Painting The Paradise of Maitreya from the Bishop White Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum"], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare the monastery wall for this type of painting, it was covered first with a mudded layer of clay, followed by a layer of straw and additional layer of clay, giving the surface a workable texture. From there, a light carbon ink and colour pigments were used to create the image, which would have been copied from a smaller-scale version.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Movement ==

During the 1920s, the various armies of the [[Warlord Era|Chinese warlords]] would often plunder small villages in search of valuable goods. Fearing The Paradise of Maitreya was in danger of theft, the monks of Xinghua Si removed the work from the wall and partitioned it into 63 pieces so that it could be securely stored and hidden in [[Taiyuan]]. While the painting survived the plundering, it faced environmental threats from fire and draught in its new location. Instead of allowing the work to undergo further degradation, the monks began approaching art dealers, hoping to sell it.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

In 1928, Anglican Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Honan)]] heard of the sale and proceeded to purchase the painting. Over the following 5&amp;nbsp;year period, the piece was shipped from Taiyuan to [[Tianjin]], then taken via American Express to Boston, and from there was taken to Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum by train.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Restoration at the Royal Ontario Museum ==

While the painting suffered notable damage following its removal from the Xinghua si monastery, restoration efforts made by the ROM have led The Paradise of Maitreya to become one of the best preserved pieces from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt;

=== Initial restoration ===

Restoration on the piece commenced in 1933 with structural treatment to reassemble the 63 panels the painting was partitioned into. During the work’s movement, a significant amount of degradation had occurred, causing loss and disfigurement.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; After the initial restoration was completed, George Stout mounted the painting on the north wall of the ROM’s Bishop White Gallery. It was placed on Masonite panels developed at the [[Fogg Museum|Fogg Art Museum]] using a [[polyvinyl acetate]] resin.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ROM ===

As part of a museum-wide restoration effort put on by the ROM in 2005, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' received further attention addressing surface and structural issues. Plastazote LD45 was used to undertake general breakdowns in the joint material of the [[Masonite]] panels for its flexibility and imperviousness to humidity.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

== Dating ==

While ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' arrived in the ROM in 1933, it wasn’t until 1940 when Bishop William C. White became the first to propose a date for the painting. A team of students commissioned by White discovered the painting appeared to bear an inscription dictating it was completed on the 14th day of the mid-autumn moon of ''qingshen''. White believed this gave an age that was too young for the painting and that his students had therefore interpreted the inscription incorrectly. Instead, he believed the inscription read the painting was completed in ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', which he claimed would date it to be from 1238.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt"&gt;Steinhardt, "A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style", "Artibus Asiae, 48, 1, 5-38", 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Bachhofer later researched the painting and found an additional inscription quoting “da Yuan guo” (the great Yuan state). As this title was not used in Yuan until 1271, it made the painting’s date of 1238 inaccurate. He agreed that the painting bore the inscription ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', however, as these characters were reused on a 60-year cycle, he instead believed the term ''wuzu'' was referring to the year 1298.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===

As most of the painting’s inscriptions were not transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, it is impossible to get a full record of the painting’s background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the painting’s date. As such, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, "Further Observations on the Yuan Wall Painter Zhu Haogu and the Relationship of the Chunyang Hall Wall Paintings to The Maitreya Paradise at the ROM", "Artibus Asiae, 52, 1, 94-118", 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">In [[demonology]], '''Phenex''' is a Great Marquis of [[Hell]] and has twenty legions of [[demon]]s under his command. He teaches all wonderful sciences, is an excellent poet, and is very obedient to the [[conjuror]]. Phenex hopes to return to [[Heaven]] after 1,200 years, but he is deceived in this hope.

He is depicted as a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], which sings sweet notes with the voice of a child, but the conjurer must warn his companions (for he has not to be alone) not to hear them and ask him to put in human shape, which the demon supposedly does after a certain amount of time.

[[Johann Wier]]'s [[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]] describes this spirit as follows:
 
"Phoenix is a great marquesse, appearing like the bird [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], having a child's voice: but before he standeth still before the conjuror, he singeth many sweet notes. Then the exorcist with his companions must beware he give no ear to the melody, but must by and by bid him put on humane shape; then will he speak marvelously of all wonderful sciences. He is an excellent poet, and obedient, he hopeth to return to the seventh throne after a thousand two hundredth years, and governeth twenty legions."

''Other spellings'': Pheynix, Phoenix, Phoeniex.

== Ancient indigenous beliefs or Dayawism ==
{{Main|Indigenous religious beliefs of the Philippines|Philippine mythology|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Anito|Gabâ|Kulam|Dambana}}
During pre-colonial times, a form of [[animism]] was widely practiced in the Philippines. Each of the ethno-linguistic tribe in the archipelago practices a distinct indigenous religion. Today, the Philippines is mostly Catholic and other forms of Christianity, and only a handful of the indigenous tribes continue to practice the old traditions. These are a collection of beliefs and cultural mores anchored more or less in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and supernatural entities, both good and bad, and that respect be accorded to them through nature worship. These spirits all around nature are known as "''[[diwata]]s''", showing cultural relationship with [[Hinduism]] ([[Devata]]s). Currently, there are 135 ethno-linguistic tribes in the Philippines according to the [[Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino]]. Less than half of which still practice indigenous religions which have been used prior to Spanish colonialism.
[[File:Wodden Carvings of the Bululs.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Wooden images of ancestral spirits (''[[anito]]'') in a museum in [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Philippines]]]]
Some worship specific deities, such as the Tagalog supreme deity, [[Bathala]], and his children Adlaw, [[Mayari]], and [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]], or the Visayan deity [[Kan-Laon]]. Others practice [[Ancestor worship]] (''[[anito]]s'').{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Variations of animistic practices occur in different ethnic groups. [[Magic and religion|Magic]], chants and prayers are often key features. Its practitioners were highly respected (and some feared) in the community, as they were healers, [[midwives]] (''[[hilot]]''), [[shaman]]s, [[witch]]es and [[warlock]]s (''[[mangkukulam]]''), [[priest]]s/priestesses (''[[babaylan]]/[[katalonan]]''), tribal historians and wizened elders that provided the spiritual and traditional life of the community. In the [[Visayas|Visayan]] regions, shamanistic and animistic beliefs in witchcraft (''[[barang (Philippine mythology)|barang]]'') and mythical creatures like ''[[aswang]]'' (vampires), ''[[duwende]]'' (dwarves), and ''[[bakonawa]]'' (a gigantic sea serpent), may exist in some indigenous peoples alongside more mainstream Christian and Islamic faiths.

[[File:Kaamulan(2).jpg|thumb|180px|right|Procession in Malaybalay for the indigenous Kaamulan Festival]]

Spanish missionaries during the 16th century arrived in the [[Philippines]] noted warrior priestesses leading tribal spiritual affairs. Many were condemned as [[paganism|pagan]] [[heresy|heretics]]. Although suppressed, these matriarchal tendencies run deep in Filipino society and can still be seen in the strong leadership roles modern Filipino women are assuming in business, politics, academia, the arts and in religious institutions.

Nominally animists constitute about one percent of the population.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} But animism's influence pervade daily life and practice of the colonial religions that took root in the Philippines. Elements of folk belief melded with Christian and Islamic practices to give a unique perspective on these religions.

Just like the way Hinduism and Shintoism started, where they began as a collection of different indigenous belief systems from different ethnic groups, the indigenous belief systems of the Philippines are sometimes referred to as ''Dayawism''. The term itself came from the word, 'dayaw', which is an indigenous word found in all indigenous languages in the country. The term means to give praise, to be proud of oneself and the nation the self represents, enhancements or improvements, or festivity and pride, depending on the language. Other terms used for the collection of Philippine indigenous religions are ''Anitism'' and ''Bathalism'', although the two terms are Tagalog-centrist in terminology.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

===Preserving Dayawism Through the Paiwan Model===
Due to the influx of Christianity, Islam, and other world religions in traditional communities, the indigenous practices, rituals, and spiritual performances and knowledge of indigenous Filipinos are fast disappearing. Cultural workers in the country suggest the Paiwan Model, which was made by the Taiwanese government to preserve indigenous religions, to save the Philippines' own indigenous religions. The indigenous practices and shamanism of the Paiwan people of Taiwan was the fastest declining religion in the country. This prompted the Taiwanense government to preserve the religion and to push for the establishment of the Paiwan School of Shamanism where religious leaders teach their apprentices the native religion so that it will never be lost. It became an effective medium in preserving, and even uplifting the Paiwan people's indigenous religion.

In the Philippines, shamanism is referred as ''dayawism'', meaning 'gallant religions that give thanks to all living and non-living things'. As of 2018, there is no established ''school of dayawism'' in the Philippines, making the hundreds of indigenous religions in the country in great peril from extinction due to the influx of colonial-era religions. Each indigenous religion in the Philippines is distinct from each other, possessing unique epics, pantheons, belief systems, and other intangible heritage pertaining to religious beliefs. Due to this immense diversity in indigenous religions, a singular school of dayawism is not feasible. Rather, hundreds of schools of dayawism pertaining to an ethno-linguistic tribe is a better supplement to the current religious landscape in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=School of witchcraft opens in Taiwan |first=Nick |last=Collins |newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk |date=21 Sep 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6207476/School-of-witchcraft-opens-in-Taiwan.html |access-date=2018-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428193926/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6207476/School-of-witchcraft-opens-in-Taiwan.html# |archive-date=2018-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|Buddhism in the Philippines}}
No written record exists about the early Buddhism in the Philippines. However, archaeological discoveries and the few scant references in the other nations' historical records can tell about the existence of Buddhism from the 9th century onward in the islands. These records mention the independent states that comprise the Philippines and which show that they were not united as one country in the early days. Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts. The style are of Vajrayana influence.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The Philippines's early states must have become the tributary states of the powerful Buddhist Srivijaya empire that controlled the trade and its sea routes from the 6th century to the 13th century in Southeast Asia. The states's trade contacts with the empire long before or in the 9th century must have served as the conduit for introducing Vajrayana Buddhism to the islands.

Both Srivijaya empire in Sumatra and Majapahit empire in Java were unknown in history until 1918 when the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient's George Coedes postulated their existence because they had been mentioned in the records of the Chinese Tang and Sung imperial dynasties. Ji Ying, a Chinese monk and scholar, stayed in Sumatra from 687 to 689 on his way to India. He wrote on the Srivijaya's splendour, "Buddhism was flourishing throughout the islands of Southeast Asia. Many of the kings and the chieftains in the islands in the southern seas admire and believe in Buddhism, and their hearts are set on accumulating good action."

Both empires replaced their early Theravada Buddhist religion with Vajrayana Buddhism in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinebuddhism.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/early-buddhism-in-the-philippines/|title=Early Buddhism in the Philippines|first=|last=filipinobuddhism|date=8 November 2014|publisher=|access-date=2015-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222165630/https://philippinebuddhism.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/early-buddhism-in-the-philippines/#|archive-date=2015-12-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological evidence===
[[File:Right side of Tabon Cave.JPG|thumb|Example of what believes to be a cave painting depicting [[Manjusri]], at the [[Tabon Caves]] in [[Palawan]].]]
The Philippines's archaeological finds include a few of Buddhist artifacts, most of them dated to the 9th century. The artifacts reflect the iconography of the Srivijaya empire's [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its influences on the Philippines's early states. The artifacts's distinct features point to their production in the islands and they hint at the artisans's or goldsmiths's knowledge of the Buddhist culture and the Buddhist literature because the artisans have made these unique works of Buddhist art. The artifacts imply also the presence of the Buddhist believers in the places where these artifacts turned up. These places extended from the Agusan-Surigao area in Mindanao island to [[Cebu]], [[Palawan]], and [[Luzon]] islands. Hence, [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] must have spread far and wide throughout the archipelago. And Vajrayana Buddhism must have become the religion of the majority of the inhabitants in the islands.

In 1225, China's [[Zhao Rugua]], a [[wikt:superintendent|superintendent]] of maritime trade in [[Fujian|Fukien]] province wrote the book entitled ''Zhu Fan Zhi'' ({{zh|c=諸番志|l="Account of the Various Barbarians"}}) in which he described trade with a country called [[Ma-i]] in the island of [[Mindoro]] in [[Luzon]],(pronounced "Ma-yi") which was a prehispanic Philippine state. In it he said:

{{Quote|The country of Mai is to the north of [[Borneo]]. The [[natives]] live in large [[villages]] on the opposite banks of a stream and cover themselves with a cloth like a sheet or hide their bodies with a loin cloth. There are metal images of [[Buddhas]] of unknown origin scattered about in the tangled wilds.&lt;ref&gt;Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very lfferent from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism "There are [[copper]] Buddha's" images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political and Historical Writings (Vol. 7) | publisher=National Historical Institute | author=Rizal, Jose | year=2000 | location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The gold statue of the deity [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] is the most significant Buddhist artifact. In the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, Tara symbolizes the Absolute in its emptiness as the wisdom heart's essence that finds its expression through love and through compassion. The Vajrayana tradition also tells about the outpouring of the human heart's compassion that manifests Tara and about the fascinating story of the Bodhisattva of Compassion shedding a tear out of pity for the suffering of all sentient beings when he hears their cries. The tear created a lake where a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower emerges. It bears Tara who relieves their sorrow and their pain.

The Golden Tara was discovered in 1918 in Esperanza, Agusan and it has been kept in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, Illinois since the 1920s. [[Henry Otley Beyer]], the Philippines's pioneer anthropologist-archaeologist, and some experts have agreed on its identity and have dated it to belong within 900-950 CE, which covers the Sailendra period of the Srivijaya empire. They can not place, however, the Golden Tara's provenance because it has distinct features.

In the archipelago that was to become the Philippines, the statues of the Hindu gods were hidden to prevent their destruction by a religion which destroyed all [[cult image]]s. One statue, a "Golden Tara", a 4-pound gold statue of a Hindu-Malayan goddess, was found in [[Mindanao]] in 1917. The statue, denoted the ''Agusan Image'', is now in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], Chicago. The image is that of a Hindu-Malayan female deity, seated cross-legged. It is made of "twenty-one carat gold and weighs nearly four pounds." It has a richly ornamented headdress and many ornaments in the arms and other parts of the body. Scholars date it to the late 13th or early 14th century. It was made by local artists, perhaps copying from an imported Javanese model. The gold that was used was from this area, since Javanese miners were known to have been engaged in gold mining in [[Butuan]] at this time.

The existence of these gold mines, this artefact and the presence of "foreigners" proves the existence of some foreign trade, gold as element in the barter economy, and of cultural and social contact between the natives and "foreigners." As previously stated, this statue is not in The Philippines. Louise Adriana Wood (whose husband, [[Leonard Wood]], was military-governor of the Moro Province in 1903-1906 and governor general in 1921-1927) raised funds for its purchase by the Chicago Museum of Natural History. It is now on display in that museum's Gold Room.

According to Prof. Beyer, considered the "Father of Philippine Anthropology and Archaeology", a woman in 1917 found it on the left bank of the Wawa River near Esperanza, Agusan, projecting from the silt in a ravine after a storm and flood. From her hands it passed into those of Bias Baklagon, a local government official. Shortly after, ownership passed to the Agusan Coconut Company, to whom Baklagon owed a considerable debt. Mrs. Wood bought it from the coconut company.

The Philippines's archaeological finds include many ancient gold artifacts. Most of them have been dated to belong to the 9th century iconography of the Srivijaya empire. The artifacts's distinct features point to their production in the islands. It is probable that they were made locally because archaeologist Peter Bellwood discovered the existence of an ancient goldsmith's shop that made the 20-centuries-old lingling-o, or omega-shaped gold ornaments in Batanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |title=The Indian in the Filipino |first=Sunita |last=Khatnani |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621051322/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The style are of [[Vajrayana]] influence.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camperspoint"/&gt;

== Christianity ==
[[File:SanFernandojf3055 29.JPG|thumb|right|200px|San Fernando Metropolitan Cathedral in Pampanga]]
{{Main|Christianity in the Philippines}}
[[Christianity]] arrived in the Philippines with the landing of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521. In the late 16th century, the archipelago was claimed for Spain and named it after its king. Missionary activity during the country's colonial rule by Spain and the United States led the transformation of the Philippines into the first and then, along with [[East Timor]], one of two predominantly Catholic nations in East Asia, with approximately 92.5% of the population belonging to the Christian faith.&lt;ref name="cia-rp" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cia-tt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tt.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=|access-date=2012-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tt.html#|archive-date=2015-09-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
[[File:Cebu cathedral.jpg|thumb|The Catholic [[Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral]], built on the site of the Church of St. Vitales, the first church built in the Philippines]]
{{Main|Catholic Church in the Philippines}}

Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion and the largest Christian denomination, with estimates of approximately 80.6% of the population belonging to this faith in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/81162-map-catholicism-philippines|title=MAP: Catholicism in the Philippines|publisher=|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622060420/https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/81162-map-catholicism-philippines#|archive-date=2018-06-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has a significant Spanish Catholic tradition, and Spanish style Catholicism is embedded in the culture, which was acquired from [[priest]]s or [[friar]]s.

The Catholic Church has great influence on Philippine society and politics. One typical event is the role of the Catholic hierarchy during the bloodless [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986. Then-[[Archbishop of Manila]] and ''de facto'' Primate of the Philippines, [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] appealed to the public via radio to congregate along [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] in support of rebel forces. Some seven million people responded to the call between 22–25 February, and the non-violent protests successfully forced [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] out of power and into exile in [[Hawaii]].

Several Catholic holidays are culturally important as family occasions, and are observed in the civil calendar. Chief among these are [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]], which includes celebrations of the civil New Year, and the more solemn [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]], which may occur in March or April. Every November, Filipino families celebrate [[All Saints' Day]] and [[All Souls' Day]] as a single holiday in honour of the saints and the dead, visiting and cleaning ancestral graves, offering prayers, and feasting. As of 2018, Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 was added as a special non-working holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/29/17/duterte-signs-law-declaring-dec-8-a-nationwide-holiday|title=Duterte signs law declaring Dec. 8 a nationwide holiday|first=Dharel Placido, ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309114519/http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/29/17/duterte-signs-law-declaring-dec-8-a-nationwide-holiday#|archive-date=2018-03-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Papal visits ====
* [[Pope Paul VI]] was the target of an assassination attempt at Manila International Airport in the Philippines in 1970. The assailant, a [[Bolivia]]n [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] painter named [[Benjamín Mendoza y Amor Flores]], lunged toward Pope Paul with a [[kris]], but was subdued.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the country twice, 1981 and 1995. The final Mass of the event was recorded to have been attended by 4 million people, and was at the time the largest papal crowd in history.
* [[Pope Benedict XVI]] declined the invitation of Cardinal [[Gaudencio Rosales]] and CBCP President Ángel Lagdameo to visit because of a hectic schedule.
* [[Pope Francis]] visited the country in January 2015, and the concluding Mass at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] had almost 6 million attendees, breaking the record at Pope John Paul's Mass at the same site twenty years prior.

[[Members Church of God International]] (Filipino: ''Mga Kasapi Iglesia ng Dios Internasyonal'') is a religious organization popularly known through its television program, ''[[Ang Dating Daan]]'' (Tagalog for "The Old Path").

The church is known for their "Bible Expositions", where guests and members are given a chance to ask any biblical question to the Overall Servant of the church, [[Eliseo Soriano]] directly from the Bible. He and his co-servants expose teachings of asked religions which are not biblical and expands more knowledge about some misunderstood verses by using old manuscripts and reliable bible translations. 
Besides general preaching, they also established charity works. Among these humanitarian services are the charity homes for the senior citizens and orphaned children and teenagers; transient homes; medical missions; full college scholarship; start-up capital for livelihood projects; vocational trainings for the differently-abled; free legal assistance; free bus, jeepney, and train rides for commuters and senior citizens, and; free Bible for everyone.

Ora in May 1922. The Church claims to restore the visible Church founded in Jerusalem by Christ Jesus. It has spread to areas including [[California]], USA; [[Calgary]], Canada, [[Dubai]], UAE and other Asian countries. The Church will be celebrating its centennial anniversary in May 2022.

The church was founded by Bishop Teofilo D. Ora in 1922. He, along with Avelino Santiago and Nicolas Perez, split off from the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (Church of Christ) in 1922. They initially called their church ''Iglesia Verdadera de Cristo Hesus'' (True Church of Christ Jesus). However, following a religious doctrine controversy, Nicolas Perez split off from the group and registered an offshoot called ''Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus, Haligi at Suhay ng Katotohanan'' (Church of God in Christ Jesus, the Pillar and Support of the Truth). Teofilo D. Ora was bishop until his death in 1969. He was officially succeeded by Bishop [[Salvador C. Payawal]] who led the church until 1989. Subsequent bishops were Bishop Gamaliel T. Payawal (1989 to 2003) and Bishop Isagani N. Capistrano (2003–present). It was during Gamaliel Payawal's tenure when the church was renamed as ''Most Holy Church of God in Christ Jesus''.

=== Philippine Independent Church ===
[[File:Maragondon, Cavite..jpg|thumb|160px|Iglesia Filipina Independiente Parish of the [[Assumption of Mary|Virgin of the Assumption]] in [[Maragondon, Cavite]].]]
{{Main|Philippine Independent Church}}
The Philippine Independent Church (officially Spanish: [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]], IFI; colloquially known as the Aglipayan Church) is an independent Christian denomination in the form of a national church in the Philippines. Its schism from the Catholic Church was proclaimed in 1902 by the members of the [[Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina]] due to the alleged mistreatment of Filipinos by Spanish priests and the execution of nationalist José Rizal under Spanish colonial rule.

[[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was one of the initiators of the separation, and suggested that former Catholic priest [[Gregorio Aglipay]] be the head of the church. It is also known as the [[Aglipayan Church]] after its first [[Obispo Maximo]], Gregorio Aglipay.

Commonly shared beliefs in the Aglipayan Church are the rejection of the Apostolic Succession solely to the Petrine Papacy, the acceptance of priestly ordination of women, the free option of clerical celibacy, the tolerance to join Freemasonry groups, non-committal in belief regarding transubstantiation and Real Presence of the Eucharist, and the advocacy of contraception and same-sex civil rights among its members. Many saints canonised by Rome after the schism are also not officially recognised by the Aglipayan church and its members.

{{as of|2010}}, Aglipayans in the Philippines numbered about a million members, with most from the northern part of Luzon, especially in the Ilocos Region. Congregations are also found throughout the Philippine diaspora in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The church is the second-largest single Christian denomination in the country after the Roman Catholic Church (some 80.2% of the population), comprising about 2.6% of the total population of the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Apostolic Catholic Church ===
{{main|Apostolic Catholic Church (Philippines)}}
The [[Apostolic Catholic Church]] ([[Apostolic Catholic Church|ACC]]) is a [[catholic]] denomination founded in the 1980s in [[Hermosa, Bataan|Hermosa]], [[Bataan]]. It formally separated in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1992 when [[Patriarch]] Dr. John Florentine Teruel registered it as a [[Protestant]] and [[Independent Catholic]] denomination. Today, it has more than 5 million members worldwide. The largest international congregations are in Japan, United States and Canada.

In 1898, Spain lost the Philippines to the United States. After a bitter fight for independence against its new occupiers, Filipinos surrendered and were again colonized. The arrival of Protestant American missionaries soon followed. Protestant church organizations established in the Philippines during the 20th century include the following:

In 1380 [[Makhdum Karim|Karim ul' Makhdum]] the first Arabian trader reached the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and [[Jolo]] in the Philippines and through trade throughout the island established Islam in the country.

By the next century conquests had reached the [[Sulu]] islands in the southern tip of the [[Philippines]] where the population was animistic and they took up the task of converting the animistic population to Islam with renewed zeal. By the 15th century, half of [[Luzon]] (Northern Philippines) and the islands of [[Mindanao]] in the south had become subject to the various Muslim [[sultanates]] of [[Borneo]] and much of the population in the [[Mindanao|South]] were converted to Islam. However, the [[Visayas]] was largely dominated by [[Hinduism in the Philippines#Pre-contact period|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism in the Philippines#Pre-colonial period|Buddhist]] societies led by [[rajah]]s and [[Datu#Datu in Pre-colonial Principalities in the Visayas|datus]] who strongly resisted [[Islam]]. One reason could be due to the economic and political disasters prehispanic [[Moro Pirates|Muslim pirates]] from the Mindanao region bring during raids.

The Moros seek to establish an independent Islamic province in Mindanao to be named [[Moro people|Bangsamoro]]. The term ''Bangsamoro'' is a combination of an [[Old Malay language|Old Malay]] word meaning ''nation'' or ''state'' with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''Moro''.

Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by [[Majapahit]]. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.

Another gold artifact, from the Tabon caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam.&lt;ref name=atnb&gt;Anna T. N. Bennett (2009), [http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072 "Gold in early Southeast Asia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514022330/http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072# |date=2015-05-14 }}, ''ArcheoSciences'', Volume 33, pp 99–107&lt;/ref&gt; These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.&lt;ref&gt;Dang V.T. and Vu, Q.H., 1977. "The excavation at Giong Ca Vo site." ''Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology'' 17: 30–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Hinduism is largely confined to the Indian Filipinos and the [[expatriate]] Indian community. Theravada and Vajrayana Buddhism, are practiced by [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Sri Lanka]]n, [[Bamar|Burmese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]] nationals. There are Hindu temples in Manila, as well as in the provinces. There are temples also for [[Sikhism]], sometimes located near Hindu temples. The two Paco temples are well known, comprising a Hindu temple and a Sikh temple.

== Religion and politics ==
{{further|Freedom of religion in the Philippines}}
The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares: The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable. (Article II, Section 6), and, No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights. (Article III, Section 5). Joaquin Bernas, a Filipino Jesuit specializing in constitutional law, acknowledges that there were complex issues that were brought to court and numerous attempts to use the separation of Church and State against the Roman Catholic Church, but he defends the statement, saying that "the fact that he [Marcos] tried to do it does not deny the validity of the separation of church and state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquin G.

"head of a religious organization who influences or threatens to punish members could be held liable for coercion and violation of citizen's right to vote freely". The lawsuit filed by Social Justice Society party stated that "the Church's active participation in partisan politics, using the awesome voting strength of its faithful flock, will enable it to elect men to public office who will in turn be forever beholden to its leaders, enabling them to control the government".

They claimed that this violates the Philippine constitution's separation of Church and State clause.

The '''Royal Canadian Chaplain Service''' ({{lang-fr|Service de l'aumônerie royal canadien}}) is a [[personnel branch]] of the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] that has approximately 192 Regular Force chaplains and 145 Reserve Force chaplains&lt;ref name="forces.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/cfcb-bsafc/ps/rec/crb-bra/index-eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522200713/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/cfcb-bsafc/ps/rec/crb-bra/index-eng.asp |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[Christian]], [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish]] faiths. From 1969 to 2014 it was named the '''Chaplain Branch'''. It was renamed on October 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Canadian Armed Forces Chaplain Branch Returns to its Historical Identity|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=894079|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and vision==
The mission of this branch is to "support and enhance the effectiveness of the CF as a whole – its leadership, the individual men and women who serve and their families – through the provision of comprehensive religious and spiritual support, advice, and care."&lt;ref name="forces.gc.ca1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/cfcb-bsafc/acf-sbs/index-eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522200646/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/cfcb-bsafc/acf-sbs/index-eng.asp |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vision of the Chaplaincy is to "be an operationally relevant Chaplaincy that supports and cares for all CF personnel and their families, wherever they live and serve, empowering them spiritually and morally to meet the demands of military service."&lt;ref name="forces.gc.ca1"/&gt;

==Role==
*Foster the religious, spiritual and moral well-being of members and their families
*Offer a ministry of presence in a multitude of environments (at home and abroad)
*Participate in the life of the worshipping community
*Officiate at special functions
*Advise the commanding officer regarding the spiritual and ethical well-being and morale of their unit
*Liaise with civilian religious faith groups
*Collaborate with other care providers
*Provide directed care after critical incidents&lt;ref name="forces.gc.ca"/&gt;

==Leading prayer==
In accordance with their role, chaplains offer prayer services at home and abroad. Some services are inherently religious, such as Sunday worship, [[baptisms]] or religious funerals and [[burial at sea]] ceremonies. Other times, chaplains may offer a prayer for secular occasions such as base divisions, changes of command, mess dinners or [[ship commissioning]] ceremonies.  Before offering prayers during parades and ceremonies, it is customary that the order to remove headdress be given to those on parade.&lt;ref name="forces.gc.ca2"&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/pub/oth-aut/rd-js/rd-js-eng.asp#par-14&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, [[Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada]] ruled that this order was "not lawful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decisions.cmac-cacm.ca/site/cmac-cacm/cmac-cacm/en/item/7837/index.do?r=AAAAAQAGcHJheWVyAAAAAAAAAQ|title=R. v. Scott - Court Martial Appeal Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it unjustifiably required all attendees to show participation in a prayer that they may not believe. Following this ruling, non-believers are now permitted to retain their headdress, just like [[Jews]] and [[Sikh]]s do in accordance with their faith.&lt;ref name="forces.gc.ca2"/&gt;

==Training==

===Canadian Forces Chaplain School and Centre===
The Canadian Forces Chaplain School and Centre (CFChSC) in [[Borden, Ontario]], is responsible for the training of all [[chaplain]]s (Regular and Reserve, [[Protestant]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish]]). CFChSC provides training in operational and static ministry. 
The training is provided with an operational focus and an interfaith approach. Courses are available in both official languages English and French. Courses include Chaplain Basic Officer Training, Ethics, Pastoral Counselling, Chaplains in Deployed Operations, Intermediate, Advanced, Chapel Life Coordinator (Protestant and Roman Catholic), and Ministry in a Pluralistic Environment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://everitas.rmcclub.ca/?p=49026 Col John Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt; CFChSC prepares [[Military Chaplain#Canada|military chaplains]] for service in times of peace and times of conflict. The Resource Centre contains a library relating to ministry, religion and related areas. The Chaplains provide ministry to Canadian Forces personnel and their families.

==Annual Royal Canadian Chaplain Service Exercise==
[[Image:Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada, fall 2011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada]]
Since the amalgamation of the former Protestant and Roman Catholic Chaplaincies in the mid-1990s into a single multi-faith Canadian Forces Chaplaincy, a joint exercise. Consisting of seminars, business meetings and worship services, the annual exercise provides opportunities for the professional and spiritual development of chaplains and for fellowship as a Branch. The Annual Protestant Chaplain Branch Retreat and Seminar was held annually at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] in the late 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Badges==
{{see also|Military chaplain #Badges and insignia}}
On 24 September 2006, the Department of National Defence issued a press release indicating that, "[i]n order to better represent the diversity of Canadian society, and reflect the multi-faith nature of today’s chaplaincy", the current branch cap badge would be replaced with three new badges. The new badges would retain the crowned wreath of red maple leaves and central blue circle; the Maltese Cross behind the circle would be removed. On the circle would be "a different symbol for each faith tradition: for Christian chaplains, the Maltese cross, which has long been associated with Christian chaplaincy. Jewish chaplains will wear the symbol of the tablets of the Law and the Magen David (the star of David) and Muslim chaplains will wear the crescent." A scroll with the motto {{lang|la|vocatio ad servitium}} would be placed below the circle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=2083&lt;/ref&gt; These badges were approved by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on 15 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1078|title=Chaplain Branch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam''''' from the Studies in Late Antiquity and Early Islam series is a book by scholar of the Middle East [[Robert G. Hoyland]].

The book contains an extensive collection of [[Greece|Greek]], [[Syria]]n, [[Copt]]ic, [[Armenia]]n, [[Latin]], [[Jewish]], [[Iran|Persian]], and [[China|Chinese]] primary sources written between 620 and 780 AD in the Middle East, which provides a survey of eyewitness accounts of historical events during the formative period of [[Islam]].

The book presents the evidentiary text of over 120 seventh century manuscripts, one of which (the manuscript of [[Thomas the Presbyter]]) contains what Hoyland believes is the "first explicit reference to Muhammad in a non-Muslim source:"&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;
:In the year 945, indiction 7, on Friday 7 February (634) at the ninth hour, there was a battle between the Romans and the Arabs of Muhammad (tayyaye d-Mhmt) in Palestine twelve miles [19&amp;nbsp;km] east of Gaza. The Romans fled, leaving behind the patrician Bryrdn,&lt;ref&gt;The name "Bryrdn" is unclear; see, e.g., "Biblical and Near Eastern essays: studies in honour of Kevin J. Cathcart", {{ISBN|0-8264-6690-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7K0NqGJg2tcC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=bryrdn#v=onepage&amp;q=bryrdn&amp;f=false p. 283]&lt;/ref&gt; whom the Arabs killed. Some 4000 poor villagers of Palestine were killed there, Christians, Jews and Samaritans. The Arabs ravaged the whole region.

According to [[Michael G. Morony]], Hoyland emphasizes the parallels between Muslim and non-Muslim accounts of history emphasizing that non-Muslim texts often explain the same history as the Muslim ones even though they were recorded earlier. He concludes "Hoyland's treatment of the materials is judicious, honest, complex, and extremely useful."&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Morony. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/176224 International Journal of Middle East Studies], Vol. 31, No. 3. (Aug., 1999), pp. 452-453&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seth Andrews''' (born April 12, 1968) is an author and speaker on the subject of [[atheism]]. He is the creator and host of ''The Thinking Atheist'' online community, [[podcast]], and YouTube channel, and the author of the self-published books ''Deconverted'' and ''Sacred Cows''. Prior to his atheist activism, he was a [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] and had a ten-year career as a [[Christian radio]] host.&lt;ref name="dMcAfee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McAfee|first1=David|authorlink=David G.

== Early life ==

Andrews was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], into a [[Christianity|Christian]] family with parents who studied [[theology]], and he was baptized at the Eastwood Baptist Church. When his public-school education conflicted with the religious teachings he had received at home, his parents transferred him to the small, church-owned Temple Christian School, and later to the Eastwood Baptist School. As a student leader, he eagerly participated in school functions and religious activities, including weekly church services, the student council, and the local branch of [[Youth for Christ]], for which he was a spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Seth|title=Deconverted|date=2012|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=1-4787-1656-8|pages=5–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friendly-Atheist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehta|first1=Hemant|authorlink=Hemant Mehta|title=Friendly Atheist Podcast Episode 7: Seth Andrews, The Thinking Atheist|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/07/28/friendly-atheist-podcast-episode-7-seth-andrews-the-thinking-atheist/|website=[[Patheos]]|date=July 28, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career as a radio host ==
Andrews was a fan of [[contemporary Christian music]]. He hosted the Morning Show on [[Christian radio]] station [[KXOJ-FM]] from 1990 to 2000.&lt;ref name="AA Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whissel|first1=Pamela|title=From Christian Broadcaster to Thinking Atheist: An Interview with Seth Andrews|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/02/10/from-christian-broadcaster-to-thinking-atheist-an-interview-with-seth-andrews/|work=[[American Atheist Magazine]]|date=2013|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1997 death of [[Rich Mullins]] planted the first seed of doubt in his mind. The premature death of the Christian songwriter was hard to reconcile with Andrews' understanding of the principles of Christianity. He later commented, "As I spoke words of comfort to our listeners and callers, I struggled to reconcile the notion that the God of [[Matthew 10]], the one who considered us worth 'more than many sparrows,' would design or abide the taking of Mullins’ earthly life in such a pointless, gruesome manner."&lt;ref name="AA Magazine"/&gt; This event was a turning point for him, and he began the long, slow journey to [[apostasy]].&lt;ref name="Deconverted the book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Seth|title=Deconverted|date=2012|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=1-4787-1656-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events of [[attacks of September 11, 2001|September 11, 2001]] also played a crucial role in strengthening his doubts about religion.&lt;ref name="AA Magazine"/&gt;

== ''The Thinking Atheist'' ==
In 2004 Andrews saw the video of [[new atheist]] [[Christopher Hitchens]] debating [[Rabbi Shmuley Boteach]], which gave him the courage to leave his faith. In 2008, he finally came out as [[atheism|atheist]] to his family and friends.&lt;ref name="eSKEPTIC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prothero|first1=Donald|authorlink=Donald Prothero|title=The Thinking Atheist Confesses|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/14-08-27/#feature|work=[[Skeptic Magazine]]|date=August 27, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding no community of like-minded people in his area, he decided to build an atheist community online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Seth|title=Deconverted|date=2012|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=1-4787-1656-8|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He created a website and Facebook page, both called ''The Thinking Atheist'',&lt;ref name="tta-updated-2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Seth|url=http://www.thethinkingatheist.com|title=The Thinking Atheist|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to connect with other non-believers online and "share some of the information that I had found helpful in the hope of making the journey out of superstition easier for others".&lt;ref name="AA Magazine"/&gt; He considers the website to be a venue which allows people to engage their doubts and question their faith, and thus live a healthier life.&lt;ref name="AZDS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Betz|first1=Eric|title=Popular atheist to speak at Northern Arizona University on Saturday|url=http://azdailysun.com/news/local/popular-atheist-to-speak-at-northern-arizona-university-on-saturday/article_043bafe4-9543-11e3-bcba-0019bb2963f4.html|date=February 14, 2014|work=[[Arizona Daily Sun]]|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Andrews is also the host of ''The Thinking Atheist'' weekly [[podcast]], which aims to challenge stereotypes that depict atheists as angry, or religious people as stupid.&lt;ref name="RedDirt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffin|first1=Andrew|title=Tulsan Seth Andrews, host of 'The Thinking Atheist,' talks about his journey from faith to non-belief|url=http://www.reddirtreport.com/red-dirt-news/tulsan-seth-andrews-host-thinking-atheist-talks-about-his-journey-faith-non-belief|accessdate=January 20, 2017|work=Red Dirt Report|date=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he has a YouTube channel called ''The Thinking Atheist'' which hosts numerous self-produced atheist-related videos. He also does public speaking about atheism.&lt;ref name="AZDS"/&gt;

== Books ==
[[File:Seth Andrews 2016 (3).jpg|thumb|Andrews signing ''Sacred Cows'' at the Atheist Community of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]]]
Andrews has written two self-published books, ''Deconverted'' (2012) and ''Sacred Cows'' (2015). 

=== ''Deconverted'' ===
In December 2012 he self-published his autobiographical book ''Deconverted: A Journey From Religion To Reason'', detailing his journey out of religion and how he became an atheist activist.&lt;ref name="Deconverted-updated"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Seth|title=Deconverted|date=2012|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-1656-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaxpx.com/book-review-seth-andrews-de-converted-a-journey-from-religion-to-reason/|title=Book Review: Seth Andrews ''De-Converted: A Journey From Religion To Reason''|last=Avalos|first=Joey|date=January 31, 2013|access-date=January 29, 2017|website=The Armchair Philosopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to discussing his apostasy, he recounts his life growing up in the [[Bible Belt]] and his past as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] for a Christian radio station, and discusses how and why he created the ''Thinking Atheist'' community. 

Paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]] commented on the book as follows: "Andrews writes in a friendly, relaxed folksy style, just as you hear him on the air, and it suits his humble narrative well. He is a good storyteller and conversationalist not only in his radio work, but on the printed page as well.... Andrews’ book is a short but very enjoyable read. It is especially of interest to anyone who has made a similar journey from faith to non-belief, or wishes to understand how this process works."&lt;ref name="eSKEPTIC" /&gt;

=== ''Sacred Cows'' ===
In June 2015 he self-published his second book, ''Sacred Cows: A Lighthearted Look at Belief and Tradition Around the World''. In it he identifies ideas, beliefs and traditions that various cultures regard as [[holy]], stressing that ideas should be examined critically rather than being followed with blind faith. 

In a review for ''[[Skeptic Magazine]]'', Donald Prothero wrote: "Taking a gently incredulous tone, Andrews reviews a long litany of the strange things people believe and do. In most cases, he tries to be sympathetic and understanding. He always tries to keep things in perspective and remind his readers that he once accepted beliefs that seem odd to him now. But in other cases, it’s impossible not to adopt a note of sarcasm and mockery at beliefs that are clearly bonkers."&lt;ref name="Cows"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prothero|first1=Donald|authorlink=Donald Prothero|title=All Sacred Cows|url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/all-sacred-cows/|website=[[Skeptic Magazine]]|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
* In 2012, ''The Thinking Atheist'' was voted the Favorite Agnostic/Atheist Website of 2012, winning the [[About.com]] Reader's Choice Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/ReadersChoiceAwards/ss/Readers-Choice-Awards-2012_5.htm|title=Readers' Choice Awards 2012: Favorite Agnostic/Atheist Web Site of 2011|author=Cline, Austin|work=About Religion: Agnosticism/Atheism|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401215657/http://atheism.about.com/od/ReadersChoiceAwards/ss/Readers-Choice-Awards-2012_5.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=2012|archivedate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2013, he received the Evolve Award For Excellence in a Podcast for ''The Thinking Atheist'', with the comment that "Andrews tackles issues about the world, atheism, and religion while showing that a person can be an atheist without being a grouch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eberhard|first1=JT|title=2013 EVOLVE Award winners|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wwjtd/2013/06/2013-evolve-award-winners/|website=[[Patheos]]|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on religion ==
In 2014, Andrews told the ''[[Arizona Daily Sun]]'', "I was a true believer, and when I hit the age of 37, my doubts about my faith came to critical mass and for the first time in my life, I began to examine what I had held as true." About his recent activism he declared: “I’m not an enemy of religious people, but I’ll be honest and say I am an enemy of religion.”&lt;ref name="AZDS" /&gt; 

When asked by ''[[AlterNet]]'' what his favorite Bible verse was, he replied that it was probably [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 12:9]], which reads 'Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.' He explained, "The message here isn't groundbreaking (and certainly doesn't require godlike powers to formulate), but I find it admirable: Don't be a fake. Pursue that which brings about a positive result, for yourself and for others. Hold evil in contempt. Of course, I don't bind a supernatural connotation to the word 'evil' but rather see evil as an action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tarico|first1=Valerie|title=Bible Verses That Atheists Love|url=http://www.alternet.org/belief/bible-verses-atheists-love|website=[[AlterNet]]|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Oklahoma news website asked Andrews about his opinion on [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], America's first modern atheist and the founder of [[American Atheists]], who ended compulsory Bible reading in public schools in the 1960s. He replied, "I personally don’t relate to her tactics, but while I myself may have a different style, I must give her credit. Madalyn was a such a champion for non-belief that she paid for it with her life. I have a tremendous amount of admiration (for her). She did a lot of good work."&lt;ref name="RedDirt" /&gt;

'''Siddhashrama''' ({{IAST|Siddhāśrama}}; [[Devanagari]]:सिद्धाश्रम) popularly called '''Gyangunj''' is considered as a mystical hermitage, which according to a tradition, is located in a secret land deep in the Himalayas, where great [[yogi]]s, [[sadhu]]s, and [[Wise old man|sages]] who are [[siddha's]] live. This place is also revered as the mystical land of [[Shambhala]] by Tibetans. According to another tradition, the Siddhashrama is located in the Tibetan region, nearby Kailash parvat. Though any Sadhu, Sanyasi, Yeti, Monk and Yogi might have known 'Siddhashram' by any name or various cults might have used different worship or Sadhana methods according to their beliefs. 

The context of this supernatural land has been mentioned in many ancient scriptures along with four Vedas. The Siddhashram is described as a divine place in spiritual journey. Thus it is also believed that while discharging their divine works in this universe the spiritually empowered Yogis remain in constant touch with Siddhashram and they visit it regularly. Further more, it is also believed that the divine personalities like Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Shankaracharya, and Ma Anandamai etc. are present along with their bodies at Siddhashram.

Siddhashram is considered as the base of spiritual consciousness, heart of divinity and the mortification land of great Rishies. Siddhashram is equally scarce to human beings and all the visible and invisible creatures. Thus, the Siddhashram is assumed as a very scarce divine place. But it will be possible to get the divine power to enter this scarce and sacred place by doing hard works through Sadhana procedure and following Sadhana path.
Siddhashram is a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas, where great siddha yogis, sadhus, and sages live. Siddhashram is the ashram by our ancestors, saints, sages &amp; Yogis of high order. It is referred to in many Indian epics, the Veda, Upanishads and Puranas including the Rigveda, the oldest scripture of human civilization.

Siddhashram is the society for the enlightened people or siddhas. The person, who reaches high level in sadhana can reach the mystical siddhashram with the blessings of the guru, who is the regular of this place. 
This aashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash. Siddha yogis and sanyasis are meditating in this place for thousands of years. Like many mystical places mentioned in different religions this place can't be seen with naked eyes, it's an experience and only through the path of meditation and spiritual awareness we can experience this place.

Many in Hinduism believe that Maharsih Vashishtha, Vishwamitra, Kanad, Pulastya, Atri, Mahayogi Gorakhnath, Srimad Shankaracharya, Bheesma, Kripacharya, can be seen wandering there in physical form and also one can have the privilege of listening to their sermons. Many Siddha yogi, yoginis, Apsara (Angel), saints are found to be meditating in this place. The beautiful flowers in the garden, trees, birds, siddha-yoga lake, meditating saints and many other things of the place cannot be described in words.

==In ancient Indian literature==
Siddhashrama (literally, the hermitage of the Siddhas) is referred to in the [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Purana]]s. In [[Valmiki]]'s Ramayana it is said that [[Viswamitra]] has his hermitage in Siddhashrama and it was the erstwhile hermitage of [[Vishnu]], when he appeared as the [[Vamana]] [[Avatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vyas, R.T. (ed.)|title={{IAST|Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Text as Constituted in its Critical Edition}}|year=1992|publisher=Oriental Institute, Vadodara|location= Vadodara|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] to Siddhashrama to exterminate the demons who are disturbing his religious sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valmikiramayan.net/bala/sarga29/bala_29_frame.htm Valmiki Ramayana - Bala Kanda Chapter 29]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Narada Purana]] (Purva,1.25), Siddhashrama is mentioned as the hermitage of sage [[Ugrasrava Sauti|Suta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/puranas/narada_purana_purva.pdf|title=Shri Naradiya Mahapuranam, Purvabhagam. |publisher=Maharishi University of Management website|accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In recent writings==
In the modern era, the knowledge of Siddhashram is first referred by the Pandit [[Gopinath Kaviraj]] and later extensively by [[Dr.Narayan Dutt Shrimali]].

'''Tōdaiji Gakuen''' (東大寺学園 ''Tōdaiji Gakuen'') is a private school, combined [[middle school|middle]] and [[high school]] in the city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]]. It was founded in 1926 as an offshoot of the famous [[Tōdai-ji]] temple, and began as an evening middle school (夜間中学) for working students. Daytime education began in 1963, when the current name was adopted, and evening education was dropped in 1977.
Today, most of the students go on to the national universities, especially [[Kyoto University]] and [[University of Tokyo]], or medical courses.

[[File:Benkert-William-Randolph-1909.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rev. William Rudolph Benkert was the originator and longtime National Chairman of the United Christian Party.]]
The '''United Christian Party''' (UCP) was a [[political party]] first established in the [[United States|American]] state of [[Iowa]] in August 1897. Although superficially professing an orientation towards [[theocracy]] and a conservative social program in its earliest years, the UCP advocated progressive political reform, promoting [[direct democracy]] through implementation of [[initiative and referendum]]. By 1904 the organization advocated government ownership of key natural resources and public utilities and an opposition to monopolistic forms of economic ownership in accord with the [[golden rule]].

The UCP was the brainchild of Rev. [[William Rudolph Benkert]] of [[Davenport, Iowa]], who dominated the organization as its National Chairman throughout its entire existence. After running tickets for President and Vice President of the United States under its own name in the elections of 1900, 1904, and 1908, the UCP was briefly absorbed into a new organization called the '''American Party''' in 1909 before resuming its former name.

In 1912 another very short-lived name change was made, this time to '''Christian Patriots'''. This change was again quickly reversed and the party's ticket appeared on the November 1912 ballot under its old moniker. The party continued in existence but went on hiatus, failing to run a Presidential ticket in the elections of 1916, 1920, or 1924. While intimations were made that a Presidential ticket would be fielded in 1928, it seems that this plan came to naught and the party expired.

== Organizational history ==

=== Early history ===
The United Christian Party was the brainchild of Rev. [[William Rudolph Benkert]], a minister at the Church of God in [[Davenport, Iowa]] moved to action by what he perceived to be the nation's declining [[morality|moral values]] and called for a return to the [[Christianity|Christian]] moral tradition.&lt;ref name=Others303&gt;Darcy Richardson, ''Others: Third Parties During the Populist Period: Volume II.'' New York: iUniverse, 2007; pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1897 an organizational conference was held in Davenport to establish a political organization through which Benkert might advance his political agenda.&lt;ref name=Proposal&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2497841/united_christian_party_history/ "United Christian Party: A Proposal to Hold a National Convention in the Near Future,"] ''Davenport Daily Leader,'' vol. 8 (April 24, 1898), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent conference helping to solidify the organization was held in the neighboring town of [[Washington, Iowa]], and planning began almost immediately for a national convention to be held in a major [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] city.&lt;ref name=Proposal /&gt;

In the spring of 1898 Benkert came out with a draft national platform which acknowledged "Almighty God and the rightful sovereign of all men and women, and the [[Jesus|Lord Jesus Christ]] as the ruler among the nations of the earth."&lt;ref name=Proposal /&gt; Having made this tip of the hat to [[theocracy]], Benkert's program declared the United Christian Party to be a "party of reform" in favor of "whatever tends to make men and women intelligent and virtuous."&lt;ref name=Proposal /&gt; Such reforms were envisioned to be enabled by the establishment of [[direct legislation]] through implementation of the system of [[initiative and referendum]] and [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref name=Proposal /&gt; Benkert's draft platform declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We believe that it will be impossible to secure direct legislation without a union of all Christians and all reformers and reform parties, and knowing that there is no higher standard of reform than Christ and no more worthy name to be honored in uniting us than his name, and knowing he is a true friend of those who labor and a friend of the poor and oppressed and that God hears us when we ask for reform in His name, therefore we ask all his followers, regardness of nationality, creed or color, sex or previous politics to join hands with us in His name at the ballot box in making this a government by and for the people through direct legislation of the people..."&lt;ref name=Proposal /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1899 Iowa State Convention ===
[[File:Inn-Black-Hawk-Watch-Tower.jpg|thumb|right|340px|The Inn at Black Hawk's Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois, was the frequent location of conventions of the United Christian Party.]]

On July 4, 1899, delegates gathered in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] for what was touted as the first annual Iowa State Convention of the United Christian Party.&lt;ref name=State&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2500645/iowa_state_convention_of_the_united/ "End of the Convention: State Meeting of United Christian Party Adjourns, First Annual Session,"] ''Daily Iowa Capital'' [Des Moines], vol. 16, no. 162, Third Edition (July 5, 1899), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering received an official communication from the [[National Reform Association (19th century, U.S.)|National Reform Party]] which requested that the convention name a 10-member delegation to attend a joint convention held at some future time to be determined in the following year to name a ticket for a national campaign in the November 1900 election.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

Individuals were selected to comprise a State Central Committee to govern the affairs of the United Christian Party in Iowa, one from each of five congressional districts, with no committee members immediately named for the three other congressional districts in the state.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;  Nominees were selected to represent the party in the 1899 Iowa elections, topped by C. C. Heacock of [[Brighton, Iowa|Brighton]] for Governor and Rev. [[John Fitz Randolph Leonard]] of [[Ainsworth, Iowa|Ainsworth]] for Lieutenant-Governor, in addition to nominees for other state offices.&lt;ref name=State /&gt; A short platform, borrowing heavily from William R. Benkert's previous draft document, was approved.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

The choice of Heacock for Governor was regarded by peculiar by at least one Des Moines political analyst. Heacock, the publisher of the ''Brighton Enterprise,'' was at the time serving a six-month jail sentence following conviction for criminal [[libel]].&lt;ref name=Criticism&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2500684/criticism_of_united_christian_partys/ "Editorial,"] ''Daily Iowa Capital'' [Des Moines], vol. 16, no. 165 (July 8, 2015), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "it is not claimed that he is a Christian or even a church member," the editor of the Des Moines ''Iowa Daily Capital'' scolded.&lt;ref name=Criticism /&gt;

The UCP subsequent regarded the July 4, 1899 date of the convocation of this convention as its moment of foundation, despite the group's previous organizational history.&lt;ref name=Bemidji&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2501076/call_issued_for_1904_nominating/ "Meet in St. Louis May 1: Christian Party Will Name Candidate for President,"] ''The Pioneer'' [Bemidji, MN], vol. 1, no. 207 (Dec. 22, 1903), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The slate of the United Christian Party of Iowa appeared on the November 1899 state ballot by virtue of a nominating petition campaign which garnered 961 signatures — enough to meet statutory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2515935/united_christian_party_of_iowa_state/ "Ticket is Filed: Secretary Dobson Accepts United Christian Party Filings,"] ''Iowa Daily Capital'' [Des Moines] vol. 16, no. 238 (Oct. 2, 1899), pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900 National Convention ===
[[File:Turney-Daniel-Braxton.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rev. Daniel Braxton Turney, 1908 and 1912 candidate of the United Christian Party for President of the United States.]]

The UCP held a national convention from May 1 to 2, 1900 in [[Rock Island, Illinois]]. About 25 delegates were in attendance.&lt;ref name=CDNA1901&gt;"National Nominating Conventions in 1900: United Christian Party," in George E. Plumbe, ''The Daily News Almanac and Political Register for 1901.'' Chicago: Chicago Daily News Co., 1901; pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

After unanimously approving a resolution to organize a national "Christian political union or party for the application of the Christ principle in state and nation."&lt;ref name=CDNA1901 /&gt; A second motion to name the organization United Christian Party so as "to conform to the development of the movement in Iowa" was approved by a vote of 20 to 5, with the names Christian Political Union and Christian Union Party drawing minority support.&lt;ref name=CDNA1901 /&gt;

The convention approved a platform of a socially conservative bent, declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We deprecate certain immoral laws which have grown out of the failure of our nation to recognize [the principle that no law should contravene the Divine law], notably such as require the desecration of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sabbath]], authorize unscriptural marriage and divorce, and license the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage."&lt;ref name=Smulls /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The party further called for a ban on the sale of "cigarettes or tobacco in any form" to minors and for daily reading of the Bible in [[state school|public schools]].&lt;ref name=Smulls /&gt;

Beyond this conservative agenda, the party declared in its 1900 platform in favor of certain items commonly associated with progressivism, including proportional representation and the system of initiative and referendum, an end to mob violence, and termination of war in favor of mediation of all international disputes.&lt;ref name=Smulls /&gt; The UCP also expressed support for public ownership of utilities as well as for direct election of the President and Vice President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Smulls /&gt;

Rev. [[Silas C. Swallow]] of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] was unanimously nominated by the conventionfor [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name=CDNA1901 /&gt; Swallow later declined the nomination, however, and party stalwart J.F.R. Leonard was ultimately tapped as the party's Presidential nominee in his stead.&lt;ref name=Smulls /&gt; [[John G. Woolley]] of Illinois was unanimously chosen as the new party's nominee for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], but he, too, later declined the nomination, to be replaced by Rev. [[C. M. Sheldon]], who also later declined.&lt;ref name=CDNA1901 /&gt; [[David H. Martin]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] finally assented, becoming the second name listed on the party's November ticket.&lt;ref name=Smulls&gt;"National Party Platforms: The United Christian," in Thomas B. Cochran with Herman P. Miller, ''Smull's Legislative Hand Book and Manual of the State of Pennsylvania, 1901.'' Harrisburg, PA: William Stanley Ray, State Printer of Pennsylviania, 1901; pg. 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leonard-Martin ticket collected a grand total of 1,059 votes out of approximately 14 million cast in the November 1900 general election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2515577/few_presidents_had_more_than_one/ "Few Presidents Had More Than One Christian Name,"] ''York Daily'' [York, PA].Nov. 15, 1912, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1904 National Convention ===
The United Christian Party began touting the notion that "[[golden rule|Christ's golden rule]] should be applied to all government by and for the people" in its convention call for its May 1904 National Convention,&lt;ref name=Bemidji /&gt; and made use of similar slogans in subsequent campaigns.

William Benkert remained as the organization's National Chairman and D.H. Martin of Pittsburgh as Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;"United Christian Party National Committee," ''The World Almanac and Encyclopedia, 1905.'' New York: Press Publishing Co., 1904; pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The UCP's 1904 platform included planks in favor of direct legislation; opposing war and mob violence; favoring government ownership of oil wells, coal mines, and public utilities; opposing government profiting from the liquor trade via taxation of alcoholic beverages; and opposing "all trusts and combines contrary to the welfare of the common people."&lt;ref&gt;"Platform of the United Christian Party, Adopted at St. Louis, Mo., May 2, 1904," ''The World Almanac and Encyclopedia, 1905.'' New York: Press Publishing Co., 1904; pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1908 National Convention ===
In 1908 the United Christian Party nominated Rev. [[Daniel Braxton Turney]] of Illinois for President and [[L. S. Coffin]] of Iowa for Vice President.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;"National Nominating Conventions in 1908," in James Langland (ed.), ''Daily News Almanac for 1909.'' Chicago: Chicago Daily News Co., 1908; pg. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; William R. Benkert remained in place as National Chairman of the organization.&lt;ref name=DNA /&gt;

The ticket polled about 12,000 in the November 1908 election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2449955/the_indianapolis_star/ "Vice Presidential Nominee of United Christian Party,"] ''Indianapolis Star,'' vol. 9, no. 342 (May 12, 1912), pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1909 National Convention ===
[[File:Benkert-Katherine-M.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Katherine M. Benkert, wife of UCP National Chairman William Benkert, was Secretary of the party in 1909.]]

National Chairman William Rudolph Benkert issued a call for a "national convention" to be held May 1, 1909 at the Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois.&lt;ref name=ACFP&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2501057/national_convention_of_united_christian/ "National Convention Called,"] ''Adams County Free Press'' [Corning, IA], vol. 26, no. 14 (April 10, 1909), pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This gathering was to be held "to confer with one another concerning the will and kingdom of God in earth, in behalf of humanity, as the assembly led by His Spirit, and governed by His command of love, may we see and act upon."&lt;ref name=ACFP /&gt;

The convention seems to have increased the organization's association with the personality of its founder, granting to William R. Benkert the right to personally appoint the members of the party's governing 7-member National Executive Committee.&lt;ref name=Honor&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2501130/report_on_outcome_of_1909_convention_of/ "New Honor for Mr. Turney: Decatur Man on National Executive Committee for Christian Party,"] ''Decatur Herald,'' vol. 28, no. 226 (May 5, 1909), pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The party reconfirmed its dedication to move forward, naming four national organizers to establish state organizations in preparation for the 1912 Presidential campaign, still three years away.&lt;ref name=Honor /&gt;

For a time it seemed that the plan for organizational advance was not to take place under the United Christian Party moniker, however, as shortly after the 1909 convention was closed it was announced that the UCP had been absorbed by a new organization called the American Party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2501174/name_change_for_united_christian_party/ "It Was 10 Cents Instead of $10: Daniel Braxton Turney Modestly Corrects Error in Good Samaritan Story,"] ''Decatur Herald'' vol. 28, no. 209 (July 17, 1909), pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This name change proved short-lived, however, and the old organizational name was resumed.

=== 1911 National Convention ===
The United Christian Party returned on May 1, 1911, to the perennial location for its conventions, the inn at Black hawk's Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois.&lt;ref name=CDN12&gt;"United Christian Party Convention," in George Edward Plumbe and James Langland (eds.), ''Chicago Daily News Almanac and Year-Book for 1912.'' Chicago: Chicago Daily News Co., 1911; pg. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention predictably reconfirmed party founder William Benkert as National Chairman.&lt;ref name=CDN12 /&gt; In a less predictable move, the convention anticipated modern American electoral politics by nominating young minister Daniel Braxton Turney to head the UCP ticket for a second time in the campaign for President at the November 1912 election — still more than 18 months away.&lt;ref name=CDN12 /&gt; [[Samuel C. Carter]] of [[Howard Lake, Minnesota]] was selected as Turney's 1912 Vice Presidential running mate.&lt;ref name=CDN12 /&gt;

In addition to its perennial calls for obedience to God and the golden rule, the platform adopted at the 1911 National Convention included calls for "a rightful ground and income tax" and an end to "unsettling of business by unjust tariff legislation."&lt;ref name=CDN12 /&gt; "We disapprove of a standing army and the expense of further preparation for war," the platform noted.&lt;ref name=CDN12 /&gt; The convention again yielded plenipotentiary authority to its longtime National Chairman, granting to Benkert the power to unilaterally select State Chairmen in each state.&lt;ref name=CDN12 /&gt;

=== 1912 National Convention ===
William Benkert's call for a May 1, 1912 National Convention of the UCP was issued in February of that year and indicated that the group sought to "end war and [[capital punishment]], and to settle tariff, liquor, trust, and high cost of living questions by direct vote of the people and by the Golden Rule."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2509050/william_r_benkert_issues_call_for_1912/ "Odd Bits of Daily News,"] ''Brooklyn Eagle,'' vol. 72A, no. 53, 4 O'clock Edition (Feb. 23, 1912), pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidential ticket of Daniel B. Turney and Samuel G Carter named by the 1911 convention was unanimously reaffirmed by the gathering.&lt;ref name=DanielB&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2509123/united_christian_party_changes_name_to/ "Daniel B. is the Unanimous Choice: Decatur Man Chosen to Lead Christian Patriots,"] ''Daily Review'' [Decatur, IL], vol. 34, no. 122 (May 1, 1912), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Christian Party name was to be once again terminated, however, with a new name of "Christian Patriots" selected for the UCP.&lt;ref name=DanielB /&gt; This change appears once again to have been rapidly abandoned in favor of the established party name.&lt;ref name=Ticket&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2390896/the_decatur_herald/ "Turney Not on Ticket in His Home State; United Christian Party Candidate Gets Dates Mixed,"] ''Decatur Herald,'' vol. 32, no. 6 (Oct. 10, 1912), pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post-convention statement to the press, Presidential nominee Daniel Braxton Turney indicated that some 250 delegates, representing 7 states, had been in attendance at the 1912 Rock Island gathering.&lt;ref name=Strenuous&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2509378/strenuous_time_at_party_convention/ "Strenuous Time at Party Convention: Candidate Turney Worn Out by Strain,"] ''Daily Review'' [Decatur, IL], vol. 34, no. 128 (May 7, 1912), pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  He declared, with evident hyperbole, that the party was "at least 5,000 percent stronger" than it had been during the 1908 campaign.&lt;ref name=Strenuous /&gt;

The UCP ticket appeared on the ballot in about 20 states in 1912.&lt;ref name=Ticket /&gt;

=== Final years ===
The United Christian Party remained in existence at least through 1916, holding its annual May Day gatherings in Davenport, Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2515642/united_christian_party_to_meet_db/ "United Christian Party to Meet: D.B. Turney Not Yet Certain of Presidency,"] ''Decatur Review,'' vol. 38, no. 99 (April 6, 1915), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By decision of the small gatherings, the last of which was held in the home of National Chairman William R. Benkert, no ticket was put in the field for the 1916 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2515740/united_christians_not_in_field_party/ "United Christians Not in Field: Party Decides Not to Have Presidential Candidate This Year,"] ''Daily Review'' [Decatur, IL], vol. 38, no. 125 (May 4, 1916), pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The hiatus proved to be an extended one, with no ticket being put forward in the campaigns of 1920 or 1924.

In 1927 the tenacious National Chairman William R. Benkert announced plans for a conference to name a candidate for the 1928 campaign, with Judge W.S. Kenyon of Iowa Benkert's personal choice for the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2515845/kenyon_is_united_christian_choice/ "Kenyon is United Christian Choice, Reports Benkert,"] ''Davenport Democrat and Leader,'' vol. 72, no. 162 (April 17, 1927), pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of manuscript prophecies concerning the [[Papacy]], under the title of '''''Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus''''', a Latin text which assembles portraits of popes and prophecies related to them,&lt;ref&gt;The texts and illustrations are so closely related they must have been conceived together.&lt;/ref&gt; circulated from the late thirteenth-early fourteenth century, with prophecies concerning popes from [[Pope Nicholas III]] onwards.
[[File:VaticiniaTP.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Vaticinia, sive Prophetiae / Vaticinii, overo Profetie'' (Prophecies or Foretellings). Venice: Hieronymum Porrum and Giovanni Battista Bertoni, 1589.]]

== Introduction ==
The series of some thirty prophecies, based on Greek prototypes, was "most probably conceived in order to influence one of the ongoing papal elections,"&lt;ref&gt;Schleich ref.&lt;/ref&gt; written in opposition to the [[Orsini]] and their candidates.

The mystical series of prophecies, known from their ''[[incipit]]'' as the ''''' =Genus nequam''''' prophecies (''"the origin of evil"''), are derived from the Byzantine [[Leo Oracles]], a series of twelfth-century Byzantine prophecies that foretell a savior-emperor destined to restore unity to the empire. Their poems and tempera illuminations mix fantasy, the [[occult]], and chronicle in a chronology of the popes. Each prophecy consists of four elements, an enigmatic [[Allegory|allegorical]] text, an [[emblem]]atic picture, a motto, and an attribution to a pope.

The series was augmented in the fourteenth century with further prophecies, with the ''[[incipit]]'' '''''Ascende calve''''' (''"arise, bald one"''), written in imitative continuation of the earlier set, but with more overtly [[propaganda|propagandist]] aims. By the time of the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–18), both series were united  as the '''''Vaticinia de summis pontificibus''''' and misattributed to the [[Calabria]]n mystic [[Joachim of Flora]], thus credited to a ''pseudo-Joachim.'' There are some fifty manuscripts of this fuller collection.

The prophecies received numerous printed editions.

He conferred with every U.S. president during his term as chief.

Griffin also served as an interpreter and also was an important figure among the practitioners of the Big Moon variant of the [[Native American Church]], and played a significant role in the spreading and continuing this religion among multiple tribes.&lt;ref name=religion/&gt;&lt;ref name=baird&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quapaw Indians: A History of the Downstream People|last=Baird|first=Dr. David|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press, Norman.|year=1979|isbn= 978-0-8061-1542-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 13: Plains, Pt. 1 and Pt. 2|last=Sturtevant|first=William|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|year=2001|isbn=0160504007|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=plains&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wishart, ed.|first1=David J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|date=2004|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=978-0-8032-4787-1|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&amp;lpg=PA596&amp;ots=IjBZzhBJTv&amp;dq=Encyclopedia%20of%20the%20Great%20Plains%20Victor%20Griffin&amp;pg=PA596#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 2014 523"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Native America in the Twentieth Century: An Encyclopedia|last=Davis|first=Mary|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin was also a 32 degree Scottish Right [[Freemasonry|Mason]] and a member of the [[Shriners|Akdar Shrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chief Victor Griffin of Quapaw Tribes Dies|work=Joplin Globe|date=11 April 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Victor Griffin was born around 1873 in [[Indian Territory]] in what is now [[Osage County, Oklahoma]]. Griffin was orphaned at a young age, and was adopted and raised by Mary "Widow" Stafford.

Details about the early life of Griffin are scant and conflicting. Mary Stafford was born prior to the first Quapaw [[Indian removal|removal]], and died at over 100 years of age and was buried on her home allotment. Due to his upbringing with Stafford, Griffin was fluent in the [[Quapaw language]] and well versed in tribal [[oral history]]. Griffin was given the Quapaw name '''Geh-Hu-He Jinka'''.

==Translation and linguistic work==
Being well educated and well spoken in both English and Quapaw, Griffin frequently served as a translator during meetings or when an elderly Quapaw tribal member needed his services, for example when drafting a will.

He was interviewed by many individuals such as news reporters and researchers. In 1940, linguist Frank T. Siebert interviewed Griffin regarding the Quapaw language; Griffin provided several Quapaw words to Siebert and stated to him "that Quapaw was closely related to Ponca and Omaha, especially to the latter... (you) should study these languages instead".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siebert|first=Frank|date=1989|title="A note on Quapaw" International Journal of American Linguistics 55 (4)|jstor=1265244|journal=University of Chicago Press|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
After the death of John Quapaw, elected chief of the Quapaw Tribe, Griffin was elected chief and served from 1920 to 1957.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;

During his tenure as chief, he frequently went to Washington D.C. for meetings in the interest of the Quapaw Tribe. It is noted that he met with every President of the United States that served during his time as chief. Griffin was also noted for being the first "Short-Haired Chief of the Quapaws,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3676261/quapaw_news/|title=Miami Daily News-Record|last=Nieberding|first=Velma|date=30 April 1961|work=|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he cut off his braids.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okeson|first1=Sarah|title=Quapaw Tribe working to pass on native language|url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/news/quapaw-tribe-working-to-pass-on-native-language/article_a8c99b16-30ec-11e5-9e57-77264e185c36.html|website=The Joplin Globe|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted as saying "formerly our chiefs were chosen by inheritance but now we are elected".&lt;ref name=averie/&gt;

While serving as chief, Griffin was known for colorful displays and often was pictured in tribal regalia, which often included a full Plains eagle-feather headdress.&lt;ref name=averie&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social and Economic History of the Quapaw Tribe of Indians Since 1833|last=Averie|first=Essie|publisher=Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin also featured prominently in the commemorative festivities when paving was completed for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] in [[Quapaw, Oklahoma]] on March 24, 1933. The two halves of Route 66 met in the town of Quapaw, leading to the town being referred to in some instances as "where east meets west." Griffin laid a zinc tablet on Main Street to memorialize the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Route 66 Encyclopedia|last=Hinckley|first=Jim|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mickey|title=Quapaw|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=QU004|website=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the Quapaw Tribe, influenced by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]],&lt;ref name=blue/&gt; ended their system of governance by chief. They passed a series of governing resolutions that created new form of government by an elected tribal business committee headed by a chairperson.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; When this took place, Griffin no longer held his position as chief and the political authority of the Quapaw Tribe was vested in the new committee.&lt;ref name=baird/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quapawtribe.com/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/229|title=Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma Governing Resolution|last=|first=|date=|website=www.quapawtribe.com|publisher=Official Quapaw Tribal Website|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 13: Plains, Pt. 1 and Pt. 2|last=Sturtevant|first=William|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|year=2001|isbn=0160504007|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Disintegration and Revitalization" Quapaws, Indians of North America|last=Baird|first=David|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native American Church involvement==
[[John Wilson (Caddo)|John Wilson]] ([[Caddo]]-[[Delaware Nation|Delaware]]), also known as Moonhead, introduced the Peyote religion to the Quapaw people living near present-day Quapaw, Oklahoma, in 1880&lt;ref name=religion/&gt; or the mid-1890s at the request of [[Tall Chief]].&lt;ref name=religion/&gt;&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Josephine Walker Interview, 1968|last=|first=|publisher=Oklahoma Federation of Labor Collection, M453, Box 5, Folder 2.

When he visited Quapaw, Moonhead introduced Griffin to peyotism. Griffin was in his teenage years or early twenties.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moonhead instructed Griffin in this religion and authorized him to conduct Native American Church ceremonies.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugtext.org/The-Peyote-Cult/plates.html|title=Plates by Weston La Barre|last=|first=|date=2011|website=International Substance Use Library|publisher=|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following John Wilson's death, Griffin became the Native American Church priest to the Quapaw.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;

Griffin became an ardent believer in the Peyote religion and helped to spread its practice, especially among members of the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and Quapaw tribes, but also among other tribal groups such as the [[Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="baird" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quapawtribalancestry.com/marymaudeangel.htm|title=Quapaw Tribe Mary Maude Angel Grandma Supernaw a Historical Legend|website=www.quapawtribalancestry.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peyote Religious Arts: Symbols of Faith and Belief|last=Swan|first=Daniel|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also was instrumental in the incorporation of the Native American Church under Oklahoma law in 1911, the incorporation of the religion specified the use of peyote as a sacrament.&lt;ref name=baird/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=plains/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 2014 523"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Osage Peyotism|last=Swan|first=Daniel|publisher=Plains Anthropologist|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

[[File:Whitechapel Road, looking east - geograph.org.uk - 561906.jpg|thumb|300px|Looking east on Whitechapel Road, near [[Whitechapel station|Whitechapel tube station]]. The [[Whitechapel Road market|street market]] is on the left.]]
'''Whitechapel Road''' is a major [[arterial road]] in [[Whitechapel]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], in the [[East End of London]]. It is named after a small [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St Mary]] and connects [[Aldgate]] to the west (as Whitechapel High Street) with [[Mile End Road]] to the east. The road is part of the historic [[Roman road]] from London to [[Colchester]], now the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11]].

The road had become built up by the 19th century and is now a main shopping district in the Whitechapel area. Along the road, there is an established [[Whitechapel Road market|market]], [[Whitechapel station]] and the [[Royal London Hospital]]. It remains an important road and is marked with [[bus lane]]s, with limited parking.

Several [[ethnic minority]] communities have centred on Whitechapel Road. The road was a focal point of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards the latter part of the 20th century, the street became an established settlement of the [[British Bangladeshi]] community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and clothes in the market and on shop fronts. [[Altab Ali Park]] sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978.

==Geography==
The road's name, along with the area, is derived from the original 14th century [[Whitechapel|White Chapel]].{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|p=1018}} It follows the section of the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] between [[Londinium]] ([[London]]) and [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]), which connected to the [[Pye Road]] to [[Venta Icenorum]] ([[Caistor St Edmund]] near [[Norwich]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learninglegacy.independent.gov.uk/documents/pdfs/archaeology/ll35roman-road-aw.pdf|title=Learning Legacy: Lessons Learned from the London 2012 Games construction project|last=Chaffey|first=Gareth|publisher=Olympic Delivery Authority|date=2011|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section of the Roman road that is now Whitechapel Road is a [[Hierarchy of roads#primary route|Primary A-road]], the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11]], and has [[bus lane]]s running along its length.&lt;ref name=tfl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/cycling/89151b51|title=Section 2 – White Church Lane to Cambridge Heath Road|work=Barclays Superhighway 2|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the popularity of the market, parking is heavily restricted, limited to occasional [[parking meter]]ed spaces along the road.{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=121}}

[[List of cycle routes in London#Cycle Superhighways|Cycle Superhighway CS2]] runs along Whitechapel Road.&lt;ref name=tfl/&gt; The nearest [[London Underground]] stations are [[Whitechapel station]] and [[Aldgate East station]] and the nearest [[National Rail]] station is [[Bethnal Green railway station]]. A number of local [[London Buses]] routes run along Whitechapel Road, including 25, 205 and 254.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/bus-route-maps/north-east-london-bus-map.pdf|title=North to East London Bus Map|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Whitechapel High Street 1905.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Whitechapel High Street in 1905]]
The road has been an important thoroughfare and coaching route for centuries. Whitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are named as such on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]], both marked as "White Chapel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Rocque%27s_Map_of_London,_1746.png|via=Wikimedia|title=John Roque's Map of London|year=1746}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[John Cary]]'s "Environs of London" of 1795 (published in his ''New Itinerary'' of 1798) there are properties on both sides of the road.&lt;ref name=cary&gt;{{cite map|url=http://mapco.net/cary1795/cary15.htm|title=Cary's New And Accurate Plan of London And Westminster|year=1795|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the ninth edition in 1821, the road is shown as extensively built up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|url=http://www.warwickleadlay.com/sites/default/files/styles/colorbox-fs/public/map_images/Cary-New-Itinerary-1821.jpg?itok=Oniix1iF|title=Environs of London|publisher=Cary's New Itinerary|year=1821|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, [[droving|drovers]] steered livestock from local farms along the road towards [[Smithfield Market]], causing considerable [[traffic congestion]].{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=121}}{{sfn|Davis|Emeljanow|2005|p=67}} By the 1870s, the road had become extensively developed with properties along the entire stretch of the road.{{sfn|Bard|2014|p=30}}

The [[Freedom Press]] Bookshop is on Angel Alley, No.&amp;nbsp;84b Whitechapel High Street, and was established in the 1880s by Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson as the first publishing house to deal with [[anarchism]] and radical publications. The press has been controversial, and was fire-bombed in 2013, but quickly reopened.{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=121}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/04/freedom-press-oldest-radical-bookshop-arson-attack|title=Britain's oldest radical bookshop is burned, but the ideas survive|first=Tim|last=Gee|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] on Whitechapel High Street opened in 1899. It was designed by Charles Harrison Townsend in 1895 and was the first major art gallery in East London. It has shown works of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[David Hockney]]. It continues to be the centre of the arts scene in the area.{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=18}}

[[File:St marys station 1938.jpg|thumb|left|[[St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station]] on Whitechapel Road, shortly after closure in 1938. The building was destroyed in 1940.]]
The [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], a principal supplier of [[church bell]]s in Britain, was, until its closure in 2017, based at 32–34 Whitechapel Road.{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=121}} The buildings date from 1670 and are [[listed building|Grade II listed]]. Originally a [[coaching inn]] known as the Artichoke, it was occupied by the foundry from 1738, replacing smaller premises on the north side of the road.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|p=1018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelbellfoundry.co.uk/foundry.htm|title=500 Years of History|publisher=Whitechapel Bell Foundry|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Davenant Foundation School]] moved to No.&amp;nbsp;173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to [[Loughton]], [[Essex]]. The building remains on the north side and is [[listed building|Grade II listed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol1/pp293-294|title=A History of the County of Middlesex|volume=1|publisher=Victoria County History|location=London|year=1969|pp=293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://planreg.towerhamlets.gov.uk/WAM/doc/513588-Page-37.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;page=37&amp;id=513588&amp;contentType=application/pdf&amp;location=VOLUME4|title=Townscape and Heritage|publisher=Tower Hamlets London Borough Council|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing eastwards, Whitechapel station is on the north side of the road, alongside the [[Whitechapel Road market|street market]]. Behind the tube station is the former site of [[Blackwall Buildings]] a set of philanthropic houses built in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Administrative County of London development plan: first review 1960|publisher=London County Council|year=1962|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just to the east of the market are [[almshouse]]s at Trinity House, that were originally built in 1695 for retired seamen.{{sfn|Harriss|2006|p=121}}

Nearby is the former site of [[St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station]]. It opened in March 1884 but its close proximity to both Whitechapel and [[Aldgate East station|Aldgate East]] tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938.{{sfn|Bard|2014|p=133}} It was used as an air raid shelter in the [[Second World War]], but was destroyed by bombing in 1940.{{sfn|Long|2010|p=108}} Opposite to the south is the former [[Royal London Hospital]] building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the [[Second World War]], but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|pp=725–726}}

[[File:Whitechapel Street Market.jpg|thumb|[[Whitechapel Road market]]]]
The [[Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel|Pavilion Theatre]] opened on Nos.191–193&amp;nbsp;Whitechapel Road, the site of a former clothes factory, in 1828. It was the first major theatre to open in the East End of London.{{sfn|Davis|Emeljanow|2005|p=55}} The original building was destroyed in a fire in 1856, and was replaced by a larger theatre that could accommodate over 1,000 people, becoming the centre of [[Yiddish theatre]] in Britain.{{sfn|Davis|Emeljanow|2005|p=58}} It closed in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/7th-Stencl-Lecture-Memories-of-London-Yiddish-Theatre.pdf|title=Memories of London Yiddish Theatre|publisher=Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies|date=14 August 1989|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, the Metropolitan Police attempted to crack down on illegal gambling held in social clubs along Whitechapel Road. The Brancroft Social Club was based at No.&amp;nbsp;69,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/33793/page/580/data.pdf|title=Advertisement of Cancelling|publisher=The London Gazette|date=26 January 1932|p=580|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 1944, a police raid uncovered unlicensed horse and dog race betting which led to the arrest of the club's owner and 21 patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1944/apr/04/club-raids-london#S5CV0398P0_19440404_HOC_240|title=Club Raids, London|work=Hansard|date=4 April 1944|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albion Brewery]] was first established at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road in 1808 by Richard Ivory, landlord of [[the Blind Beggar]]. In 1860, the brewery was rebuilt, producing an average of 133,000 barrels of beer a year. It closed in 1979.{{sfn|Richmond|Turton|1990|pp=224–225}}

The [[E postcode area|Eastern District Post Office]] is based at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road, on the south side. This was the eastern terminus for the former [[London Post Office Railway]] (colloquially known as the "Mail Rail"), built to allow fast mail transfers across London. It closed in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1913/jun/11/post-office-london-railway-bill|title=Post Office (London) Railway Bill|date=11 June 1913|work=Hansard|first=Herbert|last=Samuel|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25145632|title=Mail Rail: What is it like on the 'secret' tube|first=Andy|last=Dangerfield|work=BBC News|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond this is Mile End Gate – where the road becomes [[Mile End Road]]; and was the site of the former [[toll gate]].&lt;ref name=cary/&gt;

==Community==
[[File:Aerial view of East London Mosque complex - Feb 2014.jpg|thumb|left|The [[East London Mosque]] has been established on Whitechapel Road since 1985.]]
The road has the been the centre of several [[ethnic minority]] groups in London. In the 1840s, many Irish emigrated to avoid the [[Irish potato famine|potato famine]] and began street selling at Whitechapel Market and along Whitechapel Road.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|p=1017}}

The [[History of the Jews in England|Jewish community]] settled on and around Whitechapel Road from the 1850s onwards.{{sfn|Snyder|2013|p=105}} In the 1880s, the community expanded rapidly as [[Ashkenazi Jews]] fled to Britain and took over many of the shops and market stalls on the street.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=296}} For the remainder of the century and much of the 20th, the road was the focal point of the community. The nearby [[Jewish Free School]] was, at one point, the largest educational establishment in the world, with over 4,300 pupils.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=296}} A fountain opposite the Royal London Hospital in memory of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] has the inscription "erected from subscriptions raised by Jewish inhabitants of East London".{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|p=1018}} On 4 October 1936, [[British Union of Fascists]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]] organised an anti-Jewish parade through the East End that included passing through Whitechapel Road, but was stopped by a crowd of protesters.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=297}} The sentiment against Jews in Whitechapel Road caused the community to dissolve from the 1930s onwards; the Pavilion Theatre closed and the Jewish Free School was destroyed in [[the Blitz]] during the Second World War.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=298}} The Yiddish newspaper ''The Jewish Times'' (''Die Zeit'') was produced at No.&amp;nbsp;135 Whitechapel Road from 1913 to 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2lgpAQAAIAAJ|title=Willing's Press Guide|publisher=T Skinner Directories|p=68|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 20th century, the street, along with nearby [[Brick Lane]] became the centre of the [[British Bangladeshi|British Bangladeshi community]]. The [[East London Mosque]] on Whitechapel Road was opened by Shaykh Abdullah bin Subayl in 1985 and can accommodate over 3,000 worshippers, with dedicated facilities for women. The nearby [[London Muslim Centre]] opened in 2003.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|p=1018}} Whitechapel Market caters well for the community, with stalls stocking Asian fruit and vegetables including [[okra]] and [[mango]]es, clothing such as tunics and [[pashmina]]s, and [[mobile phone]] cards for cheap long-distance calls.{{sfn|Harriss|2006|pp=121–122}} A racially motivated attack on local worker Altab Ali near Whitechapel Road in May 1978 was a significant event for the local Asian community, and his life is now commemorated in [[Altab Ali Park]] at the western end of the road, which was built on the former St Mary's Church grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/altab_ali_s_racist_murder_in_whitechapel_remembered_37_years_on_1_4061835|title=Altab Ali's racist murder in Whitechapel remembered 37 years on|work=East London Advertiser|first=Mike|last=Brooke|date=6 May 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=303}}

==Events==
[[File:The blind beggar 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Blind Beggar]] public house, 337 Whitechapel Road]]
The area around Whitechapel Road is notorious for the 19th century [[Whitechapel murders]], which are believed to be linked to [[Jack the Ripper]]. One of the first victims was [[Martha Tabram]], who was found with multiple stab wounds on George Yard Buildings, Whitechapel Road on 7 August 1888.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|2010|p=1017}}

[[Joseph Merrick]], the Elephant Man, moved to Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid to see him in the back room of a shop owned by showman [[Tom Norman]]. The shop was directly opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors.{{sfn|Howell|Ford|1992|pp=72,75}} Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=294}}

The Blind Beggar is at No.&amp;nbsp;337 and was the founding point of the [[Salvation Army]] following a meeting outside the pub by [[William Booth]] in 1865. On 9 March 1966, the venue became notorious after [[Ronnie Kray]] fatally shot [[George Cornell]] at the pub. The premises remains open for business, though it has been refurbished several times.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|p=26}} The Kray Twins also used the Blackwall Buildings, by then [[urban decay|dilapidated]], as a form of punishment by locking a victim in a flat alone with Ronnie's [[German Shepherd]] dog.{{sfn|Pearson|2011|p=2280}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9235">The '''Women's Torah Project''' ('''WTP''') was an initiative to have the first [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]] [[Sofer|scribed]] entirely by women. The project began in 2003 and was completed in [[Seattle]] in 2010. Wendy Graff was the leader of WTP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013165249_torah15m.html|title=Rare New Torah Made by Women Debuts Saturday in Seattle|last=Bartley|first=Nancy|date=14 October 2010|work=The Seattle Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618080917/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013165249_torah15m.html|archive-date=18 June 2012|access-date=2 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTP was commissioned by the Seattle-based Kadima [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] community.

== History ==
The Kadima Reconstructionist community of Seattle decided to purchase a Torah scroll written by women for their congregation in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/133017/women-who-write-torah/|title=Women Who Write Torah|last=Strauss|first=Elissa|date=10 November 2010|work=Forward|access-date=2 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, they had been borrowing scrolls.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/64329/unfurling-a-piece-of-history-womens-torah-to-embark-on-eight-day-local-tour/|title=Unfurling a Piece of History: Women's Torah to Embark on Eight-Day Local Tour|last=Silvers|first=Emma|date=16 February 2012|work=J Weekly|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They started looking for women [[Sofer|scribes]], but had trouble finding any at first.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/59670/cjms-resident-scribe-takes-part-in-group-torah-project-in-seattle/|title=CJM's Resident Scribe Takes Part in Group Torah Project in Seattle|last=Fishkoff|first=Sue|date=21 October 2010|work=J Weekly|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason there were no women scribes was because of the prohibition in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] against women writing a Torah scroll for ritual use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kadima eventually found a "''[[Halakha|halachically]]'' acceptable" way to create the Torah and began to look at multiple scribes for the project.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The scroll was commissioned in 2003.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/121108/njScribeWritesAScroll.html|title=Scribe Writes a Scroll, and Revises a Tradition|last=Ginsberg|first=Johanna|date=11 December 2008|work=New Jersey Jewish News|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadima supported the training of two women scribes and the other four trained on their own.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The scribes included Rachel Reichhardt, who was also the only officially certified scribe, Linda Coppleson, Irma Penn, Rabbi Hanna Klebansky, Julie Seltzer, and [[Aviel Barclay]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=jta&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jta.org/2005/02/27/life-religion/features/female-scribe-writes-torah-scroll|title=Female Scribe Writes Torah Scroll|first=Dan|last=Pine|date=27 February 2005|accessdate=15 December 2015|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead scribe (or ''[[Sofer|soferet]]'') on the project was Shoshana Gugenheim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gugenheim said that "it was important to me that there would be other women scribes".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Torah-she-wrote|title=Torah She Wrote|last=Spiro|first=Amy|date=7 October 2012|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the scribes was checked by [[Jen Taylor Friedman]], who created a [[Book of Esther|Scroll of Esther]] and was the first woman to scribe any part of the Torah in modern times.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishcurrents.org/october-15-the-womens-torah-12502|title=October 15: The Women's Torah|last=|first=|date=14 October 2012|work=Jewish Currents|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the pages were finished, the parchment panels were further checked and minor ''tikkunim'' (corrections) made by experts in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The individual sections were sewn together by a group of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/2010/10/15/life-religion/womens-torah-dedicated-in-seattle|title=Women's Torah Dedicated in Seattle|last=Fishkoff|first=Sue|date=15 October 2010|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish law and the Women's Torah ==
According to the [[Talmud]] (''[[Nashim|Gittin]]'' 45b), a Torah scroll written by a woman for ritual use is invalid.&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/articles/3614/a-female-scribe-e2-80-99s-trailblazing-effort/|title=A Female Scribe's Trailblazing Effort|first=Alice|last=Lowenstein|date=3 June 2005|accessdate=15 December 2015|work=[[The Forward]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arba'ah Turim]], however, does not prohibit women from becoming scribes.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/oct/16/2010/women%E2%80%99s-torah-project|title=First Torah Commissioned to be Scribed Entirely By Women is Read in Seattle|last=|first=|date=16 October 2010|work=Jewish Women's Archive|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern-day rabbis have presented arguments supporting the view that a woman can write a scroll for ritual use.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; A Conservative Israeli Rabbi, Simcha Roth, wrote that since women may learn the Torah, "they should certainly be eligible to write a scroll".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Linda Coppleson, who is a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jew]], expresses that while the Talmud forbids women from writing Torah scrolls, it also states that "whoever is qualified should write a Torah;" and when women have "the same opportunities as men, it is fitting to remove them from forbidden categories".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Wendy Graff, the project's leader, said that "if my daughter could read and study the Torah and yet not be allowed to create the scroll that is the basis of our faith, then we still have a long way to go".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Members of the Women's Torah Project recognize that some Jewish communities do not see the Women's Torah as valid. Taylor Friedman says that it is important to keep women's Torah scrolls out of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Torah scrolls written by women are not considered [[Kashrut|kosher]] by all Jewish communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/10/15/2741314/an-all-women-torah-is-completed-in-seattle|title=Female Scribes Finish Writing Torah Scroll|last=Fishkoff|first=Sue|date=15 October 2010|work=JTA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022110146/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/10/15/2741314/an-all-women-torah-is-completed-in-seattle|archive-date=22 October 2010|access-date=3 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zār''''' ({{lang-ar|زار}}, {{lang-gez|ዛር}}) is the term for a [[demon]] or spirit assumed to [[spirit possession|possess]]  individuals, mostly women, and to cause discomfort or illness.
The so-called ''' ''zār'' ritual''' or ''' ''zār'' cult''' is the practice of [[exorcism|exorcising]] such spirits from the possessed individual.&lt;ref name="EDD"&gt;R. Guiley, ''The Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology'' (2009), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NHosWhaeWDQC&amp;pg=PA277 p. 277].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zār'' exorcism has become popular in the contemporary urban culture of [[Cairo]] and other major cities of the Islamic world as a form of women-only entertainment. ''Zār'' gatherings involve food and musical performances, and they culminate in ecstatic dancing, lasting between three and seven nights.&lt;ref name="EDD"/&gt; 
The ''[[Tanbūra (lyre)|tanbura]]'', a six-string [[lyre]] (6-stringed "bowl-lyre"&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;), is often used in the ritual.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Tanbūra|last=Poché|first=Christian|vol=xxv|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instruments include the ''[[mangour]]'', a leather belt sewn with many [[Domestic goat|goat]] [[hoof|hooves]], and various [[percussion instrument]]s.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

==History==
Scholarship in the early 20th century attributed Abyssinian (Ethiopian) origin to the custom, although there
were also proposals suggesting Persian or other origins.
Thus, [[Leo Frobenius|Frobenius]] suggested that '' zār'' and ''bori'', a comparable cult in [[Hausa people|Hausa]] culture, were ultimately derived from a Persian source. Modarressi (1986) suggests a Persian etymology for the term.&lt;ref&gt;Taghi Modarressi, "The Zar Cult in South Iran," in R. Prince, ed., Trance and Possession States, Montreal, 1986, pp. 149-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the word is unclear; Walker (1935) suggested the name of the city of [[Zara, Iran (disambiguation)|Zara]] in northern Iran, or alternatively the Arabic root ''[[:wikt:زار#Verb|z-w-r]]'' "to visit" (for the possessing spirit "visiting" the victim). The ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'' of 1934 favoured an Ethiopian origin of the word.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;cited after Fakhouri (1968), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread beyond the Horn of Africa likely dates to the 18th or early 19th century, presumably introduced by Ethiopian slaves brought to the [[harem]]s of the Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Messing (1958) states that the cult was particularly well-developed in Northern Ethiopia ([[Amhara Region|Amhara]]), with its center in the town of [[Gondar]].
One late 19th-century traveler describes the Abyssinian "Sár" cultists sacrificing a hen or goat and mixing the blood with grease and butter, in the hopes of eliminating someone's sickness.  The concoction was then hidden in an alley, in the belief that all who pass through the alley would take away the patient's ailment.&lt;ref&gt;William Cornwallis Harris, ''The Highlands of Aethiopia,'' volume 2, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirzai Asl (2002) suggests that the introduction to  Iran likewise took place in the 19th century ([[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]]) by Africans brought to Iran via the [[Arab slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Behnaz A. Mirzai Asl, "African Presence in Iran: Identity and its Reconstruction in the 19th and 20th Centuries," Revue française d'histoire d'Outre Mer 89, 2002, pp. 229-46.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Natvig (1988) reports that the ''zār'' cult "served as a refuge for women and effeminate men" in the [[Sudan (region)|Sahel (Sudan) region]] under [[Islamization of the Sudan region|Islamic rule]].&lt;ref name=numen&gt;{{Citation|last=Natvig|first=Richard|title=Liminal Rites and Female Symbolism in the Egyptian Zar Possession Cult|journal=Numen|volume=35|issue=1|date=July 1988|pages=57–68|doi=10.2307/3270140|jstor=3270140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties ==
Among extant varieties of Zār cults are "''zār Sawāknī'' (the ''zār'' from the area of [[Suakin]] ["''Dalūka'', that is, ''zār Sawāknī''"&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;]) and ''zār Nyamānyam'' {cf. /NYAMe/ ('Friend'), god of the Akan} (the ''zār'' of the [[Azande]])":&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; "the Nyam-Nyam have ''zār nugāra'', with Babīnga and Nakūrma". "Babīnga and Nakūrma are recognized as Azande ancestral spirits". Nugāra (big drum) = "''nuqara'' ... of the Dega tribe ... was originally from Wau".&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; (Wau is in Equatoria province of Sudan.) "Besides the nugāra of the Azande, other zār cults mentioned were those of the Fartīt [Fartīt peoples include "the Karra, Gula, Feroge, and Surro"&lt;ref&gt;Makris p. 222, n. 5:15&lt;/ref&gt;], the [[Shilluk people]], and the [[Dinka people]] and the ''dinia'' [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]] cult".&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirits==
In Ethiopia, ''zār'' is used as a term for malevolent spirits or demons.   At the same time, many Ethiopians believe in benevolent, protective spirits, or ''abdar''.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, John W. Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity: Faith and Practices. ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]''. Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds. Washington: Library of Congress Federal Research Division, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in such spirits is widespread among both Christians and Muslims.&lt;ref name="beckwith"&gt;Beckwith, Carol, Angela Fisher, and Graham Hancock. ''African Ark''. New York: Henry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|199}} 
As is usual in African animism, and in pre-modern folk belief in general, what would be termed mental illness in modern psychiatry is attributed to spirit possession.&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;Kemp, Charles.  "[http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Charles_Kemp/www/ethiopian_refugees.htm Ethiopians &amp; Eritreans.]"  ''Refugee Health – Immigrant Health''.  Waco, TX: Baylor University.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Ĥēṭ'' ("thread"&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;){{huh|date=May 2016}}&lt;!--Ĥ is a letter used to transcribe Esperanto and Chinook--&gt; is a term of for the possessing spirits. ''Tumbura''  is another term.{{huh|date=May 2016}} Named individual ''tumbura'' include: ''Nuba, Banda, Gumuz, Sawākiniyya, Lambūnāt, Bābūrāt, Bāshawāt, Khawājāt''.&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on which spirit an individual is possessed by, they will don different costumes, such a traditional loincloth for ''Nuba'', a straw loincloth for ''Bada'', 
a red fez for ''Bāśawāt'', and a pith-helmet and khaki shorts for ''Ĥawājāt''.&lt;ref&gt;Makris 2000, p. 198&amp;ndash;203&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, there are eighty-eight "Sároch", emissaries of evil all under the service of a spirit named "Warobal Mama",&lt;ref&gt;William Cornwallis Harris, ''The Highlands of Aethiopia,'' volume 2, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; who dwells in lake Alobar in the [[Menz]] region.&lt;ref&gt;William Cornwallis Harris, ''The Highlands of Aethiopia,'' volume 2, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Zār beliefs are common today even among Ethiopian immigrants to North America, Europe, or Israel. For example, [[Beta Israel]] are often raised with both [[Judaism|Jewish]] and Zār beliefs, and individuals who believe they house a spirit are bound to attend to it despite other demands. However, ceremonies can be performed by [[shamans]] to persuade a spirit to leave, thus releasing the person from their duties to that spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edelstein|first1=Monika|title=Lost Tribes and Coffee Ceremonies: Zar Spirit Possession and the Ethno-Religious Identity of Ethiopian Jews in Israel|journal=Journal of Refugee Studies|date=2002|volume=15|issue=2|url=http://webhome.weizmann.ac.il/home/liorg/zar.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2015|doi=10.1093/jrs/15.2.153|pages=153–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern Iran, ''zār'' is interpreted as a "harmful wind" assumed to cause discomfort or illness. Types of such winds include ''Maturi, Šayḵ Šangar, Dingemāru, Omagāre, Bumaryom, Pepe, Bābur, Bibi,  Namrud''.&lt;ref name="EncIr"&gt;
