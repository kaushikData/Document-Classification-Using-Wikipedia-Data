      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">'''Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)''' is a [[Nonparametric statistics|non-parametric statistical test]] widely used in the field of [[ecology]]. The test was first suggested by K. R. Clarke&lt;ref name="Clarke1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=K. R.|title=Non-parametric multivariate analyses of changes in community structure|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=18|issue=1|year=1993|pages=117–143|issn=1442-9985|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1993.tb00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[analysis of variance|ANOVA]]-like test, where instead of operating on [[raw data]], operates on a ranked dissimilarity [http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MatrixOperations.html matrix].

Given a matrix of rank [[dissimilarities]] between a set of samples, each solely belong to one [[treatment group]], the ANOSIM tests whether we can reject the [[null hypothesis]] that the similarity between groups is greater than or equal to the [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] within the groups.

The test statistic ''R'' is calculated in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt; R = \frac{r_B - r_W}{M/2} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{overline|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of rank similarities of pairs of samples (or replicates) originating from different sites, {{overline|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of rank similarity of pairs among [[Replicate (statistics)|replicates]] within sites, and ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 where ''n'' is the number of samples.

The test statistic ''R'' is constrained between the values −1 to 1, where [[Sign (mathematics)|positive numbers]] suggest more similarity within sites and values close to zero represent no difference between within sites and within sites similarities. Negative ''R'' values suggest more similarity between sites than within sites and may raise the possibility of wrong assignment of samples to sites.

For the purpose of [[hypothesis]] testing, where the null hypothesis is that the similarities within sites are smaller or equal to the similarities between sites, the ''R'' statistic is usually compared to a set of ''R&amp;prime;'' values that are achieved by means of randomly shuffling site labels between the samples and calculating the resulting ''R&amp;prime;'', repeated many times.  The percent of times that the actual ''R'' surpassed the [[permutation]]s derived ''R&amp;prime;'' values is the p-value for the actual ''R'' statistic.

Ranking of dissimilarity in ANOSIM and NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) go hand in hand.
Combining both methods complement visualisation of group differences along with [[Statistical significance|significance testing]].&lt;ref name="ButtigiegRamette2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttigieg|first1=Pier Luigi|last2=Ramette|first2=Alban|title=A guide to statistical analysis in microbial ecology: a community-focused, living review of multivariate data analyses|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=90|issue=3|year=2014|pages=543–550|issn=0168-6496|doi=10.1111/1574-6941.12437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANOSIM is implemented in several statistical software including PRIMER, R Vegan package and PAST.

This theory is proposed by [[Grafton Elliott-Smith]] (1912) who was a neuroanatomist who was chiefly concerned with the emergence of the primate brain.

The '''arboreal theory''' claims that [[primate]]s evolved from their ancestors by adapting to [[arboreal]] life.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy,G.E. ''Paleoanthroplogy'' (1980) New York: McGRAW-HILL BOOK COMPANY.(p.28)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R. W. (1991). Primate origins and the evolution of angiosperms. American Journal of Primatology, 23(4), 209-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primates are thought to have developed several of their [[Trait (biology)|traits]] and [[Habituation|habits]] initially while living in trees.  One key component to this argument is that primates relied on sight over [[Olfaction|smell]].  They were able to develop a keen sense of [[depth perception]], perhaps because of the constant leaping that was necessary to move about the trees.  Primates also developed [[hand]]s and feet that were capable of grasping.  This was also a result of arboreal life, which required a great deal of crawling along branches, and reaching out for fruit and other food.  These early primates were likely to have [[diet (nutrition)|eaten]] foods found in trees, such as flowers, fruits, berries, gums, leaves, and insects.  They are thought to have shifted their diets towards insects in the early [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic era]], when insects became more numerous.

As a measure of its influence on the accounting industry, the [[AICPA]]'s ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' estimated that as many as half of the CPAs in the United States have passed the CPA Exam with the help of Becker's course.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tysiac|first=Ken|title=CPA exam prep innovator Newton D.

Originally developed in 1957 by accountant and entrepreneur [[Newton Becker]] as a training course for fellow employees of [[Price Waterhouse]], Becker CPA Review was launched as an independent company in 1960. The company grew rapidly, and by the 1980s it had classroom locations in more than 90 cities.&lt;ref name="Sun-Times — Exam Programs" /&gt; Becker eventually sold the company to DeVry in 1996, partly due to changes in the industry.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune — DeVry Acquisition"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Stanley|title=DeVry Acquires CPA Training Firm|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-20/business/9606200247_1_becker-cpa-review-devry-acquires|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its CPA Exam Review, Becker currently offers exam preparation for a number of other international accounting credentials: [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) and Diploma in International Financial Reporting (DipIFR) certifications. Becker also provides [[continuing professional education]] (CPE) and project management training.

In 2012, Becker acquired Falcon Physician Reviews and expanded into the healthcare education field.&lt;ref name="NASDAQ — Falcon Acquisition"&gt;{{cite news|title=DeVry Unit Acquires Falcon Physician Reviews|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/devry-unit-acquires-falcon-physician-reviews-20120403-01222|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=NASDAQ.com|date=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through Falcon, Becker now offers review programs for physicians who are preparing for the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) and the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]] (COMLEX).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12424">'''Cell cycle analysis by DNA content measurement''' is a method that most frequently employs [[flow cytometry]] to distinguish cells in different phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Before analysis, the cells are usually [[wiktionary:Permeabilization|permeabilised]] and treated with a [[fluorescent dye]] that stains [[DNA]] quantitatively, such as [[propidium iodide]] (PI) or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the [[S phase]], the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the [[G0 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] and [[G1 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] (before S), in the S phase, and in the [[G2 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] and [[M phase]] (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; versus S versus G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.

Cell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such [[DNA damage]] that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]. Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell ([[carcinogenesis]]), or to cell death, often by the mode of [[apoptosis]]. An arrest of cells in G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after [[blood serum|serum]] deprivation.

'''Multiparameter analysis of the cell cycle''' includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye [[acridine orange]], reveals the G&lt;sub&gt;1Q&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; cell cycle compartments and also makes it possible to discriminate between S, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and mitotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;Darzynkiewicz Z, Traganos F, Melamed MR.

Similar cell cycle compartments are also recognized by multiparameter analysis that includes measurement of expression of [[cyclin D1]], [[cyclin E]], [[cyclin A]] and [[cyclin B1]], each in relation to DNA content &lt;ref&gt;Darzynkiewicz Z, Gong JP, Juan G, Ardelt B, Traganos, F.

(1986) Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. Feb;49(2):237-55. {{PMID|3510993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the incorporation of [[5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine]] (EdU), the precursor whose detection offers certain advantages over BrdU, has now become the preferred methodology do detect DNA replicating (S-phase) cells.&lt;ref&gt;Buck SB, Bradford J, Gee KR, Agnew BJ, Clarke ST, Salic A.

==Experimental procedure==

[[File:1D30 DNA DAPI.png|250px|right|thumb|DAPI (magenta) bound to the minor groove of DNA (green and blue). From {{PDB|1D30}}.]] Unless staining is performed using [[Hoechst 33342]], the first step in preparing cells for cell cycle analysis is permeabilisation of the cells' [[plasma membrane]]s. This is usually done by incubating them in a [[buffer solution]] containing a mild [[detergent]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[NP-40]], or by [[Fixation (histology)|fixating]] them in [[ethanol]]. Most fluorescent DNA dyes (one of exceptions is [[Hoechst 33342]]) are not plasma membrane permeant, that is, unable to pass through an intact cell membrane. Permeabilisation is therefore crucial for the success of the next step, the staining of the cells.

Prior to (or during the staining step) the cells are often treated with [[RNase A]] to remove [[RNA]]s. This is important because 
certain dyes that stain DNA will also stain RNA, thus creating [[Artifact (error)|artefact]]s that would distort the results. An exception is the metachromatic fluorochrome [[acridine orange]],  which under the specific staining protocol can differentially stain both, RNA (generating red luminescence) and DNA (green fluorescence), or in another protocol, after removal of RNA and partial DNA denaturation, to differentially stain double-stranded DNA (green fluorescence) versus single-stranded DNA(red luminescence)&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. Aside from propidium iodide and acridine orange, quantifiable dyes that are frequently used include (but are not limited to) DRAQ5, [[7-Aminoactinomycin D]], [[DAPI]] and [[Hoechst 33342]].

===Doublet discrimination===

Since cells and especially fixed cells tend to stick together, cell aggregates have to be excluded from analysis through a process called ''doublet discrimination''. This is important because a doublet of two G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells has the same total content of DNA and thus the same fluorescence intensity as a single G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M cell.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpless T, Traganos F, Darzynkiewicz Z, Melamed MR.

===Nicoletti assay===

The '''Nicoletti assay''', named after its inventor, the Italian physician [[Ildo Nicoletti]], is a modified form of cell cycle analysis. It is used to detect and quantify [[apoptosis]], a form of [[programmed cell death]], by analysing cells with a DNA content less than 2n ("sub-G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells"). Such cells are usually the result of [[apoptotic DNA fragmentation]]: during apoptosis, the DNA is degraded by cellular [[endonuclease]]s. Therefore, [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of apoptotic cells contain less DNA than nuclei of healthy G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells, resulting in a sub-G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; peak in the fluorescence [[histogram]] that can be used to determine the relative amount of apoptotic cells in a sample.This method was developed and first described in 1991 by Nicoletti and co-workers at [[University of Perugia|Perugia University]] School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Chromosome combing''' (also known as molecular combing or DNA combing)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Alignment and sensitive detection of DNA by a moving interface.|journal=Science|volume=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique used to produce an array of uniformly stretched [[DNA]] that is then highly suitable for [[nucleic acid hybridization]] studies such as [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|fluorescent in situ hybridisation]] (FISH) which benefit from the uniformity of stretching, the easy access to the hybridisation target sequences,&lt;ref name="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5331/1518.long"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5331/1518.long],&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[X-ray crystallography|resolution]] offered by the large distance between two probes, which is due to the stretching of the DNA by a factor of 1.5 times the crystallographic length of DNA.

DNA in solution (i.e. with a randomly-coiled structure) is stretched by retracting the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] of the solution at a constant rate (typically 300&amp;nbsp;µm/s). The ends of DNA strands, which are thought to be frayed (i.e. open and exposing polar groups) bind to ionisable groups coating a [[silanization|silanized]] glass plate at a [[pH]] below the [[pKa]] of the ionizable groups (ensuring they are charged enough to interact with the ends of DNA). The rest of the DNA, which is mostly dsDNA, cannot form these interactions (aside from a few ‘touch down’ segments along the length of the DNA strand) so is available for hybridisation to probes. As the meniscus retracts, surface retention creates a force that acts on DNA to retain it in the liquid phase; however this force is inferior to the strength of the DNA’s attachment; the result is that the DNA is stretched as it enters the air phase; as the force acts in the locality of the air/liquid phase, it is invariant to different lengths or conformations of the DNA in solution, so DNA of any length will be stretched the same as the meniscus retracts. As this stretching is constant along the length of a DNA, distance along the strand can be related to base content; 1&amp;nbsp;µm is approximately equivalent to 2&amp;nbsp;kb.

DNA regions of interest are observed by hybridising them with probes labelled by [[hapten]]s like [[biotin]]; this can then be bound by one or more layers of fluorochrome-associated ligands (such as immunofluorescence antibodies). Multicolour tagging is also possible. This has several potential uses, typically as a high-resolution physical mapping technique (e.g. for positional cloning), an example of which was the correct mapping of 200&amp;nbsp;kb of the CAPN3 gene region, or the mapping of non-overlapping sequences (since the distance between two probes can be accurately measured). It is therefore useful for finding exons, microdeletions, amplifications, or rearrangements. Before the combing improvement, FISH was too low-res to be of use in this case. With this technique, the resolution of FISH is theoretically limited only by the resolution of the [[fluorescence microscopy|epifluorescence microscope]]; in practice, resolutions of around 2&amp;nbsp;µm are obtained, for DNA molecules usually 200–600&amp;nbsp;kb long (though combing-FISH has been used with some success on molecules in excess of 1&amp;nbsp;Mb long), and there may be room for improvement through optimisation. Since DNA analyses using this technique are single-molecule, genomes from different cells can be compared to find anomalies, with implications for diagnosis of cancer and other genetic alterations.

Chromosome combing is also used to study [[DNA replication]], a highly regulated process that is reliant on a specific program of temporal and spatial distribution of activation of [[origin of replication|origins of replication]]. Each origin occupies a distinct genetic locus and must fire only once per [[cell cycle]]. Chromosome combing allows a genome-wide view of the firing of origins and propagation of [[replication fork]]. As no assumptions are made about the sequence of the origins, this technique is particularly useful for mapping origins in [[eukaryote]]s, which are not thought to have precisely defined initiation sequences.

Strategies involving combing recently replicated DNA typically involve incorporating modified nucleotides (such as BrdU, [[bromodeoxyuridine]]) into the nascent DNA, then fluorescently detecting it. As replication forks spread bidirectionally from origins of replication at (approximately) equal speeds,&lt;ref name="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1949372/?tool=pubmed"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1949372 | pmid=17522385 | doi=10.1091/mbc.E06-08-0689 | volume=18 | title=Replication fork velocities at adjacent replication origins are coordinately modified during DNA replication in human cells | journal=Mol Biol Cell | pages=3059–67 | last1 = Conti | first1 = C | last2 = Saccà | first2 = B | last3 = Herrick | first3 = J | last4 = Lalou | first4 = C | last5 = Pommier | first5 = Y | last6 = Bensimon | first6 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; then origin position can be inferred. Replacing the modified nucleotide pool with a different type of modified nucleotide after a certain amount of time allows development of a time-resolved picture of the firing of sites, and the kinetics of replication forks. Pause sites can be identified, merged replication forks resolved, and the frequency of origin firings in different time periods to be studied.

Firing frequencies have shown in ''in vitro'' studies of Xenopus laevis egg extract to increase as S phase progresses. In another study&lt;ref name="Han"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Han, Kocher et al |title=Visualizing regional distribution of firing events in the Epstein-Barr virus episome using hybridized probes |journal=Methods in Biomolecular Research |date=2009 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=1351-1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Epstein-Barr virus [[episome]]s, hybridised probes were used to visualise the regional distribution of firing events; a particular zone showed preference for firing, whilst a few pause sites were also inferred.

'''Codarts University for the Arts''' ({{lang-nl|Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[vocational university]] in [[Rotterdam]] that teaches music, dance and circus. It was established in its present location in 2000.

==History==

Codarts can trace its origins to the  Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek (Rotterdam Conservatory of Music), popularly known as the Conservatorium Holthaus after its director, Jos Holthaus (1879-1943).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1930 the alternative Rotterdamsch Toonkunst Conservatorium (Rotterdam Musical Arts Conservatory) was founded with the composer [[Willem Pijper]] as director.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;
The Rotterdamse Dansschool (Rotterdam Dance School) was established in 1931 by [[Corrie Hartong]] as director and the German dancer [[Gertrud Leistikow]] as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;  
At first the dance school was part of the Conservatorium Holthaus.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1935 the dance school transferred to Pijper's conservatory.  
Hartong remained as director. She was to stay in this position until 1961, and continued to teach until 1967.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;

[[World War II]] broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of Pijper's conservatory were destroyed by bombs.  It was decided to merge Pijper's and Holthaus's conservatories into one building on Mathenesserlaan, where Holthaus had a branch.
Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war.
Until Holthaus died in 1943 the combined conservatory had two directors.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;

The Rotterdamse Dansschool was renamed the Rotterdamse Dansacademie (Rotterdam Dance Academy) in 1954.  In 1986 the Conservatory and Dance Academy became the Hogeschool voor Muziek en Theater Rotterdam (Rotterdam University of Music and Theatre).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
The school moved into its present modern building next to the [[De Doelen|Doelen]] concert hall in 2000 under the name Codarts - hogeschool voor de kunsten (Codarts - University of the Arts).&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;
The Circus arts program was launched in September 2006.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

Codarts has three divisions: the Rotterdam Conservatory, Rotterdam Dance Academy, and Rotterdam Circus Arts.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

The Rotterdam Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the Netherlands, with over 900 pupils.
It offers courses through which students may obtain a bachelor's degree in any of several disciplines: Music Theater, Pop, Jazz, Composition/arranging, Music Production, Argentinean tango, Indian music, Flamenco, Latin/Latin jazz/Brazilian, Turkish music, Classical music, and Music in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The school puts on public performances, at times using the adjacent [[De Doelen]] concert hall.
Thus in April 2011 guest conductor [[Arie van Beek]] led the Codarts Orchestra and Codarts Chamber Choir in a performance in the Jurriaanse Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Dance Academy teaches dancers and arranges for students to appear in performances and tours.
Codarts helps students gain practical experience with internships with noted dance companies, and participates in student exchange programs with other European and American dance schools.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
In May 2011 the Rotterdam Dance Academy performed at the [[Venice Biennale]] with a show called ''Talent on the Move''.
The program included works by established choreographers such as  [[Jiří Kylián]], [[Nacho Duato]] and [[Mauro Bigonzetti]] and by younger artists including graduates of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Building==
[[File:CodartsRotterdam2017.jpg|thumb|Codarts Rotterdam]]
The building abuts the 1966 [[De Doelen]] concert and conference building, home of the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Concertgebouw de Doelen |language=Dutch
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was built as part of an overall plan for an extension to De Doelen defined in 1993 by Jan Hoogstad.
A new building site beside the Kruisplein was created by reducing the size of Karel Doormanstraat, and this was used for the Doelen extension and the Codarts building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Netherlands/Rotterdam/De%20Doelen
 |title=DE DOELEN |work=Mimoa
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The building was developed by the architectural firm of [[Jan Hoogstad|Ector Hoogstad]], and was completed in 2000.
The plinth is mainly used for commercial purposes.
The building is relatively high to accommodate all the demands of the school, and has a total floor space of {{convert|10500|m2}}.
Visually, the Codarts building appears to reach over the end of the conference center.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

The building's steel skeleton supports a "box in box" design for the interior spaces, including several tall spaces with variable lighting.
A long escalator connects the entrance lobby to the fifth floor.
This is the main floor for Codarts, holding the restaurant, library and several performance rooms, and opening onto a terrace on the roof of the Doelen extension.
Codarts occupies classrooms and offices below this floor.  
The conservatory is above it and the large dance studios are at the top of the building.
The building is clad in brick to give an appearance consistent with nearby apartment buildings.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

==Notable alumni==
* [[Henk van der Vliet]] (1950), Dutch composer and flautist
* [[Willemijn Verkaik#cite note-Nieuws-1|Willemijn Verkaik]], Dutch theatre actress, best known for playing Elphaba from the musical [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]] in the Netherlands, Germany, New York and London.
* [[San Holo]], Dutch record producer and DJ.

'''Coleopterology''' (from [[Coleoptera]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is a branch of [[entomology]], the [[scientific]] study of [[beetle]]s  of the order Coleoptera. Practitioners are termed '''coleopterists'''. Coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles. Among these is The Coleopterists Society, an [[international organization]] based in the United States. Such organizations may have both professionals and amateurs as members, interested in beetles. When speaking informally, coleopterists sometimes refer to their study as "'''beetling'''".

== Journals ==
Research in this field is often published in [[scientific journal|peer-reviewed journals]] specific to the field of coleopterology, though journals dealing with general entomology also publish many papers on various aspects of beetle biology. Some of the journals specific to beetle research are:
* ''[[The Coleopterist]]'' (United Kingdom beetle fauna)
* ''The Coleopterists Bulletin'' (published by The Coleopterists Society)
* ''[[Elytron (journal)|Elytron]]'' (published by the European Association of Coleopterology)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31366">A '''Collections Management System''' ('''CMS'''), sometimes called a '''Collections Information System''', is [[software]] used by the collections staff of a collecting institution or by individual private collectors and collecting hobbyists or enthusiasts.  Collecting institutions are primarily [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s and cover a very broad range from huge, international institutions, to very small or niche-specialty institutions such as local historical museums and preservation societies.  Secondarily, [[libraries]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are also collecting institutions.   Collections Management Systems (CMSs) allow individuals or collecting institutions to organize, control, and manage their collections' objects by “tracking all information related to and about” those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Sully | first=Perian | date=8 July 2006 | url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf | title=Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software | publisher=[[John F.

All of this recorded information is then also accessed and used by other institutional departments such as “education, membership, accounting, and administration."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010).

Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though early Collections Management Systems were cataloging databases, essentially digital versions of card catalogs, more recent and advanced systems are being used to improve communication between museum staff and to automate and manage collections-based tasks and workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Swank | first=Annamaria Poma | date=September 2008 | url=http://carlibrary.org/Collection-Management-Systems-Swank.pdf | title=Collections Management Systems | publisher=Carlibrary.org | format=[[PDF]] | page=15 | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems are also used to provide access to information about an institution's collections and objects to academic researchers, institutional volunteers, and the public, increasingly through online methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schmitt | first=Bob | date=10 October 2014 | url=http://carlibrary.org/CMS.htm | title=Collection Management Systems | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and history of collections management systems==
Ever since machine-readable standards were developed for libraries in the 1960s, museums have had an interest in utilizing computers to record information about their collections. However, museums have very different needs from libraries; while bibliographic information about a library collection object is usually static, museum records are ever-changing because of the continuous need for new information about museum objects to be added to the records.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 11. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1967, the [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN), an informal group of New York museums, attempted to create a collections management database called GRIPHOS, and at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[IBM]] conference in 1968, speakers discussed current and proposed projects to automate collections management.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, pp. 23-24. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to coordinate research into developing these systems, professional associations such as the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee (MDBCC), formed in 1972, were created to disseminate information about computers and databases to museums interested implementing computerized collections systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 29. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Collections Management Systems became more advanced with the rise of relational databases that “[relate] each piece of data to every other piece,"&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 126. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and during this time some of today’s popular systems were originally developed for specific institutions “based on generic relational databases” — such as Gallery Systems' The Museum System for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and [http://rediscoverysoftware.com/welcome/ Re:discovery Software's Proficio] for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s [[Monticello]] — before being released as commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 19. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, with computers becoming faster and cheaper and with the rise of the Internet, collections management software became much more sophisticated, able to “present images, sort information in any one of a myriad of configurations, record exhibition information, track locations, and interface with a museum Website."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 40. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the goal during the 1960s was to use computers for collections record-keeping for purposes of accountability, MCN Executive Director [[Everett Ellin]] warned that museum professionals should include public access as a goal because it would “not be worth the effort if museums only create a glorified record-keeping system."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 26. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems have become crucial tools in increasing public access to collections information, expanding the types of information that are recorded. What was once “a simple tool for collections care and inventory” has become “a robust and powerful instrument for saving all information about museum objects," including interpretive material, digital objects, and digital surrogates. Since some Collections Management Systems now incorporate [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] and content information storage, many museum professionals have started to use the acronym CMS to stand for “[[Content management system|Content Management System]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information managed in collections management systems==
In 1997, art historian and museum information studies consultant Robert A. Baron outlined the requirements for Collections Management Systems, not as a list of the kinds of collections object information that should be recorded, but rather as a list of collections activities such as administration, loan, exhibition, preservation, and retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;Swank, Annamaria Poma (September 2008).

Retrieved 15 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] (CHIN) Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist (CMSCC), which aims to be a comprehensive list of the kinds of information that a museum may want to record in a CMS, organizes that list by processes and actions rather than type of information. The checklist “outlines a number of features commonly included in a commercial CMS, which can assist a museum in determining which features have priority.”&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

==Features of collections management systems==

===Functionality===

A Collections Management System should be able to store data, edit data, delete data, access data through queries, sort data, and output data in the form of reports.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), pp. 117-118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Data is stored in the form of tables and is entered into the system (and sometimes edited) using forms. Queries are searches that help retrieve specific data from the system, and reports “are the means by which the results of a query are displayed or printed."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexibility===
An efficient CMS, like a good relational database, should not have duplicate records and should not require that the same information be recorded in more than one place in the system. At the same time, the system should be flexible enough to accommodate more data as the collections expand.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The user must also understand that not all information must be entered into a Collections Management System; for example, complex information such as complicated dimensions and measurements. Some institutions may not want to record confidential information such as private donor information in a CMS and instead keep it in a manual file or a separate, secure digital file, with pointers to the file’s location recorded in the CMS.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 169. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that such confidential information should be recorded in the CMS to protect the information in the event of a disaster where manual files may be destroyed.

===Backup and redundancy===
A CMS should have "a built in backup and recovery process" to protect data against not only equipment failure and disaster but also human error, which may result in loss or corruption of data. Redundant copies of the information should be stored in multiple locations, and the backup process may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data standards===
Because a computerized system “demands a much greater degree of precision in the use of language for cataloging and data retrieval than does a manual system,” data and [[metadata standards]] should be applied in a Collections Management System.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 173. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;  Data standards provide rules for how information is entered into the system, and data that has been entered into the system in a consistent manner allows for more accurate and precise [[information retrieval]] and for easier exchange of data between different systems.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of data standards are structure, content, and value:

* Data structure standards describe the fields and categories of information (sometimes called elements) that are required to identify an object. In a museum CMS, these fields often include accession number, title/name of object, maker/creator of object, place of creation/origin, date of creation, dimensions, material, and source of object (for example, name of donor or seller).&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 122. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of widely used data structure standards used for cultural objects are the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (DC), [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), the [[MARC standards|MARC]] formats, the element sets of Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO), and the VRA ([[Visual Resources Association]]) Core Categories.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Marcia Lei;Qin, Jian. (2008). Chapter 2: Current Standards. In ‘’Metadata’’ (pp.15-32). New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data content standards provide guidelines for the formatting of information being entered into the fields, “controlling the syntax, style, grammar, and abbreviations” that should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of data content standards used in institutions that collect cultural objects include Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO) and [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]] (DACS).
* Data value standards provide the preferred terms and vocabulary to be used in the fields, often in the form of [[authority lists]], lexicons, [[Data Dictionaries|data dictionaries]], and thesauri. Examples include the Getty’s [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) and [[Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN), Nomenclature 4.0 for Museum Cataloguing, and [[Iconclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), pp. 175-176. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;
While most of these data standards apply to the cataloging and description of cultural objects, efforts are also being made to create data standards for natural history collections. Based on Dublin Core, the [[Darwin Core]] standard is a data structure standard for biodiversity information whose “glossary of terms” are the “fields” and “elements” needed to catalog biological and natural history specimens and samples.&lt;ref&gt;Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/ Darwin Core]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the importance of data standards to many users, some developers advertise that their Collections Management Systems are compliant with certain standards. For example, the Adlib Museum CMS is “certified as SPECTRUM compliant by the Collections Trust” and “also incorporates other international standards such as the ‘[[CIDOC]]’ guidelines and Getty ‘Object ID.’”&lt;ref&gt;Adlib Software. [http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/museum-collection-management-software Adlib Museum]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and access===
A Collections Management System should have security measures that “ensure that only authorized persons are able to enter, edit, or view” information contained in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a growing demand for public access to some of the collections and object information contained in the CMS, which “helps fulfill a museum's mission to educate the public and prove that the objects held in public trust are used to public benefit” while also encouraging collections staff to “support basic collection stewardship” by ensuring that information about the object is accurate before being made publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 182. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The system should allow the public to be able to make and refine searches of publicly accessible information in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and reproductions===

A CMS should also allow collections staff to manage information on reproduction rights of the objects for which the institution is responsible, including type of copyright scheme being applied (for example, U.S. copyright or [[Creative Commons license]]), copyright ownership, and digital watermarks.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when selecting a system==
Since every museum has different needs, a museum should make a [[needs assessment]] before selecting a Collections Management System. The museum should determine what collections processes it needs the system to manage.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should also identify who will be using the system and consider such factors as collection size (both present and future), staff technology skills, and budget/pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Zenobia (Jan-Feb 2013), [https://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?] ‘’MUSEUM’’. American Association of Museums,. Retrieved 13 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recommendation is to map out both the short- and long-term goals for the new CMS and then determine how the system can help increase the museum's efficiencies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/select-museum-cms-start-with-needs-assessment/|title=Start Your Museum CMS Selection Process with a Needs Assessment |publisher=HistoryAssociates.com |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation information management systems==
Collections Management Systems have their origins in cataloging and registration, and consequently, most systems manage information and records “from a curatorial and collections management perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation information in these systems is often limited to condition reporting and documentation of treatment history. While some advanced systems allow registrars to manage workflow tasks such as approvals and receipts, most systems are unable to manage conservation workflows. Many conservators also need a system that can not only store and manage conservation documentation but also easily share that information with other conservators and institutions.

Many Collections Management System developers have responded to this need by adding requested conservation features to their products. For example, in 2009, Gallery Systems, the developer of The Museum System (TMS), formed a consortium of stakeholders called the Conservation Working Group, to create a set of features to add to the conservation module of TMS.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems (2015). [http://www.gallerysystems.com/a-brief-history-of-conservation-studio/ A Brief History of Conservation Studio]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservators and institutions have taken a different approach, customizing existing software so that the system can manage conservation workflows. For example, at the [[Smithsonian National Postal Museum]] in 2012, former collections database administrator Kate Collen modified The Museum Systems’ conservation module so that it could manage object treatment processes, including assigning roles and responsibilities to multiple staff, ordering and prioritizing conservation tasks and treatments, separating treatment images from object images, automating registrar and lender approvals for treatments, and even tracking staff hours. This was achieved by renaming and remapping fields in the existing system, in some cases using fields for different purposes than originally intended by the software developer.&lt;ref&gt;Collen, Kate (2012). [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vsnd3jf5g7rssr/Collen%2C%20Kate%20%282012%29.%20Making%20Conservation%20Work.pdf?dl=0 Making Conservation Work: Configuring the Conservation Module for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum]. Retrieved 14, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software developers have been developing standalone systems specifically for the purpose of managing conservation information and tasks. Since 2000, Inventive Software Solutions has been developing the Conservation Tracker System for the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to be “a comprehensive digital management tool for art conservation documentation.”&lt;ref&gt;Inventive Software Solutions. [http://www.inventivesoftware.net/Products/ConservationTracker.aspx Conservation Tracker System Overview]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed since 2009 as a program of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], ConservationSpace is a project “to develop an open-source software application that will address a core need of the conservation community for a shared solution to the problem of documentation management.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationspace.org/Home.html ConservationSpace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219041630/http://conservationspace.org/Home.html |date=2014-12-19 }}. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gallery Systems decided that adding incremental conservation features to The Museum System was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of conservators and began to develop a standalone web-based system to manage conservation processes called TMS Conservation Studio, which was released in summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39340">In 1975 the Japanese government added a new chapter to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950) to provide for "traditional techniques or craftsmanship that are indispensable to the preservation of cultural property and for which preservation measures shall be taken". Preservation techniques are selected in relation to both [[Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan|tangible]] and [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible]] cultural properties and a holder or preservation body is recognized for each technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/natlaws/media/pdf/japan/japan_law_protectionproperty_entno.pdf |title=Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950, last amendment 2007) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h21_chapter_06.pdf |title=Preservation and Utilization of Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |page=41 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Architectural Preservation in Japan |author=Larsen, Knut Einar |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] International Wood Committee |year=1994 |pages=40f |ISBN=82-519-1432-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the {{nihongo|Selected Conservation Techniques|選定保存技術}}, the government provides funding for and conducts programmes relating to documentation, training, development, promotion and public education. Recognition is thus made and measures taken to combat some of the most serious conservation issues, namely the lack of specialist craftsmen, the loss of knowledge of traditional techniques, and the availability of suitable tools and materials. These issues are of particular relevance in Japan due to the sophistication and inherent susceptibility of much of its art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of totem poles''' is a relatively new topic in the field of [[Art Conservation and Restoration|art conservation]]. Those who are custodians of [[totem pole]]s include [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities, [[museum]]s, [[Cultural Heritage Center|cultural heritage centers]], parks or [[national park]]s, camp grounds or those that belong to individuals. Conservation activities include the historical research and context of totem poles, studying materials and manufacture, performing assessments, documentation and treatments. This field can pertain to [[conservator-restorer]]s, Native Americans, [[museum curator|curators]], [[collection manager]]s, [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[park ranger]]s and city planners.

==History==
In the field of [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|Conservation of Cultural Heritage]], the [[totem pole]] is categorized as a wooden object. Although totem poles are generally identified as wooden objects, there are more complex ideologies associated with them. Totem poles "are more than works of art; they embody the culture of the Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Todd|first1=Andrew|title=Painted Wood: History and Conservation.|journal=Painted Memory, Painted Totems|date=1998|pages=410–428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, conservators must regard the communities from which the poles originated prior to performing any type of assessment or conservation treatment. Totem poles can pose ethical issues in the practice of conservation. These issues may be; spiritual or ceremonial that concern their original communities, or related to provenance. "In recent years more attention has been focused on understanding the perspective of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture in regards to totem poles, especially by conservators. Instead of approaching the conservation of a totem pole with mere intellect some have turned to understanding the spiritual and ceremonial significance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhyne|first1=Charles S.|title=Changing Approaches to the Conservation of Northwest Coast Totem Poles|journal=Tradition and Innovation: Advances in Conservation Contributions to the Melbourne Congress|date=October 10, 2000|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In [[Anthropology|anthropological]] terms, totem poles are visible proof of family lineages".&lt;ref name="PaintedWoodPP400-411"&gt;Todd (1998). pp. 400-411.&lt;/ref&gt; The Totem Pole began being collected by many anthropologists and museums in the late 1800s and early 1900s, thus removing them from their original contexts. Many totem poles originate from Alaska and Canada. Over the last decade, the care and conservation of poles has been a newly developing subject as many museums around the world now hold poles within their collections. In order for conservators to understand the care needed for poles, they must study the methods by which they have been created.

==Materials used for manufacture==
Totem poles are made from [[Western Red Cedar]] and are made from one large cedar log. Poles are carved by hand, using tools such as an axe, [[chisel]]s, gouges and [[adze]]s. Poles can take anywhere between 6 months up to a year to complete. The time to complete a pole can depend on the size of the pole, the amount of time spent and the experience of the carver. Totem poles can either be painted or unpainted. If painted, paints can either be manufactured or made from mineral pigments. The traditional colors used include red, black, yellow, green and blue. "The red was obtained from [[hematite]], the black from graphite and carbon and green/blue from various copper ores".&lt;ref name="PaintedWoodPP400-411" /&gt;

==Agents of deterioration==
Totem poles can be either displayed outdoors or indoors. Agents of deterioration that can impact totem poles are direct sunlight, moisture, fire, infestation, pollutants, fluctuating temperatures, [[relative humidity]] and theft and vandalism. Outdoor poles that are exposed to agents of deterioration are affected year round by rain, pollutants, infestation and biological growth and light. The areas where totem poles originate from have a heavy annual accumulation of rainfall. "Therefore, the major problem of outdoor totem poles is deterioration at the paint-wood surface"&lt;ref&gt;Todd (1998). p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; When it rains, the moisture can become trapped in the space between the paint and the wood and can cause deterioration. Direct sunlight can cause paint colors to fade and [[patina]]. Fluctuating temperatures, weather and [[relative humidity]] can cause the pole to crack or check. When it rains, the pole can absorb moisture and then the pole swells. "Because wood always remains hydroscopic: it absorbs moisture into its cell walls as relative humidity rises and releases water back into the atmosphere as relative humidity falls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Kostanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-56098-174-9 |pages=115–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption and releasing of moisture back into the atmosphere can cause the wood to shrink and swell which causes the cracking and checking of wood.

Because totem poles are created from an organic material they can be a place of habitat for many diverse species. They can become an ideal home for many insects such as wasps, bees, carpenter ants or termites. In addition, poles make great homes for birds as many nests have been found at the top of poles. Biological growth can develop on the exterior or interior of poles. "Biological growth has contributed to structural deterioration of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;Todd (1998). p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of biological growth can include moss, [[lichen]]s, root systems and plants.

Over the past decade some totem poles have been known to be stolen while on display outdoors. An 18-foot pole was stolen from a park in West Seattle, Washington by a man who had the vision of installing it in his front yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flandro |first1=Carly |title=Tracking the Tale of the Stolen Totem Pole |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tracking-the-tale-of-the-stolen-totem-pole/ |accessdate=20 November 2015 |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pole was later recovered, along with another pole that was stolen from a nearby town and erected again back in the park. In addition to being looted, poles have been vandalized. On May 17, 1977, entrance poles to the Tulalip Indian Reservation in the State of Washington were cut down with a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vandals Cut Totem Poles |publisher=Marysville Globe |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatments==
Prior to performing any conservation work, a condition assessment is performed. During an assessment the conservator identifies the materials used for the object and how the object was constructed. "In assessing the condition of a piece, it is also important to consider the factors that may have contributed to its present condition-former use, cultural modifications, previous environments, prior treatments, as well as storage and/or display conditions".&lt;ref name="ConservationConcernsP140"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bachmann |editor1-first=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=978-1-56098-174-9 |pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an assessment, time "may be spent photographing, taking condition notes, measuring cracks and probing the wood with an ice pick".&lt;ref name="Carlee"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carlee |first1=Ellen |title=Totem Pole Maintenance |url=https://ellencarrlee.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/totem-pole-maintenance/ |website=Ellen Carlee Conservation |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assessment, a treatment plan is developed. The treatment plan will depend on the plan or outcome of the pole such as indoor exhibition, storage our outdoor display. "Decisions about appropriate treatments and methods of preservation for individual artifacts therefore should be made by a conservator in consultation with experts in the culture".&lt;ref name="ConservationConcernsP140" /&gt; Conservation goals for totem poles can include stabilization of materials such as wood, paint or loose joints, removal of biological growth, surface cleaning, application of a water or insect repellents, removal of decayed wood, stabilizing of totem at base and in some cases the removal of the totem pole. Conservators who perform treatments on a pole document any work performed via photographs or written notes. A surface cleaning is a common treatment by conservators. The surface cleaning is generally performed with a low-suction vacuum, soft brushes, mild detergent and soft sponges. Cleanings are important for removing any dirt, grime, grease, pollution or dust from the pole's surface. It is recommended by conservators to start at the top and work your way down. Scaffolding or a lift is used with taller poles.

Another treatment done by conservators is the removal of biological growth. Conservators often use scrapers such as popsicle sticks or bamboo skewers to scrape off the surface. Sometimes poles may have trees, roots or grass growing inside of them. In this situation, "it is probably better to cut the growth off flush with the wood, since pulling out big roots can cause more damage and create empty space for water to pool".&lt;ref name=Carlee/&gt;

Another example of a treatment often performed by conservators is the consolidation of the pole's surface which can be performed in a variety of methods. In a paper presented at the 42nd annual [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute of Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]] discusses the utilization of Butvar B-98 and Paraloid B-72 as the selected adhesives for consolidating splinters and detached fragments. Another method for consolidating wood is with the use of [[epoxy]]. Epoxy is a method for adhering smaller fragments of wood or larger wood fragments such as wings, beaks or fins of animals. "Epoxy repairs are difficult to reverse without harming the wood, and skill and experience are required to select and apply epoxies, bulking agents and tinting products".&lt;ref name=Carlee/&gt; Materials used to consolidate paint surfaces are Acryloid B-72 in acetone which is applied with a brush. Last, a necessary and common treatment is an insect treatment. A product often used by conservators for infestation is Bora-care. This product is ingested by insects and impedes their ability to digest and thus starves them to death.

==Maintenance==
If one is the custodian of a pole, it is recommended to develop a maintenance plan. It is preferable to have the maintenance performed by a professional conservator. "The maintenance of a pole can include the removal of vegetation and an application of a water repellent. During a maintenance routine check, the stability of the base of the pole is tested. The base of the pole is checked for rot and decay and can be done with a resistograph. "The resistograph uses a very fine drill bit 20" long which gives graphic chart readings as it penetrates the wood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheetz |first1=Ron |title=Preservation Assessment of Totem Poles |journal=Totem Bight State Historical Park |date=May 11–21, 2008 |page=7 in 1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing the density of the base is important to ensure the safety of the public so the pole does not fall down. In addition to checking for decay and stability, any loose fragments can be repaired or removed. Last, any type of insect or biological growth can be documented and treated. Photographs and documentation help keep track of the condition of the pole throughout the years.

==Preventative conservation== 
It is difficult to mitigate against agents of deterioration such as rain, sunlight or fluctuating temperatures when a pole is displayed outdoors. It is important to follow a strict maintenance program to minimize future deterioration. The management of moisture is important for preservation. One method that has been used to prevent absorption of water at the end grain of the wood is through the fabrication of a custom fitting cap. Caps can be made with copper sheeting or sheet lead. One concern conservators have posed with the use of caps, is the potential of moisture getting trapped underneath. Poles that were capped in Sitka Historical Park in Sitka, Alaska "were found in much better condition than the poles that were not capped".&lt;ref name=Carlee/&gt;

It is recommended that if poles are stored or displayed indoors, then they should have minimal exposure to direct lighting sources. Many museums install [[UV filter]]s when poles are on display indoors. Other recommendations for indoor storage include a climate-controlled environment, no food or beverages in the vicinity of any poles, a 24-hour security system and having active security guards on duty. Last, museums typically have a barrier between the visitor and the object on display. Continual touching of a pole can cause irreversible damage such as the absorption of skin oil into the wood.

==Restoration== 
There have been previous cases where restoration of a totem pole takes place in lieu of the preservation of existing materials. Restoration practices can include the replacement of wood or repainting. Many cases of the repainting of poles most often occurred only when the original paint patterns were known. It is also recommended if any type of repainting or replacement of fragments of the pole is to take place, it should involve the consulting with the appropriate Native carver or carvers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="689">In [[telecommunication]], '''continuous operation''' is an operation in which certain components, such as nodes, [[telecommunications facility|facilities]], [[telecommunications circuit|circuits]], or equipment, are in an operational state at all times. Continuous operation usually requires that there be fully redundant configuration, or at least a sufficient ''X'' out of ''Y'' degree of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] for compatible equipment, where ''X'' is the number of [[Spare part|spare]] components and ''Y'' is the number of operational components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8678">'''Damage tolerance''' is a property of a structure relating to its ability to sustain defects safely until repair can be effected. The approach to engineering design to account for damage tolerance is based on the assumption that flaws can exist in any structure and such flaws propagate with usage. This approach is commonly used in [[aerospace engineering]] to manage the extension of cracks in structure through the application of the principles of [[fracture mechanics]].  In aerospace engineering, structure is considered to be damage tolerant if a maintenance program has been implemented that will result in the detection and repair of accidental damage, corrosion and fatigue cracking before such damage reduces the residual strength of the structure below an acceptable limit. As one such approach to crack repair, the placement of a hole at a crack tip to reduce stress concentration and inhibit crack propagation is widely studied and implemented.

==History==

Structures upon which human life depends have long been recognized as needing an element of [[fail-safe]]ty.  When describing his flying machine, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] noted that "In constructing wings one should make one chord to bear the strain and a looser one in the same position so that if one breaks under the strain, the other is in the position to serve the same function."&lt;ref name="riddick"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1970s, the prevailing engineering philosophy of aircraft structures was to ensure that airworthiness was maintained with a single part broken, a redundancy requirement known as [[fail-safe]]ty.  However, advances in [[fracture mechanics]], along with infamous catastrophic fatigue failures such as those in the [[DeHavilland Comet]] prompted a change in requirements for aircraft.  It was discovered that a phenomenon known as "multiple-site damage" could cause many small cracks in the structure, which grow slowly by themselves, to join one another over time, creating a much larger crack, and significantly reducing the expected time until failure &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Safe-life structure==

Not all structure must demonstrate detectable crack propagation to ensure safety of operation.  Some structures operate under the [[safe-life design]] principle, where an extremely low level of [[risk]] is accepted through a combination of testing and analysis that the part will ever form a detectable crack due to fatigue during the service life of the part.  This is achieved through a significant reduction of stresses below the typical fatigue capability of the part.  Safe-life structures are employed when the cost or infeasibility of inspections outweighs the weight penalty and development costs associated with safe-life structures.&lt;ref name="riddick"/&gt;  An example of a safe-life component is the [[helicopter rotor]] blade.  Due to the extremely large numbers of cycles endured by the rotating component, an undetectable crack may grow to a critical length in a single flight and before the aircraft lands, result in a catastrophic failure that regular maintenance could not have prevented.

==Damage tolerance analysis==

In ensuring the continued safe operation of the damage tolerant structure, inspection schedules are devised.  This schedule is based on many criteria, including:

*assumed initial damaged condition of the structure
*stresses in the structure (both [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and operational maximum stresses) that cause [[fracture mechanics|crack growth]] from the damaged condition
*geometry of the material which intensifies or reduces the stresses on the [[fracture|crack]] tip
*ability of the material to withstand cracking due to stresses in the expected environment
*largest crack size that the structure can endure before catastrophic failure
*likelihood that a particular inspection method will reveal a crack
*acceptable level of [[risk]] that a certain structure will be completely failed
*expected duration after manufacture until a detectable crack will form
*assumption of failure in adjacent components which may have the effect of changing stresses in the structure of interest

These factors affect how long the structure may operate normally in the damaged condition before one or more inspection intervals has the opportunity to discover the damaged state and effect a repair.  The interval between inspections must be selected with a certain minimum safety, and also must balance the expense of the inspections, the weight penalty of lowering fatigue stresses, and the opportunity costs associated with a structure being out of service for maintenance.

==Non-destructive inspections==

Manufacturers and operators of aircraft have a financial interest in ensuring that the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible.  Because aircraft are often revenue producing, there is an [[opportunity cost]] associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself.  Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul.  Crack growth, as shown by [[fracture mechanics]], is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see [[Paris' law]]). This means that only the largest cracks influence the overall strength of a structure; small internal damages do not necessarily decrease the strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Valentin L.|last2=Pohrt|first2=Roman|last3=Li|first3=Qiang|date=2017-09-01|title=Strength of adhesive contacts: Influence of contact geometry and material gradients|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=308–325|doi=10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has led to the development of [[non-destructive testing]] methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include [[eddy current]], [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic]], [[Dye penetrant inspection|dye penetrant]], and [[X-ray]] inspections.  By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair. Such repair can be readily achieved by drilling a small hole at the crack tip, thus effectively turning the crack into a [[notch (engineering)|keyhole-notch]].&lt;ref name="notch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Liu | first1= M. | display-authors=etal |title= An improved semi-analytical solution for stress at round-tip notches | journal= Engineering Fracture Mechanics | year=2015 | volume=149| pages=134–143 |url= http://drgan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/032_EFM_2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in the [[application layer]], domain fronting allows a user to connect to a blocked service over [[HTTPS]], while appearing to communicate with an entirely different site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fifield|first=David|last2=Lan|first2=Chang|last3=Hynes|first3=Rod|last4=Wegmann|first4=Percy|last5=Paxson|first5=Vern|year=2015|title=Blocking-resistant communication through domain fronting|url=http://www.icir.org/vern/papers/meek-PETS-2015.pdf|journal=Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies|volume=2015|issue=2|pages=46–64|doi=10.1515/popets-2015-0009|issn=2299-0984|access-date=2017-01-03|via=De Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical details ==
The technique works by using different [[Domain name|domain names]] at different layers of communication. The domain name of an innocuous site is used to initialize the connection. This domain name is exposed to the censor in [[Plaintext|clear-text]] as part of the [[Domain Name System|DNS request]] and the [[Server Name Indication|TLS Server Name Indication]]. The domain name of the actual, blocked endpoint is only communicated after the establishment of an encrypted HTTPS connection, in the [[List of HTTP header fields|HTTP Host header]], making it invisible to censors. This can be done if the blocked and the innocuous sites are both hosted by the same large provider, such as [[Google App Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/21/signal-egypt-uae-censorship-block-domain-fronting/|title=Encrypted chat app Signal circumvents government censorship|website=Engadget|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/encryption-app-signal-fights-censorship-clever-workaround/|title=Encryption App ‘Signal’ Is Fighting Censorship With a Clever Workaround|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|newspaper=WIRED|access-date=2017-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.attackzero.net/2015/11/domain-fronting-and-you.html?m=1|title=Domain Fronting and You|website=blog.attackzero.net|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For any given domain name, censors are typically unable to differentiate circumvention traffic from legitimate traffic. As such, they are forced to either allow all traffic to the domain name, including circumvention traffic, or block the domain name entirely, which may result in expensive collateral damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek|title=doc/meek – Tor Bug Tracker &amp; Wiki|website=trac.torproject.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whispersystems.org/blog/doodles-stickers-censorship/|title=Open Whisper Systems &gt;&gt; Blog &gt;&gt; Doodles, stickers, and censorship circumvention for Signal Android|website=whispersystems.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Early Music History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published annually by [[Cambridge University Press]], which specialises in the study of [[music]] from the [[early Middle Ages]] to the end of the 17th century. It was established in 1981 and is edited by [[Iain Fenlon]].
{{cquote|''Early Music History'' exists to stimulate further exploration of familiar phenomena through unfamiliar means, and to add to the growing appreciation of the value of interdisciplianary approaches and their potentialities.  Another emphasis might be called the contextual.  At present some music historians tend to concentrate on the internal analysis of a composition and its relation to a specific and usually narrowly defined historical frame.  Indeed, much musicological writing presents by implication a formidable orthodoxy in which history is perceived as a succession of paradigms of musical language, style, and form.  Some recent work has attempted explanation through exploration of a wider range of evidence, and Early Music History intends to strengthen this trend by encouraging studies that examine the economic, political, and social ramifications of research.  In that musicology itself can on benefit if its vision is extended and its methods refined and broadened, the board believes that ''Early Music History'' will mark a new departure in the development of the discipline while continuing to support its traditional tasks.|15px|15px|Iain Fenlon, preface to Volume I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iain Fenlon |title=Preface |journal=Early Music History |volume=1 |pages=vii-vii |year=1981|doi= 10.1017/S0261127900000243|url= |issn=1474-0559}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17708">'''Epistemic modal logic''' is a subfield of [[modal logic]] that is concerned with reasoning about [[knowledge]].  While [[epistemology]] has a long philosophical tradition dating back to [[Ancient Greece]], epistemic logic is a much more recent development with applications in many fields, including [[philosophy]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[economics]] and [[linguistics]].  While philosophers since [[Aristotle]] have discussed modal logic, and [[Medieval Philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] such as [[Avicenna]], [[William of Ockham|Ockham]], and [[Duns Scotus]] developed many of their observations, it was [[C. I. Lewis]] who created the first symbolic and systematic approach to the topic, in 1912.  It continued to mature as a field, reaching its modern form in 1963 with the work of [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]].

==Historical development==
Many papers were written in the 1950s that spoke of a logic of knowledge in passing, but it was Finnish philosopher [[Georg Henrik von Wright|von Wright]]'s paper ''An Essay in Modal Logic'' from 1951 that is seen as a founding document.  It was not until 1962 that another Finn, [[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka]], would write ''Knowledge and Belief'', the first book-length work to suggest using modalities to capture the semantics of knowledge rather than the [[alethic modality|alethic]] statements typically discussed in modal logic.  This work laid much of the groundwork for the subject, but a great deal of research has taken place since that time.  For example, epistemic logic has been combined recently with some ideas from [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] to create [[dynamic epistemic logic]], which can be used to specify and reason about information change and exchange of information in [[multi-agent systems]]. The seminal works in this field are by Plaza, [[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Van Benthem]], and Baltag, Moss, and Solecki.

==Standard possible worlds model==
Most attempts at modeling knowledge have been based on the [[possible world]]s model.  In order to do this, we must divide the set of possible worlds between those that are compatible with an agent's knowledge, and those that are not. This generally conforms with common usage. If I know that it is either Friday or Saturday, then I know for sure that it is not Thursday. There is no possible world compatible with my knowledge where it is Thursday, since in all these worlds it is either Friday or Saturday. While we will primarily be discussing the logic-based approach to accomplishing this task, it is worthwhile to mention here the other primary method in use, the [[Event (philosophy)|event]]-based approach.  In this particular usage, events are sets of possible worlds, and knowledge is an operator on events.  Though the strategies are closely related, there are two important distinctions to be made between them:
* The underlying mathematical model of the logic-based approach are [[Kripke semantics]], while the event-based approach employs the related [[Aumann structures]].
* In the event-based approach logical formulas are done away with completely, while the logic-based approach uses the system of modal logic.
Typically, the logic-based approach has been used in fields such as philosophy, logic and AI, while the event-based approach is more often used in fields such as [[game theory]] and [[mathematical economics]].  In the logic-based approach, a syntax and semantics have been built using the language of modal logic, which we will now describe.

===Syntax===
The basic [[modal operator]] of epistemic logic, usually written ''K'', can be read as "it is known that," "it is epistemically necessary that," or "it is inconsistent with what is known that not."  If there is more than one agent whose knowledge is to be represented, subscripts can be attached to the operator (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{K}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{K}_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc.) to indicate which agent one is talking about.  So &lt;math&gt;\mathit{K}_a\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "Agent &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; knows that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;."  Thus, epistemic logic can be an example of [[multimodal logic]] applied for [[knowledge representation]].&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;257 in: {{cite book |last=Ferenczi |first=Miklós |title=Matematikai logika |publisher=Műszaki könyvkiadó |location=Budapest |year=2002 |language=Hungarian |isbn=963-16-2870-1}}
: 257&lt;/ref&gt; The dual of ''K'', which would be in the same relationship to ''K'' as &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; is to &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;, has no specific symbol, but can be represented by &lt;math&gt;\neg K_a \neg \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, which can be read as "&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; does not know that not &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;" or "It is consistent with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'s knowledge that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is possible". The statement "&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; does not know whether or not &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;" can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\neg K_a\varphi \land \neg K_a\neg\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to accommodate notions of [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] and [[distributed knowledge]], three other modal operators can be added to the language.  These are &lt;math&gt;\mathit{E}_\mathit{G}&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "every agent in group G knows;" &lt;math&gt;\mathit{C}_\mathit{G}&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "it is common knowledge to every agent in G;" and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{D}_\mathit{G}&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "it is distributed knowledge to every agent in G."  If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of our language, then so are &lt;math&gt;\mathit{E}_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{C}_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{D}_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  Just as the subscript after &lt;math&gt;\mathit{K}&lt;/math&gt; can be omitted when there is only one agent, the subscript after the modal operators &lt;math&gt;\mathit{E}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{D}&lt;/math&gt; can be omitted when the group is the set of all agents.

===Semantics===
As we mentioned above, the logic-based approach is built upon the possible worlds model, the semantics of which are often given definite form in Kripke structures, also known as Kripke models.  A Kripke structure ''M'' for ''n'' agents over &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a (n+2)-tuple &lt;math&gt;(S, \pi, \mathcal{K}_1, ..., \mathcal{K}_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where S is a nonempty set of ''states'' or ''possible worlds'', &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is an ''interpretation'', which associates with each state in S a truth assignment to the primitive propositions in &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_1, ..., \mathcal{K}_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[binary relation]]s on S for ''n'' numbers of agents.  It is important here not to confuse &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;, our modal operator, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_i&lt;/math&gt;, our accessibility relation.

The truth assignment tells us whether or not a proposition ''p'' is true or false in a certain state.  So &lt;math&gt;\pi (s)(p)&lt;/math&gt; tells us whether ''p'' is true in state ''s'' in model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  Truth depends not only on the structure, but on the current world as well.  Just because something is true in one world does not mean it is true in another.  To state that a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at a certain world, one writes &lt;math&gt;(M,s) \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, normally read as "&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at (M,s)," or "(M,s) satisfies &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;".

It is useful to think of our binary relation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_i&lt;/math&gt; as a ''possibility'' relation, because it is meant to capture what worlds or states agent ''i'' considers to be possible.  In idealized accounts of knowledge (e.g., describing the epistemic status of perfect reasoners with infinite memory capacity), it makes sense for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_i&lt;/math&gt; to be an [[equivalence relation]], since this is the strongest form and is the most appropriate for the greatest number of applications.  An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]], and [[Transitive relation|transitive]].  The accessibility relation does not have to have these qualities; there are certainly other choices possible, such as those used when modeling belief rather than knowledge.

==The properties of knowledge==

Assuming that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation, and that the agents are perfect reasoners, a few properties of knowledge can be derived.  The properties listed here are often known as the "S5 Properties," for reasons described in the Axiom Systems section below.

===The distribution axiom===
This axiom is traditionally known as '''K'''.  In epistemic terms, it states that if an agent knows &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and knows that &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \psi&lt;/math&gt;, then the agent must also know &lt;math&gt;\,\psi&lt;/math&gt;.  So,

: &lt;math&gt;(K_i\varphi \land K_i(\varphi \implies \psi)) \implies K_i\psi&lt;/math&gt;

===The knowledge generalization rule===
Another property we can derive is that if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is valid, then &lt;math&gt;K_i\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  This does not mean that if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true, then agent i knows &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  What it means is that if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true in every world that an agent considers to be a possible world, then the agent must know &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; at every possible world. This principle is traditionally called '''N'''.

: &lt;math&gt;\text{if }M \models \varphi\text{ then }M \models K_i \varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===The knowledge or truth axiom===
This axiom is also known as '''T'''.  It says that if an agent knows facts, the facts must be true.  This has often been taken as the major distinguishing feature between knowledge and belief.  We can believe a statement to be true when it is false, but it would be impossible to ''know'' a false statement.

: &lt;math&gt;K_i \varphi \implies \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

===The positive introspection axiom===
This property and the next state that an agent has introspection about its own knowledge, and are traditionally known as '''4''' and '''5''', respectively.  The Positive Introspection Axiom, also known as the KK Axiom, says specifically that agents ''know that they know what they know''.  This axiom may seem less obvious than the ones listed previously, and [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued against its inclusion forcefully in his book, ''Knowledge and Its Limits''.

: &lt;math&gt;K_i \varphi \implies K_i K_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

===The negative introspection axiom===
The Negative Introspection Axiom says that agents ''know that they do not know what they do not know''.

: &lt;math&gt;\neg K_i \varphi \implies K_i \neg K_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom systems===
Different modal logics can be derived from taking different subsets of these axioms, and these logics are normally named after the important axioms being employed.  However, this is not always the case.  KT45, the modal logic that results from the combining of '''K''', '''T''', '''4''', '''5''', and the Knowledge Generalization Rule, is primarily known as [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]].  This is why the properties of knowledge described above are often called the S5 Properties.

Epistemic logic also deals with belief, not just knowledge. The basic modal operator is usually written ''B'' instead of ''K''. In this case though, the knowledge axiom no longer seems right—agents only sometimes believe the truth—so it is usually replaced with the Consistency Axiom, traditionally called '''D''':

: &lt;math&gt;\neg B_i \bot&lt;/math&gt;

which states that the agent does not believe a contradiction, or that which is false.  When '''D''' replaces '''T''' in S5, the resulting system is known as KD45.  This results in different properties for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_i&lt;/math&gt; as well.  For example, in a system where an agent "believes" something to be true, but it is not actually true, the accessibility relation would be non-reflexive.  The logic of belief is called [[doxastic logic]].

==Problems with the possible world model and modal model of knowledge==
The notion of knowledge discussed does not take into account computational constraints on inference. If we take the possible worlds approach to knowledge, it follows that our epistemic agent ''a'' knows all the [[logical consequence]]s of his or her or its beliefs. If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a logical consequence of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, then there is no possible world where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true but &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is not. So if ''a'' knows that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that all of the logical consequences of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are true of all of the possible worlds compatible with ''a'' 's beliefs. Therefore, ''a'' knows &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. It is not epistemically possible for ''a'' that not-&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; given his knowledge that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. This consideration was a part of what led [[Robert Stalnaker]] to develop [[two dimensionalism]], which can arguably explain how we might not know all the logical consequences of our beliefs even if there are no worlds where the propositions we know come out true but their consequences false.&lt;ref&gt;Stalnaker, Robert. "Propositions." ''Issues in the Philosophy of Language''. Yale UP, 1976. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when we ignore possible world semantics and stick to axiomatic systems, this peculiar feature holds. With '''K''' and '''N''' (the Distribution Rule and the Knowledge Generalization Rule, respectively), which are axioms that are minimally true of all normal modal logics, we can prove that we know all the logical consequences of our beliefs. If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a logical consequence of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, then we can derive &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_a (P \rightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt; with '''N''' and the [[conditional proof]] and then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_a P \rightarrow \mathcal{K}_a Q&lt;/math&gt; with '''K'''. When we translate this into epistemic terms, this says that if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a logical consequence of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, then ''a'' knows that it is, and if ''a'' knows &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, ''a'' knows &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. That is to say, ''a'' knows all the logical consequences of every proposition. This is necessarily true of all classical modal logics. But then, for example, if ''a'' knows that prime numbers are divisible only by themselves and the number one, then ''a'' knows that 8683317618811886495518194401279999999 is prime (since this number is only divisible by itself and the number one). That is to say, under the modal interpretation of knowledge, when ''a'' knows the definition of a prime number, ''a'' knows that this number is prime. It should be clear at this point that ''a'' is not human. This shows that epistemic modal logic is an idealized account of knowledge, and explains objective, rather than subjective knowledge (if anything).&lt;ref&gt;See Ted Sider's [http://homepages.nyu.edu/~ts65/books/lfp/lfp.html Logic for Philosophy].

'''Ethnomethodology''' is the study of methods people use for understanding and producing the [[social order]] in which they live.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1974) 'The origins of the term ethnomethodology', in R.Turner (Ed.) Ethnomethodology, Penguin, Harmondsworth, pp 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream [[sociology|sociological]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (2002) ''Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism'', Rowman &amp; Littleford, Lanham.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, its early investigations led to the founding of [[conversation analysis]], which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see {{section link||Varieties}}).&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, G. (1995) ''Talk and Social Structure' and 'Studies of Work'', in Human Studies, 18: 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomethodology provides methods which have been used in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies to produce accounts of people's methods for negotiating everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Michael Makowsky (1978). The discovery of society. London: Random House. Page 232&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;Wes W. Sharrock, Bob Anderson, R. J. Anderson (1986) The ethnomethodologists. London: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-85312-949-5}}. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.&lt;ref&gt;Rooke, J. &amp; Seymour, D. (2005) 'Studies of Work: Achieving Hybrid Disciplines in IT Design and Management Studies', Human Studies 28(2):205–221. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term's meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: ''ethno'' – ''method'' – ''ology'', for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: ''ethno'' refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); ''method'' refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ''ology'' refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the "how" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with sociological studies.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"&gt;Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==
The approach was originally developed by [[Harold Garfinkel]], who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"/&gt; His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room ''as a jury''. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

This interest developed out of Garfinkel's critique of [[Talcott Parsons]]' attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of [[Alfred Schutz]], though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]]; and the traditional sociological concern with the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]ian "problem of order".&lt;ref name="annerawls"&gt;Anne Rawls, "Harold Garfinkel", Blackwell Companion to Major Social Theorists, ed. G. Ritzer. Blackwell: London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt; This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. [[John Heritage]] writes, "In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory."&lt;ref&gt;Heritage, J. (1984). ''Garfinkel and ethnomethodology.'' Cambridge, U.K: Polity Press. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and methods==

{{Synthesis|section|date=June 2012}}

Ethnomethodology has perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method.&lt;ref name="doug1991"&gt;Doug Maynard &amp; Steve Clayman, "The Diversity of Ethnomethodology", ASR, V.17, pp. 385–418. 1991. A survey of various ethnomethodological approaches to the study of social practices. Pages 413–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, Cambridge:Polity. 1991.({{ISBN|0-7456-0060-3}}). Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory and a multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to ''Ethnomethodology's Program'' might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel's life.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garf0742516423"&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]] (2002). Ethnomethodology's Program. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-1642-3}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology's understanding of the significance of "member's methods", and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"/&gt; It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London&lt;/ref&gt; References are also made in Garfinkel's work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch ([[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt Theory]]), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz's studies of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein's understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of ''doing'' ethnomethodological investigations.

Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways,&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and the point of these investigations is "to discover the things that persons in particular situations ''do'', the methods ''they'' use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; [[Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist)|Michael Lynch]] has noted that: "Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is ''adequate'' to the particular phenomena under study".&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynch1989"&gt;Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. &amp; Wieder, D. L. (1992) 'Two Incommensurable, Asymmetrically Alternate Technologies of Social Analysis', in G. Watson  &amp; R. M. Seiler (eds.), Text in Context, Sage, London, pp. 175–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some leading policies, methods and definitions==

; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies : As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: "If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so". That is, "...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: "Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements." "The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empricist.  Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the ''unique adequacy requirement''.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a 'vulgar competence' in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference.
; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate [[agnosticism]], or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of "deviance", analysis of behavior as rule governed, [[role theory]], institutional (de)formations, theories of [[social stratification]], etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member's) concern.
; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the [[indexical]] and reflexive properties of the actors', or observer's, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer's inescapable reliance on the [[hermeneutic circle]] as the defining "methodology" of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"&gt;Mark Okrent, Heidegger's Pragmatism, Cornell University Press, 1988. Pages 157–172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared [[social order]]. For example, [[driving the wrong way]] down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise—a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household—is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach—especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.
; [[Durkheim]]'s aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: "...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a "misreading" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.
; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive—they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.
; [[Indexicality]] : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification [[operationalisation]]. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior.&lt;ref name="garf1984"&gt;Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a "segment" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a "working consensus" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).
; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, "alternate reading", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, "...translate point to point", but, "...instead, they go together."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading—the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: "incommensurable."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.
; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use "reflexivity" as a synonym for "[[Introspection|self-reflection]]," the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant "to describe the acausal and non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] determination of meaningful action-in-context."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg60u8574h414t0l/ Michael Lynch, Mark Peyrot. "Introduction: A reader's guide to ethnomethodology". ''Qualitative Sociology''. Springer Netherlands. 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Reflexivity (social theory)]].
; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. [[Garfinkel]] recovered the concept from the work of [[Karl Mannheim]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Mannheim]], "On the Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (1952),in, From Karl Mannheim (ed. Kurt Wolf), Transaction Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the "document of", "as pointing to", as "standing on behalf of", a presupposed underlying pattern.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; These "documents" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"/&gt; This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aron Gurwitsch]], The Field of Consciousness, Duquesne University Press, 1964 [out-of-print]. Pages 202–227&lt;/ref&gt;
; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group members' concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial ([[:wkit:adumbration|adumbrated]]) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual ''noema'', and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology's field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

==Differences with sociology ==

Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies.&lt;ref name="Paul Attewell 1974 pp. 179–210"&gt;Attewell, Paul. (1974). "Ethnomethodology since Garfinkel," ''Theory and Society'' '''1'''(2): 179–210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]], Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967). Page: viii&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mehan &amp; Houston Wood, The reality of ethnomethodology. 1975. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-59060-6}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or 'poke fun' at traditional sociological forms {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Leiter, ''A Primer of Ethnomethodology''. 1980. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-502628-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors' characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, "value states", "sentiments", "goal orientations", "mini-max economic theories of behavior", etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific "normative order" as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc.

For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting's features. The job of the Ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual's party to those settings.

The differences can therefore be summed up as follows:

# While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the [[facticity]] (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared.
# While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings

==Links with phenomenology==
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}

Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a "phenomenological sensibility",&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and reliable commentators have acknowledged that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology..." (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), orthodox adherents to the discipline—those who follow the teachings of Garfinkel—do not represent it as a branch, or form, of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology.

The confusion between the two disciplines stems, in part, from the practices of some ethnomethodologists (including Garfinkel), who sift through phenomenological texts, recovering phenomenological concepts and findings relevant to their interests, and then transpose these concepts and findings to topics in the study of social order. Such interpretive transpositions do not make the ethnomethodologist a phenomenologist, or ethnomethodology a form of phenomenology.

To further muddy the waters, some phenomenological sociologists seize upon ethnomethodological findings as examples of applied phenomenology; this even when the results of these ethnomethodological investigations clearly do not make use of phenomenological methods, or formulate their findings in the language of phenomenology. So called phenomenological analyses of social structures that do not have prima facie reference to any of the structures of intentional consciousness should raise questions as to the phenomenological status of such analyses.

Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being "appropriated" and intentionally "misread" for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; These appropriations and methodical "misread[ings]" of phenomenological texts and findings are clearly made for the purposes of furthering ethnomethodological analyses, and should not be mistaken for logical extensions of these phenomenological texts and findings.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

Lastly, there is no claim in any of Garfinkel's work that ethnomethodology is a form of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. To state that ethnomethodology has a "phenomenological sensibility" or that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology" is not the equivalent of describing ethnomethodology as a form of phenomenology (see Garfinkel/Liberman 2007:3–7).

Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the actual doing of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his "Field of Consciousness" (1964: ethnomethodology's phenomenological ''urtext''): "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
According to [[George Psathas]], five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as:

# ''The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning''. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel's seminal ''Studies in Ethnomethodology''.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt;
# ''The organisation of talk-in-interaction''. More recently known as [[conversation analysis]], [[Harvey Sacks]] established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]].
# ''Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings''. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings.
# ''The study of work''. 'Work' is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed.
# ''The [[haecceity]] of work''. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition?

Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard &amp; Clayman's work.&lt;ref name="doug1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with conversational analysis==
The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is "inexorably intertwined" with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: "Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversational analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;{{rp|143}}

On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and "formal analytic" enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; The "danger" of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversational analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the ''unique adequacy requirement'' of methods.

==History==
[[File:GeologicalSurveyIndia1870.jpg|thumb|left|Earliest members of the [[Geological Survey of India|GSI]] and [[British Geological Survey|BGS]] in 1851.]]

As early as 1836–51, the [[British monarchy|British crown]] [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] decided to set up the geological survey to explore the [[British Indian Empire]] under the British geologist [[David Hiram Williams|David Williams]] who later founded the [[Geological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0007/bsb00079409/images/ copy in Bavarian State Library (also Horizontal and Vertical Sections)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of Pakistan from the [[British Indian Empire]], the [[Geological Survey of India]]'s north-west branch, staff and assets were evolved into creating to Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP).&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Richard J. Ward|title=The challenge of development : theory and practice in human resource management|year=2008|publisher=AldineTransaction|location=Piscataway, N.J.|isbn=978-0202362267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQypxEfL8XEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=geological+survey+of+pakistan+1947#v=onepage&amp;q=geological%20survey%20of%20pakistan%201947&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the GSP had consisted of only six geologist and two [[chemist]]s under British scientist H.L. Crookshank, who was at that time was the most senior scientist working.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; Immediately, H.L. Crookshank was appointed first director general of GSP which he remained until 1955. Under Crookshank, the technical staff was increased to 30 geoscientists in 1948.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In its formative years, the GSP did the pioneering work in hydrogeology and [[Engineering geology|engineering]] but the efforts were transfer to engineering units of the [[Pakistan Military|military]].&lt;ref name="archives of the GSP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff editor |title=Historical perspective |url=http://gsp.gov.pk/about/historical_prespective.html |work=Govt.

Due to these activities, it increased the operational, scientific capabilities, and expansion of facilities of the GSP by 1956; it became one of the pioneering scientific institution of the government.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In 1955, English geologist, E.R. Gee, took over the GSP who initiated a massive expansion programme for GSP, including engineering, photogeology sections, as well as systematic publications journals were established. In 1959, the construction of new headquarters in [[Quetta]] was completed with Dr. N.M. Khan becoming first native GSP's director.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

By 1956, the GSP worked extremely close with the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS); the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] established multimillion-dollar work laboratories and facilities in all over the country and cooperation continued until 1970.&lt;ref name="Department of Interior, Department of State and Geological Survey of Pakistan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calkins|first=James A.|author2=S.

H. Nayyar|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the GSP helped established country's [[Universities in Pakistan|universities]] to teach geoscience and engineering as part of their university programmes.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

In the 1970s, due to its expansion and scientific capabilities, the GSP was instrumental in carrying out work on nuclear geography, when its scientists frequently visited in various [[Mountain ranges of Pakistan|mountain ranges]] of the country.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; The GSP notably carried out an ingenious work on nuclear geology and geography as part of the clandestine [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic bomb project]], and played an integral role in the selection of the test sites.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saleh|first=R.

In 1992, The GSP announced the discovery of the [[Thar coalfield|huge deposits]] of [[coal]] at [[Thar Desert]] in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="Embassy of Pakistan, Washington D.C."&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=editor and writers|title=Thar Coal Power Generation|url=http://www.embassyofpakistanusa.org/forms/Thar%20Coal%20Power%20Generation.pdf|work=Govt of Pakistan|publisher=Embassy of Pakistan, Washington D.C.|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GSP sponsored and published various studies on the geology of Thar Desert.&lt;ref name="GSP, Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Discovery Of Ignite Coal In Thar Desert|url=http://www.gsp.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30:thar-coal&amp;catid=1:data|work=Govt.

In the 2000s, the GSP gained international and public prominence when its scientists discovered and unearthed the first ever dinosaur fossils in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The remains were thought to be around  ~70 million years old and were found by geologists mapping the Barkhan district of the country's arid Balochistan province.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The specimens include legs and vertebrae.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=First dinosaur find in Pakistan|newspaper=BBC Pakistan|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the GSP submitted another report that recommended the potentially hazardous areas of [[Northern Pakistan]] where the earthquake and seismic activities were suspected. The survey also found out that the earthquake cracks were found in all over the [[Atta Abad lake]] region. The GSP declared the eastern part of the [[Atta Abad lake|Atta Abad]] as "High Hazard" area, and recommendations were submitted to evacuate the area.&lt;ref name="GSP Pakistan, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Causative Mechanisms of Hunza Valley|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/Documents/Hunza_Landslide_Report/Report%20of%20Geological%20Survey%20of%20Pakistan%20in%20Pre%20disaster%20period%20of%20Hunza%20Attabad%20Landslide.pdf|publisher=GSP Pakistan, 2009|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guild of Romanists''' or '''Confrérie van romanisten''' was a society which was active in [[Antwerp]] from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and [[artist]]s of Antwerp who had visited [[Rome]] and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.&lt;ref name=lux&gt;Rengenier C. Rittersma, ''Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present'', Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] under the patronage of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul).  It was a condition of membership to have visited [[Rome]].  The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.

The membership included [[Canon (priest)|canons]], prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists.  Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. 
[[File:Rubens apostel paulus grt.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul by Rubens]]

After 1680 the Confrérie went into decline.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades.  It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal.  The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]].

A Magistrate Book (1576), the "LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen, Sint-Joriskerk – De broederschappen actief in de kerk
Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.&lt;ref name=Tim&gt;Bert Timmermans. ''Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld'', Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar social mediation role was played by the [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] and in particular the [[Violieren]], which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]].   Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.

The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food.  The dinner was hosted at different locations.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The Confrérie further allowed "'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé (ed), ''Rubens, A Master in the Making'', The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, {{ISBN|1-85709-326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3455">[[Image:Dew on a Equisetum fluviatile Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Guttation on ''[[Equisetum]]'']]
'''Guttation''' is the exudation of drops of [[xylem]] sap on the tips or edges of leaves of some [[vascular plant]]s, such as [[grass]]es. Guttation is not to be confused with [[dew]], which condenses from the atmosphere onto the plant surface.

== Process ==
[[File:Guttation.jpg|thumb|Guttation]]
[[Image:Guttation ne.jpg|thumb|Guttation on a [[strawberry]] leaf]]
[[Image:Guttation 088 cropped.jpg|thumb|Guttation on a [[prayer plant]]]]
At night, [[transpiration]] usually does not occur, because most plants have their [[stoma]]ta closed. When there is a high [[soil moisture]] level, water will enter plant roots, because the [[water potential]] of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant, creating a slight [[root pressure]]. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special [[leaf]] tip or edge structures, [[hydathode]]s or water glands, forming drops. [[Root pressure]] provides the impetus for this flow, rather than [[transpirational pull]]. Guttation is most noticeable when transpiration is suppressed and the relative humidity is high, such as during the night.

== Chemical content ==
Guttation fluid may contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds, mainly sugars, and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Goatley | first = James L. |author2=Lewis, Ralph W.  | title = Composition of Guttation Fluid from Rye, Wheat, and Barley Seedlings  | journal = Plant Physiology  | volume = 41  | issue =  3 | pages = 373–375 | date = March 1966  | doi =   10.1104/pp.41.3.373| id =    | pmid = 16656266 | pmc = 1086351}}&lt;/ref&gt; On drying, a white crust remains on the leaf surface.

Girolami et al. (2005) found that guttation drops from corn plants germinated from neonicotinoid-coated seeds could contain amounts of insecticide consistently higher than 10&amp;nbsp;mg/l, and up to 200&amp;nbsp;mg/l for the [[neonicotinoid]] [[imidacloprid]]. Concentrations this high are near those of active ingredients applied in field sprays for pest control and sometimes even higher. It was found that when bees consume guttation drops collected from plants grown from neonicotinoid-coated seeds, they die within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Girolami, V.; Mazzon L., Squartini A., Mori N., Marzaro M., Di Bernardo A., Greatti M., Giorio C. and A Tapparos  | title = Translocation of Neonicotinoid Insecticides From Coated Seeds to Seedling Guttation Drops: A Novel Way of Intoxication for Bees  | journal = ECOTOXICOLOGY  | volume = 102  | issue =  5 | pages = 1808–1815 | date = 2009  | doi =   | id =    | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon may be a factor in bee deaths and, consequently, [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD).

== Analysis ==
If high levels of nitrogen appear in the fluid, it is a sign of [[fertilizer burn]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. Excess nitrogen must be leached from the soil by addition of large quantities of water. This is the best way to restore [[soil fertility]], but it may result in water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improve-your-garden-soil.com/fertilizer-burn.html Avoiding Fertilizer Burn&lt;!-- Bot generated '''written by kiran''' title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer''' ('''IXPE''') is a future [[space observatory]] with three identical telescopes designed to measure the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of [[X-ray astronomy|cosmic X-rays]].&lt;ref name='NASA News'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-mission-to-study-black-holes-cosmic-x-ray-mysteries NASA Selects Mission to Study Black Holes, Cosmic X-ray Mysteries]. Karen Northon, ''NASA News''. January 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission will study exotic astronomical objects and permit mapping the magnetic fields of [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[magnetar]]s, [[quasar]]s, and [[active galactic nuclei]]. The high-energy [[X-ray]] radiation from these objects' surrounding environment can be polarized – vibrating in a particular direction. Studying the polarization of X-rays reveals the physics of these objects and can provide insights into the high-temperature environments where they are created.&lt;ref name='Foust2017'&gt;[http://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-x-ray-astronomy-mission/ NASA selects X-ray astronomy mission]. Jeff Foust, ''Space News''. January 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The IXPE mission was announced on January 3, 2017.&lt;ref name='NASA News'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-mission-to-study-black-holes-cosmic-x-ray-mysteries NASA Selects Mission to Study Black Holes, Cosmic X-ray Mysteries]. Karen Northon, ''NASA News''. January 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed by NASA's [[Small Explorer program]] (SMEX) and is slated for launch in 2021.&lt;ref name='SPIE 2017'/&gt; The estimated cost of the mission and its two-year operation is $188 million.&lt;ref name='Foust2017'/&gt;  The goal of the IXPE mission is to expand understanding of high-energy [[Astrophysics|astrophysical processes]] and sources, in support of NASA's first science objective in astrophysics: "Discover how the universe works."&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; By obtaining X-ray polarimetry and polarimetric imaging of cosmic sources, IXPE addresses two specific science objectives: to determine the radiation processes and detailed properties of specific cosmic X-ray sources or categories of sources; and to explore general relativistic and quantum effects in extreme environments.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt;&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt;

During IXPE's two-year mission, it will study targets such as [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[pulsar wind nebula]]e, [[magnetar]]s, [[X-ray binary|accreting X-ray binaries]], [[supernova remnant]]s, and the [[Galactic center]].&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'/&gt; 

The spacecraft is being built by [[Ball Aerospace]].&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; The Principal Investigator is [[Martin Weisskopf]] of NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]; he is the chief scientist for [[X-ray astronomy]] at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and project scientist for the [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name='Foust2017'/&gt;

===International collaboration===

The IXPE mission is an international collaboration signed on June 2017.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; The X-ray [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] detectors will be provided by the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI).&lt;ref name='Foust2017'/&gt;  Brian Ramsey is leading the effort to produce the grazing-incidence X-ray mirrors at NASA/MSFC. Other partners include the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Stanford University]], [[McGill University]] in Canada, and MIT ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]).&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt;

==Objectives==

The technical and science objectives include: &lt;ref name=&lt;'IXPE home'&gt; [https://ixpe.msfc.nasa.gov/index.html IXPE: Expanding the X-ray View of the Universe]. NASA. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*improving polarization sensitivity by two orders of magnitude over the X-ray [[polarimeter]] aboard the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|Orbiting Solar Observatory 8]]
*providing simultaneous spectral, spatial, and temporal measurements
*determining the geometry and the emission mechanism of Active Galactic Nuclei and microquasars 
*finding the magnetic field configuration in magnetars and determining the magnitude of the field 
*finding the mechanism for X ray production in pulsars (both isolated and accreting) and the geometry 
*determining how particles are accelerated in [[pulsar wind nebula]]

The space observatory features three identical telescopes designed to measure the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of [[X-ray astronomy|cosmic X-rays]].&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt; The system was invented and developed by Italian scientists and refined over the past 15 years  by the Italian [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]] (INFN).&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'&gt; [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221137971630448X The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)]. Martin C. Weisskopf, Brian Ramsey, Stephen L. O’Dell, et al. ''Results in Physics.'' Volume 6, 2016, Pages 1179-1180. {{doi|10.1016/j.rinp.2016.10.021}} &lt;/ref&gt; 
;Principle
IXPE's payload is a set of three identical imaging X-ray polarimetry systems mounted on a common optical bench and co-aligned with the pointing axis of the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; Each system operates independently for redundancy, and comprises a 4-meter focal length mirror module assembly that focuses X-rays onto a polarization-sensitive imaging [[X-ray astronomy detector|detector]] developed in Italy.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; The focal length is achieved using a deployable boom. 

The Gas Pixel Detectors (GPD) utilize the [[anisotropy]] of the emission direction of [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectrons]] produced by polarized photons to gauge with high sensitivity the polarization state of X-rays interacting in a gaseous medium.&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'/&gt; Position- and energy-dependent polarization maps of such synchrotron-emitting sources will elucidate the magnetic field structure of the X-ray emitting regions. X-ray polarimetric imaging better indicates the magnetic structure in regions of strong electron acceleration. The system is capable to resolve point sources from surrounding [[Emission nebula|nebular emission]] or from adjacent point sources.&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'/&gt;

'''Leader development''' is defined as the "expansion of a person's capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes" (McCauley, Van Veslor, &amp; Rudeman, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2). These roles and processes are ones that aid in setting direction, creating alignment and maintaining commitment in groups of people sharing common work. Most organizational leadership research and educational programs have focused on developing individual-based knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with formal leadership roles ([[human capital]]) of individuals (Day, 2000). Leader development therefore results by investing in human capital.

==Developmental theory==
While there is no specific theory from which leader development derives, [[developmental theory]] taps into two aspects of development: learning and change. Development is a form of change and it is impossible for a leader to develop without change occurring (Day &amp; Zacarro, 2004). Learning is defined as the attainment of a permanent change in a person because of practice or experience, which then drives change and development (Day &amp; Zacarro, 2004). Learning stems from two traditions: a permanent change in behavior following experience based on [[behaviorism]], and a change in or creation of new mental models based on [[Gestalt psychology]]. Behaviorism allows for performance to be used as an indicator of a leader's behavior. In contrast, Gestalt psychology examines the creation of new mental models that arise from experience, which can help a leader develop their intrapersonal competence. Together, behaviorism and Gestalt traditions are thought to be complementary in the fact that development comes from both changing mental models and creating new behaviors (Hogan and Warrenfeltz, 2003).

==Differentiating between leader development and leadership development==
Leader development is described as one aspect of the broader process of [[leadership development]] (McCauley et al., 2010). Leadership development is defined as the expansion of a group's capacity to produce direction, alignment, and commitment (McCauley et al.), in contrast to leader development which is the expansion of a one's ability to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Further distinctions between the two can be made by looking at components of each model. Leader development focuses on developing individual knowledge, skills, and abilities (human capital), whereas leadership development focuses on building networked relationships ([[social capital]]) among individuals in an organization. Leader development keys in on the assumption that effective leadership occurs through the development of individual leaders, whereas leadership development is a function of the social resources that are rooted in relationships (Day, 2000). In leader development, the focus is on intrapersonal skills of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-motivation; leadership development focuses on [[interpersonal]] skills of social awareness and [[social skill]]s (Day, 2000). Day (2000) argues that what most organizations term as leadership development should be more accurately labeled as leader development. Organizations cannot choose one or the other approach, but instead a bridge must be anchored on either side of leader and leadership development for effective development to occur (Kegan, 1994). Therefore, it is important to develop the intrapersonal capabilities to serve as a foundation for interpersonal competence and link both leader and leadership development together.

==Differentiating between leader development and management development==
[[Management development]] and leadership development can often be confused as one. Although they also can overlap, there are key differences between the two that are not to get confused with leader development. Leadership processes allow groups of people to work together, whereas management processes are considered to be position and organization specific (Keys &amp; Wolf, 1988). Management development includes managerial education and training (Latham &amp; Seijts, 1998; Mailick, Stumpf, Grant, Kfir, &amp; Watson, 1998). There is a greater emphasis on gaining specific types of knowledge, skills,and abilities to enhance task performance in management roles (Baldwin &amp; Padgett,1994; Keys &amp; Wolfe, 1988; Wexley &amp; Baldwin, 1986). Also, management development's goal is to apply proven solutions to problems giving it more of a training orientation. Management development focuses more on the formal managerial roles.

==Leader development model==
McCauley, Van Veslor, and Ruderman (2010) explain a two-part model for developing leaders. The first part illustrates three elements that combine to make developmental experiences stronger: assessment, challenge and support. Assessment lets leaders know where they stand in areas of strengths, current performance level, and developmental needs. Challenging experiences are ones that stretch a leader's ability to work outside of their comfort zone, develop new skills and abilities, and provide important opportunities to learn. Support, which comes in the form of bosses, co-workers, friends, family, coaches and [[mentors]], enables leaders to handle the struggle of developing.  
The second part of the leader development model (McCauley et al., 2010) illustrates that the leader development process involves a variety of developmental experiences and the ability to learn from them. These experiences and the ability to learn also affect each other in that a leader with a high ability to learn will search for developmental experiences and through developmental experiences leaders will increase their ability to learn. It is also important to note that the leader development process is rooted in a particular leadership context which includes elements such as age, [[culture]], economic conditions, gender of the population, organizational purpose and mission, and business strategy (McCauley et al.). This environment molds the leader development process. Along with assessment, challenge and support, leadership context are important aspects of the leader development model.

==YGLP==
[[YGLP]] is an international leadership program for [[university]] and [[high school]] students aiming to groom young minds into exemplary leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.timeskuwait.com/Times_Two-Kuwait-cities-selected-to-host-YGLP-Asia-2017-18| title=Two Kuwait cities selected to host YGLP Asia 2017-18 |work=Kuwait Times | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[YGLP]] was developed by Human Science Lab, London, with support from several transnational organizations and foundations. The objective behind creation of [[YGLP]] was to come up with a path-breaking [[leadership]] model that could be used across the globe to create a new generation of leaders who can push the limit of human accomplishments to new frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bfirst.in/news/bengaluru/20445/bengaluru-selected-host-yglp-asia-2017-18| title=Bengaluru selected to host YGLP Asia 2017-18|publisher=Bfirst News Network | access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four-Step Leadership theory formulated under the HSL Leadership Project at Human Science Lab, London, provides the [[scientific]] framework for [[YGLP]]. The theory stipulates that "the leadership achievement of an individual is proportional to the optimal use of four principal components that makes a leader –motivation, planning, energising and executing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/outreach| title=YGLP Leadership Program |publisher=www.humansciencelab.org.uk | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YGLP contains four core modules and one non-core module. Each core module is designed to optimise one of the four [[leadership]] component enumerated in the Four-Step Leadership Principle i.e. motivating, planning, energising and executing.

==Intrapersonal competencies==
There are three types of intrapersonal competencies related to leader development: self-awareness (emotional awareness, self-confidence, and accurate self-image), self-regulation (self-control, trustworthiness, adaptability and personal responsibility), and self-motivation (commitment, initiative, and optimism) (Day, 2000).

===Self-awareness===
In today's changing environment, the two personal capabilities that allow a leader to learn new skills or competencies are '''[[self-awareness]]''' (identity) and adaptability (Briscoe &amp; Hall, 1999; Hall, 1986a, 1986b, 2002). Leader development is personal development and involves the process of becoming more aware of one's self (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness is the extent to which people are conscious of various aspects of their identities and the extent to which their self-perceptions are congruent with the way others perceive them (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness has been referred to as "the first component of emotional intelligence" and discusses how it is "the ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drives, as well as their effects on others" (Goleman, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;95). This is vital for a leader to be able to evaluate themselves to recognize their impact on their thinking and decisions as well as on other individuals.

===Self-regulation===
'''Self-regulation''' has been conceptualized in proposed models by Tsui and Ashford (1994) as well as Wood and Bandura (1989). The models have some differences but agree on a fundamental sequence where individuals (a) regulate their attention and effort around self-set goals or assigned goals, (b) take action to achieve their goals, (c) obtain their goals or their performance strategy, if necessary, to maintain or enhance their progress toward their goals and (e) recommence the cycle. Tsui and Ashford (1994) describe the procedure as setting the goal, behaving, detecting a discrepancy, and lastly reducing any discrepancy. This process is vital in leader development because it can have both internal and external effects. As Sosik, Potosky, and Jung (2002) stated that, "individuals desire congruence between their own and others’ perceptions of their behavior, and, therefore, set and work toward goals to reduce perceptual discrepancies, gain congruence, and improve their effectiveness" (p.&amp;nbsp;212). This is similar to the intrapersonal competence of self-awareness as individuals want their own perception of themselves be congruent with those of others, both outlining importance for leader development.

===Self-motivation===
'''Self-motivation''' involves having higher levels of identification to be motivated to go beyond contracts and exchanges in both their own development and performance (Hall, 2004). 
Together, the capabilities of self-awareness, self-regulation and self-motivation allow for enhanced individual knowledge, trust, and personal power, which can be seen as fundamental to create in a leader (Zand, 1997).

==Modes of development==
Leader development takes place through multiple mechanisms: formal instruction, developmental job assignments, [[360-degree feedback]], [[executive coaching]], and self-directed learning (Boyce, Zaccaro &amp; Wisecarver, 2009; Day, 2000). These mechanisms may occur independently, but are more effective in combination.

===Formal training===
Organizations often offer '''formal training''' programs to their leaders. Traditional styles provide leaders with required knowledge and skills in a particular area by utilizing coursework, practice, "[[overlearning]]" with rehearsals, and feedback (Kozlowski, 1998). This traditional lecture-based classroom training is useful, however, the limitations include the leader's ability to transfer the information from a training environment to a work setting.

===Developmental job assignments===
Following formal training organizations should assign leaders to '''developmental jobs''' that target the newly acquired skills (Zacarro &amp; Banks, 2004). A job that is developmental is one in which leaders  learn, undergo personal change, and gain leadership skills resulting from the roles, responsibilities and tasks involved in that job (McCauley &amp; Brutus, 1998). Developmental job assignments are one of the most effective forms of leader development (Ohlott, 2004). After training a leader should first complete a "stamping-in" assignment". A "stamping-in" assignment is one in which the leader masters the new skills before moving on to a "stretch assignment" (Zacarro &amp; Banks). The "stretch" or developmental assignment challenges the leader's new skills and pushes them out of their comfort zone to operate in a more complex environment involving new elements, problems and dilemmas to resolve (Ohlott, 2004). A truly development assignment doesn’t depend on existing skills, it challenges the leader to understand his or her current limitations and develop new skills (Zaccaro &amp; Banks). These assignments should be given to leaders who do not possess the skills to succeed at the current assignment, but who have the ability to succeed at higher levels (Zaccarro &amp; Banks). Developmental assignments should be accompanied by appropriate feedback that assesses the leader's strengths and weaknesses in order to be successful (Zaccaro &amp; Banks).

===Three hundred and sixty-degree feedback===
'''Three hundred and sixty-degree feedback''' is a necessary component of leader development which allows leaders to maximize learning opportunities from their current assignment. It systematically provides the leader with perceptions of his or her performance from a full circle of viewpoints including subordinates, peers, superiors (Day, 2000), and the leader's own [[self-assessment]] (Zaccaro &amp; Banks, 2004). With many different sources from which to interpret information, the messages may differ and be difficult to interpret. However, when several different sources concur on a similar perspective, whether a strength or weakness, the clarity of the message increases (King &amp; Santana, 2010). For this mechanism to be effective, the leader must accept feedback and be open and willing to make changes. An effective way to facilitate the feedback through open discussion and to help facilitate change is through coaching (Day, 2000).

===Executive coaching===
The goal of '''executive coaching''' focuses on enhancing the leader's effectiveness along with the effectiveness of the team and organization (Frankovelgia &amp; Riddle, 2010). It involves an intense one-on-one relationship designed at learning important lessons through assessment, challenge, and support. Although coaching is sometimes aimed at correcting a fault, it is being used more and more to help already successful leaders move to the next level of increased responsibilities, and new and complex challenges. Coaching must move toward measurable goals that contribute to individual and organizational growth. Day (2000) proposes that leaders should be carefully selected, willing to change, and matched with a compatible coach in order for coaching to be most effective.

===Self-directed learning===
'''Self-directed learning''' is an individual leader's aim in identifying the focus of development, specifying the developmental processes, and identifying the resources (Boyce, Zaccaro, &amp; Wisecarver, 2010). Self-development is the process of not only acquiring new skills but also gaining an understanding of the leader's environment and self through new experiences and activities, such as seeking out mentors or developmental job assignments (Boyce, Zaccaro, &amp; Wisecarver, 2010).

==Application==
The Army has been conducting leader development studies since as early as 1971; studies include a review of education and training for Army officers, and professional development of officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers. In 1987, the Army Chief of Staff directed a comprehensive leader development study to be conducted which produced the Army's  leader development system, a support system to monitor and adapt to the effects of change on Army leader development, and a leader development action plan (U.S. Army, 1994). The U.S. Army Research Institute's (ARI) research topics include training, leader development, and soldier research and development. One area ARI's leadership development program focuses on is ways to provide accelerated development of Army leaders.

'''Lottery competition''' in [[ecology]] is a model for how organisms [[Competition (biology)|compete]].  It was first used to describe competition in coral reef fish.&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter L.|last2=Warner|first2=Robert R.|title=Environmental Variability Promotes Coexistence in Lottery Competitive Systems|journal=The American Naturalist|date=June 1981|volume=117|issue=6|pages=923–943|doi=10.1086/283778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under lottery competition, many offspring compete for a large number of sites (e.g., many [[Juvenile fish|fry]] competing for a few territories, or many seedlings competing for a few [[treefall gap]]s).  Under lottery competition, one individual is chosen randomly to "win" that site (typically becoming an adult soon after), and the "losers" typically die off.  Thus, in an analogy to a lottery or [[raffle]], every individual has an equal chance of winning (like every ticket has an equal chance of being chosen), and therefore more abundant species are proportionately more likely to win (just as an individual who buys more tickets is more likely to win).  Some models&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chesson1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=P.|title=Multispecies Competition in Variable Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=1 June 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–276|doi=10.1006/tpbi.1994.1013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580984710136}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalize this idea by weighting some individuals who are more likely to be chosen (by analogy, this would be like some tickets counting as two tickets instead of one).

Lottery competition has been used to in understanding many key ideas in ecology, including the [[storage effect]] (species coexist because they are affected differently by environmental variation)&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chesson1994" /&gt; and [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]] (species diversity is maintained because species are competitively equivalent, and extinction rates are slow enough to be offset by speciation and dispersal events).&lt;ref name="hubbell2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbell|first1=Stephen P.|title=The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0-691-02129-5|edition=Print on Demand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lusterware''' or '''Lustreware''' (respectively the US and all other English spellings) is a type of [[pottery]] or [[porcelain]] with a [[metal]]lic glaze that gives the effect of [[iridescence]], produced by metallic [[oxide]]s in an [[ceramic glaze|overglaze]] finish, which is given a second firing at a lower temperature in a "[[Muffle furnace|muffle kiln]]", [[redox|reduction]] [[kiln]], which excludes oxygen.

Lustre decoration was first used as a [[glass]]-painting technique.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/l/lustre_painted_bowl.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in [[Fustat]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. 1991. The Islamic Lands and China. In: H. Tait (ed.), Five Thousand Years of Glass. London: British Museum Press, 112-143; p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and [[Coptic Egypt]] during the centuries preceding the rise of [[Islam]].  Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni, S. 2001. Glass from Islamic Lands. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd., p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; although true [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] technology probably began sometime between the 4th and 8th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradell, T., Molera, J., Smith, A.D., Tite, M.S. 2008.

{{Anchor|Islamic lustreware}}
Lustre glazes were applied to pottery in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique later became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], the upper part of the [[mihrab]] is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862 to 863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szNMwUFyjbkC&amp;pg=PA40 Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), ''The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance'', Getty Publications, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en Mihrab of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara mediterranean heritage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184012/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam forbade the use of precious metal dishes and vessels for eating, which had been normal for pre-Islamic elites, and there was therefore a market for elaborate and expensive glass and ceramic equivalents.  The reminiscence of shining metal, especially gold, made lustreware especially attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusterware was produced in quantity in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid dynasty]] in the 10th–12th centuries. While the production of lusterware continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]] through [[Al-Andalus]]. [[Málaga]] was the first centre of [[Hispano-Moresque ware]], before it developed in the region of [[Valencia]], and then to [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Italy]], where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]]. In the 16th century lustred maiolica was a specialty of [[Gubbio]], noted for a rich ruby red, and at [[Deruta]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

After a gap of several centuries in Persian production, it was revived in the [[Safavid]] period from about the 1630s, in a rather different style, typically producing small pieces with designs often in a dark copper colour over a dark blue (cobalt) background. Unlike other Persian wares of the period, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than Chinese-inspired ones, and also do not take their shapes from metalware. Designs featured plant forms and animals, and generally flowed freely over the whole surface, typically taking up over half the surface area.  Production, which was never large, appears to have mostly been from about 1650 to 1750, but with rather inferior wares produced into the 19th century.

==Modern lustreware==
[[File:Clement massier.jpg|thumb|Lustreware vase by Clement [[:fr:Massier]], circa 1900]]
Metallic lustre of another sort produced English lustreware, which imparts to a piece of pottery the appearance of an object of silver, gold or copper. Silver lustre employed the new metal [[platinum]], whose chemical properties were analyzed towards the end of the 18th century, John Hancock of Hanley invented the application of a platinum technique, and "put it in practice at [[Josiah Spode|Mr Spode's manufactory]], for Messrs. Daniels and Brown",&lt;ref&gt;Hancock's memoir, quoted by Ross Taggart, ''The Frank P. and Harriet C. Burnap Collection of English Pottery in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery'', rev. ed. (Kansas City) 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; about 1800. Very dilute amounts of powdered gold or platinum were dissolved in [[aqua regia]]&lt;ref&gt;Aqua regia, a mixture of [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and added to spirits of tar for platinum and a mixture of turpentine, flowers of sulfur and linseed oil for gold.  The mixture was applied to the glazed ware and fired in an enameling kiln, depositing a thin film of platinum or gold.&lt;ref&gt;Technical description from Taggart 1967:168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum produced the appearance of solid silver, and was employed for the middle class in shapes identical to those uses for silver [[tea service]]s, ca. 1810-1840.  Depending on the concentration of gold in the lustring compound and the under slip on which it was applied, a range of colours could be achieved, from pale rose and lavender, to copper and gold. The gold lustre could be painted or stenciled on the ware, or it could be applied in the resist technique, in which the background was solidly lustred, and the design remained in the body color. In the resist technique, similar to [[batik]], the design was painted in glue and size in a glycerin or honey compound, the lustre applied by dipping, and the resist washed off before the piece was fired.

Lustreware became popular in [[Staffordshire pottery]] during the 19th century, where it was also used by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who introduced pink and white lustreware simulating mother o' pearl effects in dishes and bowls cast in the shapes of shells, and silver lustre, introduced at Wedgwood in 1805. In 1810 Peter Warburton of [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] patented a method of [[transfer-printing]] in gold and silver lustre. [[Sunderland Lustreware]] in the [[North East England|North East]] is renowned for its mottled pink lustreware, and lustreware was also produced in [[Leeds, Yorkshire]], where the technique may have been introduced by Thomas Lakin.&lt;ref&gt;Taggart 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedgwood's lusterware made in the 1820s spawned the production of mass quantities of copper and silver lustreware&lt;ref&gt;Silver was produced from platinum salts; fully lustred teasets imitating silver models were introduced in 1823 for middle-class households (L.G.G. Ramsey, ed. ''The Connoisseur New Guide to Antique English Pottery, Porcelain and Glass'' p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales. Cream pitchers with appliqué-detailed spouts and meticulously applied handles were most common, and often featured stylized decorative bands in dark blue, cream yellow, pink, and, most rare, dark green and purple. Raised, multicolored patterns depicting pastoral scenes were also created, and sand was sometimes incorporated into the glaze to add texture. Pitchers were produced in a range of sizes from cream pitchers to large milk pitchers, as well as small coffeepots and teapots. [[Tea set]]s came a bit later, usually featuring creamers, sugar bowls, and slop bowls.

Large pitchers with transfer printed commemorative scenes appear to have arrived around the middle of the 19th century. These were purely decorative and today command high prices because of their historical connections. Delicate lustre imitating [[mother-of-pearl]] was produced by Wedgwood and at [[Belleek Pottery|Belleek]] in the mid-century, derived from  [[bismuth nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;John Fleming and Hugh Honour, ''Dictionary of the Decorative Arts'', 1977, ''s.v.'' "Lustre".&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the impetus of the [[Aesthetic Movement]], [[William de Morgan]] revived lustrewares in a manner drawing from lustred majolica and Hispano-Moresque wares, with fine, bold designs.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 168-170&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, copper lusterware became popular because of its lustrousness. Apparently, as gaslights became available to the rich, the fad was to place groupings of lusterware on mirror platforms to be used as centerpieces for dinner parties. Gaslights accentuated their lustrousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Lydia Fairchild''' is an [[Americans|American]] woman who exhibits [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], in having two distinct populations of DNA among the cells of her body.  She was pregnant with her third child when she and the father of her children, Jamie Townsend, separated. When Fairchild applied for enforcement of child support in 2002, providing [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] of Townsend's paternity was a routine requirement. While the results showed Townsend to be certainly their father, they seemed to rule out her being their mother.

Fairchild stood accused of fraud by either claiming benefits for other people's children, or taking part in a [[surrogacy]] scam, and records of her prior births were put similarly in doubt. Prosecutors called for her two children to be taken away from her.{{dubious|date=September 2017|reason= "pros'r" is a role in a criminal trial. The logically related custody matter is a civil case with different *roles*, for attys, even if the prosecuter who brought the crim case happens  to bring the civil action. (Likelihood of same atty having both roles is ruffly proportional to both pop'n and level of litigousness in that jurisdiction, but even so would not be acting in role of pros'ctor in the custody matter.)}} As time came for her to give birth to her third child, the judge ordered that an observer be present at the birth, ensure that blood samples were immediately taken from both the child and Fairchild, and be available to testify. Two weeks later, DNA tests seemed to indicate that she was also not the mother of that child.

A breakthrough came when a lawyer for the prosecution{{cn|date= September 2017|reason = this might have been involved only in the civil matter, since this editor demonstrated ignorance or neglect of the distinction}} knew of  [[Karen Keegan]], a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] woman in Boston, and suggested the similar possibility to Fairchild's lawyer, Alan Tindell, who then introduced an article in the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'' about Keegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013452|last=Yu|first=Neng|date=16 May 2002|title=Disputed Maternity Leading to Identification of Tetragametic Chimerism|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=346|issue=20|pages=1545–1552|pmid=12015394|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013452|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowlands|first=Letitia|title=When your unborn twin is your children's mother|url=http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|publisher=Essential Baby|accessdate=26 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301211020/http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that Fairchild's case might also be caused by [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]]. As in Keegan's case, DNA samples were taken  from members of the extended family. The DNA of Fairchild's children matched that of Fairchild's mother to the extent expected of a grandmother. They also found that, although the DNA in Fairchild's skin and hair did not match her children's, the DNA from a [[Pap test|cervical smear]] test did match. Fairchild was carrying two different sets of DNA, the defining characteristic of chimerism.&lt;!-- Chimerism is a largely insignificant medical anomoly. A "chimera" is a superstitious fantasy of the ancient, biologically benighted, Greek shitkickers (and even of their wisest shitkicker pre-scientists), making failure to clearly distinguish between the condition and a person exhibiting it a crime against humanity. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8401">'''Machine guarding''' is a  safety feature on or around [[manufacturing]] or other engineering equipment consisting of a shield or device covering hazardous areas of a machine to prevent contact with body parts or to control [[hazards]] like chips  or sparks from exiting the machine. Machine guarding provides a means to protect humans from [[injury]] while working nearby or while operating equipment. It is often the first line of defense to protect operators from injury while working on or around [[industrial machinery]] during normal operations. In the U.S., machine guarding is referred to in [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 1910.212;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9836|title=General requirements for all machines. - 1910.212 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.K., machinery safety is covered mainly by [[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998|PUWER]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2306/contents/made|title=The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Point guarding ==
[[File:Point Guarding.jpg|thumb|Point guarding around gear operation of machine]]
Point guarding refers to guarding of moving parts on a machine that present a hazard to the machine operator or others who may come in contact with the hazard. OSHA 1910.212(a)(2) requires these guards to be “affixed to the machine where possible."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Specifics for the type and construction of the guard are determined by the proximity of the guard to the hazard, and the type of hazard. Point of Operation Guarding refers to guarding the area of the machine where the work is performed. Construction of the machine and the guarding should “prevent the operator from having any part of his/her body in the danger zone during the operating cycle.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/machineguarding/generalrequirements.html#point_of_operation|title=Machine Guarding eTool {{!}} General Requirements|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fixed perimeter guarding ==
[[File:Fixed Perimeter Guarding.jpg|thumb|Fixed perimeter guarding with weld curtains]]
Perimeter or barrier guarding refers to a barrier placed around a work area where an automated piece of equipment-like a robotic arm-performs a function. This type of guarding is generally a wire partition system, but also can take the form of pressure sensitive mats or light curtains. Wire partitions systems used as machine guards must be fixed in place either on the machine or around its perimeter. These guarding systems may be configured with various sizes of wire mesh, solid sheet metal, or clear polycarbonate panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wirecrafters.com/on-the-wire/case-study-polycarbonate-machine-guarding-parker-aerospace/|title=Polycarbonate Machine Guarding – Parker Aerospace [Case Study]|last=Tandy|first=Milt|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these materials depends on the hazard being guarded and the distance between the hazard and the guard. Mesh opening size of the guard depends on the proximity of the guard to the hazard. If the guard is installed close to moving parts, the mesh openings must be smaller than if the guard is installed a greater distance away from the moving parts. Mesh opening sizes for specific distances from the hazard are defined in ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robotics.org/bookstore-prod.cfm?category_id=118&amp;product_id=426|title=ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems- Safety Requirements (revision of ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999)|website=Robotics Online|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid barriers such as sheet metal or clear view polycarbonate can be used to shield the hazard as well as control sparks or liquids. Size of the barrier (height and width) must conform to ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Wire partition guards provide a means of access to the guarded equipment with doors, lift out sections, or other controlled openings.

== Safety devices ==
[[File:Electrical Interlock.jpg|thumb|Electrical interlock mounted on wire mesh machine guarding]]
Electrical interlocks or other devices tied into the equipment’s control circuit are mounted on access points and are configured to stop equipment operations when opened. These access points should also incorporate hardware to comply with the OSHA lockout/tagout regulation 1910.147.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9804|title=The control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout). - 1910.147 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lockout/tagout hardware allows the operator or maintenance person to lock the equipment in the stopped state while performing duties in the hazardous area.

Light curtain systems may be used alone or in conjunction with other guarding systems. The light curtain projects a field or beams of light between two points and, when the field is broken-at any point, the light curtain system interrupts the circuit it is wired into. These can be used in areas where an operator must interact with operating equipment to prevent movement of the equipment while the operator works a hazardous area.
[[File:Pressure Sensitive Mat.jpg|thumb|Pressure sensitive mat for operator of laser cutter]]
Pressure sensitive mats that are wired into the equipment’s control system can be placed in hazardous areas and be set to stop the equipment if stepped on. These devices can be used alone or in conjunction with other guarding devices, usually at operator interaction points.

== Applications ==
[[File:Pallet wrapper.jpg|thumb|Pallet wrapper without guarding]]
Packaging Equipment or pallet wrappers have a moving load and an arm that stretches plastic wrap around the load.  Typically a three sided wire partition guard is placed around the wrapper, and a light curtain controls access to the open side where the wrapper is accessed by a lift truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinesafety.com/physical-machine-guarding-technologies/pallet-case-wrapper-guards/|title=Machine Safety : Pallet and Case Wrapper Guards - Machine Guarding|website=machinesafety.com|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robotic Welding Cell.jpg|thumb|Machine guarding with weld curtains around a robotic weld cell]]
Robotic Welding Cells incorporate wire mesh fixed barriers outfitted with vinyl welding curtains and light curtains or pressure sensitive mats. The welding curtains mounted inside of the fixed barrier control exposure to welding flash, sparks and spatter from the welding operation. While the light curtain or pressure sensitive mats prevent welding operations while the operator is loading/unloading the weld fixtures. 
[[File:In-line Palletizer by OCME S.r.L.jpg|thumb|In-Line palletizer with machine guarding]]
Robotic Material Handling for pallet pack or de-palletizing could use any of the aforementioned guarding systems. Light curtains or pressure sensitive mats around the perimeter of the work area that stop the robot when an operator enters. Wire partition could be used around the work area with an interlocked gate which stops the robot when opened.

This local protest was part of the [[March for Science]], a series of rallies and marches in [[Washington, D.C.]] and over 600 cities across the world on April 22, 2017 ([[Earth Day]]). Portland Science Advocates organized the march in support of science and to protest President [[Donald Trump]]'s plan to cut funding for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Funding for the event, which cost approximately $30,000, was [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]].

Amid rainy weather, thousands of people attended the demonstration, gathering at a rally at [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] before marching 44 blocks of [[downtown Portland]].

[[File:March for Science, PDX, 2017 - 29.jpg|thumb|right|Handmade sign with a variation on "[[Make America Great Again]]"]]

Portland's March for Science was organized by Portland Science Advocates.&lt;ref name=PSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=XS/&gt; The group was composed of people with backgrounds in various disciplines, including Jackie Wirz, an assistant dean at [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]], and a store clerk with a passion for science and writing.&lt;ref name="Campuzano"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campuzano|first1=Eder|title=Portland's March for Science: This one's for the kids|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/04/portland_science_march_earth_day_protest.html|accessdate=April 22, 2017|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=April 22, 2017|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event's steering committee included co-chairs Curt Waltman and Wirz; additionally, Rich Hatfield served as communications committee co-chair and Sumi Malik, a transportation planner for [[CH2M Hill]],&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; served as community outreach co-chair.&lt;ref name="Guest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marching for science that's vital to Oregon's economy, environment and health (Guest opinion)|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/04/marching_for_science_thats_vit.html|accessdate=April 23, 2017|work=The Oregonian|date=April 21, 2017|first1=Curt|last1=Waltman|first2=Jackie|last2=Wirz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Conley was also an organizer.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; The organizers met through the event's Facebook page, which was launched in February 2017, and sought advice from the organizers of the [[Women's March on Portland]], which was held in January 2017.&lt;ref name="Humanize"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campuzano|first1=Eder|title=Portland's March for Science: 'We want to humanize scientists'|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/04/portland_march_for_science.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|work=The Oregonian|date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers wanted to support science and protest [[Donald Trump]]'s plan to cut funding for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The event was also to protest Trump's threat to withdraw from the [[Paris Agreement]] and decrease funding for scientific research and [[K–12]] science programs,&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt;&lt;ref name="KUOW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Looming Budget Cuts Put Scientists In Limbo|url=http://kuow.org/post/looming-budget-cuts-put-scientists-limbo|publisher=[[KUOW-FM]]|accessdate=April 23, 2017|date=April 21, 2017|location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other policies.&lt;ref name="Oregonian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/04/traffic_delays_portland_march_for_science_earth_day.html|accessdate=April 22, 2017|work=The Oregonian|date=April 21, 2017|first=Eder|last=Campuzano|title=Prepare for traffic, delays downtown during Portland's March for Science on Saturday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the march, Waltman and Wirz wrote a guest column in ''[[The Oregonian]]'', where they noted Oregon's achievements in science, and encouraged people to "stand up for science".&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt; They said, "We stand in support of scientific inquiry, researchers, availability of data and evidence-based policy", and invited people who "love" science to participate.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;

===Preparation and planning===

Funding for the event, which cost approximately $30,000, was crowdsourced. Obtaining a permit to host the event at the park cost $3,000.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; Monetary donations were accepted, and merchandise sales also funded the demonstrations. Funds were transferred through the [[Xerces Society]].&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; Portland Science Advocates was established as a nonprofit organization for members to continue the demonstration's mission after the march.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt;

Prior to the march, organizers surveyed [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] and posted flyers about the event in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; They emphasized that all people were invited to participate, not just scientists,&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guide to Portland's March for Science Saturday, expected to be thousands strong |url=http://katu.com/news/local/guide-portland-march-for-science-downtown-speaker-size-number-signs |accessdate=April 22, 2017 |publisher=[[KATU]] |date=April 21, 2017 |location=Portland, Oregon |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621060237/http://katu.com/news/local/guide-portland-march-for-science-downtown-speaker-size-number-signs |archivedate=June 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and anticipated participation by approximately 10,000 demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Vespa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vespa|first1=Maggie|title=Thousands March for Science in Portland|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/politics/thousands-march-for-science-in-portland/433419583|accessdate=April 23, 2017|publisher=[[KGW]]|date=April 22, 2017|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; Nearly 7,000 had committed to attending the event on its [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas |first1=Keaton |title=Thousands take to the streets of downtown Portland for Earth Day 'March for Science' |url=http://katu.com/news/local/thousands-expected-in-downtown-portland-for-earth-day-march-for-science |accessdate=April 22, 2017 |publisher=KATU |date=April 22, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426085522/http://katu.com/news/local/thousands-expected-in-downtown-portland-for-earth-day-march-for-science |archivedate=April 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers planned to use drones to help estimate the crowd size.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt;

Blumenauer referred to the Trump administration in his speech, saying, "We have failed in the political process because they've made science partisan.

The Audubon Society of Portland organized a sign making party on April 20.&lt;ref name=ASP/&gt;

==Commentary and documentation==
Leading up to the event, ''[[The Portland Mercury]]''{{'s}} Erik Henriksen encouraged readers to join the march, writing: "Trump's hostility to science isn't just an attack on humankind's accumulated knowledge—it's an attack on all of us, and its repercussions will affect everyone on Earth, every day, for the rest of our lives. Time to fight back."&lt;ref name=Henriksen/&gt; [[KOIN]] said organizers portrayed the demonstration as "political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks, including proposed U.S. government budget cuts under President Donald Trump".&lt;ref name=KOIN/&gt; Similarly, Maggie Vespa of [[KGW]] said, "Although organizers trumpeted the event's 'nonpartisan' platform, participants in Portland were quick to take aim at President Trump's proposed funding cuts to scientific research agencies."&lt;ref name=Vespa/&gt;

[[File:March For Science PDX (34209711036).jpg|thumb|left|Demonstrators]]

Following the event, ''The Oregonian''{{'s}} Eder Campuzano noted, "unlike so many similar demonstrations — such as January's Women's March, the [[Tax March|Tax Day March]] or several other downtown protests — this one skewed younger".&lt;ref name=Campuzano/&gt; Furthermore, he said of the event's [[family-friendly]] atmosphere: "Demonstrators turned out in droves with their children in tow, a fact many parents attributed to the fact that event organizers had provided a kids' zone near the Battleship Oregon Memorial with educational booths and live music nearby."&lt;ref name=Campuzano/&gt; Lyndsey Hewitt of the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'' noted, "The March for Science's crowd was somewhat calmer than the Women's March, which was an audience electrified, fresh off the heels of President Donald Trump's inauguration... The March for Science, however — announced not long after the Women's March — had a much more focused group of protestors."&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt;

One demonstrator, immuno-oncologist and filmmaker Tyler Hulett, documented the march and created the 8-mintute film, ''A Scientist Documents the March for Science''. The film features people "whose lives and careers intersect with science and research", including a woman who believes funding for her cancer research work is being threatened, a couple who is worried about reduced Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding, and a woman concerned about Portland's unfluoridated water.&lt;ref name="MacMurdo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacMurdo |first1=Walker |title=Watch a Short Documentary About the Portland March for Science Made by Local Scientist |url=http://www.wweek.com/arts/movies/2017/04/25/watch-a-short-documentary-about-the-portland-march-for-science-made-by-a-portland-scientist/ |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |work=Willamette Week |date=April 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426154552/http://www.wweek.com/arts/movies/2017/04/25/watch-a-short-documentary-about-the-portland-march-for-science-made-by-a-portland-scientist/ |archivedate=April 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulett wanted to raise awareness about the people involved in scientific research, and said his goal was to "show that many of Portland's doctors and scientists are concerned about the lack of critical thinking coming from both sides of the political aisle".&lt;ref name=MacMurdo/&gt;

The type of marine animal vary greatly, for example, sponges, sea squirts, corals, worms, and algae all host a variety of unique symbionts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Zhiyong|title=Advances in Marine Microbial Symbionts in the China Sea and Related Pharmaceutical Metabolites|journal=Marine Drugs|date=2009|volume=7|issue=2|pages=113–129|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/7/2/113/htm|accessdate=1 June 2015|doi=10.3390/md7020113|pmid=19597576|pmc=2707038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each symbiotic relationship displays a unique ecological niche, which in turn can lead to entirely new species of host species and symbiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Colleen|title=Microbial Symbiosis: Patterns of Diversity in the Marine Environment|journal=Integr Comp Biol Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=1994|volume=34|issue=1|pages=79–89|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/79.full.pdf+html|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly interesting that it took so long to discover the marine microbial symbiosis because nearly every surface submerged in the oceans becomes covered with [[biofilm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Evelyn|last2=Yan|first2=Liming|last3=Boyd|first3=Kenneth|last4=Phillip|first4=Wright|last5=Burgess|first5=J|title=The symbiotic role of marine microbes on living surfaces|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=2001|volume=461|issue=1–3|pages=37–40|doi=10.1023/A:1012756913566}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a large number of living organisms. Many marine organisms display symbiotic relationships with microbes. [[Epibiotic]] bacteria have been found to live on crustacean larvae and protect them from fungal infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Evelyn|last2=Yan|first2=Liming|last3=Boyd|first3=Kenneth|last4=Phillip|first4=Wright|last5=Burgess|first5=J|title=The symbiotic role of marine microbes on living surfaces|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=2001|volume=461|issue=1–3|pages=37–40|doi=10.1023/A:1012756913566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other microbes in deep-sea vents have been found to prevent the settlement of barnacles and tunicate larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Evelyn|last2=Yan|first2=Liming|last3=Boyd|first3=Kenneth|last4=Phillip|first4=Wright|last5=Burgess|first5=J|title=The symbiotic role of marine microbes on living surfaces|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=2001|volume=461|issue=1–3|pages=37–40|doi=10.1023/A:1012756913566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable display of marine symbiotic relationship would be coral. Coral reefs are home to a variety of [[dinoflagellate]] symbiont,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Andrew|title=Flexibility and Specificity in Coral-Algal Symbiosis: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=200|volume=34|pages=661–689|jstor=30033790|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt; these symbionts give coral its bright coloring and are vital for the survival of the reef. The symbionts provide the coral with food in exchange for protection. If the waters warm or become too acidic, the symbionts are expelled, the [[Coral bleaching|coral bleaches]] and if conditions persist the coral will die. This in turn leads to the collapse of the entire reef ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Andrew|title=Flexibility and Specificity in Coral-Algal Symbiosis: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=200|volume=34|pages=661–689|jstor=30033790|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine invertebrates are the hosts of a wide spectrum of bioactive metabolites, which have vast potential as drugs and research tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haygood|first1=Margo|last2=Schmidt|first2=Eric|last3=Davidson|first3=Seana|last4=Faulkner|first4=John|title=Microbial Symbionts of Marine Invertebrates: Opportunities for Microbial Biotechnology|journal=J.

The '''modius''' is a type of flat-topped cylindrical headdress or crown found in [[ancient Egyptian art]] and art of the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The name was given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a [[ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of dry measure]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lynn Sebesta and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 245; Irene Bald Romano, ''Classical Sculpture: Catalogue of the Cypriot, Greek, And Roman Stone Sculpture in the University Of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably does represent a grain-measure, and symbolized powers over fecundity in those wearing it.

The modius is worn by certain deities, including [[Mut]],&lt;ref&gt;Betsy M. Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen from the Reign of Amenhotep III," in ''Servant of Mut: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Fazzini'' (Brill, 2007), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian deities]] and their Roman counterparts, the [[Artemis of Ephesus|Ephesian Artemis]] and certain other forms of the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Didyma: Apollo's Oracle, Cult, and Companions'' pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecate]], and [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture: The Styles of ca. 331–200 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On some deities it represents fruitfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, ''Didyma'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be a form mostly restricted to supernatural beings in art, and by rarely worn in real life, with two probable exceptions.  A tall modius is part of the complex headdress used for portraits of Egyptian queens, ornamented variously with symbols, vegetative motifs, and the [[uraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen," p 36ff.; Paul Edmund Stanwick, ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings As Egyptian Pharaohs'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), p. 35 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the distinctive headdress of [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, ''Classical Sculpture,'' p. 294; Lucinda Dirven, ''The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria'' (Brill, 1999), pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entrance of Institute of nuclear and particle physics NCSR Demokritos.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Entrance of Institute of nuclear and particle physics NCSR Demokritos]]
The '''National Centre of Scientific Research "Demokritos"''' ('''NRCPS'''; {{lang-el|Εθνικό Κέντρο Έρευνας Φυσικών Επιστημών (Ε.Κ.Ε.Φ.Ε.) "Δημόκριτος"}}) is a research center in [[Greece]], employing over 1,000 researchers, engineers, technicians and administrative personnel. It focuses on several fields of natural sciences and engineering and hosts laboratory facilities.

The facilities cover approximately {{convert|150|acres|abbr=off}} of land at [[Aghia Paraskevi]], ten kilometers from the center of [[Athens]], on the northern side of [[Hymettus]] mountain. The buildings cover an area of approximately 35.000 m{{sup|2}} (8.6 acres).

The Centre started its operation in 1959 as an independent division of the public sector under the name ''Nuclear Research Center "Demokritos"'', named in honour of the Greek philosopher [[Democritus]]. In 1985 it was renamed and given self-governing jurisdiction under the auspices of the General Secretariat of Research and Technology. The original objective of the newly created center was the advancement of nuclear research and technology for peaceful purposes. Today, its activities cover several fields of science and engineering.

The NCSR is a self-administered governmental legal entity, under the supervision of the General Secretariat of Research and Technology of the [[Ministry of Education (Greece)|Ministry of Education]].

==Research Institutes==
[[File:Nuclear accelerator in NCSR Demokritos.jpg|thumb|right|Ion Accelerator
Tandem]]
The research activities of the centre are conducted in eight administratively independent institutes:

*Institute of [[Biology]] 
*Institute of [[Materials Science]] (IMS) 
*Institute of [[Microelectronics]] 
*Institute of [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] and [[Telecommunications]] (IIT)
*Institute of [[Nuclear technology|Nuclear Technology]] - [[Radiation Protection]] (INT-RP) 
*Institute of [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear Physics]] 
*Institute of [[Radioisotopes]] &amp; Radiodiagnostic Products 
*Institute of [[Physical Chemistry]]

The INT-RP at Demokritos operates Greece's only [[nuclear reactor]], a 5 MW research reactor.

==The Environmental Research Laboratory (EREL)==
The EREL is part of the Institute of Nuclear Technology - Radiation Protection (INT-RP) and it is one of the largest scientific research teams in Greece dealing with environmental research. The staff consists of 13 Ph.D. and 5 M.Sc. scientists, 4 Ph.D. students, 1 technician and 1 administrative assistant.

The research and development activities of the EREL include:

*Weather Forecasting 
*Urban [[air quality]] 
*[[Emission inventory|Emissions inventories]]
*Air quality measurement, analysis and predictions 
*[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Air pollutant dispersion modelling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; over terrain of high complexity on local, urban and regional scales.

*Soil remediation

===The DETRACT atmospheric dispersion modeling system===
The DETRACT [[atmospheric dispersion modelling]] system, developed by the EREL, is an integrated set of modules for modelling air pollution dispersion over highly complex terrain.

==The Media Networks Laboratory==
The Laboratory is a part of the “Digital Communications” research programme of the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, NCSR “Demokritos”. It is located in the premises of NCSR in Athens, Greece and employs high-qualified research personnel, specialised in networking and multimedia technologies. The laboratory has been active for more than a decade in a number of national and European research projects, following the reputation of the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunication in the global research communities. In this context, it maintains close collaboration with Greek and international partners, both industrial and academic. The research achievements of the laboratory are reflected in a considerable number of publications in journals and conferences.

The lab pioneered in 2001 by developing the first digital television platform to support fully interactive services in Greece (and one of the first ones in Europe).

'''"New York Mining Disaster 1941"''' is the debut American single by the British pop group the [[Bee Gees]], released on 14 April 1967. It was written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]. Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single "[[Spicks and Specks (song)|Spicks and Specks]]," it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in both the UK and the US. It was produced by [[Ossie Byrne]] with their manager [[Robert Stigwood]] as executive producer. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album, ''[[Bee Gees' 1st]].'' This was the first single with Australian drummer [[Colin Petersen]] as an official member of the band.

==Background and writing==
On 3 January 1967, the Gibb brothers, with their parents and Byrne, set sail from Australia to England on the ship [[Fairsky]], reaching Southampton on 6 February. The brothers performed on board in exchange for passage. Later, the Gibb brothers auditioned for Stigwood; they passed, and they signed to [[RSO Records|Robert Stigwood Organisation]] on 24 February. "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was their first song that was written in 1967.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

The first recording session of the Bee Gees after returning to England was a second version of "[[Town of Tuxley Toymaker, Part 1]]," a song recorded by [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]], but was first recorded by Jon Blanchfield in Australia. Kramer's version was recorded on 4 March 1967 in [[IBC Studios]], London, with the Gibb brothers on background vocals.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

Barry and Robin Gibb wrote the song while sitting on a darkened staircase at [[Polydor Records]] following a power cut. The echo of the passing lift inspired them to imagine that they were trapped in a mine.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7494 |title=New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Songfacts) |publisher=Songfacts |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song recounts the story of a miner trapped in a cave-in. He is sharing a photo of his wife with a colleague ("Mr. Jones") while they hopelessly wait to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/new-york-mining-disaster-1941-mt0030257568 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 |last=Elias |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the liner notes for their box-set ''[[Tales from the Brothers Gibb]]'' (1990), this song was inspired by the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster|Aberfan mining disaster]] in [[Wales]]. According to Robin, there actually had also been a mining disaster in New York in 1939, but not in 1941.&lt;ref name="also"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-4.html |title=History Part 4 - The story about the Bee Gees |last=Adriaensen |first=Marion |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second and third verses, the lyrical lines get slower and slower, as if to indicate that life is about to end for the miners. On the second chorus, the drums get louder. On the second verse, when Robin sings the line "I keep straining my ears to hear a sound," a violin was featured in response on Robin's line.

==Recording and composition==
[[File:NYMiningdisaster68sheet.png|thumb|left|1967 sheet music cover, Abigail Music, Ltd., London. "Recorded by the Bee Gees on Polydor".]]
On 7 March, the Bee Gees recorded "New York Mining Disaster 1941" in six takes, along with three other songs: "[[I Can't See Nobody]]," "Red Chair, Fade Away," and "Turn of the Century." The orchestra and some other parts were added on 13 March.&lt;ref name="own"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/67.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1967 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was done first, and it may have already been nominated as the first single on the strength of the Polydor demo.&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

The song begins in the chord of A minor; as Maurice explained: "There's a lot of weird sounds on this song like the Jew's harp, the string quartet, and of course the special way that Barry plays that guitar chord. Because of his tuning when he plays the minor at the beginning of the song which is different from a conventional A minor, it's a nice mixture when I play my conventional tuning together with Barry's tuning because his [[Open D tuning|open D]] and mine are different." Barry said, "It's Hawaiian tuning, there they play the same way I do. I got a guitar for my ninth birthday and the guy who lived across the road from us just came back from Hawaii and he was the one who taught me that tuning, that's how it started and I never changed."&lt;ref name="also"/&gt;

Robin Gibb took both leading and backing vocals, singing the high harmony while Barry sang the low harmony on the first and second verse:

[[Maurice Gibb]] recalled in a June 2001 interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine: "The opening chord doesn't sound like a conventional A minor. Barry was using the open D tuning he'd been taught when he was nine, and I was playing it in conventional tuning. It gives an unusual blend. People went crazy trying to figure out why they couldn't copy it."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

Robin Gibb recalled to ''The Mail on Sunday'' on November 1, 2009: "We recorded this at London's IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. The result was a very lonely sound."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
At the time, rumours circulated that the Bee Gees were [[The Beatles]] recording under a pseudonym (the Bee Gees' name was alleged to be code for "Beatles Group"), in part because the record referenced NEMS Enterprises ([[Brian Epstein]]'s management agency, which had just been joined by Bee Gees' manager [[Robert Stigwood]]). The song is unusual in that the lyrics do not contain the song's title, though the originally planned title, "Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones," does appear in the chorus.&lt;ref name=pc49&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming!

[[Atco Records|Atco]] distributed promos with a blank label and the suggestion that it was an English group whose name started with B. Many [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s thought it was a new Beatles song and played the song heavily. Atco also retitled the song "New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones?)" to make sure people could find it in the shops.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |title=The Bee Gees on British Invasion Bands |publisher=British Invasion |accessdate=14 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175804/http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles|Beatles]] lead guitarist [[George Harrison]] met Maurice Gibb at a party several years later, and told him that he had bought a copy of "New York Mining Disaster 1941" because he thought it sounded so much like The Beatles. Maurice's response to Harrison was that the resemblance "was unintentional" and Harrison said, "I knew that, I admire your work."&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&amp;pg=PT258&amp;dq=new+york+mining+disaster+1941+they+can+tell+the+beatles&amp;hl=fil&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nuvTULrrGaeiigeQrYCAAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ |title=The Bee Gees - Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |last=Hughes |first=Andrew |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Gibb explained about this song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you sounded like the Beatles and also could write a hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought you sounded like the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles. And that sold you, attracted attention to you. It was good for us because everyone thought it was the Beatles under a different name."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robin Gibb explained about this track:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...all the DJs on radio stations in the US picked it up immediately thinking it was the Beatles, and it was a hit on that basis. It established us in those early years. It helped our following record which was nothing like the Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The success of this song owes a lot more to the perseverance of Robert Stigwood than he has previously been given credit for. "We had quite a hard time at getting the Bee Gees played. We weren't all totally convinced that Stigwood was picking the right song to plug, but at the end of the day, he was a forceful character. All of these guys were... [[Chas Chandler]] (manager of [[Jimi Hendrix]]) was the same, [[Kit Lambert]] (manager of [[The Who]]) was the same. They all argued their case with passion, you know, they lived it, they were like that," conceded [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]'s [[Alan Bates]]. When the ''Disc &amp; Music Echo'' reported "widespread rumours" that this song had been written by [[Lennon-McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], Robin countered with, "Rubbish! We've always written our own songs. I've been writing since I was ten, before Lennon and McCartney were even on stage. People can say what they like. If they don't believe us, they can ask The Beatles."

Bassist Maurice Gibb, though, had previously said that "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was in fact influenced by the Beatles:&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"New York Mining Disaster 1941" was a total rip-off of The Beatles, we were so influenced by them. In fact it started a mystery [in the USA] about us, because they started playing [it] and saying, 'They're this new group from England that begins with a B and finished with an s' so they all said, 'Ah, it's The Beatles, not naming it, they're doing that trick again.' The disc jockey would play it and play it and play it and, 'Guess who it is?' and people would guess, and they wouldn't get the answer. I heard [the idea] came actually from [[Ahmet Ertegun]] and [[Jerry Wexler]]. To us it was an honour, to actually think we were as good as The Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music video and live performances==
On the video, the band only features four members (but [[Vince Melouney]] later joined the band), Barry playing his guitar, Maurice playing his [[Rickenbacker 4001]], Robin Gibb on vocals and drummer [[Colin Petersen]] wears a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps-Qq7ucMA0 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 (1967) |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group found time to record their first BBC session at Playhouse Theatre, Northumberland Avenue, London, with producer Bill Bebb, on which they performed this song, with the songs "In My Own Time," "One Minute Woman," and "Cucumber Castle." When the BBC Light Programme's ''Saturday Club'' presented by Brian Matthew was broadcast on April 22, it was noted that there were "rave reviews from the audition panel."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On the song's promotional clip, the band only feature four members (the three Gibb brothers and drummer [[Colin Petersen]]) The group (Barry, Robin, Maurice, Colin and Vince) made their first British TV appearance on ''Top of the Pops'' performing this song on May 11 and were rather awe-struck at the company they were keeping.&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On 20 May 1967, the group performed this song on ''[[Beat-Club]],'' a German TV program.

The Bee Gees performed this song on 21 July 1967 at the Stockholm Palladium, Stockholm, Sweden., 12 August 1967 at The Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England and Christ the King College at Newport, England on 27 September 1967. Since 1967, the song has been part of every Bee Gees concert, eventually becoming part of their acoustic medley performed during the middle of the concert. It was also performed on the show ''[[Beat-Club]]'' in [[Germany]], on that performance Robin wears a hat and plays [[violin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSLDUGKWEc |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 Live in Beat Club |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by the group in 1973 on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' with Barry and Maurice on rhythm guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ5tSc3tqOE |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster - live, 1973 |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The 1969 [[David Bowie]] song "[[Space Oddity]]" owes a debt to the style, arrangement and lyrics of "New York Mining Disaster 1941." Like "New York Mining Disaster 1941," "Space Oddity" is about a trapped man who is doomed to die, and the song is similarly structured as a series of statements addressed to another person. "'Space Oddity' was a Bee Gees type song," Bowie’s colleague John "Hutch" Hutchinson has said. "David knew it, and he said so at the time, the way he sang it, it’s a Bee Gees thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidbowie.com/users/lunamagic/space1.html |title=David Bowie - Space Oddity |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Marc Bolan]] explained: "I remember David playing me 'Space Oddity' in his room and I loved it and he said he needed a sound like the Bee Gees, who were very big then."

[[Paul McCartney]] said: "It was the 'Mining Disaster' song that [Robert Stigwood] played me. I said 'sign them, they're great!' And they went on to be even greater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |title=Bee Gees |publisher=14.brinkster.com |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235737/http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Novelist [[Haruki Murakami]] made "New York Mining Disaster" the title of one of his short stories. The piece was included in his collection "[[Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umrigar |first=Thrity |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/10/01/murakami_pulls_mind_bending_stories_from_the_ruins_of_broken_rules/ |title=Murakami pulls mind-bending stories from the ruins of broken rules - The Boston Globe |website=Boston.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Galactic astronomy ==

In [[galactic astronomy]], '''peculiar motion''' refers to the motion of an object (usually a [[star]]) relative to a Galactic rest frame.

Local objects are often related in terms of [[proper motion]] and [[radial velocity]], which can be combined through [[Vector (spatial)|vector addition]] to produce the object's motion relative to the [[Sun]]. Velocities for local objects are sometimes reported with respect to the [[local standard of rest]] (LSR) — the average local motion of material in the galaxy — instead of the Sun's rest frame. Translating between the LSR and heliocentric rest frames requires the calculation of the Sun's peculiar velocity in the LSR.&lt;ref name=mnras403&gt;

== Cosmology ==

In [[physical cosmology]], '''peculiar velocity''' refers to the components of a [[galaxy]]'s velocity that deviate from the [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]]. According to Hubble's Law, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance from us.

Galaxies are not distributed evenly throughout observable space, but are typically found in groups or [[galaxy cluster|clusters]], where they have a significant [[gravitation|gravitational]] effect on each other. [[velocity dispersion|Velocity dispersions]] of galaxies arising from this gravitational attraction are usually in the hundreds of kilometers per second, but they can rise to over 1000 km/s in rich clusters.&lt;ref name=Girardi93&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This velocity can alter the [[recessional velocity]] that  would be expected from the Hubble flow and effect the observed [[redshift]] of objects via the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. The Doppler redshift due to peculiar velocities is
:&lt;math&gt;1+z_{pec}=\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;z \approx v/c &lt;/math&gt;

for low velocities (small redshifts). This combines with the redshift from the Hubble flow to give the observed redshift&lt;ref name=Davis11/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1+z_{obs} = (1+z_{pec})(1+z_{H}).&lt;/math&gt;

The radial velocity of an object can be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;v_{r} = H_0 d + v_{pec}&lt;/math&gt;

with contributions from both the Hubble flow and peculiar velocity terms, where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble constant and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the object.

[[Redshift-space distortions]] can cause the spacial distributions of cosmological objects to appear elongated or flattened out, depending on the cause of the peculiar velocities.&lt;ref name=Kaiser87&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main consequence is that, in determining the distance of a single galaxy, a possible error must be assumed.  This error becomes smaller as distance increases. For example, in surveys of type Ia [[supernova|supernovae]], peculiar velocities have a significant influence on measurements out to redshifts around 0.5, leading to errors of several percent when calculating cosmological parameters.&lt;ref name=Davis11&gt;

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest. With an appendix, containing the modern politico-commercial geography of the several countries of Europe. Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

'''Punk visual art''' is artwork associated with the [[punk subculture]]. It often graces [[punk rock]] [[album cover]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] for punk concerts, [[punk zine]]s and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.

The main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the [[Sex Pistols]]' ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]'' album designed by [[Jamie Reid]]. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.

Los Angeles artist [[Mark Vallen]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Punk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-for-a-change.com/Punk/punka.htm "A visual survey of early Punk Rock Album Covers," Essay by artist, Mark Vallen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In New York City in the mid-1970s, there was much overlap between the punk music and art scenes. In 1978, many of the visual artists who were regulars at [[CBGB]] and other punk-related music venues participated in a large punk art exhibition in Washington, DC.  Among those featured were [[John Holmstrom]] and [[Legs McNeil]] of the fanzine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'',; [[Alan Vega]] (a.k.a. Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]];  photographers [[Marcia Resnick]] and [[Jimmy De Sana]]; tattoo artist Ruth Marten; filmmaker Amos Poe; and artists [[Tom Otterness]] and [[Beth and Scott B]], who were associated with ''X Magazine''.

Also in 1978 in New York City, a related, one-night punk art show featuring films, performances and slide shows included works by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Diego Cortez]].  Other early punk art exhibits included the "Times Square Show" (1980) and "New York New Wave" at PS 1 (1981).  Punk art found an ongoing home on the New York's lower east side with the establishment of [[ABC No Rio]] Gallery in 1980. The punk aesthetic was a dominant strand from 1982 to 1986 in the art galleries of the city's East Village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43483">{{Renormalization and regularization}}

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''renormalization group''' ('''RG''') refers to a mathematical apparatus that allows systematic  investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different [[Scale_(analytical_tool)|scales]]. In [[particle physics]], it reflects the changes in the underlying force laws (codified in a [[quantum field theory]]) as  the ''energy scale'' at which physical processes occur varies, energy/momentum  and resolution distance scales being effectively conjugate under the [[uncertainty principle]] ([[cf.]] [[Compton wavelength]]).

A change in scale is called a [[Scale invariance|scale transformation]].  The renormalization group is intimately related to ''scale invariance'' and ''conformal invariance'', symmetries in which a system appears the same at all scales (so-called [[self-similarity]]).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Note that [[Scale invariance|scale transformations]] are a strict subset of [[Conformal symmetry|conformal transformations]], in general, the latter including additional symmetry generators associated with [[special conformal transformation]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the scale varies, it is as if one is changing the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally be seen to consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may  relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc.  The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable [[coupling constant|couplings]] which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.

For example, in [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), an electron appears to be composed of electrons, positrons (anti-electrons) and photons, as one views it at higher resolution, at very short distances. The electron at such short distances has a slightly different electric charge than does the [[dressed particle|dressed electron]] seen at large distances, and this change, or ''running'', in the value of the electric charge is determined by the renormalization group equation.

==History&lt;!--'History of renormalization group theory' redirects here--&gt;==
The idea of scale transformations and scale invariance is old in physics. Scaling arguments were commonplace for the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]], [[Euclid]] and up to [[Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/scaling.htm "Introduction to Scaling Laws"]&lt;/ref&gt; They became popular again at the end of the 19th century, perhaps the first example being the idea of enhanced [[viscosity]] of [[Osborne Reynolds]], as a way to explain turbulence.

The renormalization group was initially devised in particle physics, but nowadays its applications extend to [[solid-state physics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[physical cosmology]] and even [[nanotechnology]]. An early article&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Stueckelberg|Stueckelberg, E. C. G.]] and [[André Petermann|A. Petermann]] (1953). [https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=hpa-001:1953:26::894 "La renormalisation des constants dans la théorie de quanta", ''Helv. Phys. Acta'' '''26''', 499–520].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] and [[André Petermann]] in 1953 anticipates the idea in [[quantum field theory]]. Stueckelberg and Petermann opened the field conceptually. They noted that [[renormalization]] exhibits a group of transformations which transfer quantities from the bare terms to the counter terms. They introduced a function ''h''(''e'') in [[Quantum electrodynamics| quantum electrodynamics (QED)]], which is now called the [[Beta-function#Quantum electrodynamics|beta function]] (see below).

[[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Francis E. Low]] in 1954 restricted the idea to scale transformations in QED,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gell-Mann |first=M. |authorlink=Murray Gell-Mann |author2=Low, F. E. |authorlink2=Francis E. Low |year=1954 |title=Quantum Electrodynamics at Small Distances | journal=Physical Review |volume=95|issue=5|pages=1300&amp;ndash;1312 | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.1300| bibcode=1954PhRv...95.1300G}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the most physically significant, and focused on asymptotic forms of the photon propagator at high energies.  They determined the variation of the electromagnetic coupling in QED, by appreciating the simplicity of the scaling structure of that theory. They thus discovered that the coupling parameter ''g''(''μ'') at the energy scale ''μ'' is effectively given by the group equation

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;g(\mu)=G^{-1}\left(\left(\frac{\mu}{M}\right)^d G(g(M))\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
for some function ''G'' (unspecified—nowadays called [[Franz Wegner|Wegner]]'s scaling function) and a constant ''d'', in terms of the coupling ''g(M)'' at a reference scale ''M''.

Gell-Mann and Low realized in these results that the effective scale can be ''arbitrarily'' taken as ''μ'', and can vary to define the theory at ''any other scale'':

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;g(\kappa)=G^{-1}\left(\left(\frac{\kappa}{\mu}\right)^d G(g(\mu))\right) = G^{-1}\left(\left(\frac{\kappa}{M}\right)^d G(g(M))\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
The gist of the RG is this group property: as the scale ''μ'' varies, the theory presents a self-similar replica of itself, and ''any scale can be accessed similarly from any other scale'', by group action, a formal transitive conjugacy of couplings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curtright |first=T.

On the basis of this (finite) group equation and its scaling property, Gell-Mann and Low could then focus on infinitesimal transformations, and invented a computational method based on a mathematical flow function {{math|''ψ''(''g'') {{=}} ''G'' ''d''/(∂''G''/∂''g'')}} of the coupling parameter ''g'', which they introduced. Like the function ''h''(''e'') of Stueckelberg and Petermann, their function determines the differential change of the coupling ''g''(''μ'') with respect to a small change in energy scale ''μ'' through a differential equation, the '''renormalization group equation''':

The modern name is also indicated, the [[Beta function (physics)|beta function]], introduced by [[Curtis Callan|C. Callan]] and [[Kurt Symanzik|K. Symanzik]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; Since it is a mere function of ''g'', integration in ''g'' of a perturbative estimate of it permits specification of the renormalization trajectory of the coupling, that is, its variation with energy, effectively the function ''G'' in this perturbative approximation. The renormalization group prediction (cf. Stueckelberg–Petermann and Gell-Mann–Low works) was confirmed 40 years later at the [[LEP]] accelerator experiments: the [[Fine-structure constant|fine structure "constant"]] of QED was measured to be about 1/127 at energies close to 200 GeV, as opposed to the standard low-energy physics value of 1/137. (Early applications to [[quantum electrodynamics]] are discussed in the influential book of [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]] and [[Dmitry Shirkov]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolay Bogolyubov|N.N. Bogoliubov]], [[Dmitry Shirkov|D.V. Shirkov]] (1959): ''The Theory of Quantized Fields''. New York, Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The renormalization group emerges from the [[renormalization]] of the quantum field variables, which normally has to address the problem of ''infinities'' in a quantum field theory (although the RG exists independently of the infinities). This problem of systematically handling the infinities of quantum field theory to obtain finite physical quantities was solved for QED by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]], who received the 1965 Nobel prize for these contributions. They effectively devised the theory of mass and charge renormalization, in which the infinity in the momentum scale is [[Cutoff (physics)|cut off]] by an ultra-large [[Regularization (physics)|regulator]], Λ (which could ultimately be taken to be infinite &amp;mdash; infinities reflect the pileup of contributions from an infinity of degrees of freedom at infinitely high energy scales.). The dependence of physical quantities, such as the electric charge or electron mass, on the scale Λ is hidden, effectively swapped for the longer-distance scales at which the physical quantities are measured, and, as a result, all observable quantities end up being ''finite'' instead, even for an ''infinite'' Λ. Gell-Mann and Low thus realized in these results that, while, infinitesimally, a tiny change in '' g'' is provided by the above RG equation given ψ(''g''), the self-similarity is expressed by the fact that ψ(''g'') depends explicitly ''only upon the parameter(s) of the theory, and not upon the scale'' ''μ''. Consequently, the above renormalization group equation may be solved for (''G'' and thus) ''g''(''μ'').

A deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process, which goes beyond the dilation group of conventional ''renormalizable'' theories, considers  methods where widely different scales of lengths appear simultaneously. It came from [[condensed matter physics]]: [[Leo P. Kadanoff]]'s paper in 1966 proposed the "block-spin" renormalization group.&lt;ref name=Kadanoff&gt;[[Leo Kadanoff|L. P. Kadanoff]] (1966): "Scaling laws for Ising models near &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;", ''Physics'' '''2''', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''blocking idea'' is a way to define the components of the theory at large distances as aggregates of components at shorter distances.

This approach covered the conceptual point and was given full computational substance in the extensive important contributions of [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]]. The power of Wilson's ideas was demonstrated by a constructive iterative renormalization solution of a long-standing problem, the [[Kondo effect|Kondo problem]], in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth G. Wilson|K. G. Wilson]] (1975), "The renormalization group: critical phenomena and the Kondo problem", ''Rev. Mod. Phys.''

Meanwhile, the RG in particle physics had been reformulated in more practical terms by C. G. Callan and K. Symanzik in 1970.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{Cite journal

(Remarkably, quantum mechanics itself can induce mass through the trace anomaly and the running coupling.) Applications of the RG to particle physics exploded in number in the 1970s with the establishment of the [[Standard Model]].

In 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=D.J. Gross |author2=F. Wilczek |year=1973  |title=Ultraviolet behavior of non-abelian gauge theories  |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]  |volume=30 |issue= 26|pages= 1343–1346  |bibcode=1973PhRvL..30.1343G  |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.30.1343 }};   {{cite journal  |author=H.D.

This means that an initial high-energy value of the coupling will eventuate a special value of ''μ'' at which the coupling blows up (diverges). This special value is the [[Strong coupling constant#QCD and asymptotic freedom|scale of the strong interactions]], [[Coupling constant#QCD scale|''μ'' = Λ&lt;sub&gt;QCD&lt;/sub&gt;]] and occurs at about 200 MeV. Conversely, the coupling becomes weak at very high energies ([[asymptotic freedom]]), and the quarks become observable as point-like particles, in [[deep inelastic scattering]], as anticipated by Feynman-Bjorken scaling. QCD was thereby established as the quantum field theory controlling the strong interactions of particles.

Momentum space RG also became a highly developed tool in solid state physics, but its success was hindered by the extensive use of perturbation theory, which prevented the theory from reaching success in strongly correlated systems. In order to study these strongly correlated systems, [[Calculus of variations|variational]] approaches are a better alternative.  

The conformal symmetry is associated with the vanishing of the beta function. This can occur naturally if a coupling constant is attracted, by running, toward a '''fixed point''' at which ''β''(''g'') = 0. In QCD, the fixed point occurs at short distances where ''g'' → 0 and is called a ([[Quantum triviality|trivial]]) [[ultraviolet fixed point]]. For heavy quarks, such as the [[top quark]], it is calculated that the coupling to the mass-giving [[Higgs boson]] runs toward a fixed non-zero (non-trivial) [[infrared fixed point]].

In [[string theory]] conformal invariance of the string world-sheet is a fundamental symmetry: ''β'' = 0 is a requirement. Here, ''β'' is a function of the geometry of the space-time in which the string moves. This determines the space-time dimensionality of the string theory and enforces Einstein's equations of [[general relativity]] on the geometry. The RG is of fundamental importance to string theory and theories of [[grand unification]].

It is also the modern key idea underlying [[critical phenomena]] in condensed matter physics.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal  | last1 = Shankar | first1 = R.  | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.66.129  | title = Renormalization-group approach to interacting fermions  | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics  | volume = 66  | pages = 129  | year = 1994|arxiv = cond-mat/9307009 |bibcode = 1994RvMP...66..129S }}  (For nonsubscribers see [https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9307009, arXiv:cond-mat/9307009].)&lt;/ref&gt;   Indeed, the RG has become one of the most important tools of modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;L.Ts.

==Block spin==
This section introduces pedagogically a picture of RG which may be easiest to grasp: the block spin RG, devised by [[Leo P. Kadanoff]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=Kadanoff/&gt;

Consider a 2{{mvar|D}} solid, a set of atoms in a perfect square array, as depicted in the figure.

[[File:Rgkadanoff.png|180px]]

Assume that atoms interact among themselves only with their nearest neighbours, and that the system is at a given temperature {{mvar|T}}. The strength of their interaction is quantified by a certain [[coupling constant|coupling]] {{mvar|J}}. The physics of the system will be described by a certain formula, say the hamiltonian {{math|''H(T,J)''}}.

Now proceed to divide the solid into '''blocks''' of 2×2 squares; we attempt to describe the system in terms of '''block variables''', i.e., variables which describe the average behavior of the block. Further assume that,  by some lucky coincidence, the physics of block variables is described by a ''formula of the same kind'', but with '''different''' values for {{mvar|T}} and  {{mvar|J}} :  {{math|'' H(T',J')''.}} (This isn't exactly true, in general, but it is often a good first approximation.)

Perhaps, the initial problem was too hard to solve, since there were too many atoms. Now, in the '''renormalized''' problem we have only one fourth of them. But why stop now? Another iteration of the same kind leads to  {{math|''H(T",J")''}}, and only one sixteenth of the atoms. We are increasing the '''observation scale''' with each RG step.

Of course, the best idea is to iterate until there is only one very big block. Since the number of atoms in any real sample of material is very large, this is more or less equivalent to finding the ''long range'' behaviour of the RG transformation which took  {{math|''(T,J) → (T',J')''}} and  {{math|''(T',J')→ (T",J")''}}. Often, when iterated many times, this RG transformation leads to a certain number of '''fixed points'''.

To be more concrete, consider a [[magnetic]] system (e.g., the [[Ising model]]), in which the {{mvar|J}} coupling  denotes the trend of neighbour [[spin (physics)|spin]]s to be parallel. The configuration of the system is the result of  the tradeoff between the ordering {{mvar|J}}  term and the disordering effect of temperature.

For many models of this kind there are three
fixed points: 
#  {{mvar|T}}=0 and  {{mvar|J}} → ∞. This means that, at the largest size, temperature becomes unimportant, i.e., the disordering factor vanishes. Thus, in large scales, the system appears to be ordered. We are in a [[ferromagnetic]] phase.
#  {{mvar|T}} → ∞ and  {{mvar|J}} → 0. Exactly the opposite; here,  temperature dominates, and the system is disordered at large scales.
# A nontrivial point between them,  {{mvar|T}} = {{mvar|T}}&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; and  {{mvar|J}} = {{mvar|J}}&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;. In this point, changing the scale does not change the physics, because the system is in a [[fractal]] state. It corresponds to the [[Curie point|Curie]] [[phase transition]], and is also called a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].

So, if we are given a certain material with given values of  {{mvar|T}} and {{mvar|J}}, all we have to do in order to find out the large-scale behaviour of the system is to iterate the pair until we find the corresponding fixed point.

==Elementary theory&lt;!--'RG flow' redirects here--&gt;==

In more technical terms, let us assume that we have a theory described by a certain function &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of the [[state variables]] &lt;math&gt;\{s_i\}&lt;/math&gt; and a certain set of coupling constants &lt;math&gt;\{J_k\}&lt;/math&gt;. This function may be a [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]], an [[Action (physics)|action]], a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], etc. It must contain the whole description of the physics of the system.

Now we consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables &lt;math&gt;\{s_i\}\to \{\tilde s_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of &lt;math&gt;\tilde s_i&lt;/math&gt; must be lower than the number of &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt;. Now let us try to rewrite the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; function ''only'' in terms of the &lt;math&gt;\tilde s_i&lt;/math&gt;. If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, &lt;math&gt;\{J_k\}\to \{\tilde J_k\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the theory is said to be '''renormalizable'''.

For some reason, most fundamental theories of physics such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[quantum chromodynamics]] and [[Electroweak force|electro-weak]] interaction, but not gravity, are exactly renormalizable. Also, most theories in condensed matter physics are approximately renormalizable, from [[superconductivity]] to fluid turbulence.

The change in the parameters is implemented by a certain beta function: &lt;math&gt;\{\tilde J_k\}=\beta(\{ J_k \})&lt;/math&gt;, which is said to induce a '''renormalization flow''' (or '''RG flow''') on the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;-space. The values of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; under the flow are called '''running couplings'''.

As was stated in the previous section, the most important information in the RG flow are its '''fixed points'''. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points.If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit [[quantum triviality]], possessing what is called a [[Landau pole]], as in quantum electrodynamics.  For a {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; interaction, [[Michael Aizenman]] proved that this theory is indeed trivial, for space-time dimension {{mvar|D}} ≥ 5.&lt;ref name="Aiz81"&gt; {{cite journal  |last=Aizenman|first=M. |authorlink=Michael Aizenman  |year=1981  |title=Proof of the Triviality of ''ϕ{{su|b=d|p=4}}'' Field Theory and Some Mean-Field Features of Ising Models for ''d'' &gt; 4  |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]  |volume=47  |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1 |bibcode=1981PhRvL..47....1A }}&lt;/ref&gt;For {{mvar|D}} = 4, the triviality has yet to be proven rigorously, but [[Quantum triviality|lattice computations]] have provided strong evidence for this.  This fact is important as [[quantum triviality]] can be used to bound or even ''predict'' parameters such as the [[Higgs boson]] mass in [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity#The mass of the Higgs boson|asymptotic safety]] scenarios. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of [[Lattice gauge theory#Quantum triviality|lattice Higgs theories]], but the nature of the quantum field theories associated with these remains an open question.&lt;ref name="TrivPurs"&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[David J E Callaway|D. J. E.

Since the RG transformations in such systems are '''lossy''' (i.e.: the number of variables decreases - see as an example in a different context, [[Lossy data compression]]), there need not be an inverse for a given RG transformation. Thus, in such lossy systems, the renormalization group is, in fact, a [[semigroup]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Relevant &amp; irrelevant operators and universality classes==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Power law]] --&gt;

{{See also|Universality class| Dangerously irrelevant operator|Phase transition#Critical exponents and universality classes|Scale invariance#CFT description}}

Consider a certain observable {{mvar|A}} of a physical system undergoing an RG transformation. The magnitude of the observable as the length scale of the system goes from small to large may be: (a) always increasing, (b) always decreasing or (c) other. In the first case, the observable is said to be a '''relevant''' observable; in the second, '''irrelevant''' and in the third, '''marginal'''.

A relevant observable is needed to describe the macroscopic behaviour of the system; an irrelevant observable is not. Marginal observables
may or may not need  be taken into account. A remarkable broad fact is that ''most observables are irrelevant'', i.e.,  ''the macroscopic physics is dominated by only a few observables in most systems''.    As an example, in microscopic physics, to describe a system consisting of a [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of carbon-12 atoms we need of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]) variables, while to describe it as a macroscopic system (12 grams of carbon-12) we only need a few.

Before Wilson's RG approach, there was an astonishing empirical fact to explain: the coincidence of the [[critical exponents]] (i.e., the exponents of the reduced-temperature dependence of several quantities near a [[second order phase transition]]) in very disparate phenomena, such as magnetic systems, superfluid transition ([[Lambda transition]]), alloy physics, etc. Thus, in general, thermodynamic features of a system near a phase transition ''depend only on a small number of variables'', such as dimensionality and symmetry, but are insensitive to details of the underlying microscopic properties of the system.

This coincidence of critical exponents for ostensibly quite different physical systems is called [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]−−and is now successfully explained by the RG: essentially by showing that the differences  among all such phenomena are, in fact,  traceable to such '''irrelevant observables''', while the relevant observables are shared in common.

Thus, many macroscopic phenomena may be grouped into a small set of '''[[universality class]]es''', specified by the shared sets of relevant observables.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A superb, albeit technical, exposition by [[:de:Jean Zinn-Justin|J. Zinn-Justin]] (2010) is the classic Scholarpedia article [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Critical_Phenomena:_field_theoretical_approach "Critical Phenomena: field theoretical approach"]. For example, for Ising-like systems with a ℤ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry or, more generally, for models with an ''O(N)'' symmetry, the Gaussian (free) fixed point is long-distance stable above space dimension four, marginally stable in dimension four, and unstable below dimension four.  See [[Quantum triviality]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Momentum space==
Renormalization groups, in practice, come in two main "flavours". The Kadanoff picture explained above refers mainly to the so-called '''real-space RG'''.

'''Momentum-space RG''' on the other hand, has a longer history despite its relative subtlety.  It can be used for systems where the degrees of freedom can be cast in terms of the [[Fourier modes]] of a given field. The RG transformation proceeds by ''integrating out'' a certain set of high-momentum (large-wavenumber) modes. Since large wavenumbers are related to short-length scales, the momentum-space RG results in an essentially analogous coarse-graining effect as with real-space RG.

Momentum-space RG is usually performed on a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]] expansion. The validity of such an expansion is predicated upon the actual physics of a system being close to that of a [[free field]] system. In this case, one may calculate observables by summing the leading terms in the expansion. 
This approach has proved  successful for many theories, including most of particle physics, but fails for systems whose physics is very far from any free system, i.e., systems with strong correlations.

As an example of the physical meaning of RG in particle physics,  consider an overview of ''charge renormalization'' in [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). Suppose we have a point positive charge of a certain true (or '''bare''') magnitude. The electromagnetic field around it has a certain energy, and thus may produce some pairs of (e.g.) electrons-positrons, which will be annihilated very quickly. But, in their short life, the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled. Since this happens continuously, these pairs are effectively '''screening''' the charge from abroad. Thus, the measured strength of the charge will depend on how close to our probes it may enter. Hence a ''dependence of a certain coupling constant (here, the electric charge) with distance scale''.

Momentum and length scales are related inversely, according to the  [[de Broglie relation]]: the higher the energy or momentum scale we may reach, the lower the length scale we may probe and resolve. Therefore, the momentum-space RG practitioners sometimes declaim to ''integrate out'' high momenta or high energy from their theories.

==Exact renormalization group equations==
An '''exact renormalization group equation''' ('''ERGE''') is one that takes [[irrelevant]] couplings into account. There  are several formulations.

The '''Wilson ERGE''' is the simplest conceptually,  but is practically impossible to implement. [[Fourier transform]] into [[momentum space]] after [[Wick rotation|Wick rotating]] into [[Euclidean space]]. Insist upon a hard momentum [[Cutoff (physics)|cutoff]], {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''Λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} so that the only degrees of freedom are those with momenta less than {{mvar|Λ}}. The [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] is
:&lt;math&gt;Z=\int_{p^2\leq \Lambda^2} \mathcal{D}\phi \exp\left[-S_\Lambda[\phi]\right].&lt;/math&gt;

For any positive  {{mvar|Λ'}} less than  {{mvar|Λ}}, define {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;Λ'&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (a functional over field configurations  {{mvar|φ}} whose Fourier transform has momentum support within {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''Λ' ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) as
:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(-S_{\Lambda'}[\phi]\right)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{\Lambda'  \leq p \leq \Lambda} \mathcal{D}\phi   \exp\left[-S_\Lambda[\phi]\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously,
:&lt;math&gt;Z=\int_{p^2\leq {\Lambda'}^2}\mathcal{D}\phi \exp\left[-S_{\Lambda'}[\phi]\right].&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this transformation is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. If you compute  {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;Λ′&lt;/sub&gt;''}} from  {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and then compute S&lt;sub&gt;Λ&amp;Prime;&lt;/sub&gt; from S&lt;sub&gt;Λ′&lt;/sub&gt;, this gives you the same Wilsonian action as computing S&lt;sub&gt;Λ&amp;Prime;&lt;/sub&gt; directly from S&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''Polchinski ERGE''' involves a [[smooth function|smooth]] UV [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] [[Cutoff (physics)|cutoff]]. Basically, the idea is an improvement over the Wilson ERGE. Instead of a sharp momentum cutoff, it uses a smooth cutoff. Essentially, we suppress contributions from momenta greater than  {{mvar|Λ}} heavily. The smoothness of the cutoff, however, allows us to derive a functional [[differential equation]] in the cutoff scale  {{mvar|Λ}}. As in Wilson's approach, we have a different action functional for each cutoff energy scale  {{mvar|Λ}}. Each of these actions are supposed to describe exactly the same model which means that their [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition functional]]s have to match exactly.

In other words, (for a real scalar field; generalizations to other fields are obvious),
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\Lambda[J]=\int \mathcal{D}\phi \exp\left(-S_\Lambda[\phi]+J\cdot \phi\right)=\int \mathcal{D}\phi \exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\phi\cdot R_\Lambda \cdot \phi-S_{\text{int}\,\Lambda}[\phi]+J\cdot\phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and Z&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; is really independent of {{mvar|Λ}}! We have used the condensed [[deWitt notation]] here. We have also split the bare action S&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; into a quadratic kinetic part and an interacting part S&lt;sub&gt;int Λ&lt;/sub&gt;. This split most certainly isn't clean. The "interacting" part can very well also contain quadratic kinetic terms. In fact, if there is any [[wave function renormalization]], it most certainly will. This can be somewhat reduced by introducing field rescalings. R&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of the momentum p and the second term in the exponent is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\int \frac{d^dp}{(2\pi)^d}\tilde{\phi}^*(p)R_\Lambda(p)\tilde{\phi}(p)&lt;/math&gt;
when expanded.

When &lt;math&gt;p \ll \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')/''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is essentially 1. When &lt;math&gt;p \gg \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')/''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} becomes very very huge and approaches infinity. {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')/''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is always greater than or equal to 1 and is smooth. Basically, this leaves the fluctuations with momenta less than the cutoff {{mvar|Λ}} unaffected but heavily suppresses contributions from fluctuations with momenta greater than the cutoff. This is obviously a huge improvement over Wilson.

The condition that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\Lambda}Z_\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;
can be satisfied by (but not only by)
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\Lambda}S_{\text{int}\,\Lambda}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\delta S_{\text{int}\,\Lambda}}{\delta \phi}\cdot \left(\frac{d}{d\Lambda}R_\Lambda^{-1}\right)\cdot \frac{\delta S_{\text{int}\,\Lambda}}{\delta \phi}-\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Tr}\left[\frac{\delta^2 S_{\text{int}\,\Lambda}}{\delta \phi\, \delta \phi}\cdot R_\Lambda^{-1}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

[[Jacques Distler]] claimed without proof that this ERGE is not correct [[nonperturbative]]ly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000648.html golem.ph.utexas.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''effective average action ERGE''' involves a smooth IR regulator cutoff. 
The idea is to take all fluctuations right up to an IR scale {{mvar|k}} into account.  The '''effective average action''' will be accurate for fluctuations with momenta larger than {{mvar|k}}. As the parameter {{mvar|k}} is lowered, the effective average action approaches the [[effective action]] which includes all quantum and classical fluctuations. In contrast, for large {{mvar|k}} the effective average action is close to the "bare action". So, the effective average action interpolates between the "bare action" and the [[effective action]].

For a real [[scalar field]], one adds an IR cutoff
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\int \frac{d^dp}{(2\pi)^d} \tilde{\phi}^*(p)R_k(p)\tilde{\phi}(p)&lt;/math&gt;
to the [[action (physics)|action]]  {{mvar|S}}, where R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of both  {{mvar|k}} and  {{mvar|p}} such that for 
&lt;math&gt;p \gg k&lt;/math&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(p) is very tiny and approaches 0 and for &lt;math&gt;p \ll k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_k(p)\gtrsim k^2&lt;/math&gt;. R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is both smooth and nonnegative. Its large value for small momenta leads to a suppression of their contribution to the partition function which is effectively the same thing as neglecting large-scale fluctuations.

One can use the condensed [[deWitt notation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \phi\cdot R_k \cdot \phi&lt;/math&gt;
for this IR regulator.

So,
:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(W_k[J]\right)=Z_k[J]=\int \mathcal{D}\phi \exp\left(-S[\phi]-\frac{1}{2}\phi \cdot R_k \cdot \phi +J\cdot\phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{mvar|J}} is the [[source field]]. The [[Legendre transform]] of W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; ordinarily gives the [[effective action]]. However, the action that we started off with is really S[φ]+1/2 φ⋅R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;⋅φ and so, to get the effective average action, we subtract off 1/2 φ⋅R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;⋅φ. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi[J;k]=\frac{\delta W_k}{\delta J}[J]&lt;/math&gt;
can be inverted to give J&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;[φ] and we define the effective average action Γ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k[\phi]\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \left(-W\left[J_k[\phi]\right]+J_k[\phi]\cdot\phi\right)-\tfrac{1}{2}\phi\cdot R_k\cdot \phi.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dk}\Gamma_k[\phi] &amp;=-\frac{d}{dk}W_k[J_k[\phi]]-\frac{\delta W_k}{\delta J}\cdot\frac{d}{dk}J_k[\phi]+\frac{d}{dk}J_k[\phi]\cdot \phi-\tfrac{1}{2}\phi\cdot \frac{d}{dk}R_k \cdot \phi \\
&amp;=-\frac{d}{dk}W_k[J_k[\phi]]-\tfrac{1}{2}\phi\cdot \frac{d}{dk}R_k \cdot \phi \\
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2}\left\langle\phi \cdot \frac{d}{dk}R_k \cdot \phi\right\rangle_{J_k[\phi];k}-\tfrac{1}{2}\phi\cdot \frac{d}{dk}R_k \cdot \phi \\
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2}\operatorname{Tr}\left[\left(\frac{\delta J_k}{\delta \phi}\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{d}{dk}R_k\right] \\
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2}\operatorname{Tr}\left[\left(\frac{\delta^2 \Gamma_k}{\delta \phi \delta \phi}+R_k\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{d}{dk}R_k\right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dk}\Gamma_k[\phi] =\tfrac{1}{2}\operatorname{Tr}\left[\left(\frac{\delta^2 \Gamma_k}{\delta \phi \delta \phi}+R_k\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{d}{dk}R_k\right]&lt;/math&gt;
is the ERGE which is also known as the [[Christof Wetterich|Wetterich]] equation. As shown by Morris &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Tim R.|title=The Exact renormalization group and approximate solutions|journal=Int. J. Mod. Phys. A|date=1994|volume=9|page=2411}}&lt;/ref&gt; the effective action Γ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is in fact simply related to Polchinski's effective action S&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; via a Legendre transform relation.

As there are infinitely many choices of {{mvar|R}}&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, there are also infinitely many different interpolating ERGEs.
Generalization to other fields like spinorial fields is straightforward.

Although the Polchinski ERGE and the effective average action ERGE look similar, they are based upon very different philosophies. In the effective average action ERGE, the bare action is left unchanged (and the UV cutoff scale—if there is one—is also left unchanged) but the IR contributions to the effective action are suppressed whereas in the Polchinski ERGE, the QFT is fixed once and for all but the "bare action" is varied at different energy scales to reproduce the prespecified model. Polchinski's version is certainly much closer to Wilson's idea in spirit. Note that one uses "bare actions" whereas the other uses effective (average) actions.

The '''Rod and ring symbol''' is a symbol that is depicted on Mesopotamian [[stela]]s, [[cylinder seal]]s and [[relief]]s. It is held by a god or goddess and in most cases is being offered to a king who is standing, often making a sacrifice, or otherwise showing respect. The symbol dates from the [[Sumerian Renaissance]] to the [[Neo-Assyrian Period]], and is commonly explained as a [[wiktionary:coil|coil]] of [[measuring string]] and a [[yardstick]].&lt;ref name="TJ"&gt;Jacobsen, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories are that they are a [[shepherd's crook]] and a [[nose rope]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallo, W.W. 2005. Sumerian history in pictures: a new look at the ‘Stele of the Flying Angels’, in: Y. Sefati et al (eds), ‘An Experienced Scribe who Neglects Nothing’: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Honor of Jacob Klein. Bethesda, MD: CDL Press, 142-62.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the ring is no rope at all.&lt;ref&gt;Van Buren, E.D. 1949. The rod and ring. ArO 17 (2), 434-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the symbol is seen on the [[Code of Hammurabi]] stela. The most elaborate depiction is found on the  [[Ur-Nammu]]-stela, where the winding of the cords has been detailed by the sculptor. This has also been described as a "staff and a chaplet of beads".&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, Anthony Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia'', Rod and Ring, p 156.&lt;/ref&gt; There is discussion whether the Ur-Nammu-stela is showing the same thing.

==Scepter, throne, and ring: Enuma Elish==
The myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent to the nether world describes how the goddess dresses and prepares herself: "She held the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand."&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.4.1 Inana's descent to the nether world] line 25. The Sumerian has: gi-diš-'''nindan''' '''eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' za-gin&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; šu ba-ni-in-du&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; i.e. taken literally the rod would have the length of one ''nindan'' (6 cubit = 5.94m) and the eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  the surveyor's line - would be ten ''nindan'' in length.&lt;/ref&gt;

In tablet IV of the [[Enuma Elish]], the rod and ring symbol is referenced as:
:"They rejoiced, and they did homage unto him, saying, "[[Marduk]] is King!"&lt;br&gt;They bestowed upon him the scepter, and the throne, and the ring.&lt;br&gt;They gave him an invincible weaponry which overwhelmeth the foe."&lt;ref&gt;Enuma Elish, tablet IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols that appear similar==
*The Egyptian [[Shen ring]] has an identical resemblance.
*The Greek goddess [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]] uses a different type of [[investiture]] symbol for the victor in the sporting races, a ''wreath of laurel'', or a wreath of olive branches, but she is depicted with a ring, a rigid circle.
*The [[Faravahar]], the symbol of [[Zoroastrianism]], also holds a ring.
*The Egyptian [[Ankh]] has a vaguely similar form but is used in very different contexts.
*At the 6th century B.C.E. archaeological site of [[Cancho Roano]], located near [[Zalamea de la Serena]], Badajoz, Spain, a large feature in the shape of the rod and ring symbol was modeled into the floor of the innermost chamber of a [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] temple.
*This symbol also bears a resemblance to an ancient rune called a [[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]] or thorn, which means "frost giant" or "giant".

'''Sea Education Association''' (SEA) is a private, nonprofit educational organization. Founded in 1971 by [[Corwith Cramer]], Jr. SEA operates two sailing ships traveling throughout both the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. 

SEA is based on Cape Cod in the oceanographic research community of Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

== History ==

Founded in 1971, the Sea Education Association spent its first years operated from headquarters in [[Boston]] and [[Chicago]], however in 1975, Corwith Cramer had the organization and its sole vessel, the R/V Westward, transferred to its modern-day location in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]].

Over the years, the program would expand greatly, with more ocean semester programs being offered at a time and the expanding of the SEA fleet. Most of these changes can be accredited to Cramer's successor, Rafe Parker, who replaced him in 1982. Some of the program's most significant changes include, the addition of the SSV ''Corwith Cramer'' brigantine in 1987, and the replacement of the R/V ''Westward'' with the SSV ''Robert C. Seamans'' in 2001.

John Bullard took over as President in 2002 and retired in June 2012. During John's term, SEA developed the Stanford@SEA Program and formed additional partnerships with domestic and foreign universities.

Peg Brandon, SEA Semester alumna and former SEA Faculty Captain, took over as SEA's President in 2014.

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989).

The '''University of Turin Department of Law''' is the [[law school]] of the [[University of Turin]].
It is commonly shortened ''UNITO Department of Law''.
It traces its roots to the founding of the University of Turin, and has produced or hosted some of the most outstanding [[jurists]], [[politician|statespeople]] and scholars in Italian and European history.
Among its distinguished [[List of UNITO law people|faculty and alumni]] are leading writers, philosophers and legal scholars.  Nowadays the Department of Law continues the tradition, with particular strengths in the fields of [[private law]], [[EU law]], [[comparative law]] and related fields.

==History of the Department==

[[File:Campus Einaudi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Luigi Einaudi Campus - Department of Law building]]

[[File:Loggiato Università di Torino.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Central administrative building of the [[University of Turin]]]]


The history of the Department of Law can be traced to the establishment of the [[University of Turin]], in 1404, and has followed its developments over the ensuing six centuries.

In autumn 1404, a [[papal bull|bull]] issued by [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], the Avignon Pope, marked the actual birth of a centre of higher learning in Torino, formally ratified in 1412 by the Emperor Sigmund's certification and subsequently, in 1413, by a bull issued by [[antipope John XXIII]], the Pisan Pope, and probably by another issued in 1419 by [[Martin V]], Pope of Rome, and by a series of papal privileges. The new institution, which initially only held courses in [[Civil law (area)|civil]] and [[canon law]], was authorized to confer both the academic "licentia" and "doctoratus" titles which were later to become a single "laurea" (degree) title. It was the Bishop, as Rector of Studies, who proclaimed and conferred the title on the new doctors.

In 1436, ducal licenses established the three core faculties of Theology, Arts and Medicine, as well as Civil and Canon law.  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,  the legal studies increasingly grew, giving the Department a national and international reputation. Notable academics contributed to the growth of the Department. During the years of the [[Italian unification|Resurgence]], when a numerous group of patriots and intellectuals took refuge in the [[Savoy]] capital city, some of Italy's most remarkable names taught at the University and the Department of Law, like the jurist and statesman [[Pasquale Stanislao Mancini]], and the two economics professors [[Antonio Scialoja]] and [[Francesco Ferrara]].

In modern Italian history, the UNITO Department of Law was known for its central role in Italian national unification and cultural progressiveness.  For instance, in 1881, the  Department of Law graduated [[Lidia Poët]], who would become the controversial first female jurist in modern Italy.

In the first half of  20th century some outstanding names in the history of the Department and the university include: [[Luigi Einaudi]], in the field of the financial studies; [[Gaetano Mosca]] in public law; [[Francesco Ruffini]] in [[canon law]] and [[Paolo Greco]] in [[commercial law]]. 
Most recently should be mentioned at least [[Norberto Bobbio]], in legal philosophy; [[Giovanni Conso]], in criminal law; [[Gastone Cottino]] in commercial law; [[Marcello Gallo]], in criminal law; [[Giuseppe Grosso]] in [[Roman law]]; [[Rodolfo Sacco]] in civil and [[comparative law]].
The Department of Law is located in [[Turin]], nearby the fascinating [[Mole Antonelliana]].
It is one of the leading law departments in [[Europe]], with particular strengths in the fields of comparative law and private law. Additionally, the Department of Law has improved its physical facilities (including course offerings in [[Cuneo]] and international exchange programs with a number of the world's leading research universities).  
The Department of Law coordinates the research work of more than 120 law professors in the different areas of law.


==Academics and Degree Programs==
The Department offers a number of degrees, starting with the ''laurea di giurisprudenza'' (equivalent to an [[LL.B.]]), ''laurea specialistica'' or ''laurea magistrale'' (postgraduate law degree, equivalent to an [[LL.M.]]) and several specialized LL.M. programs.
The Department also offers some brief degree courses (three years).  In addition, the Department offers the ''dottorato di ricerca'' or the traditional research [[Ph.D.]] degree.  As a result of the [[Bologna Process]], all of the UNITO Law degrees are fully comparable and transferrable across Europe, and graduates of the law department in fact practice in a number of leading jurisdictions across Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35709">: ''This article is about urban history as a subject. See [[history of the city]] for a chronological description of cities.''
'''Urban history''' is a field of [[history]] that examines the historical nature of [[city|cities]] and [[town]]s, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]], [[business history]], and [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of urbanization focuses on the processes of by which existing populations concentrate themselves in [[Urban area|urban localities]] over time, and on the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of cities. Most urban scholars focus on the "metropolis," a large or especially important city.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Keene, "Ideas of the metropolis," ''Historical Research'' (2011) 84#225 pp 379-398.&lt;/ref&gt; There is much less attention to small cities, towns or (until recently) to suburbs. However social historians find small cities much easier to handle because they can use census data to cover or sample the entire population.  In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many of the most influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888-1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915-2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;  The field grew rapidly after 1970, leading one prominent scholar, [[Stephan Thernstrom]], to note that urban history apparently deals with cities, or with city-dwellers, or with events that transpired in cities, with attitudes toward cities – which makes one wonder what is ''not'' urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L.  Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205 quote p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative studies==
Only a handful of studies attempt a global history of cities, notably [[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Paul Bairoch]], ''Cities and Economic Development, From the Dawn of History to the Present'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural history is its own field, but occasionally overlaps with urban history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Spiro Kostof]], ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The political role of cities in helping state formation—and in staying independent—is the theme of [[Charles Tilly]] and [[W. P. Blockmans]], eds., ''Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, A.D. 1000 to 1800'' (1994).  Comparative elite studies—who was in power—are typified by Luisa Passerini, Dawn Lyon, Enrica Capussotti and Ioanna Laliotou, eds. ''Who Ran the Cities? City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940'' (2008) .&lt;ref&gt;See also Frederic Cople Jaher, ''The Urban Establishment: Upper Strata in Boston, New York, Charleston, Chicago, and Los Angeles'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  Labor activists and socialists often had national or international networks that circulated ideas and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton Stromquist, "'Thinking globally; acting locally': Municipal Labour and Socialist Activism in Comparative Perspective, 1890–1920," ''Labour History Review'' (2009) 74#3 pp 233-256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
{{Main|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Urban history}}
In the 1960s, the historiography of Victorian towns and cities began to flourish in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Gary W. Davies, "The rise of urban history in Britain c. 1960-1978" (PhD dissertation, University of Leicester, 2014) [https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/29036/1/2014daviesgwphd.pdf online, wWillith detailed bibliography pp 205-40]&lt;/ref&gt; Much attention focused first on the Victorian city, with topics ranging from demography, public health, the working-class, and local culture.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Dyos, and Michael Wolff, eds. ''Victorian City: Images and Realities'' (2 vol. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, topics regarding class, capitalism, and social structure gave way to studies of the cultural history of urban life, as well as the study of groups such as women, prostitutes, migrants from rural areas, and immigrants from the Continent and from the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Myers and Ian Grosvenor, "Birmingham Stories: Local Histories of Migration and Settlement and the Practice of History." ''Midland History'' (2011) 36#2 pp 149-162&lt;/ref&gt; The urban environment itself became a major topic, as studies of the material fabric of the city, and the structure of urban space, became more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gunn, "Urbanization" in Chris Williams, ed., ''Eight Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2007) pp 238-252&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have almost always focused on London, but they have also studied small towns and cities from the medieval period, as well as the urbanization that attended the industrial revolution. In the second half of the 19th century, provincial centers such as Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, and Manchester doubled in size, and became regional capitals. They were all conurbations that included smaller cities and suburbs in their [[catchment area]]. Available scholarly materials have become quite comprehensive today.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser,  Peter Clark, and Martin Daunton, eds. ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain'' (3 vol 2000), which reaches down to 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban biography==
Urban biography is the narrative history of a city, and often reaches a general audience. Urban biographies cover the interrelationships among various dimensions, such as politics, demography, business, high culture, popular culture, housing, neighborhoods, and ethnic groups.  It covers [[municipal government]] as well as physical expansion, growth and decline.  Historians often focus on the largest and most dominant city—usually the national capital—which geographers call a "[[primate city]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Nagle|title=Advanced Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cq9uFL07Y6wC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2000|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some representative urban biographies are:
* [[Edwin G. Burrows]] and [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]]. ''Gotham: a history of New York City to 1898'' (2000)
* [[S. G. Checkland]], ''The Upas Tree: Glasgow, 1875-1975'' (1981)
* Geoffrey Cotterell, ''Amsterdam, The Life of a City'' (1972)
* [[Janet Abu-Lughod]], ''Cairo; 1001 Years of City Victorious'' (1971)
* Diane E. Davis, ''Urban Leviathan: Mexico City in the Twentieth Century'' (1994)
* [[Christopher Hibbert]], ''London, the Biography of a City'' (1969)
* [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], ''Barcelona'' (1992)
* [[Colin Jones (historian)|Colin Jones]]. ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (2004)
* Blake McKelvey. ''Rochester'' (4 vol, 1961), [[History of Rochester, New York|Rochester NY]]
* [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem: The Biography'' (2012)
* [[Bessie Louise Pierce]], ''A History of Chicago'' (3 vol 1957), to 1893.
* [[Roy Porter]], ''London: A Social History'' (1998)
* Alexandra Ritchie, ''Faust's Metropolis: A History of Berlin'' (1998)
* James Scobie, ''Buenos Aires: Plaza to Suburb'' (1974)
* Ronald Taylor, ''Berlin and its Culture: A Historical Portrait'' (1997),  considers literature, music, theater, painting, and decorative arts.

Historians have developed typologies of cities, emphasizing their geographic location and economic specialization. In the United States [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] was a pioneer in the historiography.  He emphasized the major port cities on the East Coast, the largest of which were Boston and Philadelphia, each with fewer than 40,000 people at the time of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness: The First Century of Urban Life in America, 1625-1742'' (1938), and ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians have covered the port cities up and down the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast, along with the river ports along the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri rivers. Industrialization began in New England, and several small cities have scholarly histories. The railroad cities of the West, stretching from Chicago to Kansas City to Wichita to Denver have been well treated. Blake McKelvey provides an encyclopedic overview of the functions of major cities in ''The Urbanization of America, 1860-1915'' (1963), and ''The Emergence of Metropolitan America, 1915-1966'' (1968)

==Large scale reference books==
Peter Clark of the Urban History Center of the University of Leicester was the general editor (and Cambridge University Press the publisher) of a massive history of British cities and towns, running 2800 pages in 75 chapters by 90 scholars.  The chapters deal not with biographies of individual cities, but with economic, social or political themes that cities had in common.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. I, 600-1540'' (2000); P. A. Clark, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain vol. II, 1540-1840''; M. J. Daunton, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. III, 1840 1950.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See review by: Albert J. Schmidt, ''Journal of Social History'' (2003) 36#3 pp. 781-784 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790746 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Two highly influential, authoritative and comprehensive compendia of European urban history were also compiled by Barry Haynes of the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University in 1990 and 1991, published by Leicester University. These books made a significant contribution to the bibliographic review of urban history research and literature in both Eastern and Western Europe.

In the United States a very different approach was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has sponsored large historical encyclopedias for many states and several cities, most notably the [[Encyclopedia of Chicago]] (2004; also online edition) and  [[The Encyclopedia of New York City]] (1995, 2nd ed. 2010) They followed the model of an earlier encyclopedia of Cleveland&lt;ref&gt;David D. Van Tassel and , John J. Brabowski, eds., ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and relished the details about neighborhoods, people, organizations and events, without imposing any overall theme.

===Suburbs===
{{main|Suburb}}
A new subgenre is the history of specific suburbs.  Historians have concentrated on specific places, typically focusing on the origins of the suburb in relation to the central city, the pattern of growth, different functions (such as residential or industrial), local politics, as well as racial exclusion and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth McManus and Philip J. Ethington, "Suburbs in transition: new approaches to suburban history," ''Urban History'' (2007) 34#2 pp 317-337&lt;/ref&gt; The main overview is [[Kenneth T.

Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom share the [[American Dream]] of upward social status via home ownership. Sies (2001) argues that it is necessary to examine how "suburb" is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Corbin Sies, "North American Suburbs, 1880-1950," ''Journal of Urban History,'' March 2001, Vol. 27 Issue 3, pp 313-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==New urban history==
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1960s as a branch of [[Social history]] seeking to understand the "city as process" and, through quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites. Much of the attention is devoted to individual behavior, and how the intermingling of classes and ethnic groups operated inside a particular city. Smaller cities are much easier to handle when it comes to tracking a sample of individuals over ten or 20 years.

Common themes include the social and political changes, examinations of class formation, and racial/ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;   A major early study was Stephan Thernstrom's ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, R., 1991. History, geography, and historical geography. Social Science History, 15(2), pp.265-288.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic perspectives make use of the large volume of census data from the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lampard, ''The Urbanizing World,'' in [[H. J. Dyos]] and Michael Wolff, eds., The Victorian City: Images and Realities, vol. 1 (1973), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H. Jackson, Jr.. "Alltagsgeschichte, Social Science History and the Study of Mundane Movements in 19th-Century Germany," ''Historical Social Research'' (1991) 16#1 pp23-47, explains the value of employment records, marriage contracts, vital records and continuous residency registers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being strictly areas of geographical segmentation, spatial patterns and concepts of place reveal the struggles for power of various social groups, including gender, class, race, and ethnic identity&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. The spatial patterns of residential and business areas give individual cities their distinct identities and, considering the social aspects attendant to the patterns, create a more complete picture of how those cities evolved, shaping the lives of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;James Connolly, "Bringing the City Back in: Space and Place in the Urban History of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era," ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' July 2002, Vol. 1 Issue 3, pp 258-278.  The importance of the materiality of specific spaces and places is also treated in Ralph Kingston, "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berg/cash/2010/00000007/00000001/art00006 Mind over Matter? History and the Spatial Turn]," ''Cultural and Social History,'' 2010, Vol. 7, Issue 1, pp. 111–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

New techniques include the use of historical [[Geographic information system|GIS]]  data.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Gordon, "Lost in space, or confessions of an accidental geographer,"''[[International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing]]'' (2011) 5#1 pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western cities==
Since the 1980s extensive research has been done of the cities of the Ottoman Empire, where standardized record keeping and centralized archives have facilitated work on [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]], [[Jericho]], [[Hama]], [[Nablus]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Historians have explored the social bases of political factionalism, histories of elites and commoners, different family structures and gender roles, marginalized groups such as prostitutes and slaves, and relationships between Muslims and Christians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Reilly, "Ottoman Syria: Social History Through an Urban Lens," ''History Compass'' (2012) 10#1 pp 70-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly work is underway on African cities,&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Fourchard, "Between World History and State Formation: New Perspectives On Africa's Cities," ''Journal of African History'' (2011) 52#2 pp 223-248.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Burton, ed., ''Urban History in Africa: The Urban Experience in Eastern Africa c. 1750–2000'' (Nairobi: The British Institute in Eastern Africa, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Sharif Uddin Ahmed, ed., ''Dhaka: Past, Present, Future'' (1991) is Bangladesh history from an urban planning perspective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Heitzman, "Middle Towns to Middle Cities in South Asia, 1800-2007," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2008) 35#1 pp 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China the Maoist ideology privileged the uprising of the peasants as the central force in Chinese history, which led to a neglect of urban history until the 1980s. Academics were then allowed to assert that peasant rebellions were often reactionary rather than revolutionary, and that China's modernizers of the 1870s made significant advances, even if they were capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Buck "The Study of Urban History in the People's Republic of China," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1987), pp 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, "A Conversation with Zhou Lei: Urban History and Development in Beijing (Peking)," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1988) 14#2 pp 254-68&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a century—since [[Heinrich Schliemann]] searched for and found ancient Troy&lt;ref&gt;David A. Traill, ''Schliemann of Troy: Treasure and Deceit'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;—archaeologists and ancient historians have studies the cities of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;See  [[Marc van de Mieroop]] ''The Ancient Mesopotamian City.'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) and John Hyslop, ''Inka Settlement Planning''. (U. of Texas Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images and cultural role==
The study of the culture of specific cities and the role of cities in shaping national culture is a more recent development which provides nontraditional ways of "reading" cities. A representative class is Carl E. Schorske, ''Fin-De-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture'' (1980).  The basis for some of this approach stems from a [[post-modern]] theory including the cultural anthropology of [[Clifford Geertz]]. One example is Alan Mayne's ''The Imagined Slum: Newspaper Representation in Three Cities, 1870-1914''(1993), a study of how slums were represented in the newspapers in [[Sydney]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Birmingham]]. The accounts provided dramatic life stories but failed to integrate the agendas and animosities of city officials, property owners, residents, and local businessmen.  As a result, they did not reveal the true inner-city social structures.  Nevertheless, the middle class accepted the image of and decided to act on the [[social construction]]s, leading to the reformers' demands for [[slum clearance]] and [[urban renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Alan Mayne, "  Representing The Slum," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1990), Vol. 17, pp 66-84&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rosen and Tarr point out, environmental history has made great strides since the 1970s, but its focus is primarily on rural areas, leading to a neglect of urban issues such as air pollution, sewage, clean water—and the concentration of large numbers of horses.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Meisn Rosen, and Joel Arthur Tarr, "The importance of an urban perspective in environmental history," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1994) 20#3 pp 299-310&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians are beginning to integrate urban history and environmental history.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Massard-Guilbaud, and Peter Thorsheim, "Cities, Environments, and European History," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#5 pp 691-701, introduces a special issue with case studies from Austria, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far most of the attention concerns the negative impact on the environment, rather than how the environment shaped the urbanization process.&lt;ref&gt;Lezlie Morinière, "Environmentally Influenced Urbanisation: Footprints Bound for Town?" ''Urban Studies'' (2012) 49#2 pp 435-450, examines 147 studies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and philosophy===
In literature the city has long stood as one of the most potent symbols of human capacities and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schorske, "The Idea of the City in European Thought: Voltaire to Spengler," in ''The Historian and the City'', ed. Oscar Handlin and John Burchard (Harvard U.P., 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest and most enduring creation of human imagination and hands, and as the largest and most sustained site of human association and interaction, the city has been seen as a marker of what humans are and of what they do. This signification has almost always been shaded with ambivalence. In old legends, epics, and utopias, cities (both actual and symbolic) appeared as places of exceptional but also contradictory meaning. The histories of Troy, Babel, Sodom, Babylon, and Rome were viewed, in Western cultures, as standing for human power, wisdom, creativity, and vision, but also for human presumption, perversion, and fated destruction. Images of the modern city restated this ambivalence with fresh intensity. Great modern cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and New York, have repeatedly been portrayed as sites of opportunity and peril, power and helplessness, vitality and decadence, creativity and perplexity. This contradictory face of the city has appeared so often in Western thought as to suggest an essential psychological and cultural anxiety about human civilization, an anxiety about humanity’s relation to their created world and about "humanity" itself. This is especially true of the “modern” city, filled with human artifice and moral contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;See also Lewis Mumford, "Utopia, The City, and The Machine," ''Daedalus'' (Spring 1965): 271-92; Philip Fisher, "City Matters: City Minds," ''The Worlds of Victorian Fiction'', ed. Jerome Buckley (Cambridge, Mass., 1975); Burton Pike, ''The Image of the City in Modern Literature'' (Princeton, 1981), Marshall Berman, ''All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity'' (New York, 1982); David Harvey, ''Consciousness and the Urban Experience: Studies in the History and Theory of Capitalist Urbanization'' (Baltimore, 1985); Judith Walkowitz, ''City of Dreadful Delight: Narratives of Sexual Danger in Late Victorian London'' (Chicago, 1992); Graeme Gilloch, ''Myth and Metropolis: Walter Benjamin and the City'' (Cambridge, Eng., 1996); Peter Fritzsche, ''Reading Berlin 1900'' (Cambridge, Mass., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The [[Journal of Urban History]] has been a leading quarterly journal with articles and reviews since 1975. The Urban History Association was founded in 1988 with 284 members; it now has over 400. It sponsored the "Sixth Biennial Urban History Association Conference" in New York, October 25–28, 2012. It awards prizes for the best book prize, best article, and best PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://uha.udayton.edu/ UHA website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312054102/http://uha.udayton.edu/ |date=2015-03-12 }}; its semiannual [http://uha.udayton.edu/news.html newsletters are online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold James Dyos|H.J. Dyos]]  (1921-1978) at the University of Leicester was the leading promoter of urban history in Britain, leading the way especially into the study of Victorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, ''Exploring the Urban Past: Essays in Urban History'' edited by David Cannadine and David Reeder (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  He formed the Urban History Study Group in 1962; its newsletter became the ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1974-1991) and then the journal ''Urban History'' (1992–present).  His edited volume on ''The Study of Urban History'' (1968) opened up the methodology and stimulated young scholars, as did the conferences he organized and the book series he edited.  Dyos rejected the quantitative methods of the New Urban History because he was not interested in the individual people in the city, but in the larger social structure, such as the slum or the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J. Mandelbaum, "H. J. Dyos and British Urban History," ''The Economic History Review'' (1985)  38#3 pp. 437–447, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2596999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, the daily email discussion list '''H-Urban'''  has enabled historians, graduate students and others interested in urban history and urban studies to communicate current research and research interests easily; to query and discuss new approaches, sources, methods, and tools of analysis; and to comment on contemporary historiography. The logs are open to searches, and membership is free. H-Urban seeks to inform historians on such matters as announcements, calls for papers, conferences, awards, fellowships, availability of new sources and archives, reports on new research, and teaching tools, including books, articles, works-in-progress, research reports, primary historical documents (for example, model ordinances, federal/state/local reports, addresses of city officials), syllabi, bibliographies, software, datasets, and multimedia publications or projects. It commissions its own book reviews. H-Urban has 2,856 subscribers (as of 2012) and is the oldest of the H-Net network of discussion lists.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://langinnovate.msu.edu/~urban/ H-Urban website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Coming Race''''' is a novel by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], published anonymously in 1871. It has also been published as '''''Vril, the Power of the Coming Race'''''.
 
Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean [[master race]] and the energy-form called "Vril", at least in part; some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]], notably [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[William Scott-Elliot]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]], accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–123.&lt;/ref&gt; One 1960 book, ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', suggested that a [[Secret society|secret]] '''Vril Society''' existed in [[Weimar_Republic|Weimar]] [[Berlin]]. However, there is no evidence for the existence of such a society.

==History==
The original, British edition of ''The Coming Race'' was published anonymously in May 1871, by Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref name=newsUK/&gt; (Blackwood published four more "editions" in 1871.)&lt;ref name="editions"/&gt; Anonymous American and Canadian editions were published in August, as ''The Coming Race, or The New Utopia'', by Francis B. Felt &amp; Co. in New York and by Copp, Clark &amp; Co. in Toronto.&lt;ref name=newsUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsCA/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Late in 1871 Bulwer-Lytton was known to be the author.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' was also published anonymously, in March 1872, and Butler suspected that its initial success was due to being taken as a ''Coming Race'' sequel by Bulwer-Lytton. It was revealed that Butler was the writer in the 25 May 1872 issue of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''; as Butler was unknown at the time, sales dropped by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redfield | first = Marc | title = Phantom Formations: Aesthetic Ideology and the Bildungsroman | publisher = Cornell University Press | date = 1996 | page = 170 | isbn = 0-8014-3236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy traveller (the narrator), who visits a friend,  a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city  that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift [[dictionary]] during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function.

The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to [[Telepathy|transmit information]], [[Analgesic|get rid of pain]], and [[Hypnosis|put others to sleep.]] The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.

The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an [[antediluvian]] civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they had fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended housed 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society was a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an "all-permeating fluid" called "Vril", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depended on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gave them access to an extraordinary force that could be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employed to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril included the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular were powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.

Men (called An, pronounced "Arn") and women (called Gy, pronounced "Gee") have equal rights. The women are stronger and larger than the men. The women are also the pursuing party of romantic relationships. They marry for just three years, after which the men choose whether to remain married, or be single. The female may then pursue a new husband. However, they seldom make the choice to remarry.

Their religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.

The narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bulwer Lytton|first1=Edward|title=Vril: The Power of the Coming Race|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Vril:_The_Power_of_the_Coming_Race;_The_New_Utopia|website=wikisource.com|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vril in the novel===

The uses of Vril in the novel amongst the Vril-ya vary from destruction to healing. According to Zee, the daughter of the narrator's host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.

A Vril staff is an object in the shape of a wand or a staff which is used as a channel for Vril. The narrator describes it as hollow with "stops", "keys", or "springs" in which Vril can be altered, modified, or directed to either destroy or heal. The staff is about the size of a walking stick but can be lengthened or shortened according to the user's preferences. The appearance and function of the Vril staff differs according to gender, age, etc. Some staves are more potent for destruction; others, for healing. The staves of children are said to be much simpler than those of sages; in those of wives and mothers, the destructive part is removed while the healing aspects are emphasised.

==Literary significance and reception==

The book was quite popular in the late 19th century, and for a time the word "Vril" came to be associated with "life-giving elixirs".&lt;ref name = "dav"&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Seed | origyear = 1870 | title = The Coming Race | first2 = Sir Edward | last2 = Bulwer‐Lytton | publisher = Wesleyan University Press | date = 2007 | pages = xvii, 159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known use of "Vril" in this context is in the name of [[Bovril]] (a [[blend word]] of Bovine and Vril).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Hadley | title = A History of Bovril Advertising | place = London | publisher = Bovril | date = 1972 | page = 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 5 to 7 March 1891, there was even a "Vril-ya Bazaar" held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has shown that Bulwer-Lytton developed his ideas about "Vril" against the background of his long preoccupation with occult natural forces, which were widely discussed at that time, especially in relation to [[animal magnetism]] or, later, [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 13–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In his earlier novels ''[[Zanoni]]'' (1842) and ''A Strange Story'' (1862), Bulwer-Lytton had discussed electricity and other "material agents" as the possible natural causes for occult phenomena. In ''The Coming Race'', those ideas are continued in the context of a satirical critique of contemporary philosophical, scientific, and political currents. In a letter to his friend John Forster, Bulwer-Lytton explained his motives:

{{bq|1=I did not mean Vril for mesmerism, but for electricity, developed into uses as yet only dimly guessed, and including whatever there may be genuine in mesmerism, which I hold to be a mere branch current of the one great fluid pervading all nature. I am by no means, however, wedded to Vril, if you can suggest anything else to carry out this meaning namely, that the coming race, though akin to us, has nevertheless acquired by hereditary transmission, etc., certain distinctions which make it a different species, and contains powers which we could not attain to through a slow growth of time; so that this race would not amalgamate with, but destroy us. [...]

Now, as some bodies are charged with electricity like the torpedo or electric eel, and never can communicate that power to other bodies, so I suppose the existence of a race charged with that electricity and having acquired the art to concentre and direct it in a word, to be conductors of its lightnings. If you can suggest any other idea of carrying out that idea of a destroying race, I should be glad. Probably even the notion of Vril might be more cleared from mysticism or mesmerism by being simply defined to be electricity and conducted by those staves or rods, omitting all about mesmeric passes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Victor Alexander Robert | last = Lytton | title = The Life of Edward Bulwer Lytton, First Lord Lytton, vol. 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofedwardbulw00lyttuoft| place = London | publisher = Macmillan and Co. | date = 1913 | page = 466f.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bulwer-Lytton has been regarded as an "initiate" or "adept" by esotericists, especially because of his [[Rosicrucian]] novel ''Zanoni'' (1842). However, there is no historical evidence that suggests that Bulwer-Lytton can be seen as an occultist, or that he has been the member of any kind of esoteric association. Instead, it has been shown that Bulwer-Lytton has been "esotericized" since the 1870s. In 1870, the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] appointed Bulwer-Lytton as her "Grand Patron." Although Bulwer-Lytton complained about this by letter in 1872, the claim has never been revoked. Other claims, such as his membership in a German [[masonic]] lodge ''Zur aufgehenden Morgenröthe'', have been proven wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those claims, as well as the recurrent esoteric topics in Bulwer-Lytton's works, convinced some commentators that the fictionalised Vril was based on a real magical force. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], endorsed this view in her book ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877) and again in ''The Secret Doctrine'' (1888). In Blavatsky, the Vril power and its attainment by a superhuman elite are worked into a mystical doctrine of race. However, the character of the subterranean people was transformed. Instead of potential conquerors, they were benevolent (if mysterious) spiritual guides. Blavatsky's recurrent homage to Bulwer-Lytton and the Vril force has exerted a lasting influence on other esoteric authors.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 69ff., 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[William Scott-Elliot]] describes life in [[Atlantis]] in {{Citation | title = The Story of Atlantis &amp; The Lost Lemuria | edition = first | date = 1896}}, the aircraft of the Atlanteans are propelled by Vril-force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L Sprague | last = de Camp | title = [[Lost Continents]] | date = 1954 | edition = first | page = 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His books are still published by the [[Theosophical Society]]. Scott-Elliot's description of Atlantean aircraft has been identified as an early inspiration for authors who have related the Vril force to [[UFO]]s after World War II.

[[George Bernard Shaw]] read the book and was attracted to the idea of Vril, according to [[Michael Holroyd]]'s biography of him.

French writer [[Jules Lermina]] included a Vril-powered flying machine in his {{Citation | language = French | date = 1910 | type = novel | title = L'Effrayante Aventure | trans-title = Panic in Paris}}.

==Stage adaptation==

A stage adaptation of the book was written by journalist [[David Christie Murray]] and magician [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]]. The production premiered at [[St. George's Hall, London|Saint George's Hall]] in London on 2 January 1905. Both Nevil Maskelyne and his father [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] collaborated on the special effects for the play. The play did not meet with success and closed after a run of eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jim | last = Steinmeyer | author-link = Jim Steinmeyer | title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible and Learned to Disappear | publisher = Carrol &amp; Graf | type = trade paperback | date = 2004 | pages = 184–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vril Society==

===Willy Ley===
[[Image:Heinz Haber Wernher von Braun Willy Ley (1954).jpg|thumb|190px|[[Willy Ley]] (right) in a discussion with [[Heinz Haber]] and [[Wernher von Braun|Wernher v. Braun]], 1954]]
[[Willy Ley]] was a German rocket engineer who had emigrated to the United States in 1937.&lt;!-- or 1933 or 1935; 1937 says the German wiki-article on him--&gt; In 1947, he published an article titled "Pseudoscience in Naziland" in the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Willy | last = Ley |date=May 1947 | title = Pseudoscience in Naziland | journal = Astounding Science Fiction | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 90–98 | url = http://www.alpenfestung.com/ley_pseudoscience.htm | publisher = Alpenfestung}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the high popularity of irrational convictions in Germany at that time explained how National Socialism could have fallen on such fertile ground. Among various pseudoscientific groups he mentions one that looked for the Vril: 
"The next group was literally founded upon a novel. That group which I think called itself 'Wahrheitsgesellschaft'&amp;nbsp;— Society for Truth&amp;nbsp;—and which was more or less localised in Berlin, devoted its spare time looking for Vril."

===Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels===
The existence of a Vril Society was alleged in 1960 by [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi [[Berlin]] that was a sort of inner circle of the [[Thule Society]]. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Monsieur Gurdjieff'', Louis Pauwels&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Amazon | title = Monsieur Gurdjieff | first = Louis | last = Pauwels | language = French | place = [[France|FR]]| id =  {{ASIN|2226081968|country=fr}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that a Vril Society had been founded by General [[Karl Haushofer]], a student of [[Russia]]n magician and metaphysician [[George Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]].

===Publications on the Vril Society in German===
The book of [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]] was published in [[German language|German]] with the title: ''Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft'' (literally ''Departure into the Third Millennium: The Future of the Fantastic Reason'') in 1969.

In his book [[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|''Black Sun'']], [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] refers to the research of the German author Peter Bahn. Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, "Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie" ("The Secret of Vril Energy"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Peter |last= Bahn |title= Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie: Berichte und Erfahrungen zu einer mächtigen Naturkraft |editor1-first= Adolf | editor1-last = Schneider |editor2-first= Inge |editor2-last= Schneider |work= Vorträge des Kongresses 1995 im Gwatt-Zentrum am Thunersee &lt;!-- Duplicate parameter --&gt;|place= Bern |publisher= Jupiter-Verlag A.+l. Schneider |date= 1996 |isbn= 3-906571-14-9 |pages= 137–46 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of his discovery of an obscure esoteric group calling itself the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft", which revealed itself in a rare 1930 publication ''Vril. Die Kosmische Urkraft'' (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym "Johannes Täufer" (German: "John [the] Baptist"). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was "Täufer"), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Johannes | last = Täufer | contribution = "Vril" Die Kosmische Urkraft Wiedergeburt von Atlantis | language = German | title = Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Reichsarbeitgemeinschaft "Das kommende Deutschland" Zentralbüro | place = Berlin W 57, Pallasstr. 7 | publisher = Astrologischer Verlag Wilhelm Becker: Berlin Steglitz, Schloßstraße 69 | date = 1930}}. [[:de:Datei:Vril Urkraft Einband.jpg|See image in German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft" can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft," who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875–1947).&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 98–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric neo-Nazism===
After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the [[Landig Group|Vienna Circle]] elaborated an esoteric neo-Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril topos in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In their writings, Vril is associated with [[Nazi UFOs]] and the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the [[Neo-völkisch movements#Tempelhofgesellschaft|Tempelhofgesellschaft]], has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as ''[[Iron Sky]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
