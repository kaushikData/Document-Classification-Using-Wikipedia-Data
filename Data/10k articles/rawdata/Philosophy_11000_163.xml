      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6235">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Aenesidemus'' (book)}}
'''''Aenesidemus''''' is a German book published anonymously by Professor [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] of [[Helmstedt]] in 1792. Schulze attempted to refute the principles that [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] established in support of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781). The title is a reference to [[Aenesidemus]], an ancient Greek [[skeptical]] philosopher. Its complete title, in English translation, was ''Aenesidemus or Concerning the Foundations of the Philosophy of the Elements Issued by Professor Reinhold in Jena Together with a Defense of Skepticism against the Pretensions of the Critique of Reason'' ({{lang-de|Aenesidemus oder Ã¼ber die Fundamente der von dem Herrn Professor Reinhold in Jena gelieferten Elementar-Philosophie. Nebst einer Vertheidigung des Skepticismus gegen die Anmassungen der Vernunftkritik}}).  

==Summary==
The book was supposed to be a written correspondence between Hermias ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: "a follower of [[Hermes]]"), who believes in the Kantian critical philosophy, and Aenesidemus (Greek: "he who praises the people"), who is skeptical about that philosophy.  The skepticism of [[David Hume]]'s [[Hume's skepticism about induction|skepticism about induction]], according to this book, was not disproved by Kant.  As Hume had asserted, the existence of [[causality]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], or the [[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]] cannot be proved.

==Schulze's skepticism==
[[Philosophy]] cannot establish the [[existence]] or non-existence of the thing-in-itself.  By establishing general principles, we can't know the limits of our ability to know.  Progressive development, however, can approach complete knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol. 7,  New York: Macmillan, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

No skeptic can doubt the reality and certainty of mental representations and mental events that are immediately given through consciousness.

Skepticism does not claim that metaphysical questions cannot be answered.

[[Skeptic]]ism doubts the possibility of knowledge about the existence or non-existence of the thing-in-itself.  Kant, however, was guilty of [[begging the question]] in that he presupposed that the thing-in-itself exists and causally interacts with observing subjects.

Kant and Reinhold claimed that the reality of objects can be known from the representations in the mind of the observing subject.  This is inferring objective reality from subjective thought.  Such an inference is the [[fallacy]] of drawing existential conclusions from logical premises.

Kant's critical philosophy is self-contradictory.  He said that things-in-themselves cause sensations in an [[observation|observer]]'s [[mind]].  Kant applied [[causality]] to [[noumenon|noumena]].  But, in his critique, he had claimed that causality is a [[category (philosophy)|category]] of the [[understanding]] that can only be applied to [[phenomena]].

Kant posited real existence to the postulates of [[God]], [[Free Will]], and [[Immortality|Immortal]]  [[Soul (spirit)|Soul]]s.  But this is more than is necessary for [[moral theology]], which only requires belief in them as [[Idea]]s of [[Reason]].

The [[science]] of [[psychology]] does not require that the soul have faculties.  Rather, psychology is a detailed description and systematic classification of actual mental events.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-48328-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we were to take critical philosophy seriously, we would commit ourselves to resolving experiences into two parts &amp;mdash; a system of universal subjective forms on one side, and a mass of amorphous, meaningless objective matter on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Between Kant and Hegel'', trans. and ed. George Di Giovanni and H. S. Harris, Indianapolis, Hackett, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87220-504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How can we be sure that Kant's obligation to be moral is the result of freedom?  It might be the result of some irrational natural force.

==Reactions==
Kant's response was indicated in his letter to [[Jakob Sigismund Beck]], December 4, 1792: 
:"Under the assumed name of Aenesidemus, an even wider skepticism has been advanced, namely, that we cannot know at all whether our representations correspond to anything else (as object), which is as much as to say: whether a representation is a representation (stands for anything).  For 'representation' means a determination in us that we relate to something else (whose place the representation takes in us)..."&lt;ref&gt;Di Giovanni and Harris 2000, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhold wrote that true skepticism rested on the fact that only the observing subject felt what was in its consciousness.  The only truth is the subject's notion that there is an object that agrees with its internal mental representation. 

[[Johann Fichte]] agreed with Reinhold's subjectivity.  He based his own idealism on the observing subject's internal forms of knowledge. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] agreed with Schulze: ["Therefore the world as [REPRESENTATION], in which aspect alone we are here considering it, has two essential, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one half is the object, whose forms are space and time, and through these plurality. But the other half, the subject, does not lie in space and time, for it is whole and undivided in every representing being. Hence a single one of these beings with the object completes the world as representation just as fully as do the millions that exist. And if that single one were to disappear, then the world as representation would no longer exist. Therefore these halves are inseparable even in thought, for each of the two has meaning and existence only through and for the other; each exists with the other and vanishes with it."].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Volume I, Book 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexis Nour''' ({{IPA-ro|aËleksis Ëno.ur}}; born '''Alexei Vasile Nour''',&lt;ref name="ghgb203"&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], Bucharest, 1972, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Alexe Nour''', '''Alexie Nour''', '''As. Nr.''';&lt;ref name="bnrm455"&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425080245/http://87.248.191.115/bnrm/publicatii/files/5/Alteaniversari2008.pdf ''Calendar NaÈional 2008. Alte aniversÄri''], [[National Library of Moldova]], ChiÈinÄu, 2008, p.455&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐµÌÐ¹ ÐÐ¾ÑÑ}}, ''Aleksey Nour''; 1877â1940) was a [[Bessarabia]]n-born [[Romania]]n journalist, activist and essayist, known for his advocacy of [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Romanian-Bessarabian union]] and his critique of the [[Russian Empire]], but also for controversial political dealings. Oscillating between [[socialism]] and [[Russian nationalism]], he was noted as founder of ''[[ViaÈa Basarabiei (1907)|ViaÈa Basarabiei]]'' gazette. Eventually affiliated with Romania's [[left-wing]] form of [[cultural nationalism]], or [[Poporanism]], Nour was a long-term correspondent of the Poporanist review ''[[ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ]]''. Publicizing his conflict with the Russian authorities, he settled in the [[Kingdom of Romania]], where he openly rallied with the ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' group.

During [[World War I]], Nour agitated against any military alliance between Romania and Russia. He stood out among [[Germanophile]]s and local supporters of the [[Central Powers]], agitating in favor of a military offensive into Bessarabia, and demanding the annexation of [[Transnistria]]. This combative stance was later overshadowed by revelations that Nour was spying for Russia's intelligence service, the ''[[Okhrana]]''.

Still active as an independent socialist in [[Greater Romania]], Alexis Nour won additional fame as an advocate of [[human rights]], [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], [[women's suffrage]] and [[Jewish emancipation]]. During the final decade of his life, Nour also debuted as a novelist, but did not register significant success. His late contributions as a [[Thracology|Thracologist]] were received with skepticism by the academic community.

==Biography==

===Early activities===
The future journalist, born in Russian-held Bessarabia (the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]), was a member of the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] cultural elite, and, reportedly, a graduate of the [[Metropolis of Bessarabia|Bessarabian Orthodox Church]] [[ChiÈinÄu Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name="ic30"&gt;Constantin, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phunirea"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pan Halippa]], [http://www.literaturasiarta.md/public/851ro_33.pdf "Unirea Basarabiei cu RomÃ¢nia" (I)], in ''[[Literatura Èi Arta]]'', August 28, 2008, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, he spent his early years in [[Kiev]] and graduated from the Pavlo Galagan College.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; Nour furthered his studies in other regions of the Russian Empire, where he became a familiar figure to those who opposed [[Tsarist autocracy]], and exchanged ideas with radical young men of various ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="phunirea"/&gt; He is known to have studied Philology at [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv|Kiev University]], where he affiliated with the underground [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary (Eser) Party]], probably infiltrated in its ranks by the ''Okhrana''.&lt;ref name="ic30"/&gt;

From 1903, Nour was editor of ''Besarabskaya Zhizn{{'}}'', Bessarabia's "first democratic paper".&lt;ref name="alvb188"&gt;Boldur, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Nour was still in Bessarabia during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], but was mysteriously absent from the follow-up protests by local Romanians (or, in contemporary references, "[[Moldavia]]ns"). According to [[Onisifor Ghibu]] (himself an analyst of Bessarabian life), Nour missed out on the chance of establishing a RomanianâMoldavianâBessarabian "[[Irredentism|irredentist]] movement", leading "a mysterious existence", and "not giving even the faintest clue that he was alive, until 1918."&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.261&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Nour had joined a local section of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party]], the leading force in [[Liberalism in Russia|Russian liberalism]]. As one historian assesses, this was a maverick's choice: "A. Nour [...] did not consider himself either a socialist or a nationalist."&lt;ref name="alvb188"/&gt;

During the post-revolutionary age of reforms and concessions, when ''Besarabskaya Zhizn{{'}}'' became a Kadet paper, Nour himself was a member of the Kadet bureau in Bessarabia, and the private assistant of regional party boss Leopold Sitsinski.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; However, Nour was soon after expelled from the Constitutional Democratic group (reportedly, for having pocketed some of the party's funds) and began frequenting the political clubs of Romanian nationalists.&lt;ref name="ic30"/&gt;

In 1906, Nour was affiliated with ''[[Basarabia (newspaper)|Basarabia]]'', a [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] newspaper for the region's politically minded ethnic Romanians in the region, soon after closed down by Imperial Russian [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin, p.30; Dulschi, p.22-24; Kulikovski &amp; Ècelcikova, p.37; LÄcustÄ, ''passim''; Rotaru, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ishalippa"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Èpac]], [http://www.literaturasiarta.md/public/949ro_nr_46.pdf "Pantelimon Halippa â fondator Èi manager al ziarului Èi revistei ''ViaÈa Basarabiei''"], in ''[[Literatura Èi Arta]]'', November 13, 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The short-lived periodical, financed by sympathizers from the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (including politician [[Eugeniu Carada]]), was pushing the envelope on the issue of Romanian emancipation and trans-border brotherhood, beyond what the 1905 regime intended to allow.&lt;ref&gt;LÄcustÄ, p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first-ever article for the review, Alexis Nour suggested that the regional movement for national emancipation still lacked a group of intellectual leaders, or "elected sons", capable of forming a single Romanian faction in the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|State Duma]].&lt;ref name="il56"&gt;LÄcustÄ, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such setbacks and the continued spread of illiteracy, Nour contended, Bessarabia's Romanians were more attached to the national ideal, and more politically motivated, than their brethren in Romania-proper.&lt;ref name="il56"/&gt; Other ''Basarabia'' articles by Nour were vehement rebuttals addressed to [[Pavel Krushevan]], the (supposedly ethnic Romanian) exponent of extreme Russian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dulschi, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

===''ViaÈa Basarabiei'' and 1907 election===
The following year, in April, Nour himself launched, sponsored and edited the political weekly ''ViaÈa Basarabiei'', distinguished for having discarded the antiquated [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]] in favor of a [[Romanian alphabet|Latin alphabet]], wishing to make itself accessible to readers in the Kingdom of Romania; an abridged, "people's" version of the gazette was also made available as a supplement, for a purely Bessarabian readership.&lt;ref&gt;Kulikovski &amp; Ècelcikova, p.225; Rotaru, p.38-39, 62, 523. See also Boldur, p.193; Cazacu, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friend and colleague, [[Petru Cazacu]], Nour had to order the Latin [[typeface]] in [[Bucharest]], and used coded language to keep the Russian authorities a step behind him.&lt;ref name="pcaz174"&gt;Cazacu, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

As later attested by Bessarabian Romanian activist [[Pan Halippa]] (founder, in 1932, of the [[ViaÈa Basarabiei|similarly titled magazine]]), his predecessor Nour had tried to emulate the ''Basarabia'' program of [[popular education]] in Romanian, with the ultimate goal of ethnic emancipation.&lt;ref name="ishalippa"/&gt; In his capacity as editor in chief, he employed poet [[Alexei Mateevici]], and republished fragments from classical works of [[Romanian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Nour joined [[Gheorghe V. Madan]], publisher of ''[[Moldovanul]]'' newspaper, in inaugurating the [[ChiÈinÄu]]-based Orthodox Church printing press, which began publishing a Bessarabian [[Psalter]] during spring 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/revasul/1907/BCUCLUJ_FP_279662_1907_005_021_022.pdf "Momente culturale"], in ''RÄvaÈul'', Nr. 21-22/1907, p.365 (digitized by the [[BabeÈ-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Nour's ''ViaÈa Basarabiei'' represented the legalist side of the Bessarabian emancipation movement, to the irritation of more radical Romanian nationalists. Cazacu recalls: "Although moderate, the atmosphere was so stuffed, the hardships so great, the attacks of the right and the left so relentless, that in a short while [this magazine] also succumbed, not without having had its useful effect in the awakening of national sentiment, even among the Moldavians in various parts of Russia, in the [[Caucasus]], and in [[Siberia]]."&lt;ref name="pcaz174"/&gt; A nationalist historian, [[Nicolae Iorga]], accused Nour of promoting "class fraternity" between the Russians and the Romanians in Bessarabia, citing Nour's explicit rejection of the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Nour enlisted other negative comments from Iorga when he began writing Bessarabian notices in the Romanian daily ''[[AdevÄrul]]'', which had [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] proprietors. Iorga, an [[Antisemitism|antisemite]], commented: "Mr. Alexe Nour of ChiÈinÄu assures us now that his new gazette [...] will not be a [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitic]] one".&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iorga, Nour was given reason to "feel sorry" about the ''AdevÄrul'' collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.39, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Also described as one of the journals whose mission was to popularize the Constitutional Democratic program inside the Bessarabia Governorate,&lt;ref name="mcibplurip66"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Cernencu, [[Igor BoÈan]], [http://www.e-democracy.md/files/evolutia-pluripartitismului-2009.pdf ''EvoluÈia pluripartidismului pe teritoriul Republicii Moldova''], ADEPT, ChiÈinÄu, 2009, p.66.  {{ISBN|978-9975-61-529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ViaÈa Basarabiei'' only survived until May 25, 1907, publishing six issues in all.&lt;ref&gt;Grossu &amp; Palade, p.225&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, its demise happened on Russian orders, after Nour's editorial line had found itself in conflict with the censorship apparatus.&lt;ref name="ishalippa"/&gt; According to Cazacu, the [[Russian legislative election, January 1907|Second Duma election]] was disastrous for the "Moldavian" intellectuals, who had no journal of their own and were in a state of "despair". The vote in Bessarabia was carried by Krushevan'sâpro-Tsarist and [[far-right]]â[[Union of the Russian People]] (SRN), and by an aristocratic Romanian with centrist views, [[Dimitrie Krupenski]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazacu, p.174-175&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Nour had also become regional correspondent for ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'', a magazine published in the Kingdom of Romania by a left-wing group of writers and activists, the [[Poporanism|Poporanists]]. From 1907 to 1914, his column ''Scrisori din Basarabia'' ("Letters from Bessarabia") was the prime source of Bessarabian news for newspapers on the other side of the Russian border.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; It mainly informed Romanians on the state of mind and political climate of Bessarabia following the Russian elections.&lt;ref name="mcibplurip66"/&gt; Initially, they describe 1907 Bessarabia with noted regret, as the place where "nothing happens", in contrast with a more politically oriented Romania, where the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|Peasants' Revolt]] had seemingly radicalized public opinion.&lt;ref name="cdtreidim"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Catherine Durandin]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070624/article_15/ "Moldova Ã®n trei dimensiuni"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123217/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070624/article_15/ |date=2011-07-21 }}, in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr. 2/2007&lt;/ref&gt; They report with consternation that the official Moldavian Studies Society, had been inactive for an entire year, and concluded that its creation was government farce; however, he also admitted that the bloody events of 1907 Romania were unpalatable for the average Bessarabian.&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.229, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Nour also questioned the national sentiment of Bessarabia's landowning elite, which had largely been integrated into [[Russian nobility]] and served Imperial interests.&lt;ref name="cdtreidim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; The region's educated classes were Russian-educated, often Russian-oriented, and had therefore lost ''cheia de la lacÄtÄ, care Ã®nchide sufletul ÈÄranului'' ("the key that will unlock the peasant's soul").&lt;ref&gt;Cazacu, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 1908, he reported with enthusiasm that the Bessarabian Orthodox clergy upheld the use of Romanian ("[[Moldovan language|Moldavian]]") in its religious schools and press. The measure, Nour noted, gave formal status to the vernacular, in line with his own ''ViaÈa Basarabiei'' agenda.&lt;ref name="ghn75-76"&gt;Negru, p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt; Nour's "letters from Bessarabia" irritated the [[Russification|Russifying]] hierarchs of the Orthodox Church. [[Seraphim Chichagov]], the [[Archbishop of ChiÈinÄu]], included him among the Church's "worst enemies", but noted that his Romanian nationalism had managed to contaminate only 20 Bessarabian priests.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Popovschi, ''Istoria Bisericii din Basarabia Ã®n veacul al XIX-lea subt ruÈi'', Tipografia EparhialÄ Cartea RomÃ¢neascÄ, ChiÈinÄu, 1931, p.472-473&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madan scandal and ''Drug'' controversy===
[[File:Roman Doliwa-Dobrowolski, Lausanne, 1908.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Doliwa-Dobrowolski, Nour's accuser, photographed in 1908]]
Nour's other ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' articles unmasked a former colleague, Madan, officially appointed censor of Romanian literature within the Russian Empire, and unofficially a Russian spy in both Bessarabia and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Negru, p.73, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In his reply to Nour, published by the Bucharest political gazette ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'' (September 1909), Madan claimed that his accuser was at once a socialist, an [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] and a follower of [[Constantin Stere]]'s Bessarabian [[separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Negru, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; Later research into [[Special Corps of Gendarmes]] archives identified Madan as the informant who provided the Imperial authorities with first-hand reports on the perception of Bessarabian issues in Romania, including on Nour's own 1908 article on the Orthodox priests' support for the vernacular.&lt;ref name="ghn75-76"/&gt; However, the Romanian elite also took distance from Nour, even before 1910. As argued by activist [[Ion Pelivan]], the publicist was living far beyond his means, raising concern that he was receiving payments from the Russian authorities.&lt;ref name="ic30"/&gt;

Alexis Nour was, between June 1910 and August 1911, the editor of his own press venue, the [[Russian language|Russian-language]] newspaper ''Bessarabets'' (which also published a literary supplement).&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulikovski &amp; Ècelcikova, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The paper had a small circulation, and was entirely financed by the local magnate [[Vasile Stroescu]].&lt;ref name="ic30"/&gt; Nour's own literary contributions included translations from [[Russian literature|Russian classics]]. One such rendition from [[Leo Tolstoy]], dating from 1906, was one of the few Romanian-language books to see print in the Bessarabia Governorate before [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazacu, p.175; Silvia Grossu, Gheorghe Palade, "Presa din Basarabia Ã®n contextul socio-cultural de la Ã®nceputurile ei pÃ®nÄ Ã®n 1957", in Kulikovski &amp; Ècelcikova, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the political notices, ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' published samples of Nour's literary efforts, including memoirs, [[Sketch story|sketch stories]] and [[novella]]s.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; He was probably a contributor to the Romanian literary review ''[[Noua RevistÄ RomÃ¢nÄ]]'', possibly the pseudonymous author (initials ''A. N.'') of a 1912 article condemning antisemitism at the [[Romanian Writers' Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2005/pdf/numarul12/art7_primii_pasi_ai_societatii_scriitorilor_romani_ii.pdf "Primii paÈi ai SocietÄÈii Scriitorilor RomÃ¢ni (II).

When the ''Bessarabets'' venture came to an end, Nour was again employed by ''Besarabskaya Zhizn{{'}}'', before switching to the gazette ''Drug'', representing the controversial Union of the Russian People.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Associating with his former adversary, Krushevan, Nour became the editorial secretary, and even joined up with the SRN.&lt;ref name="ic31"&gt;Constantin, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; With other members of the editorial board, he was soon after involved in a regional press scandal. Nour himself was suspected of having blackmailed centrist leader Krupenski and Roman Doliwa-Dobrowolski, the [[Marshal of Nobility (Russia)|Marshal of Nobility]] in [[Orhei|Orgeyev]]. When Doliwa-Dobrowolski sued ''Drug'' and the other journalists were rounded up for questioning, Nour fled to Kiev.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt;

Probably helped along by his ''Okhrana'' contacts, he obtained a [[Russian passport|passport]], and exiled himself from Russia.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt; After spending some time in the [[German Empire]], he left for Romania, and, with Constantin Stere's help, enlisted as a student at the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of IaÈi]].&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt; He was afterwards seen as a leading member of the Bessarabian expatriate community. According to fellow Bessarabian exile [[Axinte FrunzÄ]], theirs was a minuscule political lobby, with only 6 to 10 active members, all of them saddened by the small-mindedness of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

Nour's new series in ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' documents the early spread of [[Moldovenism]]. In summer 1914, he informed his readers that the Russian state officials actively persuaded the Bessarabian peasants not to declare themselves Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.249&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, he reluctantly admitted, the only hope for a Romanian revival in Bessarabia was for the Romanians to side with the Krupenski-faction conservatives, which, although "hostile to the democratic sentiment of the masses", maintained [[linguistic purism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanophile press and Transnistrian ethnography===
[[File:Map of RDM-1917.jpg|thumb|300px|Ethnographic map of Bessarabia made by Alexis Nour in 1916]]

Soon after the outbreak of World War I, Alexis Nour was residing in neutral Romania, active within the ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' circle from his new home in [[IaÈi]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.258; Constantin, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Like other members of this group (and primarily its founder Stere), he campaigned in favor of [[rapprochement]] with the [[Central Powers]], recommending a war on Russia for the recovery of Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.99-101; Constantin, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Nour thought further than his colleagues, speculating about an alliance of interests between Romanians and [[Ruthenians]] ([[Ukrainians]]). His essay ''Problema romÃ¢no-ruteanÄ. O paginÄ din marea restaurare a naÈiunilor'' ("The Romanian-Ruthenian Issue. A Page from the Great Restoration of Nations"), published by ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' in its OctoberâNovemberâDecember 1914 issue, inaugurated a series of such pieces, which talked about [[Ukraine]]'s emancipation, the [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Bessarabian union]], and, unusually in this context, the incorporation of [[Transnistria]] into Romania (with a new frontier on the [[Southern Bug]]).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.100-101, 258. See also Constantin, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter demand was without precedent in the history of Romanian nationalism,&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt; and Nour is even credited with having coined the term ''Transnistria'' in modern parlance, alongside the adjective ''transnistreni'' ("Transnistrians").&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; Elsewhere, Nour argued that there were over 1 million ''transnistreni'' Romanians, a claim which endured as one of the largest, directly above the 800,000 advanced by Bessarabian historian [[Ètefan Ciobanu (politician)|Ètefan Ciobanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} N. A. Constantinescu, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/13565/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_3503_1941_001_0003.pdf "Nistrul, fluviu romÃ¢nesc"], in ''Dacia'', Nr. 3/1941, p.2 (digitized by the [[BabeÈ-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library]); P.

Series Historica'', Nr. 2-3/1998-1999, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The only larger such estimate came, twenty years after Nour's, from within the Transnistrian community of exiles: ethnographer [[Nichita SmochinÄ]] claimed a figure of 1,200,000.&lt;ref&gt;PÃ¢ntea CÄlin, [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/CC14/09_ethnodemographic.pdf "The Ethno-demographic Evolution of Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic"] {{sic}}, in the [[Ètefan cel Mare University of Suceava]] [http://atlas.usv.ro/www/codru_net/ ''Codrul Cosminului''], Nr. 14 (2008), p.176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of Nour's analytical texts, titled ''Din enigma anilor 1914â1915'' ("Around the Enigma of 1914â1915"), ventured to state that the German Empire and its allies were poised to win the war, ridiculed the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]]'s [[Gallipoli Campaign]], and suggested that a German-led [[Mitteleuropa|Mitteleuropean]] federation was in the making.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.258&lt;/ref&gt; This prognosis also offered a reply to the pro-Entente lobby, who prioritized the annexation of [[Transylvania]] and other Romanian-inhabited regions of [[Austria-Hungary]] over any national project in Bessarabia. In Nour's interpretation, the German project for Mitteleuropa amounted to the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, leaving Transylvania free to elect in favor of joining Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.258-259&lt;/ref&gt; The notion, also supported by Stere, was hotly contested by Onisifor Ghibu, a Transylvanian. According to Ghibu, the Poporanists seemed to ignore the realities of Austro-Hungarian domination; their ideas about Bessarabian superiority were "provocative", "at the very least rude".&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1915, Nour designed and published in Bucharest an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] map of Bessarabia on a [[Scale (map)|scale]] of 1:450,000. Building on a cartographic model first used by Zsigmond BÃ¡tky in his "[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]" ethnographic map and later adapted to the [[Balkans]] by [[Jovan CvijiÄ]], Nour's map divided the regions depicted into communal entities, represented as [[pie chart]]s of the various nationalities.&lt;ref name="edm84-86"&gt;Martonne, p.84-86&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting majority (2 out of 3 million inhabitants) was Romanian, with a note explaining that these were known locally as "[[Moldovans]]"âbeing Nour's contribution to the [[Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova|debate on Moldovan ethnicity]].&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt; Beyond Bessarabia, Nour's map states a claim about the Romanians of Transnistria, including their presence in a locality named ''Nouroaia''.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt;

The pie-chart procedure as a whole was criticized by French geographer [[Emmanuel de Martonne]], who viewed it as inaccurate in rendering the comparative numerical force of the individual populations.&lt;ref name="edm84-86"/&gt; Martonne stated having personally verified the accuracy of Nour's map at some point before 1920, and concluded: "Although it is not exempt from all criticism, it is generally as exact as is permitted by the Russian documents on which it bases itself. As is the case with [BÃ¡tky's data on the Romanians in] [[Hungary]], one presumes that any error is to the disfavor of Romanians."&lt;ref&gt;Martonne, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Bessarabian historian Ion Constantin sees the map as one of Nour's "meritorious" contributions to the cause of Romanian emancipation.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt;

Nour took his ideas outside the Poporanist clubs, and became a contributor to the unofficial [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880â1918)|Conservative Party]] press. He became a regular contributor to [[Petre P. Carp]]'s newspaper pro-Bessarabian and [[Russophobia|anti-Russian]] gazette ''[[Moldova (1915 newspaper)|Moldova]]'', which stood by the belief that "Germany is invincible".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Agrigoroaiei, [http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/texte/nr45PetreCarp.html "Petre P. Carp Èi ziarul ''Moldova''"], in ''Revista RomÃ¢nÄ'' ([[AsociaÈia TransilvanÄ pentru Literatura RomÃ¢nÄ Èi Cultura Poporului RomÃ¢n|ASTRA]]), Nr. 3/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nour also expanded on his wartime vision in the [[Germanophile]] daily ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]''. In 1915, he stated the need for Romania to join the Central Powers' effort of liberating Bessarabia, Ukraine and Poland from Russia, prophesied that Austria-Hungary would inevitably collapse, and depicted future Romania as both a [[Black Sea]] and [[Danube|Danubian]] power.&lt;ref name="lb259"&gt;Boia, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; With time, the Bessarabian journalist claimed, the [[Straits Question]] would be solved, Romanian rule over [[Odessa]] and [[ConstanÈa]] would create commercial prosperity, and Romania, a [[great power]], would be entitled to a share of the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]] or [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] colonial empires.&lt;ref name="lb259"/&gt; Another of his ''Seara'' articles, published in April 1916, argued that German victory in the [[Battle of Verdun]] was a matter of days or weeks, after which Europe would be dominated by an "industrious, healthy and conscious, 70 million-strong" [[German people]].&lt;ref name="lb259"/&gt; Reviewing Nour's project some 90 years later, historian [[Lucian Boia]] assessed: "One finds in Nour the drama of the Bessarabian who assesses all things, often in a purely imaginary pitch, around his own ideal of national emancipation."&lt;ref name="lb259"/&gt;

===Wartime refuge and ''Umanitatea''===
[[File:Pacostea RuseascÄ.JPG|thumb|270px|"The Russian Bane", a Romanian perception of the Russian forces in Moldavia]]
Against the wishes of ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' Germanophiles, Romania eventually entered the war as an Entente ally, and, in 1917, was [[Romania in World War I|invaded by the Central Powers]]. During these events, Nour was in IaÈi, where the Romanian government had retreated,&lt;ref name="lb260"&gt;Boia, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rpenigma2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Petrescu, [http://www.contrafort.md/numere/enigma-ilie-c-t-r-u-ii "Enigma Ilie CÄtÄrÄu (II)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009200046/http://www.contrafort.md/numere/enigma-ilie-c-t-r-u-ii |date=October 9, 2013 }}, in ''[[Contrafort]]'', Nr. 7-8/2012&lt;/ref&gt; and whence he made his first contributions to the international press in Entente and neutral countries.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; He kept company with another Bessarabian agent of the ''Okhrana'', [[Ilie CÄtÄrÄu]], wanted by the Central Powers on charges of terrorism.&lt;ref name="rpenigma2"/&gt;

In spring 1917, shortly after the [[February Revolution]] toppled the Tsarist regime, Nour's Bessarabian career received full exposure. The committee for exploring the [[Special Corps of Gendarmes]] archive made public his reports to the ''Okhrana'', confirming his colleagues' suspicions and exposing Nour to public shame.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt; Nevertheless, the [[October Revolution]] and its aftermath seemed to credit Nour's prophecies: although Romania was losing to the Central Powers, the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] proclaimed by Bessarabian activists looked set to unite with the defeated country. This was noted at the time by the newly appointed Germanophile [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier of Romania]], [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], who credited Nour with having helped revise Romanian foreign policy: "[His] map has since been laid out on all tables of the great European conferences, in all chancelleries, and is the soundest document for those who wish to untangle the matter of Bessarabia's nationalities."&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; In April 1918, Nour was again in ChiÈinÄu, celebrating the positive vote on Bessarabia's union. This was a risky gesture on his part: present at Londra Restaurant, where Marghiloman was being greeted by the unionist leaders, he was spotted by his former friends, and only rescued from near-certain lynching by the intervention of outgoing [[Prime Minister of Moldova|MDR Prime Minister]], his old colleague [[Petru Cazacu]].&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt;

Nour was back in IaÈi when Romania sued for [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace with Germany]]. Confusion reigned there, with [[Bolshevik]] and other Russian troops still parading through the city streets. According to Ghibu, he had an episodic career as private teacher of Russian, having as his clients the neutralized Romanian soldiers and some concerned civilians.&lt;ref name="frbasro288"&gt;Rotaru, p.288&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24, Nour inaugurated in IaÈi a new magazine, ''Umanitatea'' ("The Human Race" or "The Humanity"), which only published one more issue, on July 14, before closing down.&lt;ref name="lb260"/&gt;

''Umanitatea'' emphasized Nour's leftist projects for social change, and, according to Lucian Boia, offered a reply to Marghiloman's promise to reform the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 constitutional regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.259-260&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's agenda called for a three-pronged reform: [[labor rights]] in the industrial sphere, the reestablishment of a [[Land reform in Romania|landed peasantry]], and [[Jewish emancipation]].&lt;ref name="lb260"/&gt; The latter statement of support, Boia notes, was singular "in the context of a quite pronounced Romanian antisemitism", and further emphasized by the presence of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] intellectualsâ[[Isac Ludo]], [[Eugen Relgis]], [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]] etc.âamong ''Umanitatea'' contributors.&lt;ref name="lb260"/&gt; Boia also notes that the entire ''Umanitatea'' program was another sample of Nour's "great projects, quite nebulous and limitless".&lt;ref name="lb260"/&gt;

''Umanitatea'' was noted for covering, in Nour's own editorials, the developments of Russian political life under the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu-IaÈi ''et al.'', p.65, 93&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of Bolshevik "anarchy" preoccupied him enough to constitute a main topic for his other magazine, the [[Anticommunism|anticommunist]] ''RÄsÄritul'' ("The East"). Nour's articles, published in ''RÄsÄritul'' and in [[N. D. Cocea]]'s ''[[Chemarea]]'', describe Bessarabia (the "stateless" MDR) as prey to "Bolshevik fury", calling for Romania to immunize itself "against the plague" by simply abandoning hopes to the region. He also revisited his Transnistrian agenda, writing that the Romanian armies needed to move quickly and seize "the people's East, down to the Blue Bug."&lt;ref name="frbasro288"/&gt; Ghibu dismissed Nour's new agenda as "enormities", arguing that they show Nour's "bizarre mentality", not unlike that of his revolutionary enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Rotaru, p.288, 291-292, 521&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his later essays, Nour attested that his only son, whom the [[Russian Civil War]] had caught at Odessa, was a victim of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russian]]-organized shootings of Romanian hostages. According to Nour's account, the young man had died in a mass execution ordered by [[Commissar]] [[BÃ©la Kun]], after being made to dig his own grave.&lt;ref name="ldconstatari"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian DumbravÄ, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/constatari-amare.html "ConstatÄri amare"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', January 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such claims of loyalty, Nour is said to have been the focus of official investigation during a clampdown on wartime Germanophiles.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt;

===Feminism and Constructivism===
During the [[interwar period]], when different political circumstances resulted in the creation of [[Greater Romania]] (including both Bessarabia and Transylvania), Nour remained active on the literary and political scene, and was for a while editor in chief of the mainstream literary magazine ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref name="ic31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ldconstatari"/&gt; He also wrote for the newspapers ''Opinia'' and ''AvÃ¢ntul'', discussing Russian affairs and Russia's take on "[[Democratic socialism|socialist democracy]]",&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu-IaÈi ''et al.'', p.77, 79, 132&lt;/ref&gt; and was present on the first issue of ''Moldova de la Nistru'', a Bessarabian "magazine written for the people".&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al'' (1987), p.602-603&lt;/ref&gt; At IaÈi, ''Umanitatea'' was relaunched in June 1920, but had Relgis as editorial director and Nour as a mere correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al'' (1987), p.994&lt;/ref&gt;

He was still affiliated with the Poporanist periodicals, including ''ViaÈa RomÃ¢neascÄ'' and ''ÃnsemnÄri Literare'', where he mainly published translations from and introductions to Russian literature.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt; By 1925, he was also a contributor to a left-wing literary newspaper based in Bucharest, ''[[AdevÄrul Literar Èi Artistic]]''.&lt;ref name="bnrm455"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), p.18; {{ro icon}} [[Mihail Sevastos]], [http://www.adevarul.ro/cultura/literar_si_artistic/retro/Adevaruri_de_altadata-_Anul_Literar_1925_0_486551832.html "AdevÄruri de altÄdatÄ: Anul Literar 1925"], in ''[[AdevÄrul Literar Èi Artistic]]'', May 24, 2011 (originally published January 3, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, he worked with C. Zarida Sylva on another ''Basarabia'' newspaper, which was dedicated to "national propaganda" in Romania and abroad, and with [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] at ''Lumea'', the "weekly bazaar".&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), p.80, 590&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexis Nour centered his subsequent activities in the area of [[Human rights defender|human rights defense]] and [[pro-feminism]]. In May 1922, he was one of the Romanian contributors to [[A. L. Zissu]]'s Jewish daily, ''[[MÃ¢ntuirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al'' (1987), p.600-601&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when Romania lacked [[women's suffrage]], he argued that there was an intrinsic link between the two causes: in a piece published by the [[Feminism|feminist]] tribune ''AcÈiunea FeministÄ'', he explained that his struggle was about gaining recognition for "the human rights of women".&lt;ref name="obfeminine"&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana BÄluÈÄ, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Feminine/feministe.-Din-miscarea-feminista-interbelica*articleID_11502-articles_details.html "Feminine/feministe. Din miÈcarea feministÄ interbelicÄ"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 233, August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist Oana BÄluÈÄ, Nour's attitude in this respect was comparable to that of another pro-feminist Romanian writer, [[Alexandru VlahuÈÄ]].&lt;ref name="obfeminine"/&gt;

For a while in 1925, Alexis Nour was a supporter of [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and a member of the small but active [[avant-garde]] clubs. Writing for [[M. H. Maxy]]'s ''Integral'' magazine (Issue 4), he sought to define the political purpose of Romanian Constructivism: "progress is a gradual adaptation [to the] least reduced [[division of labor]] between men. Anything that will slow down that adaptation is immoral, and unjust, and stupid. [...] Herein is the area of social philosophy that forms the foundation of Constructivist integralism."&lt;ref&gt;George Radu Bogdan, "Un modernist: M. H. Maxy", in ''[[Revista FundaÈiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 4/1946, p.869&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
In the final part of his career, Nour still carried on with his coverage of Russian politics for Romanians.

(2003), p.491&lt;/ref&gt; He also turned to fiction writing, completing the [[novella]] ''Masca lui Beethoven'' ("[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s Mask"), first published by ''Convorbiri Literare'' in February 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} S[evastian] V[oicu], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1929/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1929_060_002.pdf "MiÈcarea culturalÄ.

One of the last projects to involve Nour was a [[collaborative fiction]] work, ''Stafiile dragostei. Romanul celor patru'' ("The Ghosts of Love. The Novel of the Four"). His co-authors were [[genre novelist]]s [[Alexandru Bilciurescu]] and [[SÄrmanul KlopÈtock]], alongside [[advice column]]ist I. Glicsman, better known as ''Doctor Ygrec''. With its [[Speculative fiction|speculative]] undertones, most of which were introduced in the text by Doctor Ygrec,&lt;ref name="dueliade"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cornel Ungureanu]], [http://revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1934&amp;editie=87 "Mircea Eliade Èi semnele literaturii"], in ''[[LuceafÄrul (magazine)|LuceafÄrul]]'', Nr. 8/2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stafiile dragostei'' is sometimes described as a [[parody]] of [[science fiction]] conventions, in line with similar works by [[Tudor Arghezi]] or [[Felix Aderca]] (''see [[Romanian science fiction]]'').&lt;ref&gt;GyÃ¶rgy GyÃ¶rfi-DeÃ¡k, "AÈa scrieÈi voi", in ''Pro-Scris'', Nr. 4/2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nour's contribution to the narrative only covers its more conventional and less ambitious episodes, which depict the [[epistolary novel]] of a sailor, Remus Iunian, and a recluse beauty, Tamara Heraclideâaccording to literary critic [[Cornel Ungureanu]]: "In the 1930s, everyone wrote epistolary novels and sentimental journals, but the worst would have to be those by Mr. Alexis Nour".&lt;ref name="dueliade"/&gt;

In his final years, Alexis Nour had a growing interest in the [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe]] and the proto-Romanian polity of [[Dacia]]. The last two of Nour's scholarly works were published posthumously, in 1941, with a Romanian Orthodox Church publishing house, at a time when Romania was ruled by the [[fascist]] [[National Legionary State|National Legionary]] regime. One was specifically dedicated to, and named after, the little-known "cult of [[Zalmoxis]]" (''Cultul lui Zalmoxis''). [[University of Turin]] academic Roberto Merlo notes that it formed part of a Zamolxian "fascination" among Romanian men of letters, also found in the research and essays of various others, from [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Dan Botta]] to [[Henric Sanielevici]] and [[Theodor SperanÈia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Roberto Merlo, [http://iit.iit.tuiasi.ro/philippide/asociatia/asociatia_admin/upload/II_2_merlo.pdf "Dal mediterraneo alla Tracia: spirito europeo e tradizione autoctona nella saggistica di Dan Botta"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006101809/http://iit.iit.tuiasi.ro/philippide/asociatia/asociatia_admin/upload/II_2_merlo.pdf |date=2011-10-06 }}, in the [[Romanian Academy]] ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 2/2006, p.56-57&lt;/ref&gt; The other study focused on [[Paleo-Balkan mythology]], and in particular on the supposed contributions of ancient [[Dacians]] and [[Getae]] to [[Romanian folklore]]: ''CredinÈe, rituri Èi superstiÈii geto-dace'' ("Gaeto-Dacian Beliefs, Rites and Superstitions"). The book was a co-recipient of the [[Vasile PÃ¢rvan]] Award, granted by the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="cd645-646"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Daicoviciu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1942/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1942_073_007_008.pdf "ÃnsemnÄri.

According to historiographer Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, Nour died in 1940.&lt;ref name="ghgb203"/&gt; He is buried at the [[Ghencea cemetery]] in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="ghgb203"/&gt;

'''Alice Voinescu''' (10 February 1885&amp;ndash;4 June 1961) was a [[Romania]]n writer, essayist, university professor, theater critic and translator. She was the first Romanian woman to become a Doctor of Philosophy, which she obtained from the [[Paris-Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]] in 1913 in [[Paris]]. In 1922, she became a professor of theatrical history at what would become the [[National University of Music Bucharest|Royal Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts]] in Bucharest, where she taught for over two decades. In 1948, she was removed from her department and spent a year and seven months in prisons in [[Jilava]] and [[Ghencea]]. After her detention, she was kept under [[house arrest]] in the village of [[CosteÈti, IaÈi|CosteÈti]] near [[TÃ¢rgu Frumos]] until 1954. Posthumously, her diary covering the interwar and communist period of Romania's history was discovered and published in 1997.

==Early life==
Alice Steriadi was born on 10 February 1885 in [[Turnu-Severin]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] to Massinca (nÃ©e Poenaru) and Sterie Steriadi. She was one of three daughters, born to the upper-middle-class family, headed by her father who was a Paris-educated lawyer. Her mother's family descended from [[Petrache Poenaru]], the noted educational reformer, and the couple provided a Western-European education for their daughters.{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=608}} By the age of five, Steriadi was able to read both [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[German language|German]] and by age six, she was studying [[French language|French]].{{sfn|''AdevÄrul''|2011}} She studied at the Lyceum in Turnu-Severin before enrolling at the [[University of Bucharest]].{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=46}}

After she graduated in 1908 from the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in [[Bucharest]], Steriadi went on an academic tour of Europe, studying first at [[Leipzig University]], with [[Theodor Lipps]] and [[Johannes Volkelt]], who introduced her to [[Hermann Cohen]]'s work on [[Immanuel Kant]]. Next she went to [[Munich]] and by 1910 had arrived in [[Paris]] to study at [[University of Paris|the Sorbonne]]. During the spring of 1911,{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=46}} Steriadi went to [[Marburg]], Germany, where she audited classes given at the [[University of Marburg]] with Cohen. She continued her education in Paris at the Sorbonne, studying under [[Lucien LÃ©vy-Bruhl]], earning a PhD ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in philosophy in 1913, with her successful defense of her thesis, ''The Interpretation of Kant's Doctrine by the Marburg School. A Study in Critical Idealism'' ({{lang-fr|LâInterprÃ©tation de la doctrine de Kant par lâEcole de Marburg. Etude sur lâidÃ©alisme crique}}).{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=608}}{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=46}}

Steriadi was the first Romanian woman to earn a doctorate in philosophy and received offers to continue her education in the United States or stay in Paris to become a lecturer.{{sfn|Stan|2014}}{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} Instead, she returned to Romania in 1915 and married the lawyer Stelian Voinescu. The marriage would prove to be an unhappy union.{{sfn|Stan|2014}} She joined the Christian Association of Women ({{lang-ro|AsociaÅ£ia CreÅtinÄ a Femeilor (ACF)}}), which was founded in 1919 by Queen [[Marie of Romania]] to provide a variety of philanthropic programs in the interwar period. The organization was aimed at providing upper- and middle-class Romanian women with ways to provide moral and charitable guidance by adopting the orthodox characterization of women, as empathetic mothers able to shape the social fabric of society through their love and devotion.{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=610}}

==Career==
As there was no avenue for a woman to teach at the [[University of Bucharest]] at that time, in 1922, Voinescu joined the faculty of the [[National University of Music Bucharest|Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Art]], renamed as the Royal Conservatory in 1931. She lectured on [[aesthetics]], [[Philosophical theory|theory]] and the [[history of theater]].{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=609}}{{sfn|Morariu|2014}} She began broadcasting educational programs on the radio in 1924.{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} Between 1928 and 1939, Voinescu traveled annually to France to participate in conferences organised by [[Paul Desjardins]] at [[Pontigny Abbey]]. The meetings brought together international intellectuals to evaluate the future of Europe after [[World War I]]. Among those she met there were [[Charles du Bos]], [[Roger Martin du Gard]], [[AndrÃ© Gide]], [[Paul Langevin]], [[AndrÃ© Malraux]], [[FranÃ§ois Mauriac]], and [[Jacques RiviÃ¨re]].{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=609}} At one of these meetings in 1929, du Gard questioned why she did not keep a journal. From that point on, Voinescu became a [[diarist]], keeping careful record of the personalities and events she encountered day to day,{{sfn|Stan|2014}} though often with long gaps between entries.{{sfn|Morariu|2014}}

Between 1932 and 1942 she made a series of radio presentations evaluating women's place in Romanian society. Some of the topics included ''Directions in Womenâs  Education'', ''The Psychology of Todayâs Working Women'', ''The Psychology of Todayâs Youth'', which considered whether intellect and femininity were at odds.  Voinescu believed that education improved women's ability to be agents of empathy and the moral caregivers of society. She was ambivalent towards women's groups which were based on a Western model and strove for emancipation of women, because she felt that they did not address the Romanian reality. In her radio speeches, she warned that erasing gender differences would result in women being limited by a male view of identity.{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=610}}{{sfn|''AdevÄrul''|2011}}

Voinescu began publishing, with such works as ''Montaigne, omul Åi opera'' (Montaigne, life and work, 1936); ''Aspecte din teatrul contemporan'' (Aspects of contemporary theater, 1941); and ''Eschil'' (Aeschylus, 1946).{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=609}} She also contributed to the ''Istoria filosofiei moderne'' (History of Modern Philosophy, 1936) with works evaluating [[Philosophical skepticism|French skepticism]] and [[Neo-Kantianism]].{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} She contributed to ''Ideea europeanÄ'' magazine and published the theatre column for ''[[Revista FundaÈiilor Regale]]''.{{sfn|Sasu|2004}} During this same time, she also began teaching at the School of Social Work, which inspired a brochure ''Contribution dans la Psychologie dans lâAssistance Sociale en Roumanie'' (Contributions to the psychology of social work in Romania, 1938),{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=609}} as well as writing theater critiques.{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} While continuing to teach at the Royal Conservatory, she also lectured at the French Institute and the Free University of Bucharest.{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=609}} Between 1939 and 1940, Voinescu prepared a publication about four playwrights discussing the works of [[Paul Claudel]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Frank Wedekind]]. She also wrote a condemnation of those who had assassinated [[Nicolae Iorga]].{{sfn|''AdevÄrul''|2011}} Her husband died in 1940 and after his death, her journal entries intimately related to him as a confidant, which she had not experienced during his lifetime due to his numerous infidelities.{{sfn|Morariu|2014}}{{sfn|Stan|2014}}

In 1948, under the nascent [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Voinescu was forcibly retired and to relive the stress, began work on ''Scrisori cÄtre fiul Åi fiica mea'' (Letters to My Son and Daughter), a fictional work addressed to children that the childless Voinescu never had.{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} The work would not be published until after her death.{{sfn|Stan|2014}} In 1951, she was accused of being a monarchist and of hiding her support for [[Michael I of Romania|King Michael]] after his forced [[abdication]].{{sfn|Morariu|2014}}{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} Arrested after attending intellectual resistance conferences held by [[Petru Manoliu]] at the Free University, Voinescu was held for a year at the Ghencea camp before being sent to the [[Jilava]] prison.{{sfn|Muzeul Sighet|2016}} She spent nineteen months in prison{{sfn|Morariu|2014}}{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} and then was kept under house arrest in a small village of [[CosteÈti, IaÈi|CosteÈti]] in [[IaÈi County]] in the northern part of the country for another year.{{sfn|Morariu|2014}}{{sfn|Georgescu|2006|p=611}} The village was very isolated, being impossible to reach except by horseback during spring and autumn rains and with roads completely impassible in winter due to blizzard conditions. Voinescu was even forbidden to attend church to limit her contact with people.{{sfn|Iancu|2002}} Friends, such as [[Petru Groza]], [[Mihail Jora]], and [[Tudor Vianu]] intervened with authorities to secure her release with a small pension.{{sfn|''AdevÄrul''|2011}}

Voinescu returned home in 1954 and worked as a literary translator for such works as ''[[Michael Kohlhaas]]'' by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and short stories by [[Thomas Mann]]. The work kept her busy and wasn't likely to have the same political repercussions as creating her own works. In 1960 and 1961, she worked on ''ÃntÃ¢lnire cu eroi din literaturÄ Èi teatru'' (Encounters with Heroes in Literature and Drama, 1983){{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} and occasionally was asked to make translations for colleagues.{{sfn|Morariu|2014}}

==Death and legacy==
Voinescu died during the night between 3 and 4 June 1961.{{sfn|Dingeldein|2009|p=47}} In 1983, Eminescu Publishing House released ''Tragic Heroes'', edited by Valeriu RÃ¢peanu{{sfn|Morariu|2014}} and then in 1994 ''Letters to My Son and Daughter'' was published.{{sfn|Stan|2014}} In 1997, Maria Ana Murnu edited and published with Editura Albatros, ''The Journal'', Voinescu's rediscovered diaries, which was reissued in 2013 by Biblioteca Polirom.{{sfn|Morariu|2014}} ''The Journal'' included notes about cultural personalities from the interwar and postwar periods; her relationships with other people, particularly her interactions with the villagers during her confinement; and her musings on historical and social issues during the time which had been obscured behind political agenda.{{sfn|Stan|2014}}{{sfn|Iancu|2002}} She explored candidly her experiences, such as her abhorrence of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and the [[propaganda]] justifying government confiscations and [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]] of properties of [[Romanian Jews]], while simultaneously pondering whether she would be able to obtain one of those houses to alleviate the financial straits in which her husband's death had left her.{{sfn|Bucur|2016|p=152}}{{sfn|Ionescu|2015|p=86}} She decried the persecution of the [[Romani people]]{{sfn|Ionescu|2015|p=121}} and her frustrations of the vulnerability women faced because of societal restrictions.{{sfn|Wingfield|Bucur|2006|p=184}} ''Scrisori din CosteÈti'' (Letters from CosteÈti), written during her house arrest, was published in 2001.{{sfn|Stan|2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7145">{{dablink|The page is about the ethical doctrine. For other uses of the word, see [[altruism]].}}

'''Altruism''' (also called the '''ethic of altruism''', '''moralistic altruism''', and '''ethical altruism''') is an [[ethics|ethical doctrine]] that holds that the [[morality|moral]] value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself. [[James Fieser]] states the altruist dictum as: "An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Comte]]'s version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others. One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an "altruist."

The word "altruism" (''French, altruisme, from autrui: "other people", derived from Latin alter: "other"'') was coined by [[Auguste Comte]], the French founder of [[positivism]], in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a [[moral obligation]] to renounce self-interest and live for others. Comte says, in his ''CatÃ©chisme Positiviste'',&lt;ref name="comte"&gt;[[Auguste Comte|Comte, August]]. ''CatÃ©chisme positiviste'' (1852) or ''Catechism of Positivism'', trans. R. Congreve, (London: Kegan Paul, 1891)&lt;/ref&gt; that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This ["to live for others"], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' says that for Comte's altruism, "The first principle of morality...is the regulative supremacy of social sympathy over the self-regarding instincts."&lt;ref name="catholicencyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01369a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia entry on altruism'']&lt;/ref&gt; Author Gabriel Moran, (professor in the department of Humanities and the Social Sciences, New York University) says "The law and duty of life in altruism [for Comte] was summed up in the phrase : Live for others."&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Gabriel Moran ''Christian Religion and National Interests''&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[philosophers]] define the doctrine in various ways, but all definitions generally revolve around a moral obligation to benefit others or the pronouncement of moral value in serving others rather than oneself. Philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] defines altruism as "the doctrine that each of us has a special obligation to benefit others."&lt;ref name="cheney"&gt;Cheney, D. R. (Editor), ''Broad's critical essays in moral philosophy'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;283â301). London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher W. G. Maclagan defines it as "a duty to relieve the distress and promote the happiness of our fellows...Altruism is to...maintain quite simply that a man may and should discount altogether his own pleasure or happiness as such when he is deciding what course of action to pursue."&lt;ref name="maclagan"&gt;''Self and Others: A Defense of Altruism'' Philosophical Quarterly 4 (1954): pp 109â110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As consequentialist ethics==
Altruism is often seen as a form of [[consequentialism]], as it indicates that an action is ethically right if it brings good consequences to others. Altruism may be seen as similar to [[utilitarianism]], however an essential difference is that the latter prescribes acts that maximize good consequences for all of society, while altruism prescribes maximizing good consequences for everyone except the actor. Spencer argued that since the rest of society will almost always outnumber the utilitarian, a genuine utilitarian will inevitably end up practicing altruism or a form of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Ethics'' Â§85ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effective altruism]] is a philosophy and social movement that maintains that the consequences of our actions - for ourselves and others - are important, and seeks to maximise the overall quality of these consequences.

==Criticisms==
[[David Kelley]], discussing [[Ayn Rand]]'s views, says that "there is no rational ground for asserting that sacrificing yourself in order to serve others is morally superior to pursuing your own (long-term, rational) self-interest. Altruism ultimately depends on non-rational 'rationales,' on mysticism in some form..." Furthermore, he holds that there is a danger of the state enforcing that moral ideal: "If self-sacrifice is an ideal - if service to others is the highest, most honorable course of action - why not force people to act accordingly?" He believes this can ultimately result in the state forcing everyone into a [[collectivist]] political system.&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;Kelley, David. https://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/3666-epistemology-and-politics-ayn-rand-s-cultural-commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian eco-philosopher [[Arne NÃ¦ss]] argues that environmental action based upon altruism â or service of the other â stems from a shrunken "egoic" concept of the self.  Self-actualization will result, he argues, in the recovery of an "[[ecological self]]", in which actions formerly seen as altruistic are in reality a form of [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref name="seed"&gt;Seed, John, Macy, Joanna, Naess, Arne, &amp; Fleming, Pat (1988). "Thinking Like a Mountain: Towards a Council of All Beings" (New Society Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two different ways in which the strong can help the weak, one which is an expression of love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of oneâs own life and existence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 88â89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another which is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peopleâs business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 95â96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 96â97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16483">'''Bhava Samadhi''' is a state of ecstatic consciousness that can sometimes be a seemingly spontaneous experience, but is recognized generally to be the culmination of long periods of devotional practices.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sivananda See [http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1526 here], Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 109 Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi "The Path Supreme" 2010 page 160 and See [http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi here].&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some groups to be evoked through the presence of "higher beings."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, "Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi", pp 87-9,&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Bhava]]" means "feeling", "emotion", "mood", "mental attitude" or "devotional state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.arcadelamor.org/storytellingmonk/ref/glossaries/b.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408022722/http://www.arcadelamor.org/storytellingmonk/ref/glossaries/b.htm |date=April 8, 2010 }}, [http://en.mimi.hu/yoga/bhava.html here] and Swami Sivananda [http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1526 here]&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Samadhi]]" is a state of consciousness in which the mind becomes completely still (one-pointed or concentrated) and the consciousness of the experiencing subject becomes one with the experienced object.  Thus, "''bhava samadhi''" denotes an advanced spiritual state in which the emotions of the mind are channelled into one-pointed concentration and the practitioner experiences devotional ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi, "The Path Supreme" 2010, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Bhava samadhi'' has been experienced by notable figures in Indian spiritual history, including Sri [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]] and some of his disciples, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] and his chief disciple Nityananda, [[Mirabai]] and numerous saints in the ''[[bhakti]]'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Lt.

== Meaning ==
[[File:Ramakrishna trance 1879.jpg|thumb|[[Ramakrishna]] in samadhi at the house of Keshab Chandra Sen. He is seen supported by his nephew Hriday and surrounded by brahmo devotees.]]
''Bhava samadhi'', sometimes translated as 'trance', has no direct counterpart in the English language, though "ecstasy" is the closest translation.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sarananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 403 &amp; pp 520&lt;/ref&gt; The various translations that have been proposed all refer to an ecstatic state of consciousness, which is attained by channelling the emotions into one-pointed concentration.  For example, in ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', the author, M., later identified as [[Mahendranath Gupta]], recounts observing Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's introverted mood in which he became "unconscious of the outer world."&lt;ref&gt;M., ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  M. later "learnt that this mood is called ''bhava'', ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;M., ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, 1942, pp. 78; see also Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Meditation, Mind and Patanjali's Yoga'', pp. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bhava" denotes the mood of ecstasy and self-surrender which is induced by the maturing of devotion to one's '''Ishta deva' '' (object of devotion).&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Bhava]]" literally means feeling, emotion, mood, or devotional state of mind. This refers to the aspirant's emotional life, which in the practice of ''jnana'' or ''raja'' yoga is controlled in order to transcend the spheres of the mind and intellect. In ''bhakti'' yoga, however, ''bhava'' is neither controlled nor suppressed, but is transformed into devotion and channelled to the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Definition can be found at [http://www.tarayogacentre.co.uk/glossary.html Tara Yoga Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127074505/http://www.tarayogacentre.co.uk/glossary.html |date=January 27, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Sivananda]] states it is an "internal feeling" that needs to be developed through proper practice just like any other faculty of the mind e.g. memory or will power.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Sivananda [http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1526 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa real bhava can only be said to occur when the relationship with the Divine is so established that it remains fixed in our consciousness at all times, "whether eating, drinking, sitting or sleeping." &lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp432&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when the ''bhava'' has fully ripened does the ''sadhaka'' (spiritual seeker) experience "''bhava samadhi''." &lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 109. and Swami Devananda, Meditation and mantra, Motilal Banarsidass, 1978, pp258&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhava samadhi'' occurs when the emotions are perfectly channelled into one-pointed concentration on the object of one's devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi, "The Path Supreme," 2010 page 160&lt;/ref&gt;   It has also been described as "Absorption in meditation due to emotional cause, e.g. ''kirtan'' [devotional music]"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.padma.org.uk/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Yoga%20Glossary here].&lt;/ref&gt; and "sheer ecstasy, a condition caused when the heart is seized by the Divine embrace."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.russillpaul.com/articles/article/1162814/10603.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113175841/http://www.russillpaul.com/articles/article/1162814/10603.htm |date=January 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotional practices that can evoke ''bhava'', such as "bhajans" and ''kirtan'' (spiritual music), are standard practices in the ''bhakti'' tradition, and in the missions of many Indian saints including Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and [[Shivabalayogi]] Maharaj.  Shri Shivabalayogi often used the words "bhava" and "bhava samadhi" interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, ''Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi'', p 203.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained ''bhava'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone is in some sort of ''bhava'' of the guru because of their attachment to the guru. The mind's attachment and devotion is the true ''bhava''."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple,'' pp. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
âBhava is the beginning for samadhi and tapas. Higher souls induce it. Bhava helps in physical, mental, and spiritual progress."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, ''Swamiji's Treasure, God Realization and Experiences of Shivabalayogi'' pp. 324-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The qualities required for a genuine bhava samadhi have been emphasized by Ramakrishna Paramahamsa when he said that a spiritual experience of a lower plane may be had by "the momentary exuberance of emotions" but the scriptures say bhava samadhi is impossible to retain unless worldly desires have been removed and proper qualities have been established like renunciation and detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 520&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misuse and controversy ==

There have been many misuses and controversies associated with ''bhava samadhi''.  Firstly, ''bhava'' itself has been mistaken to be an advanced spiritual state, whereas the great exponent of ''bhava samadhi'', Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, made it clear to his disciple, [[Swami Vivekananda]], that ''bhava'' is a preliminary state of consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Witnessing the religious ecstasy (bhava) of several devotees, Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) one day said to the Master that he too wanted to experience it. 'My child,' he was told, 'when a huge elephant enters a small pond, a great commotion is set up, but when it plunges into the Ganga, the river shows very little agitation. These devotees are like small ponds; a little experience makes their feelings flow over the brim. But you are a huge river.' "&lt;ref&gt;See online [http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda_biography/04_training.htm Vivekananda biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several other times Ramakrishna Paramahamsa made the same point like when he told one of his close devotees Gopalchandra Ghosh (later known as [[Disciples of Ramakrishna|Swami Advaitananda]], his most senior monastic disciple) that it was not so important to experience such a temporary ecstasy (bhava) and that on the spiritual path "true faith and renunciation are far greater."&lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 403&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''bhava'' is a preliminary experience has also been emphasized by Shivabalayogi Maharaj:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"During this all your ''bhava'' (the mindâs feelings) will get concentrated on your favorite deity and thus your mind becomes more concentrated, more single-pointed. Then meditation itself becomes much easier and consequently one would take up meditation more willingly. "It's like giving chocolate to a child to make it go to school. But one should not settle just for the chocolate - one must go on to school. In the same way, one must meditate."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple'' pp. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secondly, people have falsely claimed to have spontaneously attained spiritual powers and experiences through ''bhava'', whereas ''bhava samadhi'' is the culmination of a long period of devotional practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 109, and [http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bhava'' has even been used by people to falsely claim that they are "possessed by sacred deities" and to issue orders on behalf of these deities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple'' pp. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; If the ''bhava'' is genuine, however, the person will become non-violent and introverted, and will not claim or give instructions through ''bhava''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings Teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual efforts should always enable the mind to recede and become quiet, going introverted toward the Self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings Teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt;  Swami Vivekananda warned ''sadhaks'' (spiritual aspirants) to beware of claims made of ''bhava'' experiences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He pointed out that Ramakrishna had been through long years of strictest self discipline and that his ecstasy was a fruit of that discipline, not a superficial emotionalism. "When people try to practice religion," said Naren "eighty percent of them turn into cheats, and about fifteen percent go mad. Its only the remaining five percent who get some direct knowledge of the Truth and so become blessed. So Beware."&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, C., ''Ramakrishna and His Disciples'', 1980, {{ISBN|978-0-87481-037-0}} pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thirdly, genuine ''bhava samadhi'', which is an internal state of consciousness, has been identified with outer movements of the body, such as dancing and singing. It has been claimed that "the very nature of ''bhava'' itself - sometimes having such vigorous outward expression in action and movement - had always meant that those who wished attention or status in a group would sometimes simply pretend to be in ''bhava'' to obtain some personal gain."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple'' pp. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it has been made clear by Ramakrishna that emotional displays do not constitute spiritual experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One evening Subodh (later to become Swami Subodhananda) observed the devotees dancing and singing Kirtan in the Masters room at Dakshineshwar. They were overwhelmed with devotion. Shri Ramakrishna himself joined them and his ecstasy surcharged the whole place with heavenly bliss.  Some were crying, some laughing, some dancing. Others were transfixed like motionless statues, and some began to roll on the floor. Subodh was very skeptical about this kind of emotional display ... [He asked] "who had real ecstasy in the kirtan today?" The Master thought for a while and then said, "Today Latu (later to become [[Swami Adbhutananda]]) alone had the fullest measure of it; some others had sprinklings."&lt;ref&gt;Swami Chetananda, ''God Lived with Them'' {{ISBN|81-7505-198-1}}, 1997, pp. 536-537.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The depth of ''bhava'' experience varies across different individuals and depends on the spiritual maturity of their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Mature ''sadhaks'' usually do not display outward signs of ''bhava'', which are indicative of the depth of their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi "The Path Supreme" 2010 page 160, Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of devotees attempting to make claims about their inner state of consciousness by imitating external indicators of genuine ''bhava samadhi'' was addressed by Swami Vivekananda in the Ramakrishna Mission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was discovered that several were actually trying to induce the outer physical symptoms of ''Samadhi'' and also imitate the movements of one who is dancing in ecstasy. Naren reasoned with these devotees and persuaded them to stop starving themselves and eat wholesome food, and to try control their emotions instead of cultivating hysteria. The result was an increase in spirituality and a decrease in outer show.&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, C., ''Ramakrishna and His Disciples'' Vedanta Press, 1980, {{ISBN|978-0-87481-037-0}}, pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The actions of people in bhava samadhi, like dancing in ecstasy, can appear very strange to some. In Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj's mission various levels of bhava occurred to hundreds of people. Bhava was controversial throughout Shivabalayogi's public programs, and his own statements on the phenomenon appear inconsistent. Although some were acting or misusing the experience, when people complained to Sri Shivabalayogi, he was intolerant of most criticism or interference. "It is not drama. It really happens."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, ''Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi'', p 203, &amp; ''Swamiji's Treasure, God Realization &amp; Experiences of Shivabalayogi'', pp 326-7 &amp; 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

To place bhava samadhi into the correct spiritual context Ramakrishna Paramahansa said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If the depth of spiritual experiences is to be measured, it must be done from observing one's steadfastness, renunciation, strength of character, the attenuation of desires for enjoyment etc. It is by this touchstone alone, and no other means, that the amount of dross in ecstacy can be assessed." &lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 405&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Black Cat Analogy''' is an [[analogy]], accounting for the differences, mainly between [[science]] and [[religion]], but also between others, such as [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]].

==Description==
The analogy can be described like this:

*Philosophy is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat.
*Metaphysics is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there.
*Theology is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there, and shouting "I found it!"
*Science is like being in a dark room looking for a black cat while using a flashlight.

It can also be applied to other bodies of knowledge or learning, for example by [[Ernest Gellner]] to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=doniger/&gt;

==Explanation==
Vincent Barry explains the difference between philosophy and [[theology]] as lying in the fact that philosophy is scientific and open-minded, concerned with proof, while theologians "have found their final truth" before they begin the search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=Vincent|title=Bioethics in a Cultural Context|date=2011|publisher=Cengage|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ie0XO1aKVSsC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=yWfum64HEM&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Many variations on the analogy exist, and they have been variously attributed to several famous figures at different times (e.g. [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Misquoted misquotations of Charles Darwin]), but the quotation has been around since at least the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 15 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= A Blind Man in a Dark Room Looking for a Black Cat That Is Not There |url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/15/hidden-cat/ | first= Garson| last= OâToole| date= 15 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its absolute origin is unknown.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 19 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Philosopher, the Theologian, and the Elusive Black Cat|url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/19/philo-cat/| first= Garson| last= OâToole| date= 19 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Wendy Doniger]] relates it to a French and English [[proverb]]: "In the dark, all cats are grey." [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] criticised naive ideas of the Absolute, which he ridiculed as "like a night, as people say, in which all cows are black." [[Dashiell Hammett]] in ''[[The Dain Curse]]'' (1929) referred to a "blind man in a dark room hunting for a black hat that wasn't there". [[Ernest Gellner]] referred to an [[East European]] joke about science, philosophy, and [[Marxism]] as looking for a cat in a dark room with various consequences: with science the cat is present, with philosophy absent, and with Marxism absent but found.&lt;ref name=doniger&gt;{{cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The Implied Spider|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=31â33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76Oh3p2vpe4C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;ots=Ut0qmJjwux&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bryan Edgar Magee''' (born 12 April 1930)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday's today|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2012-4-12.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=12 April 2012|quote=Mr Bryan Magee, writer, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[British people|British]] [[philosopher]], broadcaster, politician, author, and poet, best known as a popularizer of philosophy.

==Early life==
Born of working class parents in [[Hoxton]], Magee was close to his father, but had a difficult relationship with his abusive and overbearing mother. An evacuee during [[World War II]], he was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] school on a [[London County Council]] scholarship. During this formative period, he developed a keen interest in socialist politics, while during the school holidays he enjoyed listening to political orators at [[Speakers' Corner]], Hyde Park, London as well as regular visits to the theatre and concerts.

During his [[National Service]] he served in the [[British Army]] and in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] seeking possible [[espionage|spies]] among the refugees crossing the border between [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Austria]]. After [[demobilisation]] he won a scholarship to [[Keble College, Oxford]] where he studied History as an undergraduate and then [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Bryan|title=Confessions of a Philosopher|year=1998|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-375-50028-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends at Oxford included [[Robin Day]], [[William Rees-Mogg]], [[Jeremy Thorpe]] and [[Michael Heseltine]]. While at university, Magee was elected president of the [[Oxford Union]]. He spent a year studying philosophy at [[Yale University]] on a post-graduate fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Bryan|title=Confessions of a Philosopher|year=1998|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-375-50028-6|pages=122â138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an honorary fellow at [[Keble College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/about/keble-today/Current-honorary-fellows|title=Current Honorary Fellows â Keble College|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Britain from Yale in 1958 with hopes of becoming a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament (MP). He twice stood unsuccessfully for [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]], at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]] and the [[Mid Bedfordshire by-election, 1960|1960 by-election]], and instead took a job presenting the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] current affairs television programme ''[[This Week (ITV TV series)|This Week]]''. He made documentary programmes about subjects of social concern such as prostitution, [[sexually transmitted diseases]], abortion and homosexuality (illegal in Britain at the time).

He was eventually elected MP for [[Leyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Leyton]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], but found himself out of tune with the Labour Party's leftward tendencies under [[Michael Foot]]. On 22 January 1982 he resigned the Labour whip and he subsequently (in March 1982) joined the defection of moderate Labour MPs to the newly founded [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. He lost his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] and returned to writing and broadcasting which, indeed, he had continued during his parliamentary career.

== Broadcaster and writer ==
At Oxford, Magee had mixed with poets as well as politicians and in 1951 published a volume of verse through the [[Reginald Caton|Fortune Press]]. The publisher did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves â a similar deal had been struck with such writers as [[Dylan Thomas]] and [[Philip Larkin]] for their first anthologies. The slim volume was dedicated to the memory of [[Richard Wagner]], with a quote from [[Rilke]]'s ''[[Duino Elegies]]'': ''...&amp;nbsp;das SchÃ¶ne ist nichts als des Schrecklichen Anfang, den wir noch grade ertragen'' ("...&amp;nbsp;beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, that we are still able to bear").&lt;ref&gt;Magee, B. (1951), ''Crucifixion and Other Poems'', London, Fortune Press&lt;/ref&gt; Magee said later: "I'm rather ashamed of the poems now, although I have written poems since which I haven't published, which I secretly think are rather good. It has always been a dimension of what I do."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/07/classicalmusicandopera.interviews|title=I think, therefore I write|date=6 June 2003|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magee's most important influence in popular culture, however, remains his efforts to make philosophy accessible to the layman. In 1970â1971, he presented a series for [[BBC Radio]] entitled ''Modern British Philosophy''. The series took the form of Magee in conversation with a number of contemporary British and American philosophers, discussing both their own work, the work of earlier 20th century British philosophers (and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]), and the relationship between philosophy and other fields such as religion and the arts. The series began with an introductory conversation between Magee and British philosopher [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]. Other programs included discussions on [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]] and [[J. L. Austin]], and the relationship between philosophy and religion, among others. The transcripts of the series are available in the book, ''Modern British Philosophy''.

In 1978, Magee presented for BBC television 15 dialogues with noted philosophers in a series called ''[[Men of Ideas]]''. Following an "Introduction to Philosophy" presented by Magee in discussion with [[Isaiah Berlin]], Magee discussed topics like [[Marxist philosophy]], the [[Frankfurt School]], the ideas of [[Chomsky]] and modern [[Existentialism]] in subsequent episodes. Transcripts of the dialogues within the ''Men of Ideas'' series are available in published form in the book, ''Talking Philosophy''.

Another BBC television series, ''[[The Great Philosophers]]'', followed in 1987. In this series, Magee discussed the major historical figures of Western philosophy with fifteen contemporary philosophers. The series covered the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Descartes]], among others, ending with a discussion with [[John Searle]] on the philosophy of Wittgenstein. Transcripts of ''The Great Philosophers'' are available in published form in a book of the same name.  ''The Story of Thought'' (also published as ''The Story of Philosophy'') also covers the history of Western philosophy.

In 1997 Magee's ''Confessions of a Philosopher'' was published, which essentially offered an introduction to philosophy in autobiographical form. The book was involved in a [[libel]] lawsuit as a result of Magee repeating the rumour that [[Ralph Schoenman]], a controversial associate of Bertrand Russell during the philosopher's final decade, had been planted by the [[CIA]] in an effort to discredit Russell. Schoenman successfully sued Magee for libel in the UK, with the result that the first printing of the British edition of the book was pulped.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} A second defamation suit, filed in California against [[Random House]], was settled in 2001. The allegations were expunged by settlement, and a new edition was issued and provided to more than 700 academic and public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=libraryjournal.com|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA156369.html|work=Schoenman Settles Defamation Suit Against Random|accessdate=31 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617165923/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA156369.html|archivedate=17 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Confessions of a Philosopher'', Magee charts his own philosophical development in an autobiographical context. He also emphasizes the importance of [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy as a serious attempt to solve philosophical problems. In addition to this, he launches a critique of [[analytic philosophy]], particularly in its linguistic form over three chapters, contesting its fundamental principles and lamenting its influence.

His book, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'' (first published in 1983) remains one of the most substantial and wide-ranging treatments of Schopenhauer; it is particularly appreciated for its several essay-appendices in which Magee assesses in depth his influence on Wittgenstein, Wagner and other creative writers. He also addresses Schopenhauer's thoughts on homosexuality and the influence of [[Buddhism]] on his philosophy. He regards the work as his "academic magnum opus".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Magee has a particular interest in the life, thought and music of Richard Wagner and has written two notable books on the composer and his world ''Aspects of Wagner'' (1968; rev. ed. 1988), and ''The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy'' (2001). He is also an admirer of the philosophy of Karl Popper on whom he has written an introduction (Modern Masters series, 1997).

Magee's novel ''Facing Death'', published in 1977, was originally written under the title ''Love Story'', though it is not to be confused with the [[Love Story (1970 film)|1970 film of the same name]], nor the book by [[Erich Segal]] upon which that film was based.

In 2016, approaching his 86th birthday, Magee had his book ''Ultimate Questions'' published by [[Princeton University]]. Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Julian Baggini]] said "Magee doesn't always match his clarity of expression with rigour of argument, sometimes ignoring his own principle that the feeling "Yes, surely this must be right" is "not a validation, not even a credential". But this can be excused. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] claimed that philosophy begins with wonder. Magee is proof that for some, the wonder never dies, it only deepens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/ultimate-questions-by-bryan-magee-book-review-a-wonderful-wonder-full-life-a6950296.html|title=Ultimate Questions by Bryan Magee: A wonderful, wonder-full life|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=24 March 2016| accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1953 Magee was appointed to a teaching job in [[Sweden]] and while there met Ingrid Soderlund, a [[pharmacist]] in the university laboratory. They married and had one daughter, Gunnela and, in time, also three grandchildren. Magee later said: "The marriage broke up pretty quickly and it was a fairly disastrous period of my life. I came back to Oxford as a postgraduate. But since then Sweden has been a part of my life. I go there every year and my daughter visits me. I always assumed that sooner or later I'd get married again but it never quite happened, although I had some very long relationships. And now I don't want to get married again. I like the freedom."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

His autobiography, ''Clouds of Glory: A Hoxton Childhood'', won the [[J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography]] in 2004.

'''Buddhist prayer beads''' or '''malas''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|''mÄlÄ''}} "[[garland]]"&lt;ref name="APTE"&gt;Apte, Vaman Shivram (1965), written at Delhi, The Practical Sanskrit Dictionary (Fourth revised and enlarged ed.), Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|81-208-0567-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a traditional tool used to count the number of times a [[mantra]] is recited, breaths while [[samadhi|meditating]], counting [[prostration (Buddhism)|prostrations]], or the [[nianfo|repetitions of a buddha's name]]. They are similar to other forms of [[prayer beads]] used in various world religions and therefore the term "Buddhist rosary" also appears.

Conventional Buddhist tradition counts the beads at 108, signifying the mortal desires of mankind. The number is attributed to the ''Mokugenji'' (soapberry seed) ''Sutra'' wherein [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] instructed King Virudhaka to make such beads and recite the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism. In later years, various Buddhist sects would either retain the number of beads, or divide them into consecutive twos, fours, for brevity or informality.  A decorative tassel is sometimes attached to the beads, flanked by talismans or amulets depending on one's local tradition. Because prayer beads are often painted in pigment, various traditional schools attribute a consecration ritual by the [[Sangha]] to the beads, to "open the eyes" for the purpose of achieving Enlightenment unique to the Karma of each believer.

[[File:Buddhist prayer beads for sale.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Buddhist prayer beads at a [[Jodo Shin]] shop.]]
Malas are used for keeping count while reciting, chanting, or mentally repeating a [[mantra]] or the name or names of a [[deity]]. This [[sÄdhanÄ]] (practice) is known in Sanskrit as ''[[japa]]''. Malas are typically made with 18, 27, 54 or 108 beads.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], malas of 108 beads are used.  Some practitioners use malas of 21 or 28 beads for doing [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostrations]]. In Tibetan Buddhism, malas are mainly used to count mantras. These mantras can be recited for different purposes linked to working with mind. The material used to make the beads can vary according to the purpose of the mantras used. Some beads can be used for all purposes and all kinds of mantras. These beads can be made from the wood of ''[[Ficus religiosa]]'' (bo or bodhi tree), or from "bodhi seeds", which come from [[rudraksha]].

Another general-purpose mala is made from [[rattan]] seeds;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.botanicalbeads.com/BBB_page_99.html&lt;/ref&gt; the beads themselves called "moon and stars" by Tibetans, and variously called "lotus root", "lotus seed" and "linden nut" by various retailers. The bead itself is very hard and dense, ivory-coloured (which gradually turns a deep golden brown with long use), and has small holes (moons) and tiny black dots (stars) covering its surface.

Pacifying mantras are often at recited using white colored malas. Materials such as [[crystal]], [[pearl]], shell/conch or [[nacre]] are preferable. These are said to purify the mind and clear away obstacles like illness, bad karma and mental disturbances. Using pearls is not practical however, as repeated use will destroy their iridescent layer. Most often, [[pearl]] malas are used for jewelry.

Increasing mantras should be recited using malas of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]] and [[amber]]. The mantras counted on these can "serve to increase life span, knowledge and merit."&lt;ref name="BN"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b_beeds.htm Buddha Dharma Education Association and Buddhanet.com ''Buddhist studies: Malas (beads)''] Retrieved 2009-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantras for magnetizing should be recited using malas made of [[saffron]], lotus seed, [[sandalwood]], or other forms of wood including [[elm]], [[peach]], and [[rosewood]]. However, it is said the most effective is made of [[precious coral]], which, due to a ban on harvesting, is now very rare and expensive.

Mantras to tame by forceful means should be recited using malas made of Rudraksha beads or bone. Reciting mantras with this kind of mala is said to tame others, but with the motivation to unselfishly help other sentient beings.&lt;ref name="BN"/&gt; Malas to tame by forceful means or subdue harmful energies, such as "extremely malicious spirits, or general afflictions", are made from rudraksha seeds, or even [[human bones]], with 108 beads on the string. It is said that only a person that is motivated by great compassion for all beings, including those they try to tame, can do this.&lt;ref name="BN"/&gt;

===Usage===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:Ladakh (1057678232).jpg|thumb|A man praying with prayer beads, Ladakh]]
Mantras and chants are typically repeated hundreds or even thousands of times. The mala is used so that one can focus on the meaning or sound of the mantra rather than counting its repetitions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} One repetition is usually said for each bead while turning the thumb [[clockwise]] around each bead, though some traditions or practices may call for counterclockwise motion or specific hand and finger usage. When arriving at the Guru bead, some{{Who|date=August 2016}} assert that both Hindus and Tibetan Buddhists traditionally turn the mala around and then go back in the opposing direction. However,  some teachers in the Tibetan traditions{{Who|date=August 2016}} and beyond emphasize that this is superstitious and therefore not so important.

Within the Buddhist tradition, this repetition of the beads serves to remind practitioners of the teaching that it is possible to break the cycle of birth and death.

In case it is necessary to recite a very large number of mantras, Tibetan Buddhist malas have bell and dorje counters (a short string of ten beads, usually silver, with a bell or dorje at the bottom). The dorje counter is used to count each round around the mala, and the bell counter to count each time the dorje counter runs out of beads. After that, the dorje counter is reset. These counters are placed at different points on the mala depending on tradition, sometimes at the 10th, 21st or 25th bead from the Guru bead. Traditionally, one begins the mala in the direction of the dorje (skillful means) proceeding on to the bell (wisdom) with each round.

A 'bhum' counter, often a small brass or silver clasp in the shape of a jewel or wheel, is used to count 1000 repetitions, and is moved forward between the main beads of the mala, starting at the Guru bead, with each accumulation of 1000.

==Japanese Beads ==
[[File:Jodo Shu Buddhist prayer beads.jpg|thumb|This is an example of the double-ring ''onenju'' or ''nikka juzu'' used by the [[JÅdo-shÅ«]].]]

In [[Buddhism in Japan]], Buddhist prayer beads are known as {{nihongo|''ojuzu''|æ°ç ||counting beads}} or {{nihongo|''onenju''|å¿µç ||thought beads}}, where the "o" is the [[Honorific speech in Japanese#Honorific prefixes|honorific ''o-'']]. Different Buddhist sects in Japan have different shaped juzus, and use them differently.  For example, [[Shingon Buddhism]], [[Tendai]] and [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may use longer prayer beads with strands on both ends similar to those used in mainland Asia.  During devotional services, these beads may be rubbed together with both hands to create a soft grinding noise, which is considered to have a purifying effect.  However, in [[JÅdo ShinshÅ«]], prayer beads are typically shorter and held draped over both hands and are not ground together.

[[JÅdo-shÅ«]] is somewhat unusual because of the use of a double-ringed prayer beads, called {{nihongo|'''nikka juzu'''|æ¥èª²æ°ç ||}}, which are used for counting [[nianfo|nenbutsu]] recitations (i.e. recitation of the name of [[Amitabha]] Buddha): one ring contains single beads used to count a single recitation while the other ring is used to count full revolutions of the first ring. Additionally, other beads hang from the strings, which can count full revolutions of the second ring (flat beads), or full revolutions of the first string of beads.  In all, it is possible to count up to 120,000 recitations using these beads.  The design is credited to a follower of [[HÅnen]] named Awanosuke.&lt;ref name='traversing'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Watts | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Tomatsu | first2 = Yoshiharu | title = Traversing the Pure Land Path: A Lifetime of Encounters with Honen Shonin | publisher = Jodo Shu Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 488363342X }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Shingon Buddhist prayer beads, inside.jpg|thumb|This is a Japanese Buddhist prayer bead that has a picture of [[KÅ«kai]] inside the main bead. The text on the left and right is a common mantra devoted to KÅ«kai.]]
Regardless of Buddhist sect, prayer beads used by lay followers are frequently smaller, featuring a factor of 108 beads.  Some beads are made using plastic, while others may contain wood, or seeds from trees in India, such as ''Ficus religiosa'', the same species as the [[Bodhi Tree]].

It is common to find prayer beads in Japan that contain a small image inside the largest bead, usually something associated with the particular temple or sect.  When held up to the light the image is clearly visible.

==Seik badi ==
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] in [[Buddhism in Myanmar|Myanmar]] use prayer beads called ''seik badi'' ({{my|áá­ááºáá¯áá®á¸}} {{IPA-my|seÉªÊ bÉdÃ­|}}), shortened to ''badi''. 108 beads are strung on a garland, with the beads typically made of fragrant wood like sandalwood, and series of brightly coloured strings at the end of the garland.&lt;ref name="dha"&gt;http://www.usamyanmar.net/Buddha/Article/Praying%20beads1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used in [[samatha]] meditation, to keep track of the number of [[mantra]]s chanted during meditation.&lt;ref name="dha"/&gt;

== Numbers and symbolism==
There are numerous explanations why there are 108 beads, with the [[108 (number)|number 108]] bearing special religious significance in a number of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and Buddhist traditions. In traditional Buddhist thought, people are said to have 108 afflictions or [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=520|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same number is also used in [[Japanese New Year]] services where a bell is rung 108 times.

== Modern usage ==
In recent years, it has become common for non-religious individuals to wear such beads as a fashion accessory, with the beads having no religious connotation whatsoever. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=Yu8yd1Xp3oLUUUdyYQtkE0kd3Qu_4nvvCYoBKw-2we2NHp9QEmfLwN5D5-tl-g5DkbmPTWvkX9Wh36iz80gjI07V57z_-vMgi9YoTT5nAEu#7|title=Baidupedia article|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byeongsan Seowon''' is a ''[[seowon]]'' located in Byeongsa-ri village of the Pungcheon-myeon township in the city of [[Andong]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]], [[South Korea]]. Seowon is a type of local [[academy]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392â1897). It was first established as Jondeoksa (å°å¾·ç¥ ) by local [[Confucian]] scholars especially [[Jeong Gyeong-se]] (é­ç¶ä¸) in 1613, the fifth year of [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|King Gwanghaegung]]'s reign, to commemorate the scholarly achievement and virtue of the notable Confucian scholar and politician [[Ryu Seong-ryong]]. The predecessor of the seowon was Pungak Seodang (æ·µå²³æ¸å ) which was a school located in [[Pungsan-eup|Pungsan]] to teach the Pungsan Ryu clan during the [[Goryeo period]]. [[Ryu Seong-ryong]] moved the [[seodang]] to the current place in 1572.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byeongsan.net/|title=Byeongsan Seowon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.byeongsan.net|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Robinson, Ray Bartlett, Rob Whyte (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=vX4uMBxzml8C&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=Byeongsan+Seowon&amp;ei=1R9-SrHoIKSCywSWprXWCg#v=onepage&amp;q=Byeongsan%20Seowon&amp;f=false "Korea"] Lonely Planet, {{ISBN|1-74104-558-4}} pp.220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254116&amp;v=42 ë³ì°ìì å±å±±æ¸é¢] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610060508/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254116&amp;v=42 |date=2011-06-10 }} [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[EncyKorea]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of Byeongsan Seowon began when [[Ryu Seong-ryong]] moved to Andong in 1572 from Pungak Seodang, a Confucian school established during the [[Goryeo period]].
After Ryu Seong-ryong died in 1607, local Confucianists such as Jeong Gyeong-se founded Jondeok Temple in 1613 and enshrined an ancestral tablet to commemorate his academic work and virtues.
The temple was renamed Byeongsan Seowon in 1614. 

In 1620, following a public discussion among Confucianists, the ancestral tablet was moved to Yeogang Seowon, a memorial Seowon for [[Yi_Hwang|Toegye]]. In 1629 new ancestral tablets to worship Ryu Seong-ryong and his third son Ryu were made. 

Byeongsan Seowon served as a branch of local education to produce many scholars. In 1868, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] ordered to remove it, but it was not damaged. The auditorium was rebuilt in 1921 under [[Korea_under_Japanese_rule|Japanese rule]]. Hyangsarye, a memorial ceremony for Ryu Seong-ryong and Ryu Jin, is held here every March and September.

It is designated as Historic Site No. 260 and contains about 3,000 books of about 1,000 different types, including a collection of books by Ryu Seong-ryong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byeongsan.net/coding/sub1/sub1.asp|title=ë³ì°ìì : ìììê°|website=www.byeongsan.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cumulative inequality theory''' or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory  is the systematic explanation of how [[Social inequality|inequalities]] develop. The theory was initially developed by [https://doi.org/10.1086/354848 Merton] (1988), who studied the sciences and prestige. He believed that recognition from peers, and   from published research in the scientific field created   cumulative advantage (see Matthew affect[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect]])  that led to the  receipt of  resources that facilitated research projects. The theory expanded in four decades to include  the idea that  some  people have more disadvantages than  advantages  which  influence the [[quality of life]] of [[societies]], cohorts, and individuals.  The theory is principally a social scientific explanation of phenomena but with links to biological and health factors, personal adjustment, and well-being.  A central premise is that âsocial systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course via demographic and developmental processes.â&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Kenneth F.|last2=Shippee|first2=Tetyana Pylypiv|date=2009|title=Aging and Cumulative Inequality: How Does Inequality Get Under the Skin? |journal=The Gerontologist|volume=49|issue=3|pages=333â343|doi=10.1093/geront/gnp034 |pmc=2721665|pmid=19377044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and application ==

The ideas of this theory were developed by Kenneth Ferraro and colleagues as an integrative or [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]].  Originally specified in five [[axiom]]s and nineteen propositions, cumulative inequality theory incorporates elements from the following theories and perspectives, several of which are related to the study of society:  
*[[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]] articulated the [[Matthew effect]] to explain accumulating advantage 
*[[Glen Elder (sociologist)|Glen Elder]]âs life course perspective 
*Stress process theory 
*[[Age stratification|Age stratification theory]]. 

In recent years, Ferraro and several other researchers have been testing and elaborating elements of the theory on a variety of topics to provide evidence for the theoretical framework. In the following information you will find some of the uses of this theory in sociological studies. 

McDonough, Worts, Booker, et al (2015) for example studied cumulative disadvantage in the generations of health inequality among mothers in Britain and the  United States.  The study examined   âif adverse circumstances early in the life course cumulate as health harming biographical patterns across working and family caregiving years (McDonough, Worts, Booker, et al, 2015).â  Also, it was examined if institutional context moderated cumulative effects of micro level processes. The results showed that existing health disparities of women in midlife, during  work and family rearing time, were intensified by cumulative disadvantages caused by  adversities in early life. Thus, the accumulation of disadvantage had negative connotations for the well being of  womenâs occupational experiences and family life.

McLean (2010), on the other hand, studied U.S combat and non combat veterans through cumulative disadvantage. He  discovered that cumulated negative disadvantages caused by disability and unemployment were more likely to influence the lives of combat veterans versus non combat veterans. Combat veterans suffered physical and emotional trauma that had a disabling effect which impeded their ability to successfully obtain employment. . The research is crucial for social policy implementation that assist United States Veterans to find and retain employment that is suitable to their personal conditions. 

In continuation, Woolredge, Frank, Coulette, et al ( 2016) studied the prison sentencing of racial groups. specifically of African American males with prior felony convictions. They examined how pre-trial processes affect trial outcomes. It was determined that cumulative disadvantage was existent for  African American males and young men; the results were measured by: set bail amounts, pre-trial detention, prison sentencing, and no reduction in sentencing length. The research are  striving to create changes in the justice system that reduce incarceration rates of African American Males by reducing bail amounts, and pre trial imprisonment. Further studies are important to decrease the incarceration of minority groups in society, and to create a non biased justice system.
 
Additinally, Ferraro &amp; Moore (2003) have applied the theory to the study of long-term consequences of early obesity  for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment. The study shows that obesity experienced in early life leads to lower body disability, but higher risk factors to healthhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348542/. Moreover. The research mentions a risk that has been brought to attention in the past years; it ties  being over weight to negative stigma (DeJong 1980),and has influenced fair labor market positioning (Averett and Korenman 1999) and wages (Register and Williams 1990). 

Lastly, Crystal, Shea, &amp; Reyes (2016) studied the effects of cumulative advantage in increasing within age cohort economic inequalities in diverse periods of time. The study utilized economic patterns such as annual wealth value and household size. The inequalities of age were analyzed by using the gini coefficient.  The study took place between 1980 to 2010. The results showed that at age 65 plus individuals had higher rates of inequality and it increased significantly for baby boomers or during economic recession and times of war. The research is written to estimate  the possible impacts of social security changes on older adults in American Society.

In conclusion, Cumulative Inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, is broadly examining various topics that imact public policy, and the  view of our role within society. Further benefits of the theory are still to be seem in the next coming years.

== Core ideas ==

According to Ferraro and Shippee, there are five main ideas in cumulative inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, which include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*âAxiom 1:  [[Social systems]] generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course through demographic and developmental processes.
*Axiom 2:  Disadvantage increases exposure to risk, but advantage increases exposure to opportunity.
*Axiom 3:  [[Life course approach|Life course]] trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency.
*Axiom 4:  The perception of life trajectories influences subsequent trajectories
*Axiom 5:  Cumulative inequality may lead to premature mortality; therefore, nonrandom selection may give the appearance of decreasing inequality in later life.â&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Axiom 1 ===
 Ferraro, K.F., &amp; Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that social structures shape human behavior and interpersonal relations. Furthermore, cumulation in childhood experiences  shape life outcomes sometimes in negative ways.  Inequality is, therefore,  not a randomly determined misfortune, but rather a predestined state that one is born into. Although it is possible for inequality to come from an individual's own actions consequences, that is not always true. One's childhood experiences and conditions should also be taken into consideration since these experiences help mold a young individual into an adult.

=== Axiom 2 ===
Ferraro, K.F., &amp; Shippee, T.P. (2009) want us to consider that cumulative advantage and disadvantage are not different they are merely opposite ends of the spectrum. Cumulative Disadvantage is perceived as a risk whereas Cumulative Advantage is an opportunity. 
A well known concept in sociological sources is that individuals  with advantages, whether they are achieved or born into, have a higher rate of opportunity in life. On the contrary, those without many advantages are more susceptible to risks throughout their life. For example, one who is born into the majority race with well-educated parents in a developed area will have more exposure to opportunity, whether it be getting a job through one of their parents' college friends or going to a highly rated high school and then being able to get into a highly accredited college. But, on the contrary, one who is born into a minority race with parents who may not have finished high school and live in the ghettos of the roughest town in the city may, not only have less exposure to opportunities, but more exposure to risks such as violence and crime. 

=== Axiom 3 ===
Ferraro, K.F., &amp; Shippee, T.P. (2009) state that even though previous life events are important, the overall quality of life is determined by frequently changing trajectories, or the long-term changes in life stability, which are created by an individual's resources, risks, and human agencies. Human agencies simply refer to an individuals own ability to act and think on their own based on their own morals and beliefs. Elder &amp; Shanahan(2006) however, believe that people's responses to stimuli determines changes to the trajectory of life. Moreover, involvement of the institution in decision making process also alters individuals decisions and behaviors.  

=== Axiom 4 ===
Carstensen (2006) makes the inference that ones view on everyday situations and 
success outcomes is more influential than their actual life status when it comes to their subsequent actions. Drawing from social comparison  and symbolic interaction theories, a person's view of their resources may be different from what actually exists, and therefore shapes life trajectories in unique ways. People's view of their lives play a huge role into how they continue their trajectory through the decisions they make, and the activities they choose to partake in. Therefore, the theory makes the claim that those who possess a more positive and optimistic outlook on life typically are more satisfied with their life course.

=== Axiom 5 ===
Ferraro, K.F., &amp; Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that before starting to explain Axion 5, researchers  should avoid cohort inversion. It will limit cohort centered studies, specifically, as it   refers to the use of non random sample selection that excludes individuals with greater health issues from the samples. Studying individuals of certain age in this case, older adults, may lead to skewed data if selection of only healthier older adults takes place. The mean concentration of results will be designed to a specific population which will limit the data from being externally valid. The axiom may seem hard to understand at first but the overall meaning is that the accumulation of disadvantages can lead to premature mortality, or in simpler terms, younger death. Also, None random selection may make it seem like mortality rates are decreasing when they are not, Take for example the amount of young people deaths in areas with high crime and violence. These individuals are not exposed to many advancing opportunities so they fall victim of the cumulative inequality theory. The nonrandom selection component of the axiom signifies how older populations age in a manner that is not totally random, but rather as a result of the advantages and disadvantages that they have gathered throughout their life. An example is exceptional health care throughout life which prolonged lifespan, or, on the contrary, prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals as a result of working in dangerous environments.

'''DÃ¶lpopa ShÃ©rap Gyeltsen'''&lt;ref&gt;[[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]], cf. http://www.thlib.org/reference/transliteration/phconverter.php&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bo-tw|t=à½à½¼à½£à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à¼à½¤à½ºà½¦à¼à½¢à½à¼à½¢à¾à¾±à½£à¼à½à½à½à¼|w=dol po pa shes rab rgyal mtshan}}) (1292â1361),&lt;ref&gt;Newland (1992). p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; known simply as '''DÃ¶lpopa''', a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] master known as "The Buddha from [[Dolpo|DÃ¶lpo]]," a region in modern [[Nepal]], who was the principal exponent of the [[shentong]] teachings, and an influential member of the [[Jonang]] tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Biography==
DÃ¶lpopa was born in DÃ¶lpo. In 1309, when he was seventeen, he ran away from home to seek the Buddhist teachings, first in [[Upper Mustang|Mustang]] and then in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1314, when he was twenty-two years old, DÃ¶lpopa received [[bhikkhu|full monastic ordination]] from the famous abbot of Choelung Monastery, SÃ¶nam Trakpa (1273â1352), and made a vow at the time to never eat slaughtered meat again.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1321, DÃ¶lpopa  visited Jonang Monastery at Jomonang (which was later destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]]) for the first time. He then visited [[Tsurphu Monastery]] for the first time and had extensive discussions with [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]], about doctrinal issues. It appears that the Karmapa Lama almost certainly influenced the development of some of DÃ¶lpopa's theories, possibly including shentong.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than this, DÃ¶lpopa had studied almost completely under the Sakya tradition until he was thirty years old in 1322 and he had taught for most of the previous decade at the great [[Sakya Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), pp. 32, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1327, after the death of his [[guru]] YÃ¶nden Gyantso, DÃ¶lpopa decided to fulfill a prayer he had made at the great [[stupa]] at Trophu (Khro phu) to repay his master's kindness. "He also felt that the stÅ«pa would become an object of worship for people who were not fortunate enough to engage in study, contemplation, and meditation, and therefore provide them with the opportunity to accumulate virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, DÃ¶lpopa became one of the most influential and original yet controversial of Tibetan Buddhist teachers, systemizing [[Buddha-nature]] and Yogacara-Madhyamaka teachings in a teaching known as [[shentong]] ({{bo|w=gzhan stong}}).

DÃ¶lpopa retired from the leadership of Jonang Monastery in 1338 and appointed the translator [[lotsawa]] LÃ¶dro Bal to succeed him. LÃ¶dro Bal remained in this role for seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
According to Stearns,
{{quote|It is important to keep in mind that DÃ¶lpopa was a consummate practitioner of the Six-branch Yoga, the perfection-stage practices of the ''KÄlacakra tantra'', and although he based his doctrinal discussions upon scripture, in particular the ''[[Kalachakra|KÄlacakra]]-''related cycles, his own experience in meditation was crucial to the formulation of his theories.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In line with the Buddha-nature teachings and the prevalent Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis, DÃ¶lpopa interpreted [[ÅÅ«nyatÄ]] as twofold, distinguishing the conventional "emptiness of self-nature" (rangtong), and the ultimate "emptiness of other" (''shentong''), which is the clear [[Nature of mind (Buddhism)|nature of mind]]. DÃ¶lpopa taught that emptiness of self-nature applied only to relative truth, while emptiness of other is characteristic of ultimate truth, i.e. ultimate Reality is not empty of its own uncreated and deathless Truth, but only of what is impermanent and illusory.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''Mountain Doctrine'', 2006, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

DÃ¶lpopa employed the term 'Self' or 'Soul' ([[Ätman (Buddhism)|atman]]) to refer to the ultimate truth, that, according to him, lay at the heart of all being. In his ''Mountain Doctrine'' work, he refers to this essence as the "Great Self", "True Self", "Diamond Self", "Supreme Self", "Solid Self" and "Supreme Self of all Creatures", basing himself on specific utterances and doctrines of the Buddha in the ''[[MahÄyÄna MahÄparinirvÄá¹a SÅ«tra]]'', the ''[[Aá¹gulimÄlÄ«ya SÅ«tra]]'' and the ''[[ÅrÄ«mÄlÄdevÄ« Siá¹hanÄda SÅ«tra]]'', amongst others&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey, ''Mountain Doctrine'', 2006 passim&lt;/ref&gt; While most of his peers baulk at such a term, there are still exponents of the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] schools who are happy to see the heart of all beings as one unified, egoless Buddha-self. [[Shenpen Hookham]], for example, writes affirmatively of the True Self in the teachings of DÃ¶lpopa and other great Buddhist masters, saying:
{{quote|Absolute, Eternal True Self: Many venerable saints and scholars have argued for the Self in the past and do so in the present. Great teachers of the Tibetan Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya schools have and do argue that such a view [i.e. the reality of an essential, deathless Self] is fundamental to the practice of the Buddhist path and the attainment of Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham (1999), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hookham further points out that DÃ¶lpopa{{refn|group=note|Along with other representatives of this shentong tradition, including such Tibetan shentong masters as Rangjung Dorje, Mikyo Dorje and Jamgon Kongtrul}} really envisioned the Buddha within each being as an actual, living truth and presence, not conditioned or generated by any temporal process of causation:
{{quote|The essential feature of a Shentong interpretation of tathÄgatagarbha doctrine is that the Buddha is figuratively within all beings as their unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned nature .... Buddha is by all [tathÄgatagarbha-sutra] accounts considered to be non-conditioned, eternal, unchanging, bliss, compassion, wisdom, power, and so on. For Shentongpas [i.e. the adherents of a Shentong understanding of scripture] the fact that Buddha is ''non-conditioned'' means the essence of Buddha is complete with all the Buddha Qualities in a timeless sense'.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham (1991), pp: 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DÃ¶lpopa uses many scriptural citations to support his view, drawing upon sutras and tantras to substantiate his understanding of Mahayana and tantric teachings on definitive truth. As Cyrus Stearns writes in his monograph on DÃ¶lpopa, this scholar-monk made:
{{quote|[T]he assertion that ultimate truth, referred to by terms such as ''tathÄgatagarbha'' ([[Buddha-nature]]), ''[[Dharmadhatu|dharmadhÄtu]]'' (expanse of reality), and ''[[dharmakÄya]]'' (buddha-body of reality), is a permanent or eternal state. Of course, statements to this effect are not unusual in certain Mahayana sutras and treatises ....For Dolpopa, all such statements in the scriptures and commentaries were of definitive meaning (''nÄ«tÄrtha'', ''nges don''), and were to be understood literally.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DÃ¶lpopa also frequently makes use of such positive terms which he finds in the selfsame scriptures and tantras as 'permanent', 'everlasting, 'eternal' and 'Self' (Stearns, ibid.). This, DÃ¶lpopa claims, all pertains to the realm of Nirvana, and is one with the Buddha-nature. It is not merely an intellectual view, but a direct experience of great bliss, and this doctrine is (according to DÃ¶lpopa) communicated to Buddhists via the mediacy of the Mahayana Buddha-nature sutras:
{{quote|The ultimate Mahayana is the vehicle of the Buddha-nature, and the ultimate Buddha-nature is great bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This felicitous state is said to lie within the being, eternally. But within the samsaric mode of perceiving, it is not recognised, and darkness remains. Stearns brings out the distinction which DÃ¶lpopa draws here between samsara and nirvana, quoting Kalkin Pundarika to make the point:
{{quote|[Samsaric] existence and nirvana are not identical, but like a shadow and the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For DÃ¶lpopa, the indwelling Buddha (or Nirvana) is genuinely real, yet 'empty' in one sense - in that the internal Buddha or Buddha nature is empty of illusion, but replete with wondrous Buddha qualities. For DÃ¶lpopa and those who espouse analogous shentong doctrines:
{{quote|[T]he whole point of establishing the empty nature of illusion ([[rangtong]]) is to discover the Reality of the Absolute Buddha Wisdom Mind (Paramarthabuddhajnana) beyond the reaches of the conceptual mind that can only function in terms of grasping its own creations.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham (1991), pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DÃ¶lpopa further comments that worldlings believe that they have Self, happiness, permanence and purity, but that they look in the wrong direction for these transcendental qualities, whereas those who have transcended the world use these terms meaningfully, since they know where these qualities are to be found. Even having faith in the reality of these higher qualities helps remove spiritual veils:{{quote|Dolpopa explains that the worldling believes he has self, permanence, bliss, and purity; he sees these qualities in what does not have them. Those who are beyond the world also talk of Self, Permanence, Bliss, and Purity, but in their case it is meaningful, because they know what really has these qualities. Dolpopa remarks that just to believe this removes many veils, thus emphasising the power of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham (1991), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cyrus Stearns points out that for DÃ¶lpopa, spiritual awareness or [[jnana|jÃ±Äna]] is a key constituent of the Buddhist path and allows the practitioner to burn away veils of ignorance and thus to see the eternal qualities of the Buddha's body of reality (the Dharmakaya):
{{quote|[T]he accumulation of gnosis (''jnana'') ... burns away all the veils that have been obscuring the spiritual qualities of the buddha-body of reality (''dharmakaya''), which is eternal and spontaneously present within each living being.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (1999), pp. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DÃ¶lpopa even wrote a prayer wishing that the Buddhas might take pity on those Buddhists who deem that the Emptiness taught by the Buddha is nothing more than a non-affirming negation and concerns only self-emptiness (the absence of essence in all things). DÃ¶lpopa writes on this point:
{{quote|May they [the Buddhas] have pity on those who hold that the whole of the Buddha's teaching on emptiness concerned self-emptiness alone and hold them in their compassion.&lt;br&gt;May they [the Buddhas] have pity on those who hold that the whole of the Buddha's teaching on emptiness concerned a non-affirming negation alone, and hold them in their compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, op. cit., pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DÃ¶lpopa also wrote a commentary on the ''[[RatnagotravibhÄga (text)|RatnagotravibhÄga]]''.

==Influence==
DÃ¶lpopa found a strong supporter and advocate in the later Jonangpa lama, [[Taranatha]], who was keen to spread DÃ¶lpopa's ideas. Cyrus Stearns comments on this:
{{quote|Taranatha took upon himself the responsibility of causing Dolpopa's insights to once again reach a wide audience, and was determined to revive what he saw as a priceless transmission lineage in danger of being lost.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, op. cit., p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Suppression===
The entire corpus of DÃ¶lpopa's writings was completely suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, for both doctrinal and political reasons. The doctrinal reason was his approach to the Buddhist concept of ''[[ÅÅ«nyatÄ]]'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''stong pa nyid''), distinguishing "emptiness of self-nature" (Wylie: ''rang stong'', pronounced /rangtong/) from "emptiness of other" (Wylie: ''gzhan stong'', pronounced /shentong/). 

Guy Newland conveys the political intrigue of the [[5th Dalai Lama]] against the Jonangpa, the king of [[Ã-Tsang|gTsang]], and the writings and philosophy of DÃ¶lpopa:
{{quote|Tsong-ka-pa and his successors have been especially vehement in their objections to the views of Shay-rap-gyel-tsen (''shes rab rgyal mtshan'', 1292â1361) and his followers. Shay-rap-gyel-tsen, an abbot of Jo-mo-nang, formulated his view in ''[[Ocean of Definitive Meaning]]'' (''nges don rgya mtsho'') and other writings; his followers are called Jo-nang-bas. As Ge-luk political power reached its apogee under the Fifth Dalai Lama in the seventeenth century, the Jo-nang-bas were proscribed and their monasteries and other property were completely confiscated and converted to Ge-luk use. Tibet's intersectarian conflicts were almost always driven by motives more political than "purely philosophical", indeed, the Jo-nang-bas were allies of the king of Tsang (gtsang), the main political and military adversary of Ge-luk in the first half of the seventeenth century. On the other hand, for more than two hundred years before they destroyed the Jo-nang-ba order the Ge-luk-bas had been denouncing Shay-rap-gyel-tsen's philosophy as something utterly beyond the pale of MahÄyÄna Buddhism. [. . .] While the immediate occasion for the persecution of Jo-nang was its defeat in a power struggle, proscription suggested itself as a penalty in the context of a long history of substantial and deeply felt philosophical differences. This hostility is reflected in the banning of Shay-rap-gyel-tsen's major books from the premises of Ge-luk monasteries more than 150 years prior to his order's extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Newland (1992): pp. 30â31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"'''Don't be evil'''" is a [[motto]] used within [[Google]]'s corporate code of conduct.

Following Google's corporate restructuring under the conglomerate [[Alphabet Inc.]] in October 2015, Alphabet took "Do the right thing" as its motto, also forming the opening of its corporate code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/02/alphabet-do-the-right-thing/ |title=Alphabet replaces Google's 'Don't be evil' with 'Do the right thing |last=Lawler |first=Richard |date=2 October 2015 |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Why Google Was Smart To Drop Its 'Donât Be Evil' Motto |author=David Mayer |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3056389/why-google-was-smart-to-drop-its-dont-be-evil-motto |magazine=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2 September 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=New Google Parent Company Drops 'Don't be Evil' Motto |author=Tanya Basu |url=http://time.com/4060575/alphabet-google-dont-be-evil/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html |title=Code of Conduct |publisher=Google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004012914/https://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html|archive-date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/code-of-conduct.html |title=Alphabet Code of Conduct |date=2 October 2015 |publisher=Alphabet |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motto was retained in Google's code of conduct, now a subsidiary of Alphabet. In April 2018, the motto was removed from the code of conduct's preface and retained in its last sentence.&lt;ref name=SEJ&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montti |first=Roger |url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-dont-be-evil/254019/ |title=Google's "Don't Be Evil" No Longer Prefaces Code of Conduct |journal=Search Engine Journal |date=20 May 2018 |accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The motto was first suggested either by Google employee [[Paul Buchheit]] at a meeting about corporate values that took place in early 2000&lt;ref name="blogoscoped"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html |title=Paul Buchheit on Gmail, AdSense and More |publisher=[[Blogoscoped]] |date=25 January 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2013}} (quoting from: [[Jessica Livingston]], ''[[Founders at Work]]'', {{ISBN|978-1590597149}})&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2001&lt;ref name="gleick2011" /&gt; or, according to another account, by Google Engineer Amit Patel in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |location=AU |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/dont-be-evil/2008/04/15/1208025168177.html?page=3 |title=Don't Be Evil or don't lose value? |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buchheit, the creator of [[Gmail]], said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take out", adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent".&lt;ref name="blogoscoped" /&gt; 

While the official corporate philosophy of Google&lt;ref name="GooglePhil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ten things we know to be true |url=https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/ |website=Google Company |publisher=Google |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not contain the words "Don't be evil", they were included in the [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] (on [[Form S-1]]) of Google's 2004 [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] (a letter from Google's founders, later called the "'Don't Be Evil' manifesto"): "Don't be evil.  We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better servedâas shareholders and in all other waysâby a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Shira |last=Ovide |title=What Would 2004 Google Say About Antitrust Probe? |date=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bz8paR7v?url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ |archivedate=2 October 2015 |accessdate=2 October 2015 |deadurl=no |quote="Our goal is to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.

This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company..." |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as ''Do no evil''.&lt;ref name="gleick2011"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/how-google-dominates-us/?pagination=false |title=How Google Dominates Us |first=James |last=Gleick |authorlink=James Gleick |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://gawker.com/valleywag/tech/google/dont-be-evil-factcheck-the-company-motto-153908.php |contribution=Donât be evil. Fact-check the company motto |title=[[Valleywag]] |publisher=[[Gawker]] |author=ndouglas |date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2018, the motto was still cited in the preface to Google's Code of Conduct:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; 
"Don't be evil." Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users. But "Don't be evil" is much more than that...

The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put "Don't be evil" into practice...&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 21 April and 4 May 2018, Google removed the motto from the preface, leaving a mention in the final line: "And rememberâ¦ don't be evil, and if you see something that you think isn't right â speak up!"&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmodo 18 May 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Conger |first1=Kate |title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct |url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393 |accessdate=19 May 2018 |work=Gizmodo |date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
In their 2004 founders' letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504142742/ds1a.htm#toc59330_1 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] |location=USA |title=Letter from the founders, "an owner's manual" for Google's shareholders |date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to their [[initial public offering]], [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] argued that their "Don't be evil" culture prohibited [[conflicts of interest]], and required [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]] and an absence of [[bias]]:

{{quotation|Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating.  We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisersâ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.}}

[[Chris Hoofnagle]], director of [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], [[Berkeley Law]]'s [[information privacy]] programs, has stated that Google's original intention expressed by the "don't be evil" motto is linked to the company's separation of search results from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=14 |number=4â6 |date=April 2009 |journal=First Monday |first=Chris |last=Hoofnagle |url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2326/2156 |title=Beyond Google and evil: How policy makers, journalist and consumers should talk differently about Google and privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he argues that clearly separating search results from sponsored links is required by law, thus, Google's practice is now mainstream and no longer remarkable or good.  Hoofnagle argued in 2009 that Google should abandon the motto because:

{{quotation|The evil talk is not only an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Google, it obscures the substantial consumer benefits from Googleâs advertising model. Because we have forgotten the original context of Googleâs evil representations, the company should remind the public of the companyâs contribution to a revolution in search advertising, and highlight some overlooked benefits of their model.}}In a 2013 [[NPR]] interview, [[Eric Schmidt]] revealed that when Larry Page and Sergey Brin recommended the motto as a guiding principle for Google, he "thought this was the stupidest rule ever", but then changed his opinion after a meeting where an engineer successfully referred to the motto when expressing concerns about a planned advertising product, which was eventually cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Googles+Eric+Schmidt+Dont+Be+Evil+was+Stupid/article31544.htm |publisher=[[DailyTech|DailyTech LLC]] |location=USA |title=Google's Eric Schmidt: "Don't Be Evil" was Stupid |date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have raised questions about the actual definition of what Google considered "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/284548/what-google-really-means-by-dont-be-evil/ |publisher=[[Atlantic Media|Quartz]] |location=USA |title=What Google really means by "Donât be evil" |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/what-is-evil-to-google/280573/ |publisher=[[The Atlantic Monthly Group]] |location=USA |title=What Is 'Evil' to Google? |date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the user-facing 'What We Believe' page, Google appeared to replace the original motto altogether (a carefully reworded version stood as of 10 April 2015, "''You can'' make money without doing evil",&lt;ref name="GooglePhil" /&gt; which varied significantly from the absolute [[Imperative mood|imperative]] of ''DON'T be'' evil).

==Use in criticism of Google==

[[Criticism of Google|Critics of Google]] frequently spin the motto in a negative way, such as [[InfoWorld|InfoWorld's]] 2014 article ''"Google? Evil? You have no idea"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2610434/cringely/google--evil--you-have-no-idea.html |title=Google? Evil?

Itâs Mostly for Google |date=14 February 2014 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, major [[Social media|social networks]] even co-developed a "''Don't be evil''" browser bookmarklet (specifically to expose alleged [[Search engine results page|SERP]] manipulation promoting Google-owned content over that of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/24/facebook-twitter-myspace-google-add-on |title=Facebook, Myspace and Twitter chide Google with 'Don't be evil' add-on |date=24 January 2012 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2013, [[Margaret Hodge MP]], the chair of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Public Accounts Committee]] accused Google of being "calculated and unethical" over [[tax avoidance by Google|its use of highly contrived and artificial distinctions]] to avoid paying billions of pounds in [[Corporation tax]] owed by its UK operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil |title=MP on Google tax avoidance scheme: 'I think that you do evil' |author=Simon Bowers |work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was accused by the committee, which represents the interests of all UK taxpayers, of being "evil" for not paying its "fair amount of tax". She told [[Matt Brittin]], head of Google UK, "I think that you do evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22554548 |title=Margaret Hodge labels Google tax record 'evil' |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the UK Government introduced a new law intended to penalise Google and other large [[multinational corporation|multinational]] corporations' artificial tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31942639 |title=Budget 2015: 'Google Tax' introduction confirmed |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[The Commercial Appeal]] reported that "critics say Google's recent moves belie search giant's motto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/turning-evil |title=Turning 'evil': Critics say Google's recent moves belie search giant's motto |website=The Commercial Appeal |publisher=[[Journal Media Group]] |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In ''Speaking My Mind: Expression and Self-Knowledge'', published by Oxford University Press,  Bar-On investigates the problem of [[Know thyself|self-knowledge]] (how, if at all, we are each in a privileged position to know own [[mental state]]s) in relation to questions of expression and expressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/speaking-my-mind-9780199276288?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Speaking My Mind: Expression and Self-Knowledge|last=Bar-On|first=Dorit|publisher=Oxford|year=2004|isbn=9780199276288|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed in {{Cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Alex|date=2011-11-01|title=Review Essay of Dorit Bar-Onâs Speaking My Mind|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00500.x/abstract|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|language=en|volume=83|issue=3|pages=705â717|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00500.x|issn=1933-1592}}&lt;/ref&gt; She draws on historical figures including [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] to develop a neo-expressivist view of first-personal expressive utterances (such as, "I am in pain") which explains how these utterances differ epistemically from non-expressive utterances while sharing the same [[Semantics|semantic]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/introspection/|title=Introspection|last=Schwitzgebel|first=Eric|date=|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Speaking My Mind'' has been praised as "a rich book; rich in topics, in argumentation, and in philosophical imagination and insight.

'''Early modern philosophy''' (also '''classical modern philosophy''')&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Tlumak, ''Classical Modern Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction'', Routledge, 2006, p. xi: "[''Classical Modern Philosophy''] is a guide through the systems of the seven brilliant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers most regularly taught in college Modern Philosophy courses".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacht"&gt;[[Richard Schacht]], ''Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant'', Routledge, 2013, p. 1: "Seven men have come to stand out from all of their counterparts in what has come to be known as the 'modern' period in the history of philosophy (i.e., the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries): Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant".&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of philosophy]] at the beginning or overlapping with the period known as [[modern philosophy]].

==Overview==
The [[early modern period]] in history is roughly 1500â1789,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Berman]]. 1982. ''[[All That Is Solid Melts into Air]]: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-24602-X}}. London: Verso. pp. 16â17. {{ISBN|0-86091-785-1}}. Paperback reprint New York: Viking Penguin, 1988. {{ISBN|0-14-010962-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the label "early modern philosophy" is usually used to refer to a more specific period of time.

In the narrowest sense, the term is used to refer principally to the [[17th-century philosophy|philosophy of the 17th century]], posited to have begun with [[RenÃ© Descartes]]; to have included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Baruch Spinoza]]; and to have ended with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Many stretch this period to [[18th-century philosophy]] (the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), thus including [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="Schacht"/&gt;

The term is sometimes used more broadly and early modern philosophy is considered to have begun in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (ed.), ''The Future for Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]; to have also included [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Thomas Paine]]; and to have ended at the latest in 1804 with the death of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Considered in this way, the period spans from [[Renaissance philosophy]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

}}'''George Cheyne''' M.D. R.C. E.d. R.S.S. (1672â1743) was a pioneering [[physician]], early proto-[[psychologist]], [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]].

==Life==
George Cheyne (1672-1743) was a Newtonian physician and [[Behmenist]], deeply immersed in [[mysticism]]. Born in 1672 in [[Methlick]], near [[Aberdeen]] in [[Scotland]], he was baptized in Mains of Kelly, Methlick, [[Aberdeenshire]], on 24 February 1673. He died in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on April 12, 1743. The books he published during his life show his wide interest which extended from medicine and natural philosophy to religion, metaphysics, astronomy and mathematics. His books were most of the time very successful and as a result they were translated into other languages, e.g. Latin, Dutch, French, Italian and German.&lt;ref&gt;Guerini, Anita, ''Obesity and Depression in the Enlightenment'', University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 2000, pp. 239-243. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Joling-van der Sar, Gerda J., ''The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson: Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist'', 2003, footnote 293, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The printer and author [[Samuel Richardson]] printed several of his books. Among many others [[Thomas Gray]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[John Wesley]], [[John Byrom]] and [[Edward Young]] liked his work. His clients included [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Gay]] and Samuel Richardson. Today he is best known for his contribution to [[vegetarianism]].

Cheyne was acquainted with [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and provoked Newton to publish his ''Quadratures'' and with it, his ''Light &amp; Colours''. Newton later offered him financial support to publish ''Fluxionum methodus inversa'' (The Inverse Method of Fluxions), but apparently he turned down the offer. Newton refused to see him any more.&lt;ref&gt;''Never at Rest'', [[Richard S. Westfall]], p.&amp;nbsp;639 {{ISBN|0-521-27435-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to succeed in medical practice, Cheyne tried to develop a rapport with his patients by regularly visiting the local taverns where they spent time, a practice common among medical practitioners of the day.  He became a popular figure of local social life, and the quantity of rich food and drink he consumed in consequence left him grossly obese and very unhealthy.  He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and regained his health.  But when he returned to a more typical diet - albeit more moderate than he had previously indulged - he regained weight and his health once again deteriorated. He went back to his vegetarian diet for the remainder of his life, recommending it for everyone suffering from obesity.

Cheyne did not believe that the present state of things is "from all ''Eternity''". Using the metaphor of "a Piece of ''Clock-work''",&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne, George, ''The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed'', published in 1705 (Part I), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; he argues that when a thing depends upon another thing as its cause, this implies that âthe first thing exists that the second may existâ. He adds: "remove the sun and there will be no fruit, take away the moon and the seas would stagnate, destroy our ''Atmosphere'' and we should swell like poisonÂ´d Rats".&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne, George, ''The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed'', published in 1705 (Part I), pp. 145-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is absolutely impossible, according to Cheyne, that âany of the ''Species'' of ''Animals'' or ''Vegetables'' should have existed from all ''Eternity''â.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne, George, ''The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed'', published in 1705 (Part I), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Cheyne also wrote on fevers, nervous disorders, and hygiene. In 1740 he wrote ''The Essay on Regimen'' and this work is often quoted by [[vegetarians]] and [[animal rights]] activists, particularly the following passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''To see the convulsions, agonies and tortures of a poor fellow-creature, whom they cannot restore nor recompense, dying to gratify luxury and tickle callous and rank organs, must require a rocky heart, and a great degree of cruelty and ferocity. I cannot find any great difference between feeding on human flesh and feeding on animal flesh, except custom and practice.''&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne, George, ''The Essay on Regimen'', 1740, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speaking from personal experience, Cheyne asserted that mental depression afflicted the brilliant rather than the dull, writing that "those of the liveliest and quickest natural Parts ... whose Genius is most keen and penetrating were most prone to such disorders. Fools, weak or stupid Persons, heavy and dull Souls, are seldom troubled with Vapours or Lowness of Spirits."

==Education==
Cheyne went to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine. During these years he may have spent a brief time in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita Guerrini, "James Keill, George Cheyne, and Newtonian Physiology, 1690-1740", in the ''Journal of the History of Biology'', 18, 1985, p. 254 and in ''Obesity and Depression in the Enlightenment: The Life and Times of George Cheyne'', Oklahoma, 2000, p. 30 and p. 198, n. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Having finished his studies he went to London in 1701 where he started a practice and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1702. Cheyne describes his own life up to 1733 in ''The English Malady''.&lt;ref&gt;''The English Malady'', 3rd ed., 1734, pp. 325-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice in Bath and London==
In the summer Cheyne worked in Bath and in the winter at [[London]]. However, in 1718 he decided to give up his practice in London to settle in Bath permanently. &lt;ref&gt;G.D. Henderson, ''Mystics of the North-East, Including I. Letters of James Keith, M.D., and Others to Lord Deskford''; II. ''Correspondence between Dr. George Garden and James Cunningham'', Aberdeen, 1934, pp. 75, 99, 105, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Porter refers to Cheyne as one of the originators of the neurological school of [[psychiatry]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''George Cheyne: The English Malady (1733)'', London, 1990. See also Porter's ''Mind-forged Manacles: A History of Madness in England from the Restoration to the Regency'', Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1987 and Porterâs ''Discovering the History of Psychiatry'', Oxford, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Though appreciated by many, Cheyne was sometimes the subject of banter as appears from the following poem, which appeared in the 1730s (reprinted in 1757 in the London Magazine). The reference to Cheyneâs weight was based on the fact that Cheyne with 32 stone (almost 203 kg) was seriously overweight. After an illness Cheyne lost almost 10 stone.&lt;ref&gt;Joling-van der Sar, Gerda J., ''The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson: Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist'', 2003, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Tell me from whom, fat-headed Scot''
::''Thou didst thy system learn''
::''From Hippocrate thou hast it not''
::''Nor Celsus, nor Pitcairne.''

::''Suppose we own that milk is good''
::''And say the same of grass''
::''The one for babes is only food''
::''The other for an ass.''

::''Doctor! One new prescription try''
::''(A friend's advice forgive;)''
::''Eat grass, reduce thyself, and die''
::''Thy patients then may live.''


Cheyneâs reply was:

::''My system, Doctor, is my own''
::''No tutor I pretend''
::''My blunders hurt myself alone''
::''But yours your dearest friend.''

::''Were you to milk and straw confin'd''
::''Thrice happy might you be''
::''Perhaps you might regain your mind''
::''And from your wit get free.''

::''I cannot your prescription try''
::''But heartily "forgive"''
::'''Tis nat'ral you should bid me die''
::''That you yourself may live.''

==Main Works==
The subjects in CheyneÂ´s books were of a medical, philosophical and mathematical nature, but certain metaphysical and religious issues of the day, combining [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] objectives with ideas in [[mystical]] and radical [[Pietism]], played an important part. His writings, which often went through several editions, were translated into Latin, Dutch, French, Italian and German. His main works are:

* ''The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed'', 1705 (Part I) and 1715 (Part II) which is mainly concerned with metaphysical matters or the spirit. The first part contained "the Elements of Natural Philosophy and the Proofs for Natural Religion arising from them". Part II contained "the Nature and Kinds of Infinites; their Arithmetick and Uses, and the Philosophick Principles of Revealed Religion".
* ''Observations concerning the Nature and due Method of treating the Gout'', 1720, which deals with physical matters or the body. In this book Cheyne shares his "Observations concerning the Nature and due Method of treating the Gout, â¦ together with an account of the Nature and qualities of the Bath Waters". 
* ''The Essay of Health and Long Life'', 1724, which is equally focussed on physical matters or the body. In the Preface Cheyne wrote that he had consulted nothing but his âown Experience and Observation on my own crazy Carcase and the Infirmities of others I have treatedâ. In the first chapter Cheyne wrote that it was easier to preserve health than to recover it, and to prevent diseases than to cure them. 
* ''The English Malady'', 1733, which discusses nervous diseases of all kinds. The subtitle of the work was ''a Treatise of Nervous Diseases of all kinds, Spleen, Vapours, Lowness of Spirits, Hypochondraical, and Hysterical Distempers, etc."
* ''The Essay on Regimen'', 1740, which discusses metaphysical matters, but physical matters as well. It was especially meant for Cheyne's "fellow-sufferers, the gouty, consumptive, or nervous valetudinarian-low-livers". 
* ''The Natural Method of Cureing [sic] the Diseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind depending on the Body'', 1742, which is mainly concerned with physical matters, but sometimes also with metaphysical matters. It was his last work and became very popular (five editions).

'''George Lansing Raymond''', (1839â1929)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=george%20lansing%20raymond Internet Archive Search: george lansing raymond&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
was a prominent professor of Aesthetic Criticism at Princeton University (1881â1905)&lt;ref&gt;General Catalogue of Princeton University 1746-1906, p.35 and 36, available via books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; and author of a new system of esthetics.  
He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7587 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as a professor at George Washington University (D.C.) and Williams College (his alma mater).

==Career==
Author of a systematic theory of art published by G.P. Putnam,  published in seven volumes during the period 1886 to 1900, and republished as a set of uniform volumes in 1909.  Additionally an eighth volume was published, as a summary of the seven volumes, titled, ''Essentials of Esthetics''.  A volume of excerpts of his seven books, edited by the classical scholar Marion Mills Miller, was also published by Putnam in 1920.  (see publication list below)

Raymond was an art theorist who created the first comprehensive and systematic theory of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;''An Art-Philosopherâs Cabinet'', Marion Mills Miller, G.P. Putnamâs Sons, 1915, page ix of introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  The New York Times said "In a spirit at once scientific and that of the true artist, he pierces through the manifestations of art to their sources, and shows the relations, intimate and essential, between painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and architecture." &lt;ref&gt;quoted in, ''An Art-Philosopherâs Cabinet'', Marion Mills Miller, G.P. Putnamâs Sons, 1915, page x of introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

He was rare among art theorists of the time (and since), to use psychology and physiology and biological factors to ground his art theory, and to use detailed discussions of specific art works to validate his views.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', [JAAC articles available to JSTOR subscribers] Thomas Munro, v.13 p.533-537&lt;/ref&gt;

His work is neglected, although some scholars say his system deserves resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' , Vol. 19 no.3 p.327-337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', âThe Strange Neglect of G. L. Raymond.â, Thomas Munro, v.13 p.533-537&lt;/ref&gt;

His basic approach is as stated in his summary one-volume book ''Essentials of Esthetics'':
''"The phenomena of the arts of the highest class have been traced [in this book] to their sources in material nature and in the human mind; the different arts have been shown to be developed by exactly similar methods; and these methods have been shown to characterize the entire work of artistic imagination, from the formulation of psychical concepts to that of their most physical expressions in rhythm, proportion and harmony."''

He was also a vocal advocate of a scientific and rational Christianity.  He seemed to be following in Aquinasâ footsteps in believing he could rationalize religious belief with science.

He was also a widely published poet during the latter part of the 19th century, though with no lasting celebrity.

He wrote works on oratory (i.e., rhetoric), early in life, since he a professor of oratory; and later in life after retiring from his professorships, he wrote a book on ethics and natural law.

Three of his books (the last two in the esthetic book list above, and one on ethics) are available in full digital text form at subscriber website www.questia.com.  In 2008 and 2009, all of these books were re-published by Kessinger Publishing and Bibliolife Publishing in hardcover and paperback.  The title "Genesis of Art-Form" is also accessible for free at www.esthetics.cc (along with an archival copy of the New York Times 1893 book review of that book).  Most of his series of seven volumes comprising his seven volumes on aesthetics is  available in digital form at books.google.com.

==Personal life==
Raymond was the son of [[Benjamin Wright Raymond]], twice [[Mayor of Chicago]]. He was educated at [[Phillips Academy]], Andover, graduating in 1858, and Williams College where he was a member of the [[Kappa Alpha Society]].
He married Mary Elizabeth Blake in 1872.

'''Gim Jeong-hui''' (ê¹ì í¬, éæ­£å, {{IPA-ko|kimdÊÊÅhi}} born on the 3rd day of the 6th lunar month 1786,  died on the 10th day of the 10th lunar month 1856), also known as '''Kim Jeong-hui''', was one of the most celebrated practitioners of [[calligraphy]], epigraphists, and scholars of [[Korea]]âs later [[Joseon]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary'' ed. Keith Pratt and [[Richard Rutt]]. (Curzon. 1999) page 209.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Gim clan of [[Gyeongju]]. He used various [[Pen name|Ho]] (pen-names): Wandang (é®å ), Chusa (ç§å²), Yedang (ç¦®å ), Siam (è©©åºµ), Gwapa (æå¡), Nogwa (èæ) etc. (some 200 in all).  He is especially celebrated for having transformed Korean epigraphy and for having created the âChusa-cheâ (ç§å²é« Chusa writing style) inspired by his study of ancient Korean and Chinese epitaphs. His ink paintings, especially of orchids, are equally admired.

As a scholar, he belonged to the [[Silhak]] (Practical Learning) school also known as the Bukhak (åå­¸, âNorthern Learningâ). He was related to Queen [[Jeongsun]], the second wife of King [[Yeongjo]], and by his adoptive mother, Nam Yang-hong, he was a cousin to Namyeon-gun Yi Gu, who was destined to be the grandfather of King [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] (é«å®, later titled åæ­¦å¸ Gwangmu Emperor. 1852â1919). Hongseon [[Daewon-gun]] (èå®£å¤§é¢å, 1820â1898), King [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]]âs father, who served as his regent and was also a noted calligrapher, was one of Gimâs pupils for a while.

==Biography==

===Early life: Birth and family===
Gim was born in the family home in [[Yesan]], now [[South Chungcheong Province]], in 1786. He was the eldest son. His birth father was Gim No-gyeong (éé­¯æ¬, 1766 - 1840); his grandfather was Gim I-ju (éé ¤æ±, ? â 1797) and his great-grandfather was Weolseongui Gim Han-sin (æåå° éæ¼¢è, 1720â1758) who married the second daughter of King [[Yeongjo]], the Princess Hwasun (åé ç¿ä¸», 1720 - 1758). His ancestors and relatives held many high administrative positions and several were noted for their calligraphy. His mother was a member of the Gigye Yu clan, a daughter of Yu Jun-ju (åªé§¿æ±), the governor of [[Gimhae]].

He is reputed to have been a remarkable calligrapher already as a child. When he was 7, the famed scholar Chae Je-gong (è¡æ¿æ­, 1720 - 1799) is said to have been impressed on seeing the âIpchun Daegil Cheonha Daepyeongchunâ (ç«æ¥å¤§å å¤©ä¸å¤ªå¹³æ¥) good-luck charm marking the coming of spring that he had written, pasted on the gate of the family home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chusa.or.kr/life/life_term.html&lt;/ref&gt; From the age of 15 he received instruction from the celebrated Bukhak (åå­¸, âNorthern Learning)â scholar [[Pak Je-ga]] (æ´é½å®¶, 1750â1805).

===Early youth===
In the 1790s, the head of the family, his eldest uncle, Gim No-yeong (éé­¯æ°¸, 1747â1707), was sent into exile, while another uncle as well as his grandparents all died in quick succession. It was decided that Gim Jeong-hui should be adopted by Gim No-yeong (who had several daughters but no son) and so become the next head of the family. When he was 15, in 1800, he married a member of the Hansan Yi clan (éå±±ææ°). That same year, King [[Jeongjo]] died and Queen [[Jeongsun]], the widow of the previous [[King Yeongjo]], became regent, since the new king was only a child. Gim Jeong-huiâs birth father benefitted from the familyâs relationship with the regent and was raised to a high rank.

===Later youth===
Gim Jeong-huiâs birth mother died in 1801, aged only 34. Queen [[Jeongsun]] died in 1805, and Gim Jeong-huiâs young wife died only a few weeks after her. His teacher [[Pak Je-ga]] also died that year and these multiple deaths seem to have encouraged his already deep interest in [[Buddhism]] as a source of consolation and meaning. His adoptive mother also died at around this time and once mourning for her was over, he married a slightly younger second wife in 1808, a member of the Yean Yi clan (ç¦®å® ææ°). In 1809 he took first place in the lower [[Gwageo]] civil examination.

===Adult life===

===Visit to China===
In 1810, his adoptive father was appointed a vice-envoy in the annual embassy to [[Qing]] [[China]] and he accompanied him, spending some 6 months in China. There he met such noted scholars as [[Weng Fanggang]] (ç¿æ¹ç¶±, 1733â1818) and [[Ruan Yuan]] (é®å, 1764â1849) who recognized his qualities. He seems to have studied documentary history there especially. Ruan Yuan gave him a copy of his âSu Zhai Bijiâ (èé½ç­è¨), a book about [[calligraphy]], and Gim continued to correspond with them after his return to Korea. For a time after returning home he did not take up any official position but continued to study the Northern Learning and write essays criticizing rigid [[Neo-Confucianism]].

He also pursued research by visiting and studying the inscriptions on ancient stele. In 1815, the Venerable [[Cho-ui]] first visited Seoul and met Gim Jeong-hui there. This was the beginning of a deep and lasting relationship. Perhaps it was from this time that Gim began to drink tea, there is no knowing.

===Success in national exams===
Passing the [[Gwageo]] national exam held to mark an eclipse year in 1819, he rose to such positions as secret inspector and tutor to the Crown Prince. Following the death of the prince, power passed to the conservative Gim clan of Andong and Gim was reduced in rank while his adoptive father was exiled for several years, until 1834. In 1835, after the accession of King [[Heonjong of Joseon|Heonjong]], the familyâs fortunes turned and Gim Jeong-hui rose to ministerial rank. In the same year he visited the Ven. [[Cho-ui]] at Daedun-sa temple (å¤§èå¯º), now called Daeheung-sa).

===Exile===
Following the death of King [[Sunjo of Joseon]] (r. 1800-1834) late in 1834, [[Queen Sunwon]], the wife of Sunjo and a member of the Gim clan of Andong, held immense power after her grandson, [[Heonjong of Joseon|Heonjong]] (æ²å®, 1827â1849 ), still only a child, was made king. Queen Gim acted as his regent. Factional in-fighting increased and in 1840, when he was due to be a member of the Chinese embassy, Gim Jeong-hui was instead condemned to exile in [[Jeju Province|Jeju]] Island. Late in 1842 his wife died. He was finally allowed to return home early in 1849. It was during those years in exile that he developed the calligraphic style known as the âChusa style,â based on his studies of models dating back to the earliest periods of Korean and Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=262822&amp;v=42 |script-title=ko:ê¹ì í¬ éæ­£å |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610070807/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=262822&amp;v=42 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his way into exile and on his way back home afterward, he visited the Venerable Cho-ui in his Ilchi-am hermitage at what is now known as Daeheung-sa temple. Cho-ui consecrated several of his building projects in the temple to helping sustain Gim during his exile and visited him in Jeju-do 5-6 times, bringing him gifts of tea. .&lt;ref&gt;''Korean Tea Classics'' ed./trans. Brother Anthony of TaizÃ©, Hong Keong-Hee, Steven D. Owyoung. Seoul: Seoul Selection. 2010. Page 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, during his exile in Jeju Island, he produced his most celebrated ink painting, usually known as âSehandoâ or âWandang Sehandoâ (é®å æ­²å¯å, âWandangâ was one of Gimâs most frequently used âHoâ names; âSehanâ means âthe bitter cold around the lunar new year,â âdoâ means âpaintingâ), which he gave to his disciple Yi Sang-jeok (æå°è¿ª, 1804â1865) in gratitude for his friendship, which included bringing him precious books from China. The painting shows a simple house, barely outlined, framed by two gnarled pine trees. Beside it there are texts expressing gratitude to Yi Sang-jeok. Yi was an outstanding figure, a poet and calligrapher who went 12 times to China and was greatly admired by the scholars he met there. In 1845, Yi returned to China with the painting, which he showed to the scholars he met. Sixteen of them composed appreciatiative colophons which were attached to the left side of the painting, creating a lengthy scroll. After Yiâs return to Korea, some Korean scholars also added their tributes, creating a unique cumulative work combining painting, poetic writing and calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moam.egloos.com/2567788 The Moam Collection Blog in Korean]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after King [[Heonjong of Joseon|Heonjong]] in 1849, there were disputes over the relocation of his tomb, in which a friend of Gim Jeong-hui, Gwon Don-in, was involved. as a result, both were sent into exile, Gim spending the years 1850-2 in Bukcheong, [[Hamgyeong-do]] province, far in the North.

==Final years==
After the northern exile, he settled in [[Gwacheon]] (to the south of Seoul, where his birth father was buried) in a house he called Gwaji Chodang (çå°èå ). In 1856 he went to stay for a while in Bongeun-sa temple, in what is now Seoulâs Gangnam area, and is said to have become a monk. Later that same year he returned to his home in Gwacheon, and continued to write until the day before he died.

In the years following his death, his disciple Nam Byeong-gil (åç§å) and others prepared and published collections of his letters (''Wandang Cheokdok'' é®å å°ºç) and of his poems (''Damyeon Jaesigo'' è¦ç³§é½è©©è) in 1867; a collection of his other writings (''Wandangjip'' é®å é) was published in 1868. A complete edition of his works, (''Wandang Seonsaeng Jeonjip'' é®å åçå¨é), was published by his great-great-grandson Gim Ik-hwan (éç¿ç¥) in 1934.

==Achievements==
The influence of Gim Jeong-hui among the Korean scholars of the later 19th century was immense. He was reputed to have taught 3,000 of them and was seen as the leader of a modernizing trend that developed into the Gaehwapa Enlightenment Party at the end of the 19th century. Among the names associated with him we find Shin Wi (ç³ç·¯, 1769â1845), O Gyeong-seok (å³æ¶é«, 1831â1879), Min Tae-ho (éå°é¬, 1834â1884), Min Gyu-ho (éå¥é¬, 1836â1878), Gang Wi (å§ç, 1820â1884).

His main scholarly interest was in documentary history and monumental inscriptions. He maintained correspondence on these topics with major scholars in China. He was particularly celebrated for having deciphered and identified the stele on Mount Bukhan commemorating a visit by King Jinheung of [[Silla]] (540â576). He is remembered for his outstanding achievements in calligraphy, ink painting, as well as his writings in prose and poetry. He was in the habit of devising a special Ho (pen-name) for himself whenever he dedicated a painting of orchids to an acquaintance, so that he became the person of his generation with the most such names.

==Buddhism==
It seems that Gim Jeong-hui was accustomed to frequenting [[Buddhist temples]] from his childhood onward. There are indications that the sudden death in or around 1805 of several of those he had been close to drove him to deepen his Buddhist practice. Among his calligraphic work, a number of copies of Buddhist [[SÅ«tra]]s and other texts survive and he wrote name boards for halls in Daeheung-sa, Bongeun-sa and other temples. The reformists of the Practical Learning tradition often showed an interest in either [[Catholicism]] or [[Buddhism]], as part of their reaction against the rigidly secular [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophy.

He was especially close to the Ven. [[Cho-ui]] Seonsa (èè¡£ç¦ªå¸«, Uiseon (ææ, 1786â1866) and Baekpa Daesa (ç½å¡å¤§å¸«, Geungseon äºç, 1767â1852).

In 1815, [[Cho-ui]] first visited Seoul and established strong relationships with a number of highly educated scholar-officials, several of whom had been to China, who became his friends and followers. These included the son-in-law of King [[Jeongjo]] (æ­£ç¥ r. 1776-1800), Haegeo-doin Hong Hyeon-Ju æµ·å± éäºº æ´ªé¡¯å¨ (1793â1865) and his brother Yeoncheon Hong Seok-Ju æ·µæ³ æ´ªå¥­å¨ (1774â1842), the son of Dasan [[Jeong Yak-yong]], Unpo Jeong Hak-Yu èé ä¸å­¸æ¸¸ (1786â1855), as well as Gim Jeong-Hui and his brothers Sanchon [[Gim Myeong-hui]] å±±æ³ éå½å (1788â1857) and Geummi Gim Sang-hu ç´ç³ éç¸å (1794â1861). It was most unusual for a Buddhist monk, who as such was assigned the lowest rank in society, to be recognized as a poet and thinker in this way by members of the Confucian establishment. As a monk, Cho-ui was not allowed to enter the city walls of [[Seoul]] and had to receive visits from these scholars while living in Cheongnyangsa temple æ·¸æ¶¼å¯º outside the capitalâs eastern gate or in a hermitage in the hills to the north.

Gim Jeong-Hui had initiated a controversy with the other celebrated Seon Master Baekpa Geungseon (ç½å¡ äºç, 1767â1852) who had written the ''Seonmun sugyeong'' (ç¦ªææé¡ Hand Glass of Seon Literature). In his ''Baekpa Mangjeungsipojo'' (ç½å¡ å¦è­åäºæ¢ Fifteen Signs of Baekpaâs Senility), Gim wrote, âThe truth of Seon is like a light new dress without stitching, just like a heavenly dress. But the dress is patched and repatched by the inventiveness of humans, and so becomes a wornout piece of clothing.â Baekpa had written that certain traditions were superior to others, and Gim considered such quibbles to be a waste of time as well as a misunderstanding of the nature of Seon. Nonetheless, when Baekpa died at Hwaeom-sa Temple in 1852, Gim wrote an epitaph for him: è¯å´å®ä¸»ç½å¡å¤§å¾å¸«å¤§æ©å¤§ç¨ä¹ç¢.[6]&lt;ref&gt;''Korean Tea Classics'' ed./trans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">'''Heinrich (Heinz) Walter Cassirer''' (9 August 1903 â 20 February 1979) was a [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian philosopher, the son of a famous German philosopher, [[Ernst Cassirer]]. Being [[Jew]]s, the Cassirer family fled the Nazis in the 1930s.  Heinz went to [[University of Glasgow]] working with Professor [[H. J. Paton]], who persuaded him to write a book on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s third Critique, the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. Following Paton, he moved to [[Oxford]], lecturing at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].

He was a noted scholar on the thought of Kant. He thought highly of [[Karl Barth|Karl Barth's]] understanding of Kant.  Cassirer, a "translator and interpret of Kant, is reliably reported to have asked, âWhy is it that this Swiss theologian understands Kant far better than any philosopher I have come across?â" (Gunton 2002: xvi). While at Glasgow, his observations of society in Scotland led him to speak of "'Highland ravings' - the obsessive clinging on to what is wholly illusory" (Weitzman 1997: 30).

As a middle-aged adult, reading the [[New Testament]] for the first time, Cassirer was struck by the writings of [[St. Paul]] in relation to [[ethics]]. As he studied, he committed himself to the [[Christianity|Christian faith]] and was baptized in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=William E |date=2003 |title=English Language Bible Translators |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |page=47 |isbn=9780786414253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a translation of the [[New Testament]] from the Greek sources, titled ''[[God's New Covenant: A New Testament Translation]]''. His own Jewish heritage and knowledge of Jewish customs is said to have given a unique insight into familiar Bible texts. His translation is also noted for its formal language. Below is a sample passage, Matthew 7:24-25.

{{Quote|"What, then, is the nature of the person, whoever he may be, who hears these words of mine and acts on them? He is like a man of prudence who built his house on a rock. The rain descended, the floodwaters rose, the winds blew and hurled themselves against that house. But it did not fall because it was on rock that its foundations were laid."}}

== Biography ==

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was born c. 965 to an Arab&lt;ref name="Vernet 1996 788"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon 2006"/&gt; family in [[Basra]], [[Medieval Iraq|Iraq]], 
which was [[Iranian Intermezzo|at the time]] part of the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid emirate]]. 
He held a position with the title ''vizier'' in his native Basra, and made a name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics. 
As he claimed to be able to regulate the [[flooding of the Nile]], he was invited to by [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] in order to realise a [[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic project]] at [[Aswan]]. However, Ibn al-Haytham was forced to concede the impracticability of his project.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993 149"&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his return to Cairo, he was given an administrative post. After he proved unable to fulfill this task as well, he contracted the ire of the caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]],&lt;ref&gt;The Prisoner of Al-Hakim. Clifton, NJ: Blue Dome Press, 2017. {{ISBN|1682060160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph's death in 1021, after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Brockelmann]], ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', vol. 1 (1898), [https://archive.org/stream/geschichtederar00brocgoog#page/n522/mode/2up p. 469].&lt;/ref&gt;
Legend has it that Alhazen [[feigned madness]] and was kept under house arrest during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=1917 |title=the Great Islamic Encyclopedia |publisher=Cgie.org.ir |accessdate=27 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930153427/http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=1917 |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}{{verify source|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he wrote his influential ''[[Book of Optics]]''.

== ''Book of Optics'' ==
{{main|Book of Optics}}

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven-volume treatise on [[optics]] ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics''), written from 1011 to 1021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Khalili|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Optics'' was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crombie|1971|p=147, n. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ efn| A. Mark Smith has determined that there were at least two translators, based on their facility with Arabic; the first, more experienced scholar began the translation at the beginning of Book One, and handed it off in the middle of Chapter Three of Book Three. {{harvnb|Smith|2001}} '''91''' Volume 1: Commentary and Latin text pp.xx-xxi. See also his 2006, 2008, 2010 translations.}} It was printed by [[Friedrich Risner]] in 1572, with the title ''Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus'' (English : Thesaurus of Optics: seven books of the Arab Alhazeni, first edition: concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~mcneil/cit/citlcalhazen1.htm |title=Alhazen (965â1040): Library of Congress Citations |publisher=Malaspina Great Books |accessdate=23 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190009/http://www.mala.bc.ca/~mcneil/cit/citlcalhazen1.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}{{verify source|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risner is also the author of the name variant "Alhazen"; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=xxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work enjoyed a great reputation during the [[Middle Ages]]. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the [[BibliothÃ¨que nationale]] in [[Paris]] in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], and one in the library of [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=xxii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of optics ===
{{See also|Horopter}}
[[File:Thesaurus opticus Titelblatt.jpg|thumb|Front page of the ''Opticae Thesaurus'', which included the first printed Latin translation of Alhazen's ''Book of Optics''. The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.]]
Two major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that "from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point".&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}."/&gt;  He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the objectâfor any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76â78}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' ([[Book of Optics]]) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}."/&gt;

Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvnb|Al Deek|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heeffer|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]], and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', published in the year 1088 C.E.. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', however Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of Science and Technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: {{quote|"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wade|Finger|2001}}: {{quote|"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham."}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the device.

Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]. He wrote a description of vertical [[horopter]]s 600 years before [[Aguilonius]] that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius'sâand his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}; {{harvnb|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lejeune|1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sabra,&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raynaud&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raynaud|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-MÃ¼ller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.

Alhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=691}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=689}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which he sought to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages= 80â85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|pages=186, 192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed [[Galen]] in believing that the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the [[retina]] was also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|1998|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=437}}  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657357?seq=104&amp;Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=child&amp;searchText=does&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dchild%2Bdoes%26amp%3Bfilter%3Diid%253A10.2307%252Fi370516#page_scan_tab_contents ''De Aspectibus'' Book Two, 3.39 p.437, via JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (''i'tibar'')(Arabic: Ø¥Ø¹ØªØ¨Ø§Ø±) and [[Scientific control|controlled testing]] in his scientific inquiries.  Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (''ilm tabi'i'') with mathematics (''ta'alim''; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectivae'')&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,[http://perspectiva.biblhertz.it/doc01.VII.html ''De aspectibus'' Book 7], for his experiments in refraction&lt;/ref&gt; and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and [[dioptrics]] (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).&lt;ref name="{{harvs|nb|last=el-bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}."&gt;{{harvs|nb|last=El-Bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [[Bradley Steffens]] in his book ''Ibn Al-Haytham: First Scientist'' has argued that Alhazen's approach to testing and experimentation made an important contribution to the scientific method. --&gt;

According to Matthias Schramm,&lt;ref name=thiele2005&gt;[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82356023.pdf see Schramm's Habilitationsschrift, ''Ibn al-Haythams Weg zur Physik'' (Steiner, Wiesbaden, 1963)  as cited by RÃ¼diger Thiele (2005) ''Historia Mathematica'' '''32''', 271â274. "In Memoriam: Matthias Schramm, 1928â2005"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen "was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[apertures]] onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964|pp=463â4}}&lt;/ref&gt; G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his ''Book of Optics'' had not yet been fully translated from Arabic.  While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Toomer does concede that "Schramm sums up [Alhazen's] achievement in the development of scientific method."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toomer 1964 lists, as a precondition, what is needed for historians to investigate Schramm's claim (1963) that Ibn al-Haytham was the true founder of modern physics,&lt;ref name=thiele2005 /&gt; is translations of Ibn al-Haytham.&lt;ref name=toomer1964Review&gt;[[G.

Mark Smith recounts Alhazen's elaboration of Ptolemy's experiments in double vision, reflection, and refraction: Alhazen's ''Optics'' book influenced the Perspectivists in Europe, Roger Bacon, Witelo, and Peckham. ''The Optics'' was incorporated into Risner's 1572 printing of ''Opticae Thesaurus'', through which Kepler&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2015|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally resolved the contradictions inherent in [[Witelo]]'s explanation of the imaging chain, from external object to the retina of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alhazen's problem ===
{{main|Alhazen's problem}}
[[File:Theorem of al-Haitham.JPG|thumb|The [[Circle#Theorems|theorem of Ibn Haytham]]]]
His work on [[catoptrics]] in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer." This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165â9 &amp;amp; 173â4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Highfield|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories]] (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|agrawal|taguchi|ramalingam|2010}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|agrawal|taguchi|ramalingam|2010}}."/&gt;

He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s and concluded that only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [[Oblique angle|oblique]] projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of [[experimental psychology]], for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [[optical illusion]]s.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{harvnb|Khaleefa|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the "founder of [[psychophysics]]", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen offered an explanation of the [[Moon illusion]], an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|Plug|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9â10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135-50 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|Ross|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.

== Other works on physics ==

=== Optical treatises ===

Besides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Dawâ'' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}."&gt;{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celestial physics ===
Alhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypothesesâin other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] "greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses "were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duhem|1969|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').

=== Mechanics ===

In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}."/&gt; In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}."&gt;{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Astronomical works ==

=== ''On the Configuration of the World'' ===

In his ''On the Configuration of the World'' Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:{{quote|The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langermann|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Lorch|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=34â41}}; {{harvnb|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' ===

In his ''Al-ShukÅ«k âalÄ BatlamyÅ«s'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8â10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a "true configuration" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}."/&gt; In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:

{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}."/&gt;}}

He held that the criticism of existing theoriesâwhich dominated this bookâholds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.

=== ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' ===

Alhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other astronomical works ===

Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed|2000|pp=49â50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8â9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical works ==
[[File:AlhazenSummation.png|thumb|150px|Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula]]
In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on "the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faruqi|2006|pp=395â6}}:
{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965â1041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. [...] Al-Haythamâs contributions to geometry and number theory went well beyond the Archimedean tradition. Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry. Subsequently, this work led in pure mathematics to the harmonious fusion of algebra and geometry that was epitomised by Descartes in geometric analysis and by Newton in the calculus. Al-Haytham was a scientist who made major contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy during the latter half of the tenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rottman|2000}}, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geometry ===
[[File:LunesOfAlhazen.svg|thumb|The lunes of Alhazen. The two blue lunes together have the same area as the green right triangle.|220px]]
Alhazen explored what is now known as the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[parallel postulate]], the fifth [[Axiom|postulate]] in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], using a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eder|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1998|p=269}}: {{quote|In effect, this method characterised parallel lines as lines always equidistant from one another and also introduced the concept of motion into geometry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the [[Lambert quadrilateral]], which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the "Ibn al-HaythamâLambert quadrilateral".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rozenfeld|1988|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of [[squaring the circle]] using the area of [[Lune (mathematics)|lune]]s (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}."&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two lunes formed from a [[right triangle]] by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the [[Lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Alhazen]]; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alsina|Nelsen|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number theory ===

Alhazen's contributions to [[number theory]] include his work on [[perfect number]]s. In his ''Analysis and Synthesis'', he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''â1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1) where 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1 is [[Prime number|prime]], but he was not able to prove this result; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] later proved it in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}."/&gt;

Alhazen solved problems involving [[congruence relation|congruences]] using what is now called [[Wilson's theorem]]. In his ''Opuscula'', Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}."/&gt;

=== Calculus ===
Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2691411 |author=Katz, Victor J. |title=Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India |jstor=2691411 |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=163â174 |year=1995 }} [165â9, 173â4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other works ==

=== ''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' ===

Alhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.

=== Engineering ===

In [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineering]], one account of his career as a [[civil engineer]] has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid [[Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], to regulate the [[flooding]] of the [[Nile]] River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]]. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [[feigned madness]] so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===

In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a [[Vacuum|void]], and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}."/&gt; [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in ''Fi al-Radd âala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haythamâs place'') for its geometrization of place.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}."/&gt;

Alhazen also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2005|pp=219â40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Alhazen was a Muslim; it is not certain to which school of Islam he belonged. As a Sunni, he may have been either a follower of the [[Ash'ari]] school,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|1998}}, {{harvnb|Bettany|1995|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a follower of the [[Mu'tazili]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodgson|2006|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sabra (1978) even suggested he might have been an adherent of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sabra|1978a|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; 
He also wrote a treatise entitled ''Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation'' in which he discussed finding the [[Qibla]], where prayers ([[salat]]) are directed towards, mathematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Topdemir|2007b|pp=8&amp;ndash;9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works, e.g. 
in  ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'':
{{quote|Truth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...&lt;ref name=Sambursky1974&gt;Translated by S. Pines, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In ''The Winding Motion'':
{{quote|From the statements made by the noble Shaykh, it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (''taqlid''); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding the relation of objective truth and God:
{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the effulgence and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment.

His main work, ''[[Book of Optics|Kitab al-Manazir]]'' (''Book of Optics''), was known in the [[Muslim world]] mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by [[KamÄl al-DÄ«n al-FÄrisÄ«]], the ''TanqÄ«á¸¥ ''al-ManÄáºir'' li-dhawÄ« l-abá¹£Är wa l-baá¹£Ä'ir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[al-Andalus]], it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the [[Banu Hud|Banu Hud dynasty]] of [[Zaragoza|Zaragossa]] and author of an important mathematical text, [[al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|al-Mu'taman ibn HÅ«d]]. A Latin translation of the ''Kitab al-Manazir'' was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|2007|pages=122, 128â129}}. {{harvtxt|Grant|1974|p=[{{google books|fAPN_3w4hAUC|plainurl=yes|page=392}} 392]}} notes the ''Book of Optics'' has also been denoted as ''Opticae Thesaurus Alhazen Arabis'', as ''De Aspectibus'', and also as ''Perspectiva''&lt;/ref&gt;  This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: [[Roger Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1996|p=11}}, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Grosseteste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Authier|2013|p=23}}: "Alhazen's works in turn inspired many scientists of the Middle Ages, such as the English bishop, Robert Grosseteste (ca 1175â1253), and the English Franciscan, Roger Bacon (ca 1214â1294), Erazmus Ciolek Witelo, or Witelon (ca 1230* 1280), a Silesian-born Polish friar, philosopher and scholar, published in ca 1270 a treatise on optics, Perspectiva, largely based on Alhazen's works."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witelo]], [[Giambattista della Porta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magill|Aves|1998|p=66}}: "Roger Bacon, John Peckham, and Giambattista della Porta are only some of the many thinkers who were influenced by Alhazen's work."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo Da Vinci]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zewail|Thomas|2010|p=5}}: "The Latin translation of Alhazen's work influenced scientists and philosophers such as (Roger) Bacon and da Vinci, and formed the foundation for the work by mathematicians like Kepler, Descartes and Huygens..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|El-Bizri|2010|p=12}}: "This [Latin] version of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics, which became available in print, was read and consulted by scientists and philosophers of the caliber of Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Huygens as discussed by [[Nader El-Bizri]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magill|Aves|1998|p=66}}: "Sabra discusses in detail the impact of Alhazen's ideas on the optical discoveries of such men as Descartes and Christiaan Huygens; see also {{harvnb|El-Bizri|2005a}}."&lt;/ref&gt; [[RenÃ© Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|El-Bizri|2010|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magill|Aves|1998|p=66}}: "Even Kepler, however, used some of Alhazen's ideas, for example, the one-to-one correspondence between points on the object and points in the eye. It would not be going too far to say that Alhazen's optical theories defined the scope and goals of the field from his day to ours."&lt;/ref&gt;  His research in [[catoptrics]] (the study of optical systems using mirrors) centred on spherical and [[Parabola|parabolic]] mirrors and [[spherical aberration]]. He made the observation that the ratio between the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] and [[refraction]] does not remain constant, and investigated the [[Magnification|magnifying]] power of a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as "[[Alhazen's problem]]".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Meanwhile in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced [[Averroes]]' writings on optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Topdemir|2007a|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by Persian scientist [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (died ca. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name="{{harvs|nb|last=el-bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}."/&gt; Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on [[cosmology]] were translated into Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and other languages.

The [[impact crater]] [[Alhazen (crater)|Alhazen]] on the Moon is named in his honour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chong|Lim|Ang|2002}} Appendix 3, [{{google books|id=vIcFxgAs-C8C|plainurl=yes|page=129}} p. 129].&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[asteroid]] [[59239 Alhazen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|NASA|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of Alhazen, the [[Aga Khan University]] (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as "The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aku.edu/res-office/pdfs/AKU_Research_Publications_1995â1998.pdf AKU Research Publications 1995-98] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104215931/http://www.aku.edu/res-office/pdfs/AKU_Research_Publications_1995 |date=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen, by the name Ibn al-Haytham, is featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000-[[dinar]] banknote issued in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 10-dinar notes from 1982.

The 2015 [[International Year of Light]] celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ibn Al-Haytham and the Legacy of Arabic Optics|publisher=2015 INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF LIGHT|url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/ScienceStories/1000-Years-of-Arabic-Optics.html|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorations ==
In 2014, the "[[Hiding in the Light]]" episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', presented by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by [[Alfred Molina]] in the episode.

Over forty years previously, [[Jacob Bronowski]] presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''. In episode 5 (''The Music of the Spheres''), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was "the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.

H. J. J. Winter, a British historian of science, summing up the importance of Ibn al-Haytham in the history of [[physics]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winter |first1=H. J. J. |title=THE OPTICAL RESEARCHES OF IBN AL-HAITHAM |journal=Centaurus |date=September 1953 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=190â210 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1953.tb00529.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0498.1953.tb00529.x |language=en |issn=0008-8994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[UNESCO]] declared 2015 the [[International Year of Light]] and its Director-General Irina Bokova dubbed Ibn al-Haytham 'the father of optics'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/Programme-Opening_IYL2015.pdf 2015, International Year of Light]&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst others, this was to celebrate Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy. An international campaign, created by the [[1001 Inventions]] organisation, titled ''1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham'' featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work, partnering with science centers, science festivals, museums, and educational institutions, as well as digital and social media platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/1000_years_of_arabic_optics_to_be_a_focus_of_the_international_year_of_light_in_2015 |title=1000 Years of Arabic Optics to be a Focus of the International Year of Light in 2015 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also produced and released the short educational film [[1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham]].

== Criticism ==
===Refraction===
{{harvtxt|Smith|2010}} has noted that Alhazen's treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith| 2010}}  para.[3.33], p.259, footnote67. Note 67 is on p.361. [3.33] is the summary of how to measure the sizes of the angle of refraction for air to water, air to glass, glass to air, glass to water, for plane, concave, and convex surfaces&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy published his experimental results for refraction, in contrast.

== List of works ==

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2002a|p=773}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8â9}}; {{harvnb|Topdemir|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49506">An '''internet relationship''' is a relationship between people who have met [[online]], and in many cases know each other only via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last3=Crowcroft | first3=Jon | last2= Bodaghi |first2=Mansoureh|last1=Quercia |first1=Daniele|title=Loosing friends on facebook|journal=ACM Web Science Conference|url=http://delcampovillares.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/websci_loosing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online relationships are similar in many ways to [[pen pal]] relationships. This relationship can be romantic, platonic, or even based on business affairs. An internet relationship (or online relationship) is generally sustained for a certain amount of time before being titled a relationship, just as in-person relationships. The major difference here is that an internet relationship is sustained via computer or online service, and the individuals in the relationship may or may not ever meet each other in person. Otherwise, the term is quite broad and can include relationships based upon text, video, audio, or even virtual character. This relationship can be between people in different regions, different countries, different sides of the world, or even people who reside in the same area but do not communicate in person.

== Technological advances ==
According to J. Michael Jaffe, author of ''Gender, Pseudonyms, and CMC: Masking Identities and Baring Souls'', "the Internet was originally established to expedite communication between governmental scientists and defense experts, and was not at all intended to be the popular 'interpersonal mass medium' it has become",&lt;ref name="Jaffe2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fragment.nl/mirror/Jaffe1995/|title=Gender, Pseudonyms, and CMC: Masking Identities and Baring Souls|last=Jaffe|first=J. Michael|publisher=University of Michigan|work=Paper for 45th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association, 1995, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA|accessdate=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901232435/http://www.fragment.nl/mirror/Jaffe1995/|archivedate=1 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet new and revolutionary devices enabling the mass public to communicate online are constantly being developed and released.

Rather than having many devices for different uses and ways of interacting, communicating online is more accessible and cheaper by having an Internet function built into one device, such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[laptop]]s, and [[smartphone]]s. Other ways of communicating online with these devices are via services and applications such as [[Email]], [[Skype]], [[iChat]], [[instant messaging]] programs, [[social networking service]]s, asynchronous discussion groups, online games, [[virtual worlds]] and the [[World Wide Web]].

Some of these ways of communicating online are asynchronous (meaning not in real time), such as [[YouTube]] and some are synchronous (immediate communication), such as [[Twitter]]. Synchronous communication occurs when two or more participants are interacting in real time via voice or text chat.&lt;ref name="Wood, A and Smith, M.2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Online communication : linking technology, identity and culture|last=Wood|first=Andrew F.|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew J.|publisher=Erlbaum|year=2001|isbn=0-8058-3731-0|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of relationships ==
Many types of internet relationships are possible in today's world of technology.

=== Internet dating ===
Internet dating is very relevant in the lives of many individuals worldwide.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yENNc7Fp3vQC&amp;dq=online+dating+sites+in+the+90s|title=Social networking communities and e-dating services: concepts and implications|last=Romm- Livermore|first=Celia|publisher=Idea Group Inc. (IGI)|year=2009|isbn=9781605661049|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major benefit in the rise of Internet dating is the decrease in prostitution. People no longer need to search on the streets to find casual relationships. They can find them online if that is what they desire.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2" /&gt; Internet dating websites offer matchmaking services for people to find love or whatever else they may be looking for. The creation of the internet and its progressive innovations have opened up doors for people to meet other people who they may very well have never met otherwise.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2" /&gt;

==== Dating website innovations ====
Although the availability of uploading videos to the internet is not a new innovation, it has been made easier since 2008 thanks to [[YouTube]]. YouTube began the surge of video streaming sites in 2005 and within three years, smaller web developers started implementing video sharing on their sites. Internet dating sites have benefitted greatly since the surge in easiness and accessibility of picture and video uploading.&lt;ref name="online videos2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2279/1/Proceedings_amcis-0635-2009-File001.pdf|title=Performing the Discourse of Sexuality Online Foucault, Butler, and Video-sharing on Sexual Social Networking Sites|last=Kreps|first=David G.|publisher=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos and pictures are equally important for most personal profiles. These profiles can be found on sites used for [[interpersonal relationships]] other than dating as well. "The body, although graphically absent, does not have to be any less present."&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt; Older and less advanced sites usually still allow, and often require, each user to upload a picture. Newer and more advanced sites offer the possibility of [[streaming media]] live via the user's profile for the site. The inclusion of videos and pictures has become almost a necessity for sexual social networking sites to maintain the loyalty of their members.&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt; It is appealing to internet users to be able to view and share videos, especially when forming relationships or friendships.&lt;ref name="Online dating has changed everything, author says2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jason|first=Sharon|date=January 23, 2013|title=Online dating has changed everything, author says|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/23/love-algorithms-online-dating/1856853/|journal=USA Today|issue=Internet Dating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Who uses online dating sites ====
According to an article in the ''New York Times'', mediated matchmaking has been around since the mid-1800s.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaefer|first=Laura J.|date=14 February 2003|title=Looking for Love, Online or On Paer|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Looking+for+love%2C+online+or+on+paper.+The+New+York+Times+Shaefer&amp;oq=Looking+for+love%2C+online+or+on+paper.+The+New+York+Times+Shaefer&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;gs_l=hp.3...8030.10040.1.10149.9.9.0.0.0.0.92.585.8.8.0.crf.1.3Rk45Pdpew4&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=fb8265af22147407&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=598|journal=The New York Times|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online dating was made available in the mid-1990s, with the creation of the first dating sites.&lt;ref name="Brooks2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/files/idea-white-paper-final-review-copy-only-updated-1-19.pdf|title=How has Internet dating changed society?  An Insider's Look|last=Brooks|first=Mark|publisher=Courtland Brooks|work=Scholarly Article|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dating sites create a space for liberation of sexuality. According to Sam Yagan of [[OkCupid]], "the period between New Year's Day and Valentine's Day is [our] busiest six weeks of the year".&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt; Changes that online dating companies have created include not only the increase of pickiness in singles, but the rise in interracial marriages and spread the acceptance of homosexual individuals. Dating sites "are a place where sexual minorities, inter-sexed people and gay people are enjoying a newly found freedom".&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt; Several studies have shown the availability of online dating to produce a greater closeness and intimacy between individuals because it circumvents barriers that face-to-face interactions might have.  "Participating in personal relationships online allow for almost full freedom from power relations in the offline/real world."&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt;

A plethora of virtual sexual identities are represented in online profiles. The amount of personal information users are being asked to provide is constantly increasing. More and more online users are starting to explore and experiment with aspects of their sexual identities, whereas before, they may have felt uncomfortable due to social constraints or fear of possible repercussions.&lt;ref name="Electronic Cloak2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=199529|title=Electronic Cloak: Secret Sexual Deviance in Cybersociety|last=DiMarco|first=Heather|publisher=William Publishing|year=2003|location=Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most internet sites containing personal profiles require individuals to fill in "personal information" sections. Often these sections include a series of multiple choice questions. Due to the anonymity of these virtual profiles, individuals are more frequent to 'role'-play at being one of the predefined 'types', although offline, reservations may inhibit the individual from sharing true answers.

There have also been many studies done to observe online daters and their reason for turning to the internet to look for romantic partners. According to Robert J. Brym and Rhonda L. Lenton, users of online games, websites, and other virtual communities are encouraged to conceal their identities and learn things about themselves that they never knew before.&lt;ref name="canada2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bestsoftworks.com/docs/loveonline.pdf|title=Love Online: A Report On Digital Dating in Canada|last=Brym|first=Robert J.|publisher=Msn.ca|year=2001|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a concealed identity, an online user can be whoever they want to be at that exact moment. They have the ability to venture outside of their comfort zone and act as someone completely different.

The ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication'' reports the results of a study conducted by Robert J. Stephure, Susan D. Boon, Stacy L. MacKinnon, and Vicki L. Deveau on types of relationships online participants were seeking. They concluded that "when asked what they were looking for in an online relationship, the considerable majority of participants expressed interest in seeking fun, companionship, and someone to talk to. Most also reported interests in developing casual friendships and dating relationships with online partners. Substantially fewer reported using the Internet for the specific purposes of identifying potential sexual or marital partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Boon|first2=Susan D.|last3=MacKinnon|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Deveau|first4=Vicki L.|year=2009|title=Internet Initiated Relationships: Associations Between Age and Involvement in Online Dating|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=14|issue=3|pages=658â681|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01457.x|last1=Stephure|first1=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012 looked at about 19,000 married people and those who met their spouse online said their marriage was more satisfying than those who met their spouse offline. Plus, marriages that began online were less likely to end in separation or divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Insider|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/happy-marriage-online-dating-2017-10|accessdate=31 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faye Mishna, Alan McLuckie, and Michael Saini, co-authors of the Oxford Journal article ''Real-World Dangers in an Online Reality: A Qualitative Study Examining Online Relationships and Cyber Abuse'', reported the results of their research and observation of over 35,000 individuals between the ages of 6 and 24 who have been or currently are a part of an internet relationship. Of the final 346 posts chosen to be included in the study, the average age of online users sharing information about their online relationship(s) was 14 years old.&lt;ref name="Abuse2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mishna|first=Faye|date=June 2009|title=Real- World Dangers in an Online Reality: A Qualitative Study Examining Online Relationships and Cyber Abuse|url=http://swr.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/2/107.full.pdf|journal=The Oxford Journal|volume=33|issue=2|author2=Alan McLuckie|author3=Michael Saini}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming result was that children and youth consider their online relationships to be just as "real" as their offline relationships. The study also showed that the internet plays a crucial role in most sexual and romantic experiences of adolescent users.&lt;ref name="Abuse2" /&gt;

==== Success of dating websites and social networks ====
Canaan Partners have reported that the dating industry brings in an estimate of 3-4 billion dollars yearly from membership fees and advertisements.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt; The range of dating sites has expanded vastly over the past two decades. There are dating websites that focus on the [[matchmaking]] of certain groups of people based on religion, sexual preference, race, etc.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt;

The average life expectancy has been on a rise, leaving many young singles feeling as if they have plenty of time to find a [[life partner]]. This opens up time to travel and experience things without the burden of a relationship. As of 1996, more than 20% of Canadians "were not living in the same census subdivision as they were five years earlier"&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt; and as of 1998, more than half of employed Canadians worried "they [did] not have enough time to spend with their family and friends".&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt; Due to an increase in many businesses requiring their employees to travel, singles, often young professionals, find online dating websites to be the perfect answer to their "problem", states Brym and Lenton.

Erik Shipmon, author of âWhy Do People Date Online?", exclaims, "the Internet is the ultimate singles' barâwithout the noise, the drunks, and the high cost of all those not-so-happy hours. Nor, thanks to online dating membership sites, do you have to depend on your friends and family to hook you up with people they think would be perfect for youâand who wouldn't be perfect for, well, anyone, which is why they are still unattachedâ.&lt;ref name="internet like singles bar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cupidnights.com/dating-advice/article-12.html|title=Why do people date online|last=Shipmon|first=Erik|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cybersex ====
Some people who are in an online relationship also participate in [[cybersex]], which is a virtual sex encounter in which two or more individuals who are connected remotely via computer network send each other sexually explicit messages describing a sexual experience. This can also include individuals communicating sexually via video or audio. Some websites offer a cybersex service, where a patron pays the website owner in exchange for an online sexual experience with another person.

Cybersex sometimes includes real life masturbation. The quality of a cybersex encounter typically depends upon the participants' abilities to evoke a vivid, visceral mental picture in the minds of their partners. Imagination and suspension of disbelief are also critically important. Cybersex can occur either within the context of existing or intimate relationships, e.g. among lovers who are geographically separated, or among individuals who have no prior knowledge of one another and meet in virtual spaces or cyberspaces and may even remain anonymous to one another. In some contexts cybersex is enhanced by the use of a webcam to transmit real-time video of the partners.

=== Social networking relationships ===
Social networking has enabled people to connect with each other via the internet. Sometimes, members of a [[social networking service]] do know all, or many of their "friends" (Facebook) or "connections" (LinkedIn) etc. in person. However, sometimes internet relationships are formed through these services, including but not limited to: [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Google Plus]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Pinterest]], [[DeviantArt]] and [[Xanga]].

"Social networking service" is a very broad term, branching out to websites based on many different aspects. One aspect that is possible on all social networking sites is the possibility of an internet relationship. These sites enable users to search for new connections based on location, education, experiences, hobbies, age, gender, and more. This allows individuals meeting each other to already have some characteristic in common. These sites usually allow for people who do not know each other to "add" each other as a connection or friend and to send each other messages. This connection can lead to more communication between two individuals. An immense amount of information about the individuals can be found directly on their social network profile. Proving those individuals include plentiful and accurate information about themselves, people in online relationships can find out much about each other by viewing profiles and "about me's".  Communication between individuals can become more frequent, thus forming some type of relationship via the internet. This relationship can turn into an acquaintance, a friendship, a romantic relationship, or even a business partnership.

=== Online gaming ===
Online gaming elicits the introduction of many different types of people in one interface. A common type of online game where individuals form relationships is the MMORPG, or a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]. Some examples of MMORPGs are [[World of Warcraft]], [[EverQuest]], [[SecondLife]], [[Final Fantasy XI|Final Fantasy Online]], and [[Minecraft]] (see [[List of massively multiplayer online role-playing games]].) These games enable individuals to create a character that represents them and interact with other characters played by real individuals, while at the same time carrying out the tasks and goals of the actual game.

Online games other than MMORPGs can elicit internet relationships as well. Card games such as [[Online poker|poker]] and board games like [[Pictionary]] have been transformed into virtual interfaces that allow an individual to play against people across the internet, as well as chatting with them. [[Virtual pet site]]s such as [[Webkinz]] and [[Neopets]] are another type of popular online game that allow individuals to socialize with other players.

Games create social spaces for people of various ages, with userbases often crossing age brackets. Most of these games enable individuals to chat with each other, as well as form groups and [[Gaming clan|clans]]. This interaction can lead to further communication, turning into a friendship or romantic relationship.

=== Online forums and chatrooms ===
An [[Internet forum]] is a website that includes conversations in the form of posted messages. Forums can be for general chatting or can be broken down into categories and topics. They can be used to ask questions, post opinions, or debate topics. Forums include their own jargon, for example a conversation is a "thread". Different forums also have different lingo and styles of communicating.

There are religion forums, music forums, car forums, and countless other topics. These forums elicit communication between individuals no matter the location, gender, ethnicity, etc. although some do include age restrictions. Through these forums people may comment on each other's topics or threads, and with further communication form a friendship, partnership, or romantic relationship.

=== Professional relationships ===
Even in work settings, the introduction of the internet has established easier and sometimes more practical forms of communicating. Compared to traditional communication in business, communication through internet can be more efficient in the aspect of time-saving. The internet is often referred to as a vehicle for [[investor relations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedlin|first=Pontus|date=1 July 1999|title=The Internet as a vehicle for investor relations: the Swedish case|journal=European Accounting Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=373â381|doi=10.1080/096381899336104}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "electronic highway" for business transactions in the United States.&lt;ref name="Business2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing More Business on the Internet: How the Electronic Highway Is Transforming American Companies|last=Cronin|first=Mary|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1995|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has increased organizational involvement by facilitating the flow of information between face-to-face meetings and allowing for people to arrange meetings at virtually any given time. Socially, it has stimulated positive change in people's lives by creating new forms of online interaction and enhancing offline relationships worldwide, allowing for better and more efficient. In the real world, companies which are considered as leading companies in the world already introduced efficient ways of communication based on internet. (See [[business communication]]&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt;)

== Advantages ==
For more [[intimate relationship]]s, research has shown that personal disclosures create a greater sense of intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurenceau|first=JP|date=May 1998|title=Intimacy as an interpersonal process: the importance of self-disclosure, partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness in interpersonal exchanges|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1238â51|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1238|pmid=9599440|author2=Barrett, LF|author3=Pietromonaco, PR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a sense of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] and equality, which people search for in a relationship, and this is often easier to achieve online than face to face, although not all disclosures are responded to positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pennebaker|first=James W.|year=1989|title=Confession, Inhibition, and Disease|journal=Department of Psychology|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|location=Dallas, TX|publisher=Southern Methodist University|volume=22|pages=211â244|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60309-3|isbn=9780120152223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are able to engage in more self-disclosure than an average interaction, because a person can share their inner thoughts, feelings and beliefs and be met with less disapproval and fewer sanctions online than is the case in face-to-face encounters. Researcher Cooper termed this type of relationship as a "Triple A Engine" implying that internet relationships are accessible, affordable, and anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Sex in America Online: An Exploration of Sex, Marital Status, and Sexual Identity in Internet Sex Seeking and its Impacts|url=|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=45|issue=2|pages=175â86|doi=10.1080/00224490801987481|last1=Albright|first1=Julie M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Katelyn Y. A.|date=1 February 2000|title=Plan 9 From Cyberspace: The Implications of the Internet for Personality and Social Psychology|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=57â75|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0401_6|author2=Bargh, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, barriers that might stand in the way of a potential relationship such as [[physical attractiveness]], [[social anxiety]] and [[stuttering]] do not exist. Whereas those could hinder an individual in face-to-face encounters, an Internet interaction negates this and allows the individual freedom. Research has shown that stigmas such as these can make a large impact on first impressions in face-to-face meeting, and this does not apply with an online relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Katelyn Y. A.|date=1 September 1999|title=Causes and Consequences of Social Interaction on the Internet: A Conceptual Framework|journal=Media Psychology|volume=1|issue=3|pages=249â269|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0103_4|author2=Bargh, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as the internet has become a worldwide phenomenon, many people can interact with others around the world, or find someone who fits their radar or their type, if there is no one who they find physically or emotionally attractive in their own area. The internet allows for interaction of many different people so there is greater chance of finding someone more attractive. The Internet "enhances face-to-face and telephone communication as network members become more aware of each others' needs and stimulate their relationships through more frequent contact".&lt;ref name="Wellman2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Barry|date=1 November 2001|title=Does the Internet Increase, Decrease, or Supplement Social Capital? : Social Networks, Participation, and Community Commitment|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/45/3/436.full.pdf+html|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|volume=45|issue=3|pages=436â455|doi=10.1177/00027640121957286|author2=ANAbel Quan Haase|author3=James Witte|author4=Keith Hampton|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Walter's Social Information Processing Theory, computer-mediated communications can work for people.&lt;ref&gt;http://crx.sagepub.com/content/21/4/460.short&lt;/ref&gt;  While online interactions take roughly four times longer than face-to-face interactions, this gives users the opportunity to evaluate and the time to think, making sure they say the perfect response.  Thus, chronemics is the only verbal clue available to digital communications.  With the focus on conversation and not appearance, digital interactions over time will develop higher levels of intimacy than face-to-face interactions.

In ''The Forms of Capital''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pierre |last=Bourdieu |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm |title=The Forms of Capital |year=1986 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] defines social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition."

Social capital researchers have found&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Bargh|first1=John A.|last2=McKenna|first2=Katelyn Y. A.|title=THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL LIFE|url=http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/psicologia/pei/download/bargh2004.pdf|publisher=The annual review of psychology|date=11 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that âvarious forms of social capital, including ties with friends and neighbors, are related to indices of psychological well-being, such as self-esteem and satisfaction with lifeâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Ellison|first1=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|title=The Benefits of Facebook âFriends:â Social Capital and College Studentsâ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x/full
|publisher=Journal of computer-mediated communication|date= July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the use of a [[social networking service]] could help to improve the [[social capital]].

More than helping to improve the [[social capital]], the use of a [[social networking service]] could help to retain it. For instance, Cummings, Lee and Kraut have shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Cummings|first1=J.|last2=Lee|first2=J.|last3=Kraut|first3=R.|title=Communication technology and friendship during the transition from high school to college|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that communication services like [[instant messaging]] âhelp college students to remain close to their high school friends after they leave home for collegeâ.

== Disadvantages ==
The Internet provides the opportunity for [[misrepresentation]], particularly in the early stages of a relationship when commitment is low, and self-presentation and enhancement agendas are paramount.&lt;ref name="Tice et al.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Butler|first2=J. L.|last3=Muarven|first3=M. B.|last4=Stillwell|first4=A.M.|year=1995|title=When modesty prevails: differential favourability of self-representation to friends and strangers|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=|pages=1120â38|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1120|last1=Tice|first1=D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving many complaints about his social networking site [[Ashley Madison]], founder Noel Biderman responded to accusations that his and other similar [[cyber-dating]] sites are at fault for the "rising divorce rates and growth in casual dating". Biderman argued that the idea for Ashleymadison.com came to him when he realized the growing number of people on "mainstream dating sites" were married or in a relationship but posing as singles in order to start an affair.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt;

In an empirical study of commitment and misrepresentation on the internet Cornwell and Lundgren (2001)&lt;ref name="Cornwell, B. and Lundgren, D. C.(2001).2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lundgren|first2=D. C.|year=2001|title=Love on the Internet: involvement and misrepresentation in romantic relationships in cyberspace vs. real-space|url=|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=17|issue=|pages=197â211|doi=10.1016/s0747-5632(00)00040-6|last1=Cornwell|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed 80 chat-room users. Half about their 'realspace' relationships, and half about their cyberspace relationships.  They found that 'realspace' relationships were considered to be more serious, with greater feelings of commitment, than the cyber-relationship participants.  Both groups, however, reported similar levels of satisfaction and potential for 'emotional growth' with regard to romantic relationships.  Cornwell and Lundgren&lt;ref name="Cornwell, B. and Lundgren, D. C.(2001).2" /&gt; went on to ask about whether the participants had misrepresented themselves to their partner in a number of areas: their interests (e.g. hobbies, musical tastes); their age; their background; their appearance and 'mis-presentation of yourself in any other way' (p.&amp;nbsp;203). Participants responded using either yes or no to each question, and their score was summed into a misrepresentation measure. The results can be found below:&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2"&gt;Joinson, A. 2003. Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviour. Palgrave Macmillan. p.3. {{ISBN|0-333-98468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dangers of internet relationships ===
An often forgotten aspect on online interactions is the possible danger present. The option for an individual to conceal their identity may be harmless in many cases, but it can also lead to extremely dangerous situations. Hidden identities are often used in cases of [[Cyber-bullying|cyberbullying]] and [[cyberstalking]]. Concealing person's true identity is also a technique that can be used to manipulate their new online [[friend]] or [[Sexual partner|lover]] into convincing them that they are someone completely different. This is something most [[online predator]]s do in order to prey on victims. Despite the awareness of dangers, Mishna et al. found children and youth to still partake in online relationships with little care or concern for negative effects.&lt;ref name="Abuse2" /&gt; Brym and Lenton also claim that "although [their] true identities are usually concealed, they sometimes decide to meet and interact in real life". From these dangers, people seriously have considered a kind of policy forcing people to use their real name only and open their personal information. By doing this, people are not going to do harmful to others because their information can be checked by others.&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt;

Engaging in internet relationships is also risky because the information placed online about an individual does not have to be accurate. An individual can formulate an entirely different persona and pose as this person as long as they desire. This can be hurtful to individuals who are honest about their identities and believe that they are in a positive relationship or friendship with the individual. This concept has been most recently illustrated on the television show, ''[[Catfish: The TV Show]]''.

=== Internet affairs ===
Internet affairs offer a new perspective on the definition of an [[affair]]. Some people consider internet relationships to be classified as an affair while others claim contact affairs are much more serious. Trent Parker and Karen Wampler conducted a [[qualitative study]] to discover the different perceptions of internet relationships based on gender differences. Through their study they found internet affairs were considered less of an affair than a physical relationship.&lt;ref name="Parker, Trent S. 20032"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wampler|first2=Karen S.|year=2003|title=How Bad Is It? Perceptions Of The Relationship Impact Of Different Types Of Internet Sexual Activities|url=|journal=Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal|volume=25|issue=4|page=415|last1=Parker|first1=Trent S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the results from the same study Parker and Wampler also concluded that women considered sexual internet activities such as [[internet porn]] much more severe than the men did. Internet affairs and physical contact affairs are similar because they both involve another partner. "The primary difference between an internet affair and an affair is that in an affair, the couple meet to engage in the relationship. With internet affairs, on the other hand, the couple rarely meet. This offers a unique advantage to internet affairs."&lt;ref name="Parker, Trent S. 20032" /&gt;

== Effects on face-to-face interactions ==
Since the creation of the [[Internet]], [[communication]] has become one of it is prime uses. It has become a ubiquitous force in people's everyday lives due to the increase in the regularity and quality of [[interaction]]. The internet has also created a new approach to [[human]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], and it has changed the way people connect to one another in their [[social world]]s. Online relationships have also changed which effective strategies we use to perform maintenance on our relationships, depending on the exclusivity of the internet the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Kevin B.|year=2004|title=On-line Relational Maintenance Strategies and Perceptions of Partners Within Exclusively Internet Based and Primarily Internet Based Relationships|journal=Communication Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=239â253|doi=10.1080/10510970409388617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, [[Mail|postal services]] made communication possible without the necessity of physical presence, and the invention of the [[telephone]] allowed [[synchronous communication]] between people across long distances. The internet combined the advantages of both mail and telephone, unifying the speed of the telephone with the written character of the mail service. The evolution of communication within the Internet has arguably changed the nature of individuals' relationships with one another.&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; Some see a major negative impact resulting in an increased use of internet communication is of its diversion of true community&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt; because online interaction via computers is often regarded as a more impersonal communication medium than face-to-face communication.&lt;ref name="Comp Face to Face2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebie|first=Linda|date=31 October 1995|title=Interaction Process in Computer-Mediated and Face-to-Face Groups|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q21x4565t3217568/|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|volume=4|issue=2â3|pages=127â152|doi=10.1007/BF00749744|author2=Jonathan A. Rhoades|author3=Joseph E. Mcgrath|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider the incorporation of the internet allowing online activities to be "viewed as an extension of offline activities".&lt;ref name="Wellman2" /&gt;  The multiple techniques that humans use to communicate, such as taking turns or nodding in agreement, are absent in these settings.&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; Without the [[body language]] cues present in a face-to-face conversation, such as pauses or gestures, participants in instant messaging may type over one another's messages without necessarily waiting for a cue to talk. Also, with or without the correct grammar, tone and context can be misunderstood. Recently people who already adapted internet-based communication have missed face-to-face interactions because this traditional way of communication is able to offer advancement in our relationships.

=== Early positive view ===
In 1991, Stone argued that when [[virtual communities]] began forming, this process generated a new type of social space where people could still apparently meet [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]], but this required a redefinition of the terms âmeetâ and âface-to-face.â These virtual communities allowed people to effortlessly access others, and in many ways to feel better connected, feel that they receive greater support from others, and to obtain emotional satisfaction from their [[families]], [[communities]] and [[society]]. However, it does have several obvious problems for people to communicate with others. The representative limitation of this way of communications is that it cannot contain people's diverse emotions completely, so it can cause diverse misunderstanding between people.&lt;ref name="Stone, A. R.2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=114785|title=Cyberspace : first steps|last=Stone|first=Allucquere Rosanne|publisher=MIT Press|year=1991|isbn=0-262-02327-X|edition=4th print.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=81â118|chapter=Will the real body please stand up?: boundary stories about virtual cultures|editor=Benedikt, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudocommunity theory ===
In 1987, this understanding of social spaces was challenged by scholars such as [[James R. Beniger]]. Beniger questioned whether these virtual communities were ârealâ or were pseudo communities,&lt;ref name="Beniger, J.2"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987|title=Personalization of the mass media and the growth of pseudo-community|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=14|issue=|pages=352â371|doi=10.1177/009365087014003005|last1=Beniger|first1=J.|authorlink=James R. Beniger}}&lt;/ref&gt; âa pattern relating that, while looking highly [[interpersonal]] interaction, is essentially impersonal.â&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; He put forward the idea that in a society within the virtual world, participants lack the necessary honesty it would take to create a ârealâ virtual community.&lt;ref name="Beniger, J.2" /&gt;

=== Weakening of social ties ===
In many cases the introduction of the Internet as a social instigator may cause a repercussion leading to a weakening of social ties. In a study conducted in 1998, Robert Kraut et al. discovered that Internet users were becoming less socially involved. They linked this to an increase in [[loneliness]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in relation to use of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Kraut, R. E., Patterson, M., Lundmark, V., Kiesler, S., Mukhopadhyay, T., &amp; Scherlis, W.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=R|date=September 1998|title=Internet paradox. A social technology that reduces social involvement and psychological well-being?|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=53|issue=9|pages=1017â31|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.53.9.1017|pmid=9841579|author2=Patterson, M|author3=Lundmark, V|author4=Kiesler, S|author5=Mukopadhyay, T|author6=Scherlis, W|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiesler/publications/1998pdfs/1998Kraut-InternetParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these findings may have been sound, in a later study, Kraut et al.&lt;ref name="kraut022"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=Robert|date=1 January 2002|title=Internet Paradox Revisited|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=58|issue=1|pages=49â74|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00248|author2=Kiesler, Sara|author3=Boneva, Bonka|author4=Cummings, Jonathon|author5=Helgeson, Vicki|author6=Crawford, Anne|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&amp;context=hcii}}&lt;/ref&gt; revisited his original study with the idea of expanding his current initial sample and correlating it with new subsequently collected [[longitudinal data]]. This synthesis produced a different outcome than the one that Kraut had originally presented.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

In this newer paper, Kraut stated that there were fewer negative affects than he had originally found, and in some cases the negative effect had vanished. In the second study he saw that small positive effects began to appear in social [[involvement]] and psychological well-being. Assessing the effect of the Internet over a period of time, he saw people's use of the Internet increase in sophistication.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

During the Kraut et al. study, the researchers asked reclusive people if they use the Internet to counteract the loss of social skills that are needed in face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt; They also asked people with strong [[social skills]] whether they use the Internet to amplify their [[Aptitude|abilities]] to [[Social network|network]] amongst people. The study discovered that these people who already possessed strong social skills were the ones who received the most beneficial outcome to using the Internet. The concluding [[analysis]] was, that rather than helping to decrease the difference between those who already had social skills compared with those lacking in social skills, internet use had actually exacerbated the differences in the skill level needed for social interaction.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

=== Assisting reclusive people ===
This theory was later challenged in a study, by McKenna et al.,&lt;ref name="McKenna, K. Y. A., &amp; Bargh, J. A.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bargh|first2=J. A.|year=1998|title=Coming out in the age of the Internet: Identity "demarginalization" through virtual group participation|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=75|issue=|pages=681â694|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.3.681|last1=McKenna|first1=K. Y. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that indicated that people who are more [[socially inept]] use the internet to create an initial contact which allows them to explore their âtrue self" within these interactions. These social interactions within [[cyberspace]] tend to lead to closer and high quality relationships which influence face-to-face encounters. In essence, these findings meant that although it is not clear whether the internet helps reclusive people develop better social skills, it does allow reclusive people to form relationships that may not have existed otherwise because of their lack of comfort with interpersonal situations in general. When these relationships emerge into face-to-face relationships it is hard to distinguish these relationships from those that started as face-to-face interactions. Future studies on this topic may allow scholars to define whether or not society is becoming too dependent on the Internet as a social tool.&lt;ref name="McKenna, K. Y. A., &amp; Bargh, J. A.2" /&gt; Those relationships are also found for people suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidal ideation]] and other [[mental health]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=McLean|first2=J. P.|last3=Sheffield|first3=J.|year=2009|title=Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes|url=|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|volume=13|issue=3|pages=264â276|doi=10.1080/13811110903044419|pmid=19591000|last1=Harris|first1=K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suicidal people were more likely to go online in search of new interpersonal relationships and to seek interpersonal help. Similar findings were found for suicidal [[LGBT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Sexuality and suicidality: Matched-pairs analyses reveal unique characteristics in non-heterosexual suicidal behaviors|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42|issue=5|pages=729â737|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0112-2|last1=Harris|first1=K. M.|pmid=23657812}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that people who have trouble meeting similar others, not only the 'socially inept', are using the internet to create stronger and more extensive interpersonal relationships.

===The danger of the âalone togetherâ===

The meaning of the word â[[friend]]â remains somewhat unclear, especially when it comes to online friendship. Online friends are either relations that people know it the real world or people met once at a conference, or maybe they are friends with someone known on a [[social networking service]].
[[Albert Mehrabian]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehrabian|first=Albert|year=1971|title=Silent Messages|publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth]]|edition=1st|isbn=0-534-00910-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 93% of communication is through nonverbal means (including body language) and only 7% down to verbal communication. Thus, it would be difficult to build true friendships on a social network. Moreover, according to [[Sherry Tutkle]], a âface-to-face friendship is riskyâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turkle, Sherry |title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can lead people to a virtual confinement.
	
The other issue raised by experts is the race for Facebook friends. If a Facebook user had in 2012 243 friends in average,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/271947/social-network-contacts-average-number-of-friends-in-the-uk-by-gender/|title=social-network-contacts-average-number-of-friends-in-the-uk-by-gender||date=January 11, 2018|website=Statista|publisher=|access-date=Mars 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; this number increased to 338 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=6 new facts about Facebook|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/6-new-facts-about-facebook/|accessdate=10 March 2018|work=Pew research|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Whatever the exact number is, it is safe to assume that it is greater than 150. However, According to evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin Dunbar]], 150 is the largest number of people you can share trust and obligations with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunbar, Robin I. M. |title=How many friends does one person need?: Dunbar's number and other evolutionary quirks |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-571-25342-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether new technologies such as the [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]s exacerbate social isolation (of any origin) is a debated topic among [[sociologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1369118X.2010.513417 |title=Core Networks, Social Isolation and New Media: How Internet and mobile phone use is related to network size and diversity |year=2011 |last1=Hampton |first1=Keith |last2=Sessions |first2=Lauren |last3=Her |first3=Eun Ja |journal=Information, Communication and Society |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=130â155}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of online [[social networking]] communities, there are increasing options to become involved with social activities that do not require real-world physical interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4069">'''Joel J. Kupperman''' (born May 18, 1936) is a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Connecticut]] and author of ''[[Six Myths about the Good Life]]'', a popular philosophical volume centering on those values most worth engaging in human life. He is best known to the general public as a young math expert on the radio and television show ''[[Quiz Kids]]''. He astounded audiences with his ability to do complex mathematics rapidly and seemingly "in his head." He also had strong general knowledge, and was often the winner of the weekly  competitions featured on the show. The 1944 film ''[[Chip Off the Old Block]]'' , starring [[Donald O'Connor]], [[Peggy Ryan]] and [[Ann Blyth]], featured Kupperman as the "Quiz Kid", representative of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kupperman, Joel J. ''Six Myths about the Good Life: Thinking about what has Value''. [[Indianapolis]]: [[Hackett Publishing Company|Hackett]], [[2006 in literature|2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his initial ''Quiz Kids'' shows, Kupperman, who was then 7, lisped, which emphasized his youth and endeared him to the listening audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19830109&amp;id=ip4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UGgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6968,4643405|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one episode of ''Quiz Kids'', Joel showed his ability to multiply any number times 99 "in his head." When asked how he was able to do this he replied "It's a theequit twick." When asked what the "secret trick" was, he explained that he merely multiplied the number he was given by one hundred, then subtracted the original number from that total to get the correct answer.

He received his bachelor's and master's degrees at the [[University of Chicago]], and his doctorate at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uconn.edu/philosophy/department/kupperman/vjk.pdf|title=Joel J.

'''John Harwood Hick''' (20 January 1922 â 9 February 2012) was a [[Philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] and [[Theology|theologian]] born in England who taught in the United States for the larger part of his career. In [[philosophical theology]], he made contributions in the areas of [[theodicy]], [[eschatology]], and [[Christology]], and in the philosophy of religion he contributed to the areas of [[epistemology]] of religion and [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref name=peters&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Peters |first=Richard |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Man of Many Mysticisms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
John Hick was born on 20 January 1922 to a middle-class family in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], England. In his teens, he developed an interest in philosophy and religion, being encouraged by his uncle, who was an author and teacher at the [[University of Manchester]]. Hick initially pursued a [[law degree]] at the [[University of Hull]], but, having converted to [[Evangelical Christianity]], he decided to change his career and he enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1941.

During his studies, he became liable for [[military service]] in [[World War II]], but, as a [[conscientious objector]] on moral grounds, he enrolled in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].

After the war, he returned to Edinburgh and became attracted to the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and began to question his fundamentalism. In 1948 he completed his MA thesis, which formed the basis of his book ''Faith and Knowledge''.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; He went on to complete a [[D. Phil]] at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[Oxford University]] in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/hick-john.aspx|title=John Hick Centre for Philosophy of Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[DLitt]] from Edinburgh in 1975.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]''. Ed. Walter A. Elwell. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2001.) 552.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Theology  at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he married Joan Hazel Bowers, and the couple had four children. After many years as a member of the [[United Reformed Church]], in October 2009 he was accepted into membership of the [[Quakers|Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)]] in Britain. He died in 2012.&lt;ref name="University of Birmingham"&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/hick-john.aspx]: ''University of Birmingham'' website.

==Career==
Hick's academic positions included Danforth Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the [[Claremont Graduate University]], California (where he taught from 1979 to 1992); H.G. Wood Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Research in Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theology.bham.ac.uk/emeritistaff/hick.htm |title=University of Birmingham |accessdate=25 February 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While at the University of Birmingham Hick played important roles in a number of organizations centered on community relations.  Non-Christian communities, mostly Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, had begun to form in this central England community as immigration from the Caribbean Islands and Indian subcontinent increased. Due to the influx of peoples with different religious traditions, organizations focused on integrating the community became necessary. During his fifteen years at the University of Birmingham, Hick became a founder, as well as the first chair, for the group All Faiths for One Race (AFFOR); he served as a chair on the Religious and Cultural Panel, which was a division of the Birmingham Community Relations Committee; and he also chaired the coordinating committee for a 1944 conference convened under the new Education Act with the aim of creating a new syllabus for religious instruction in city schools.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.

Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House, 1995. 27â59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also held teaching positions at [[Cornell University]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 Gifford Lecture Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032902/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 |date=16 February 2008 }} â Biography â John Hick&lt;/ref&gt; During his teaching stay at Princeton Seminary, Hick began to depart from his conservative religious standings as he began to question "whether belief in the Incarnation required one to believe in the literal historicity of the Virgin Birth".&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.  "A Pluralist View."  "More Than One Way? Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World".  Eds. Dennis L. Okholm and Timothy R. Phillips.  Grand Rapids, MI:  Zondervan Publishing House, 1995. 27â59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This questioning would open the door for further examination of his own Christology, which would contribute to Hick's understanding of religious pluralism. He was the Vice-President of [[the British Society for the Philosophy of Religion]], and Vice-President of The World Congress of Faiths.&lt;ref name="giffordlectures"&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 Full name, year of birth and other biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032902/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 |date=16 February 2008 }}: ''Gifford Lecture Series'' website. Retrieved on 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick delivered the 1986â87 [[Gifford lectures]]&lt;ref name="giffordlectures" /&gt; and in 1991 was awarded the prestigious [[Grawemeyer Award]] from the [[University of Louisville]] and the [[Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary]] for Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Authors/Author.htm?ContributorID=HickJ&amp;QueryStringSite |title=Zondervan |accessdate=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick was twice the subject of [[heresy]] proceedings. In 1961 or 1962, he was asked whether he took exception to anything in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith|Westminster Confession of 1647]] and answered that several points were open to question. Because of this, some of the local ministers appealed against his reception into the presbytery. Their appeal was sustained by the Synod. A year later, a counter-appeal was sustained by the Judicial Committee of the General Assembly, and Hick became a member of the presbytery.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Hick's philosophy==
Robert Smid states that Hick is regularly cited as "one of the most â if not simply the most â significant philosopher of religion in the twentieth century".&lt;ref name=smid/&gt; [[Keith Ward]] once described him as "the greatest living philosopher of global religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhick.org.uk/ Keith Ward], Regius Professor of Divinity, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his advocacy of [[religious pluralism]],&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; which is radically different from the traditional Christian teachings that he held when he was younger.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; Perhaps because of his heavy involvement with the inter-faith groups and his interaction with people of non-Christian faiths through those groups, Hick began to move toward a pluralistic outlook. He notes in both ''More Than One Way?'' and ''God and the Universe of Faiths'' that, as he came to know these people who belonged to non-Christian faiths, he saw in them the same values and moral actions that he recognized in fellow Christians.  This observation led him to begin questioning how a completely loving God could possibly sentence non-Christians who clearly espouse values that are revered in Christianity to an eternity in hell.  Hick then began to attempt to uncover the means by which all those devoted to a theistic religion might receive salvation.

Hick has notably been criticized by then-Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], later Pope between 2005 and 2013, when he was head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. Ratzinger had examined the works of several theologians accused of [[relativism]], such as [[Jacques Dupuis (priest)|Jacques Dupuis]] and [[Roger Haight]], and found that many, if not all, were philosophically inspired by Hick. Therefore, the declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' was seen by many at the time as a condemnation of Hick's ideas and theories.

===Kantian influences===
Having begun his career as an evangelical, he moved towards pluralism as a way of reconciling Godâs love with the facts of cultural and religious diversity. He was primarily influenced by Immanuel Kant in this regard, who argued that human minds obscure actual reality in favor of comprehension (see [[Immanuel Kant#Theory of perception|Kant's theory of perception]]). According to Richard Peters, for Hick, "[the] construal of the relationship of the human mind to God...is much like the relationship that Kant supposed exists between the human mind and the world".&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;

It isn't fair to say that Hick is strictly Kantian, however. Peters notes "the divide between the '[[noumenal]]' and '[[phenomenal]]' realms (so far as nature is concerned) is not nearly so severe for Hick as it was for Kant".&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Hick also declares that the [[God|Divine Being]] is what he calls 'transcategorial'. We can experience God through categories, but God Himself obscures them by his very nature.

===Pluralism===
In light of his Kantian influences, Hick claims that knowledge of the Real (his generic term for Transcendent Reality) can only be known as it is being perceived. For that reason, absolute truth claims about God (to use Christian language) are really truth claims about perceptions of God; that is, claims about the phenomenal God and not the noumenal God. Furthermore, because all knowledge is rooted in experience, which is then perceived and interpreted into human categories of conception, cultural and historical contexts which inevitably influence human perception are necessarily components of knowledge of the Real. This means that knowledge of God and religious truth claims pertaining thereof are culturally and historically influenced; and for that reason should not be considered absolute. This is a significant aspect of Hick's argument against Christian [[exclusivism]], which holds that although other religions might contain partial goodness and truth, [[salvation]] is provided only in Jesus Christ, and the complete truth of God is contained only in Christianity.

Perhaps the simplest manner in which to understand Hick's theory of pluralism of religions is to share the comparison he makes between his own understanding of religion and the Copernican view of our solar system.  Before [[Copernicus]] disseminated his views of the solar-centered universe, the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic system]] ruled in which the stars were painted in the sky, and the sun rose and set around the earth.  In short, the rest of the universe existed for and was centered on earth.  On the other hand, Copernicus asserted that the earth, and other planets as well, circled the sun, which in fact, did not move, but only appeared to move due to the revolution of our planet.  Copernicus introduced our world to the understanding that other planets took similar paths around the sun; while each path differed, all served the same purpose and generated the same result:  every planet makes a full path around our central star. Rotation of a planet about its axis creates day and night for that planet, just as day and night occur on earth.  Although the time frames for a full trip around the sun and for a full day-night cycle differs on a planet-by-planet basis, the concept remains constant throughout our solar system.

Similarly, Hick draws the metaphor that the Ptolemaic view of religion would be that Christianity is the only way to true salvation and knowledge of the one true God. Ptolemaic Christianity would assert that everything exists and all of history has played out in specific patterns for the glory of the Christian God, and that there is no other possible path that will lead to salvation.  Hick appears as Copernicus, offering the belief that perhaps all theistic religions are focused toward the one true God and simply take different paths to achieve the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.  ''God and the Universe of Faiths''.  Oxford:  OneWorld Publications Ltd., 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

A speaker on religious pluralism, Keith E. Johnson, compares Hick's pluralistic theology to a [[Blind men and an elephant|tale of three blind men attempting to describe an elephant]], one touching the leg, the second touching the trunk, the third feeling the elephant's side.  Each man describes the elephant differently, and, although each is accurate, each is also convinced of their own correctness and the mistakenness of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Keith E. [http://wri.leaderu.com/theology/hick.html "John Hick's Pluralistic Hypothesis and the Problem of Conflicting Truth-Claims"]. Retrieved 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Smid states that Hick believes that the tenets of Christianity are "no longer feasible in the present age, and must be effectively 'lowered'".&lt;ref name=smid&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smid |first=Robert |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Harwood Hick |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_875_hick.htm#John%20Harwood%20Hick |accessdate= February 2008  |edition= |date= |year=1998â1999 |month= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Mark Mann notes that Hick argues that there have been people throughout history "who have been exemplars of the Real".&lt;ref name=mann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mann |first=Mark |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Mann's Quick Notes |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_875_hick.htm#John%20Hick:%20Mann's%20Quick%20Notes |accessdate= February 2008  |year=1996â1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Here the author uses "Real" in the sense of how Hick defined it: "the referent of the world['s] religion." See Smid, reference 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick's position is "not an exclusively Christian inclusivism [like that of Karl Rahner and his âAnonymous Christianâ], but a plurality of mutually inclusive inclusivism." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''A Christian Theology of Religion'' (KY: Westminster John Knox press, 1995), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick contends that the diverse religious expressions (religions) are the result of diverse historically and culturally influenced responses to diverse perceptions of the Real. He states that "the different religious traditions, with their complex internal differentiations, have developed to meet the needs of the range of mentalities expressed in the different human cultures." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''God Has Many Names'' (PA: Westminster Press, 1980), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many rebuttals to Hick's pluralism &lt;ref&gt;Keith Ward, "Truth and the Diversity of Religions." Philip L. Quinn and Kevin Meeker, eds. The Philosophical Challenge of Religious Pluralism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hick's Christology===
In his ''God and the Universe of Faiths'' (1973), Hick attempts to pinpoint the essence of Christianity.  He first cites the [[Sermon on the Mount]] as being the basic Christian teaching, as it provides a practical way of living out the Christian faith.  He says that "Christian essence is not to be found in beliefs about God...but in living as the disciples who in his name feed the hungry, heal the sick and create justice in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. ''God and the Universe of Faiths''. Oxford:  Oneworld Publications Ltd., 1973, pp.109â110&lt;/ref&gt; However, all of the teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount, that form what Hick calls the essence of Christianity, flow directly from Jesus' ministry.  In turn, this means that the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus form the permanent basis of the Christian tradition.  Hick continues in this work to examine the manner in which the deification of Jesus took place in corporate Christianity following his crucifixion and questions whether or not Jesus actually thought of himself as the [[Messiah]] and the literal Son of God.

In several places (e.g. his contributions to ''The Metaphor of God Incarnate'', and his book ''[[The Myth of God Incarnate]]'') Hick proposes a reinterpretation of traditional Christologyâparticularly the doctrine of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. Hick contends "that the historical Jesus of Nazareth did not teach or apparently believe that he was God, or God the Son, Second Person of a Holy Trinity, incarnate, or the son of God in a unique sense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article16.html Believable Christianity]: A lecture in the annual October series on Radical Christian Faith at Carrs Lane United Reformed Church, Birmingham, 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It is for that reason, and perhaps for the sake of religious pluralism and peace, Hick proposes a metaphorical approach to incarnation. That is, Jesus (for example) was not literally God in the flesh (incarnate), but was metaphorically speaking, the presence of God. "Jesus was so open to divine inspiration, so responsive to the divine spirit, so obedient to God's will, that God was able to act on earth in and through him. This, I (Hick) believe, is the true Christian doctrine of the incarnation." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "A Pluralist View" in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'' eds. Dennis Ockholm and Timothy Phillips (MI: Zondervan, 1995), p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick believes that a metaphorical view of the incarnation avoids the need for faulty Christian paradoxes such as the duality of Christ (fully God and fully human) and even the [[Trinity]] (God is simultaneously one and three).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the intense christological debates of the centuries leading up to the Council of Chalcedon, nor the renewed christological debates of the 19th and 20th Centuries, have succeeded in squaring the circle by making intelligible the claim that one who was genuinely and unambiguously a man was also genuinely and unambiguously God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/gre3.htm "The Myth of God Incarnate"] from N. F. Gier, ''God, Reason, and the Evangelicals'' (University Press of America, 1987), chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Problem of evil==
Hick has identified with a branch of theodicy that he calls "[[Irenaean theodicy]]" or the "Soul-Making Defense".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Davis, ed. ''Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy'' (KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2001), 38â72.&lt;/ref&gt; A simplification of this view states that suffering exists as a means of spiritual development. In other words, God allows suffering so that human souls might grow or develop towards maturation. For Hick, God is ultimately responsible for pain and suffering, but such things are not truly bad. Perhaps with a greater degree of perception, one can see that the "evil" we experience through suffering is not ultimately evil but good, as such is used to "make our souls" better.

Therefore, Hick sees the evils of pain and suffering as serving Godâs good purpose of bringing "imperfect and immature" humanity to itself  "in uncompelled faith and love."&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "D. Z. Phillips on God and Evil," ''Religious Studies '', Vol. 43, No. 2, posted on www.johnhick.org.uk/article18.html  (accessed 3 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the after-life, Hick asserts that "God will eventually succeed in His purpose of winning all men to Himself."&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', Palgrave Macmillan, (2nd edition), 1977, p.342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of evil in Hick has been challenged by a number of theologians and moral philosophers including [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]] and [[John K. Roth]]. Using Hick's own words, Roth has stated, "Hick's theodicy is implausible to me because I am convinced that his claims about God's goodness cannot stand the onslaught of what he calls the principal threat to his own perspective: 'the sheer amount and intensity of both moral and natural evil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Roth, John. ''Encountering Evil'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Encountering Evil'', Stephen Davis has stated his four criticisms of Hick, "First, while no theodicy is free of difficulties, I believe Hick's is not entirely convincing in its handling of the amount of evil that exists in the world... Second, I am dubious about Hick's hope of a gradual spiritual evolution till human beings reach a full state of God-consciousness... Third, I believe Hick also faces what I call the 'cost-effective' criticism of the free will defense... My final and most serious criticism of Hick concerns his commitment to universalism."&lt;ref&gt;''Encountering Evil'', p. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6544">'''Meditation and Pain''' is the study of the [[Physiology|physiological]] mechanisms underlying meditation-specifically its [[Nervous system|neural]] components- that implicate it in the reduction of pain perception.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakata|first=Hiroki|last2=Sakamoto|first2=Kiwako|last3=Kakigi|first3=Ryusuke|date=2014-12-16|title=Meditation reduces pain-related neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, secondary somatosensory cortex, and thalamus|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01489|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4267182|pmid=25566158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation is a behavioral method that has been used for several thousand years to monitor and regulate emotion and attention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|last2=Dixon|first2=Matthew L.|last3=Nijeboer|first3=Savannah|last4=Girn|first4=Manesh|last5=Floman|first5=James L.|last6=Lifshitz|first6=Michael|last7=Ellamil|first7=Melissa|last8=Sedlmeier|first8=Peter|last9=Christoff|first9=Kalina|title=Functional neuroanatomy of meditation: A review and meta-analysis of 78 functional neuroimaging investigations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.03.021|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=65|pages=208â228|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.03.021|arxiv=1603.06342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, meditation can be categorized into one of four modes (formal practices): focused attention, open monitoring, and compassion or love-kindness practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, there are sub-variations of each of the aforementioned practices that exist, such as [[prayer]] and [[zen]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Pain]] is defined as an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience that points to possible or actual [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitsi|first=Vasiliki|last2=Zachariou|first2=Venetia|title=Modulation of pain, nociception, and analgesia by the brain reward center|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.05.017|journal=Neuroscience|volume=338|pages=81â92|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms underlying pain have been studied in order to develop methods to alleviate chronic pain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Research on meditation has shown that it involves specific brain regions that reduce overall pain perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Neural  Mechanisms ==
Several studies using meditation experts as subjects have shown that meditative practices impact several regions of the brain.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Yi-Yuan|last2=HÃ¶lzel|first2=Britta K.|last3=Posner|first3=Michael I.|date=April 2015|title=The neuroscience of mindfulness meditation|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|volume=16|issue=4|pages=213â225|doi=10.1038/nrn3916|issn=1471-0048|pmid=25783612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using functional and structural [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies have shown increased activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) of individuals engaging in mindfulness meditation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, functional changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|pre-frontal cortex]] (PFC) as well as activity in [[Nociception|nociceptive]] processing have been observed in [[neuroimaging]] studies on meditation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Meta-analysis]] research using fMRI on the various modes of meditation has shown activation in the [[Premotor cortex|pre-motor cortex]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[insular cortex]]- regions associated with the reward pathways of the brain as well as motor control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Activation of the [[precentral gyrus]], [[midbrain]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], [[precuneus]], and [[hippocampus]] have also been correlated with meditation using [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]] and [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|single photon emission computed tomography]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, in a study using experienced meditators, the findings showed increased cortical thickness in the PFC.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Increased activation in the PFC has been correlated with chronic pain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a study comparing the MRI scans of chronic lower back pain patients before and after treatment to their healthy counterparts, patients with chronic pain exhibited thinner PFCs than the control.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After treatment, chronic lower back patients showed increased thickness in the PFC which decreased pain perception and physical disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additional brain regions are involved in pain perception in what is referred to as the 'pain matrix'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The pain matrix includes the [[primary somatosensory cortex]] (SI), [[Insular cortex|insula]], ACC, and [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reduction of pain perception via mediation is mediated by the interconnected brain pathways between pain perception and meditation. These intersections are what contribute to the reduction in perceived pain via mediation.

In a study using [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] on a yoga master, researchers found that MEG recordings showed higher peaks of alpha waves in meditators as opposed to non-meditators in the [[Parietal lobe|parietal,]] [[Occipital lobe|occipital]], and [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] regions; and fMRI images showed changes in the thalamus and SI regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The resulting findings showed a reduction in pain perception, which is consistent in studies where researchers found deactivation of the thalamus in experienced meditators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study recorded the response of thermal pain stimuli in experienced and novice meditators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers found that long term meditators showed lower responses in the PFC and ACC, and that after 5 months of training, the control also experienced decreased responses in those same areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, reduction in pain perception is attributed to a decrease in brain regions involving the pain network.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A study using [[event-related potential]]s (ERP) showed that the meditation group exhibited decreased activation in the SI and posterior insula compared to a healthy control, which led to a reduction in pain perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is mediated by the fact that pain is a result of activation of the insula and SI, so a deactivation of these regions as a result of meditation reduces pain perception.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Melissus of Samos''' ({{IPAc-en|m|É|Ë|l|Éª|s|É|s}}; {{lang-el|ÎÎ­Î»Î¹ÏÏÎ¿Ï á½ Î£Î¬Î¼Î¹Î¿Ï}}; fl. 5th century BC) was the third&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not [[Xenophanes]] should be included in the list of Eleatic philosophers is debatable.&lt;/ref&gt; and last member of the ancient school of [[Eleatics|Eleatic philosophy]], whose other members included [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] and [[Parmenides]]. Little is known about his life except that he was the commander of the Samian fleet shortly before the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Melissusâ contribution to philosophy was a treatise of systematic arguments supporting Eleatic philosophy.  Like Parmenides, he argued that reality is ungenerated, indestructible, indivisible, changeless, and motionless. In addition, he sought to show that reality is wholly unlimited, and infinitely extended in all directions; and since existence is unlimited, it must also be one.

==Life==
[[File:Pythagorion.jpg|right|thumb|[[Samos]] in the southern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]]]
Not much information remains regarding the life of Melissus. He may have been born around 500 BC;&lt;ref&gt;M. Schofield approximates his birth as ca. 500 BC, given his military history and associates. Kirk, Raven and Schofield, (2004), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; the date of his death is unknown. The little which is known about him is mostly gleaned from a small passage in [[Plutarch|Plutarchâs]] ''Life of Pericles''.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pericles'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the commander of the [[Samos|Samian]] fleet not long before the [[Peloponnesian War]], and defeated [[Pericles]] and the [[Athens|Athenian]] fleet in 441 BC.  Plutarch claims that [[Aristotle]] says that Melissus had also defeated Pericles in an earlier battle.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Raven and Schofield, (2004), state that this claim was in Aristotleâs lost work entitled ''Constitution of the Samians''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Life of [[Themistocles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Themistocles'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch denies [[Stesimbrotos of Thasos|Stesimbrotusâ]] claim that Melissus was held in high regard by Themistocles, claiming that he is confusing Themistocles and Pericles. Melissus was reputed to have been the pupil of [[Parmenides]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of the Philosophers'', 9.24; Aetius 1.3.14&lt;/ref&gt; and the teacher of [[Leucippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes, ''Chiliades'', 2.980.&lt;/ref&gt; though one must regard such claims with a fair amount of skepticism.

==''On Nature''==
Much of what remains of Melissusâ philosophical treatise, ''On Nature'', has been preserved by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in his commentaries on Aristotleâs ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On the Heavens]]'', and several summaries of his philosophy have come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Commentary on Aristotleâs Physics'', 103.13-104.20; Pseudo-Aristotle, ''On Melissus, Xenophanes and [[Gorgias]]'', Ch. 1-2; [[John Philoponus|Philoponus]], ''Commentary on Aristotleâs Physics'', 50.30-52.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the remaining fragments can be found in [[DielsâKranz numbering system|DielsâKranz]].&lt;ref&gt;DK 30B1-10 ([[John Philoponus]] is not in DK&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Parmenides, Melissus wrote his treatise in prose, not poetry, consequently making it easier to follow than that of his teacher.  Like Parmenides, he claims that Being is one, ungenerated, indestructible, indivisible, changeless, motionless and the same.  Melissusâ philosophy differs from that of Parmenides in two respects: (1) Parmenides claims that Being is limited, while Melissus claims that it is wholly unlimited; and (2) for Parmenides, Being existed in a timeless Present, while for Melissus Being is eternal.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;  McKirahan claims that Parmenides argues for Being as spatially limited, but this is a contentious point.&lt;ref&gt;Drozdek, A., ''Eleatic Being: Finite or Infinite?'', Hermes, 129. Bd., H. 3 (2001), (p. 306) "for Parmenides Being is finite because it is held in limits (DK28B8.26,31,42) and is compared to a sphere (DK28B8.42-43)." (p. 307) "Parmenides refers to the [limited] metaphorically,  not literally. Being is ... not surrounded by a spatio-temporal boundary, ... [Being] surpasses the boundaries of time and space"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Eternal===
Melissus argues that since The One&lt;ref&gt;Melissusâ own choice of appellation; see fragments 9 and 10.&lt;/ref&gt; neither came to be nor is subject to destruction, it is therefore eternal.  While fragment 1 is merely a summary of Parmenidesâ arguments against coming to be and perishing (8.5-21), fragment 2 provides Melissusâ argument.  Melissusâ argument is twofold, addressing the temporal aspect of The One somewhat as a timeline: granting the reality of the present moment, he argues that The One has existed eternally into the past and will exist eternally into the future.

His argument is as follows:
#Whatever comes to be must have a beginning.
#According to fragment 1, The One did not come to be.
#Therefore, The One does not have a beginning.
#Therefore, The One is eternal (has always existed in the past).

in addition:
#Whatever has a beginning must also end.
#According to fragment 1, The One did not have a beginning.
#Therefore, The One will not end.
#Therefore, The One is eternal (will always exist in the future).

He restates his argument for The One as eternal in fragments 6 and 9.1.

It is in this respect that Melissus differs from Parmenides, although some&lt;ref&gt;Such as McKirahan, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the difference is not as important as it might seem. Parmenidesâ view is that there is only one moment (the eternal present), while Melissus argues for an infinite number of moments.  The existence of a changeless, motionless, eternal present is an arguable position (after all, change and motion depend on time); however, the existence of a changeless, motionless, infinite succession of moments is a much more difficult position to defend (after all, if there is no other change, there is still temporal change, the change from one moment to the next).

There are several problems with Melissusâ reasoning.  His second argument is based on a dubious premise (i.e., that whatever comes to be must also end at some point).  Furthermore, both arguments, which can be reduced to âIf A, then B; but not-A, therefore not-Bâ, are logically flawed.

===Unlimited===
Melissus contends that The One is unlimited.  Fragments 7 and 8 apparently indicate that Melissus is speaking in terms of spatial infinity, although regarding fragment 3, which first argues this point, Simplicius explicitly denies this: âBut by âmagnitudeâ he does not mean what is extended in space.â&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Commentary on Aristotleâs Physics'', 109.31-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplicius undoubtedly had more of Melissusâ treatise at his disposal, as well as other commentaries and notes which have not survived to the present day.

In any case, Melissusâ argument for this claim is unclear, and it is possible that it has not been preserved for us.  Alternatively, he may intend for this argument to follow from the arguments of fragments 1 and 2, either directly or indirectly.  In the former case, unless the argument is based on a now lost theory on the relationship between time and space, it is, as McKirahan says, âgrossly fallaciousâ.&lt;ref name="McKirahan, p. 297"&gt;McKirahan, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter case, granting the âbeginningâ and âendâ of fragment 2 spatial as well as temporal qualities leaves Melissus open to the charge of equivocation.&lt;ref name="McKirahan, p. 297"/&gt;

In fragment 6 Melissus connects an eternal existence and the quality of being unlimited.  Melissus may have argued for this quality due to certain issues arising in Parmenidesâ thesis (8.42-9).  The argument is as follows:

#Whatever has a beginning and end is neither eternal nor unlimited.
#Being has no beginning or end.
#Therefore, it is eternal and unlimited.

This argument, as fragment 3, is logically flawed, being basically: âIf not-A, then not-Bâ.

===One===
Melissusâ argument for the oneness of what-is, given mainly in fragments 7 and 8, is undoubtedly his best.  His argument is clearer and more concise than the one provided by Parmenides.  Melissus argues that, because what-is is unlimited, it must also be one, because if it were more than one it would have limits (namely, the boundaries between what-is and the other existing objects).  His argument is founded on the premises that what-is is both spatially and temporally unlimited and is as follows:

#What-is is temporally unlimited.
#Therefore, nothing else spatially unlimited could exist at a different time.
#What-is is spatially unlimited.
#Therefore, nothing else temporally unlimited could exist at the same time.
#Therefore, what-is is one.

===The same===
In ''[[On Melissus, Xenophanes and Gorgias]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Aristotle, ''On Melissus, Xenophanes and Gorgias'', 974a12-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo-Aristotle]] states that Melissus made a claim that The One is qualitatively the same.  The validity of the argument depends on the nature of unity intended by Melissus.  It is possible for one, single thing to have different parts: a human has a head, a body, two arms and two legs, but it is still one human. In most respects, Melissus is following in Parmenidesâ footsteps, and so it is likely that Melissus is arguing for the same type of unity as Parmenides, namely, that The One is completely unified, with no parts to subdivide it.  His argument is as follows:

#If what-is has qualitative differences, it is plural.
#What-is is one.
#What-is is whole in and of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the additional premise that The One is whole in and of itself has been added to the argument.  McKirahan, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Therefore, what-is has no qualitative differences (i.e., is the same).

This is not provided in the second-hand report by Pseudo-Aristotle; however, the quality of wholeness is a major claim in Parmenidesâ thesis, and it is likely that Melissus either made the argument for this point in a fragment that has not come down to us or expected it to be understood or inferred from his other arguments.

===Changeless===
Melissus argues that The One cannot undergo any change.  He specifically states that The One cannot be rearranged, become greater or smaller, or undergo any kind of distress, but we may safely expand his argument to include all kinds of change.  If The One underwent any kind of change whatsoever, it would become different and thus no long unified or whole.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;  His argument is as follows:

#Whatever undergoes change is altered.
#Whatever is altered is not unified or whole.
#The One is unified and whole.
#Therefore, The One does not undergo any type of change.

===Motionless===
In fragment 9.7-10 Melissus makes the argument for motionless with the qualities of full and empty.  He states that The One is full, because if it were empty it would be nothing, and what is nothing doesnât exist.  He then states that because The One is full, it canât move.  The argument is as follows:

#To be empty is to be nothing.
#What is nothing does not exist.
#The One exists.
#Therefore, The One is not empty.
#What is not empty must be full.
#Therefore, The One is full.

and further:
#Whatever has motion is not full.
#Whatever is full (i.e., has no empty spaces) must be motionless.
#The One is full.
#Therefore, The One is motionless.

===Incorporeal===
In fragment 5, Melissus makes the remarkable claim that The One is incorporeal.  Just as his insistence that The One is unlimited, this claim may also be his attempt to address a potential problem inherent in Parmenidesâ philosophy (8.42-9).  His argument is as follows:

#The One is whole in and of itself.
#Therefore, The One has no parts.
#Therefore, The One has no thickness.
#Therefore, The One does not have a body.

This argument, on the surface, does not coincide with Melissusâ claim that The One is extended and full.  After all, why can something that is extended not have any parts, and how can something that is full have no thickness?  McKirahan offers an interesting interpretation for what Melissus may have been arguing.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;  A body not only has extension, but also limits, and something infinitely large, such as The One, is unlimited; an object, then, with no limits, is not a body.  Furthermore, thickness is simply the measure of the distance between a bodyâs limits.  Since The One is unlimited, it cannot have thickness.

==Influence and reactions==
While not as influential as his fellow Eleatics, Melissus' treatise did have an important impact on philosophy.  Whether or not Leucippus was his student, it is clear that his treatise was as influential on [[atomism]] as were those of the other Eleatics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Melissusâ fragment 9.7 for the first written concept of the void, which is a fundamental part of atomist philosophy, as well as fragment 10.4-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, because of its clear and concise nature, Melissus' version of Eleatic philosophy was the chief source for its presentation in the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Raven and Schofield, (2004), p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle never hesitated to insult Melissus, whom he viewed as quite inferior to his predecessors, stating that his work was "a bit crude"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 986b25-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he made "invalid arguments starting from false assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', 185a9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristocles of Messene|Aristocles]], as well, had little admiration for Melissus, calling several of his arguments "absurd".&lt;ref&gt;DK192A14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melissus has fared somewhat better in the eyes of modern philosophers. He was an inventive philosopher and had the good quality of offering clear and direct arguments. Although he follows Parmenides in his general views and the framework of Eleaticism, he made original contributions and innovations to the substance of Eleatic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neven SesardiÄ''' (born 30 July 1949) is a Croatian philosopher known for his writings on [[heritability]] and [[Race (human classification)|race]].

== Life and career ==
The beginning of his academic career was marked by continuous polemics with [[Marxist philosophers]], who were dominant in the Croatian academic circles at that time in Yugoslavia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

From 1977â83 he worked as a lecturer at the [[University of Zagreb]], and, from then, until 1989 he was Assistant Professor at the same university. From 1989 to 1991 he was Fellow of the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] at the [[University of Giessen]]. From 1991 to 1992 he worked as a Fellow of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research at the [[University of Bielefeld]]. The following two years (1992â94) he spent as an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Zagreb.  The following academic year, 1994â1995, he worked as a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]],&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt; while the following year (1995â96) he became an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] Research Fellow at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Following that, in 1996 he became Professor of Philosophy at the [[Miyazaki International College]], Japan, where he worked until 1999 when he was appointed Research Fellow at [[King's College London]]. From 2000 until 2006, he worked as an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]], Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt; From 2006 to 2015, he worked as a Professor of Philosophy at the Lingnan University. In the year of 2015, he retired from Lingnan University.

He is a member of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA), the Croatian Philosophical Association, and the [[Philosophy of Science Association]].

During his academic career he has taught courses in [[Philosophy of Science]], [[Philosophy of Mind]], [[Logic]], Probability and Scientific Method, Contemporary Issues in Bioethics, Critical Thinking, Introduction to Philosophy of Science and Social Science, [[Theory of Knowledge]], Introduction to Philosophy, Morality and Evolution, Science and Society, Genetics and Psychology, Philosophy and Environmental Issues, and [[Ethics]].

== Work ==

=== Heritability and Causality ===

In his first article, "Heritability and Causality" (Sesardic 1993), Sesardic argues that the environmentalist criticism of [[hereditarianism]] greatly exaggerate in claiming that the explanation of [[human behavior]] in terms of [[genes]] is faced with methodological problems and flaws. He says (Sesardic 1993: 396): "They reject the idea that [[heritability]] estimates could lead to genetic explanations by pointing out that these estimates are strictly valid only for a given population and that they are exposed to the irremovable confounding effects of [[genotype]]-environment interaction and [[genotype]]-environment correlation".

=== Philosophy of Science that Ignores Science: Race, IQ and Heritability ===

In his article "Philosophy of Science that Ignores Science: Race, IQ and Heritability" Sesardic argues that the rejection of most philosophers of the connection between the [[heritability]] of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], which is, according to them, based on methodological flaws, is ill-founded. According to him the prevalence of this view among philosophers of science is based on the gap between them and experimental scientists. Sesardic argues (Sesardic 2000: 580): "[...] the discussion in philosophy of science about these matters is largely disconnected from the real, empirically complex issues debated in [[science]]."

=== Heritability and Indirect Causation ===

In his 2003 article, "Heritability and Indirect Causation" Sesardic argues that in spite of the possibility of genetic effects being changed by the environmental influences, [[heritability]] can still provide a well-founded causal explanation, since genetic differences can lead to their visible effects either directly or indirectly. In his words (Sesardic 2003: 1002): "Genetic differences can lead to [[phenotypic]] differences either directly or indirectly (via causing differences in external environments, which then affect phenotype). This possibility of genetic effects being mediated by environmental influences is often used by scientists and philosophers to argue that [[heritability]] is not a very helpful causal or explanatory notion."

===Same-sex marriage===
In his 2007 article "Homosexual marriage: The Victory of Political Correctness and Bad Arguments" he argues that the conservative arguments against homosexual marriage are not actually damaged by the most frequent liberal critiques against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Homosexual marriage: The Victory of Political Correctness and Bad Arguments |journal=[[Prolegomena: Journal of Philosophy]] |year=2007 |last=SesardiÄ |first=Neven |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=5â28 |issn=1333-4395 |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=19028&amp;lang=en |accessdate=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21333">The '''norm of reciprocity''' requires that we repay in kind what another has done for us.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley, M, A., Rhodes, A., Smith, R. H., Webster, J. M. (1999) ''The Effect of a Favor on Public and Private Compliance: How Internalized is the Norm of Reciprocity?''. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 21(3), 251â259&lt;/ref&gt; It can be understood as the expectation that people will respond favorably to each other by returning benefits for benefits, and responding with either indifference or hostility to harms. The [[social norm]] of reciprocity often takes different forms in different areas of social life, or in different societies.  All of them, however, are distinct from related ideas such as [[gratitude]], the [[Golden Rule]], or mutual goodwill. See [[reciprocity (social and political philosophy)]] for an analysis of the concepts involved. The norm of reciprocity mirrors the concept of [[reciprocal altruism]] in [[evolutionary biology]]. However, [[evolutionary theory]] and therefore [[sociobiology]] was not well received by mainstream psychologists. This led to the revitalisation of reciprocal altruism underneath the new social psychological concept, norm of reciprocity. Reciprocal altruism has been applied to various species, including humans, while mainstream psychologists use the norm of reciprocity to only explain humans.

An underlying norm of reciprocity is by itself a powerful engine for motivating, creating, sustaining, and regulating the cooperative behavior required for self-sustaining social organizations, controlling the damage done by the unscrupulous, and contributing to social system stability.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin W. Gouldner. (1960) "The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement"&lt;/ref&gt; See the discussions in [[tit for tat]] and [[reciprocity (social psychology)]]. The power and ubiquity of the norm of reciprocity can be used against the unwary, however, and is the basis for the success of many malicious [[confidence games]]. Minor, usually less malicious examples are techniques used in [[advertising]] and other [[propaganda]] whereby a small gift of some kind is proffered with the expectation of producing a desire on the part of the recipient to reciprocate in some way, for example by purchasing a product, making a donation, or becoming more receptive to a line of argument. These minor examples include gifts of stickers and pens distributed by charities and flowers handed out by members of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] group.

==Positive and negative==
Two key elements of the norm of reciprocity are positive and negative aspects to the term.

A positive norm of reciprocity is "the embedded obligations created by exchanges of benefits or favours among individuals. The recipient feels indebted to the favour or benefit giver until he/she repays" (Chen, 2009). The positive reciprocity norm is a common social expectation where a person who helps another person can expect positive feedback whether it's in the form of a gift, a compliment, a loan, a job reference, etc. In social psychology, positive reciprocity refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action (rewarding kind actions). This norm is so powerful, it allows the initial giver to ask for something in return for what was given rather than having to wait for a voluntary reciprocal act. In some cases, a person does not have to ask for the other person to return a favour because it's already implied. Reciprocity also works at the level of liking; We like people who help us, and dislike those who ask for help but never return it. Disapproval is often enough to make people comply with norm of reciprocity.

"A negative norm of reciprocity represents the means by which individuals act against unfavourable treatments, and functions to keep balance in social systems" (Chen, 2009). In contrast to the positive reciprocity norm', the negative reciprocity norm emphasizes the return of unfavourable treatment as an appropriate response to a misdeed. The principle of this norm serves as a powerful deterrent for violent or symbolic mistreatment in society. Harming others invites anger and revenge, therefore people receiving negative treatment are likely to retaliate in an angry manner. Studies have shown, that individuals with a propensity towards anger might more strongly endorse the negative reciprocity norm as a justification for consummating their hostility by punishing the instigator of mistreatment (Eisenberger, Lynch, Aselage and Rohdiek 2004).[1] Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson (2002)[2] found that most college students believe that criminal punishment should be determined by the seriousness of the crime rather than by punishment's effectiveness in preventing similar crimes.

There are also contrasting ideas when it comes to the differentiation of negative and positive norms of reciprocity. "In contrast to a positive norm of reciprocity Gouldner (1960) also suggested a negative norm of reciprocity or sentiments of retaliation where the emphasis is placed not on the return of benefits but on the return of injuries" (Chen, 2009). So there is a slight grey line between what could be considered a positive norm and a negative norm. But both of these reciprocity norms are mechanisms adapted by humans in order to keep a balance among man kind. "Accordingly, both positive and negative norms or reciprocity serve as starting mechanisms as well as stabilizing functions in theta they help initiate and maintain equitable interpersonal exchanges in human evolution" (Chen, 2009).

==Private and public==
* Private reciprocation
The norm of reciprocity is usually internalised.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (1958). "Compliance, identification and internalisation: Three processes of attitude change." Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2, 51--60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thibaut, J. J.,&amp; Kelley, H. H. (1959). "The social psychology of groups." New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; All major ethical and religious traditions include reciprocity as a primary rule of moral behaviour â from Jesus (âAs you would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.â to Confucius (âWhat you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.â).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1981). "The expanding circle: Ethics and sociobiology." New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.&lt;/ref&gt; The moral character of the norm may encourage the sense that following it is an imperative rather than a choice, and failing to reciprocate should create feelings of self-reproach and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). "Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman."&lt;/ref&gt;

* Public reciprocation
Another way to understand how the norm or reciprocity works is to understand that the initial favour and the following repayment always unfolds in a public way.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). "Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman."&lt;/ref&gt; The social rewards of sticking to the norm and the costs of breaching it are profound.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). "Opinions and social pressure. Scientific American, 193, 31-35."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thibaut, J. J.,&amp; Kelley, H. H. (1959). "The social psychology of groups." New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; People deny continued group membership to others who conveniently breach the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). "Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman."&lt;/ref&gt;

The norm of reciprocity stipulates that the amount of the return to a favour is âroughly the sameâ as what had been received.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin W. Gouldner. (1960) "The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement"&lt;/ref&gt; Such idea of equivalence takes two forms;
# Heteromorphic reciprocity: Things exchanged can be totally different, but they are equal in value, as defined by the stakeholders in the situation.
# Homeomorphic reciprocity: Exchanges are identical in form, either with regard to the things exchanged or to the situations under which they are exchanged. Historically, the most significant expression of homeomorphic reciprocity is in the negative reciprocity norms; in retaliation, the focus is not on the return of benefits, but on the return of injuries.

However, Mark A. Whatley and colleagues (1999) found that people will give more favors, like a higher donation, if it is a public condition.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley, M, A., Rhodes, A., Smith, R. H., Webster, J. M. (1999) ''The Effect of a Favor on Public and Private Compliance: How Internalized is the Norm of Reciprocity?''. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 21(3), 251â259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance to social system stability==
Favours given are not immediately repaid and returning of favours may take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, B. (1922). "Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An Account of Native Enterprise and Adventure in the Archipelagos of Melanesian New Guinea." London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Such intervening time period is governed by the norm of reciprocity in two manners. First, the stakeholder is assembling, mobilizing, liquidating resources or assets so as to make a suitable repayment. Second, it is a time period that the relevant party should not do harm to people who have given them benefits; people are morally constrained to demonstrate gratitude towards or maintain peace with their benefactors. As such, outstanding obligations can thus contribute to the stabilising of social systems by encouraging mutually beneficial exchange and cooperative behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin W. Gouldner. (1960) "The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement"&lt;/ref&gt;

The only "rough equivalence" of repayment aforementioned then suggests an important system-stabilising functions.&lt;ref&gt;Z. E. Eglar, Vartan B. (1958). "Institutionalized Reciprocity in a Changing Punjab Village", Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; It introduces an element of ambiguity as to whether the indebtedness has been repaid fully, thus creating uncertainty on who the indebted parties are. The comparative indeterminancy then serves as a type of all-purpose moral cement; it keeps us mindful of our behaviours and induces cooperative action.

The norm of reciprocity also contributes to social stability even when there is a well-developed system of specific status duties; status duties shape behavior as the status occupant believe them binding in their own right; they are expected to faithfully fulfill their responsibilities. Nonetheless, the general norm of reciprocity offers another source of motivation and moral sanction for conforming with specific status obligations; if other people have been fulfilling their status responsibilities to you, you then have a second-order obligation to fulfill your status responsibilities to them as well. The feeling of gratitude reinforces that of rectitude and contributes to conformity, thus social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, W. F. (1945) "Street Corner Society", Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

==In organizational research==
[[Perceived organizational support]] (POS) and [[perceived psychological contract violation]] (PPCV) are the two most common measures of the reciprocity norm in [[organizational research]]. POS is the degree to which employeesâ believe that their organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R., Huntington, R., Huntington, S., &amp; Sowa, D. 1986. "Perceived organizational support". ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 71: 500 â507.&lt;/ref&gt; POS is generally thought to be the organizationâs contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to pay back POS.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoades, L., &amp; Eisenberger, R. 2002. "Perceived organizational support: A review of the literature". ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 87: 698â714.&lt;/ref&gt;  PPCV is a construct that regards employeesâ feelings of disappointment (ranging from minor frustration to betrayal) arising from their belief that their organization has broken its work-related promises, is generally thought to be the organizationâs contribution to a negative reciprocity dynamic, as employees tend to perform more poorly to pay back PPCV.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. L. 1996. "Trust and breach of the psychological contract". ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 41: 574 â599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. L., Kraatz, M., &amp; Rousseau, D. M. 1994. "Changing obligations and the psychological contract: A longitudinal study". ''Academy of Management Journal'', 37: 137â152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David R. Hekman]] and colleagues found that professional employees, such as doctors and lawyers, are most likely to repay POS with better performance when they have high levels of [[organizational identification]] combined with low levels of [[professional identification]]. Professional employees are most forgiving of PPCV when they have high levels of [[organizational identification]] combined with low levels of [[professional identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Hekman, D.R., Steensma, H.K., Bigley, G.A., Hereford, J.F., (2009) â[http://journals.aomonline.org/inpress/main.asp?action=preview&amp;art_id=473&amp;p_id=1&amp;p_short=AMJ Combined Effects of Organizational and Professional Identification on the Reciprocity Dynamic for Professional Employees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104021342/http://journals.aomonline.org/InPress/main.asp?action=preview&amp;art_id=473&amp;p_id=1&amp;p_short=AMJ |date=2009-01-04 }}.â  ''Academy of Management Journal''.  Vol. 52, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms of reciprocity in interactions among employees underlie [[Adam Grant]]'s distinction between [[Organizational culture#Adam Grant|"giver cultures" and "taker cultures"]] as two end-points of a scale, with "matcher cultures" in between.

==In evolutionary psychology==

[[Evolutionary psychologist]]s have used the norm of reciprocity to explain altruism by emphasizing our expectations that âhelping others will increase the likelihood that they will help us in the future.â The underlying justification lies in the human desire to reciprocate kindness and cooperate for survival value has enabled our continued existence in a hostile world. Thus, the norm of reciprocity ultimately has survival value.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, W. A. (2007). Social Psychology 6th Edition. New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, being as this sentiment is intrinsic to our evolutionary history and existence, adherence to the norm would constitute ânaturalâ behavior whose neglect might necessarily cause a degree of dissonance in an individual who, among many other self-concepts, consciously labels himself a human being, perhaps leading to a reduction in self-esteem. The norm of reciprocity is [[reciprocal altruism]], a concept coined by the evolutionary biologist [[Robert Trivers]]. However, the rise of [[sociobiology]] was not well received by mainstream psychologists. It is therefore not surprising that the stigma of the evolutionary theory led reciprocal altruism to be revitalised underneath the name "norm of reciprocity". The norm of reciprocity is arguably less scientifically advanced than reciprocal altruism, due to the degree of research underneath the name "reciprocal altruism" as opposed to the name "norm of reciprocity".

==In developmental psychology==

[[Developmental psychologist]]s have studied the norm of reciprocity and the development of this norm in children. Psychologists have found that children begin to show the reciprocal behavior around the age of two, when they observe the behavior of others and begin to have their own relationships with peers. One way that psychologists have been able to study the norm of reciprocity in children is by observing and experimenting on their toy sharing behaviour. Kristina R. Olson and Elizabeth S. Spelke (2007) conducted an experiment is which they used dolls to represent family members and friends and gave the child various items to distribute to the dolls after a series of situations were explained to the child. These situations represented private and public reciprocity and gave the child the choice of which dolls to share the items with. An example of a situation involves one of the dolls sharing with the rest of them. Olson and Spelke found that children will give to family and friends more than strangers, repay those who shared with them, and reward those who share with others, even if they do not receive the item.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, K.R., Spelke, E.S. (2007). "Foundations of Cooperation in Young Children". Science Direct Cognition 108, 222-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Ken J. Rotenberg and Luanne Mann have also explored the development of the reciprocity norm of self-disclosure and its functions in childrenâs attraction to peers. The findings have indicated that the norm of the reciprocity is involved in attraction to peers only by six-grade; children of this year group showed such effect by reporting greater affection towards others who reciprocated the same amount of intimacy than those whose intimacy level deviated from the initiatorâs.&lt;ref&gt;Rotenberg, K. J., Mann, L. (1986) "The Development of the Norm of the reciprocity of Self-Disclosure and Its Function in Children's attraction to Peers."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Youniss's (1980) theory of social development, children's friendship during the early part of middle childhood (5â8 years) is based upon the reciprocity of behaviour that suggests a "tit-for-tat" rule of exchange and interaction. During the later part of middle childhood (9â11 years) and beyond, children's friendship is based on the reciprocity of behaviour that suggests a mutually cooperative principle of exchange as well as an appreciation of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;Youniss, J. (1980) "Parents and peers in social development." Chicago: University of chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A study was done in 2000 that consisted of 116 MBA students enrolled in a part-time MBA program at a business school, in the north east of the United States (Chen, 2009). The study consisted of two parts, the first part was to complete a series of self perception questions, which included the measure of the relational-self orientation (Chen, 2009). The second part was to complete a work relationship exercise during a class session 6 weeks later than the first task. "In the exercise, participants
read a vignette in which they were asked to imagine that they were the focal person in a reward allocation scenario at work" (Chen, 2009). They were then told that they worked hard on the project together with a colleague, and made the same sort of effort and contribution to the project. Their supervisor then agreed to give $1000 reward. They were then given the following options on how to divide the money: 
(A) Your colleague will make a proposal as to how the money should be divided.
(B) If you accept the proposal, then you will get what the colleague proposed to you. However, if you reject it, then the
money will return to the company for future reward considerations. 
Measures were calculated on how many people would reject the proposal or accept the proposal. And the results were positively and negatively skewed. If the two persons were close friends or colleagues the acceptance rate was 62% if the offer was 20% of the 1000 dollars, and 100% if the offer was 80% of the money (Chen, 2009). If the colleagues were distant then the rates were 20% for 20% of the money and 77% for 80% of the money (Chen, 2009).

'''''[[Plato]] and a [[Platypus]] Walk Into a Bar â Understanding [[Philosophy]] Through Jokes''''' is a book that explains basic philosophical concepts through classic jokes. Thomas Wilson Cathcart and Daniel Martin Klein, graduates of Harvard in philosophy, collaborated on the book.  

''Plato and a Platypus'' examines the classic categories of philosophy, with concepts explained or illustrated by jokes.

The concept behind the book in the Introduction: âThe construction and payoff of jokes and the construction and payoff of philosophical concepts are made out of the same stuff. They tease the mind in the same waysâ¦philosophy and jokes proceed from the same impulse: to confound our sense of the way things are, to flip our worlds upside down, and to ferret out hidden, often uncomfortable, truths about life. What the philosopher calls an insight, the gagster calls a [[wikt:zinger|zinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Quote from the book==
"A guy comes home from a business trip and finds his wife in bed, a nervous look on her face. He opens the closet to hang up his coat, and finds his best friend standing there, naked. Stunned, he says, "Lenny, what are you doing here?" 
Lenny shrugs and says, "Everybody's got to be someplace." 
In this gag, Lenny is giving a [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] answer to an [[Existentialism|existential question]]. The question is about the existential circumstances in the here-and-now, but the answer is from a grand, universal vantage point, what the latter-day Hegelian [[Bette Midler]] called âseeing the world from a distance."

{{History of printing}}

A '''printing press''' is a device for applying pressure to an [[ink]]ed surface resting upon a [[printing|print]] medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and [[global spread of the printing press]] was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their "People of the Millennium" countdown]. In 1997, [[TimeâLife]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310192514/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm |date=10 March 2010 }}; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalleled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]], a [[goldsmith]] by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. [[History of printing in East Asia|Printing in East Asia]] had been prevalent since the [[Tang dynasty]],&lt;ref name=Needham /&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; and in Europe, [[woodblock printing]] based on existing [[screw press]]es was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type based printing press system. His newly devised [[matrix (printing)|hand mould]] made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal [[movable type]] in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.

The printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450â1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusiÃ³n del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura econÃ³mica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout [[Western Europe]] had already produced more than twenty million volumes.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new medium of expression and communication, "[[Newspaper|the press]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}: {{quote|At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of [[mass communication]], which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in [[literacy]] broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging [[middle class]]. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-[[nationalism]], and accelerated by the development of European [[vernacular language]]s, to the detriment of [[Latin]]'s status as [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusiÃ³n del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura econÃ³mica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp.63â76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by [[steam-powered]] [[rotary press]]es allowed printing on an [[industrial age|industrial]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhardt|1978|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of printing}}

=== Economic conditions and intellectual climate ===
{{See also|History of capitalism|Medieval university}} 
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval university]] class (1350s)]]

The rapid economic and socio-cultural development of [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval society]] in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's improved version of the printing press: the entrepreneurial spirit of [[history of capitalism|emerging capitalism]] increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of [[Medieval university|medieval learning]] and literacy amongst the [[middle class]] led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological factors ===
{{See also|History of Western typography|Medieval technology}}

Technologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43294-8|page=133|edition=1st|date=1994-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:

[[File:Holzspindelkelter von 1702.jpg|thumb|left|Early modern [[wine press]]. Such [[screw press]]es were applied in Europe to a wide range of uses and provided Gutenberg with the model for his printing press.]]

The [[screw press]] which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=21â35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in the 1st century AD by the [[Roman agriculture|Romans]], it was commonly employed in agricultural production for [[Pressing (wine)|pressing]] [[vitis vinifera|wine grapes]] and ([[olive]]) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onken|2009}}; {{harvnb|White|1984|pp=31f.}}; {{harvnb|Schneider|2007|pp=156â159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a [[cloth]] press for printing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|2007|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the [[paper]] presses which had spread through the [[Holy Roman Empire|German lands]] since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schulte|1939|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the [[platen]] on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39â46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:metal movable type.jpg|thumb|[[Movable type]] sorted in a [[letter case]] and loaded in a [[composing stick]] on top]]

The concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been [[History of science and technology in China|invented in China]] during the [[Song dynasty]], and was later used in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], where [[metal]] movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15â23, 61â73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, sporadic evidence that the [[typographical principle]], the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany ([[PrÃ¼fening dedicatory inscription|PrÃ¼fening inscription]]) to England ([[letter tiles]]) to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Germany: {{harvnb|Brekle|1995|pp=23â26}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|2005|p=25}}; England: {{harvnb|Lehmann-Haupt|1940|pp=93â97}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; Italy: {{harvnb|Lipinsky|1986|pp=75â80}}; {{harvnb|Koch|1994|p=213}}. Lipinsky surmises that this typographical technique was known in [[Constantinople]] from the 10th to 12th century and that the [[Venice|Venetians]] received it from there (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.

Gutenberg greatly improved the process by treating [[typesetting]] and [[printing]] as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a [[lead]]-based [[alloy]] which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.&lt;ref name="EB: Printing"&gt;[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]] 2006: "Printing", retrieved 27 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special [[hand mould]], the [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]].&lt;ref name="Childress 2008, 51â55"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51â55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]] proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to [[Logogram|logographic writing systems]], it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different [[letter (alphabet)|letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51â55}}; {{harvnb|Hellinga|2007|p=208}}: {{quote|Gutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the [[codex]], which had originated in the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=24â30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] [[scroll]] at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=1, 38â67, 75}}: {{quote|The most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both [[recto and verso]] could be used for writing â and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45â53}}. Technically speaking, a scroll could be written on its back side, too, but the very few ancient specimen found indicate that this was never considered a viable option. (p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A paper [[codex]] of the acclaimed [[42-line Bible]], Gutenberg's major work]]

A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing [[paper]] manufacture. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=68â73}}; {{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim papermaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414â417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997|pp=41â44}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=419}}: {{quote|In the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=7f.}}: {{quote|Despite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the [[42-line Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;The ratio between paper and parchment copies is estimated at around 150 to 30 ({{harvnb|Hanebutt-Benz|2000|pp=158â189}}).&lt;/ref&gt; After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Press skeen 1872 with description.png|thumb|left|Early Press, etching from Early Typography by William Skeen]] [[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|upright|This [[woodcut]] from 1568 shows the left printer removing a page from the press while the one at right inks the text-blocks. Such a duo could reach 14,000 hand movements per working day, printing around 3,600 pages in the process.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f.}}: {{quote|From old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]A printing press, in its classical form, is a standing mechanism, ranging from {{convert|5|to|7|ft}} long, {{convert|3|ft}} wide, and {{convert|7|ft}} tall. The small individual metal letters known as type would be set up by a compositor into the desired lines of text. Several lines of text would be arranged at once and were placed in a wooden frame known as a galley. Once the correct number of pages were composed, the galleys would be laid face up in a frame, also known as a forme.&lt;ref&gt; Lyons 2011, p. 59 &lt;/ref&gt;, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressinstitute.in/file-folder/rindsurvey/Rind%20June%202015%20SN.pdf] RIND Survey (The Press Institute of India- Research Institute for Newspaper Development) June 2015, p14&lt;/ref&gt; and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a [[frisket]] and [[tympan]] (two frames covered with paper or parchment).

These are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the [[platen]], using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power. 

The function of the press in the image on the left was described by William Skeen in 1872,
{{quotation | this sketch represents a press in its completed form, with tympans attached to the end of the carriage, and with the frisket above the tympans. The tympans, inner and outer, are thin iron frames, one fitting into the other, on each of which is stretched a skin of parchment or a breadth of fine cloth. A woollen blanket or two with a few sheets of paper are placed between these, the whole thus forming a thin elastic pad, on which the sheet to be printed is laid. The frisket is a slender frame-work, covered with coarse paper, on which an impression is first taken; the whole of the printed part is then cut out, leaving apertures exactly corresponding with the pages of type on the carriage of the press. The frisket when folded on to the tympans, and both turned down over the forme of types and run in under the platten, preserves the sheet from contact with any thing but the inked surface of the types, when the pull, which brings down the screw and forces the platten to produce the impression, is made by the pressman who works the lever,âto whom is facetiously given the title of âthe practitioner at the bar.â.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Early Typography|last = Skeen|first =William|publisher =Government Printer, Colombo |year =1872|isbn = |location =Ceylon|pages = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Gutenberg's press ==
{{See also|Letterpress printing}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehnâa man who had previously instructed in gem-cuttingâand Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; However, it was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an [[alloy]] of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]], which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58â69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a special [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His [[type case]] is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, [[typographic ligature|ligatures]], punctuation marks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahnke|2009|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based [[ink]] which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and [[vellum]] (high-quality parchment). In the [[Gutenberg Bible]], Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later work, the [[Mainz Psalter]] of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter SchÃ¶ffer]], had elaborate red and blue printed initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Printing Revolution ==

The Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an "agent of change" through the societies that it reached. ([[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein|Eisenstein (1980)]])

=== Mass production and spread of printed books ===
{{See also|Global spread of the printing press|List of early modern newspapers}}
[[File:Printing towns incunabula.svg|thumb|left|Spread of printing in the 15th century from [[Mainz]], Germany]]
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450â1800.png|thumb|The European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buringh|van Zanden|2009|p=417, table 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in [[Mainz]], Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, [[Bohemia]] and Poland.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; From that time on, it is assumed that "the printed book was in universal use in Europe".&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

In Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa|1976|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Borsa|1977|p=166â169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

European printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollak |first1=Michael|title=The performance of the wooden printing press|journal=The Library Quarterly|date=1972|volume=42|issue=2|pages=218â264|jstor=4306163}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[History of printing in East Asia|book printing in East Asia]] did not use presses and was solely done by [[block printing]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham 1965, p. 211: {{quote|The outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.}} {{harvnb|Widmann|1974|p=34, fn. 14}}: {{quote|In East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.}}  {{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002|pp=112â115}}: {{quote|Chinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didnât have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[Erasmus]]'s work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469â1536).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Issawi|1980|pp=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and [[papacy]] alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first [[newspaper]]s (see ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'') which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|pp=387f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Incunable]] are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;The British Library [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 29,777 separate ''editions'' (not copies) as of 8 January 2008, which however includes some print items from the 16th century (retrieved 11 March 2010). According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke. Die Inkunabelsammlung der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek", in: Griebel, Rolf; Ceynowa, Klaus (eds.): "Information, Innovation, Inspiration. 450 Jahre Bayerische Staatsbibliothek", K G Saur, MÃ¼nchen 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-598-11772-5}}, pp. 207â224 (207f.), the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] lists 28,107 editions published before 1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of [[scientists]] who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the [[scientific revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Because of the printing press, [[author]]ship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, "One Author, one work (title), one piece of information" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of [[Aristotle]] made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Because the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Josh. âThe State of Publishing: Literacy Rates.â ''McSweeneyâs Internet Tendency''. McSweeney, 5 July 2011. Web. 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was an important step towards the [[democratization of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,473529-2,00.html Malte Herwig, "Google's Total Library", ''Spiegel Online International'', Mar. 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/technology/1057780670.php Howard Rheingold, "Moblogs Seen as a Crystal Ball for a New Era in Online Journalism", ''Online Journalism Review'', Jul. 9, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). More people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Book production became more commercialised, and the first [[copyright]] laws were passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/2486-copyright-timeline#.Wl1E7ainHIU|title=Copyright Timeline: A History of Copyright in the United States {{!}} Association of Research LibrariesÂ® {{!}} ARLÂ®|last=Eshgh|first=Amy|website=www.arl.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.&lt;ref name="CrickWalsham2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julia C. Crick|author2=Alexandra Walsham|title=The uses of script and print, 1300â1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8005wHw-KsC|accessdate=25 March 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81063-0|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilton2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Bilton|title=I Live in the Future &amp; Here's How It Works: Why Your World, Work, and Brain Are Being Creatively Disrupted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VXRLlTDNrUC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=14 September 2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-307-59111-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited{{Who|date=March 2015}} as one of the causes of the rise of [[nationalism]] in Europe.

A third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. The printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.&lt;ref name="Dittmar2011"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Jeremiah Dittmar|title=Information technology and economic change: The impact of the printing press|url=http://voxeu.org/article/information-technology-and-economic-change-impact-printing-press|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=VoxEU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like [[double-entry bookkeeping]] increased the reliability of trade and led to the decline of merchant guilds and the rise of individual traders.&lt;ref name="Raj2017"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Prateek Raj|title=How the Postal System and the Printing Press Transformed European Markets|url=http://evonomics.com/europe-markets-guilds-merchants-declined/|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=Evonomics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial printing presses ==
{{See also|History of printing}}
At the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130â133) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, the Stanhope press doubled the output of the old style press.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.

[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Koenig|Koenig]]'s 1814 steam-powered printing press]]

Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer [[Friedrich Koenig]] in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met [[Thomas Bensley]] and secured financial support for his project in 1807.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine."&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer [[Andreas Friedrich Bauer]].

Koenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to ''[[The Times]]'' in [[London]] in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making [[newspaper]]s available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of [[book]] production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other [[metadata (computing)|metadata]]. Their company [[Koenig &amp; Bauer AG]] is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.

===Rotary press===
The steam powered [[rotary printing press]], invented in 1843 in the [[United States]] by [[Richard M. Hoe]],&lt;ref name="meggs147"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip B.|authorlink=Philip B. Meggs|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1998|location=|edition=Third|page=147|isbn=978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.

By the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Also, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of [[jobbing presses]], small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as [[billhead]]s, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.

'''Pulsing''' is a rhythmic, movement-based somatic therapy that can be classed as a form of post-Reichian [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]. It uses a very gentle and nurturing approach in an attempt to increase body awareness and sensitivity.

== History ==
Pulsing was developed in the late 1970s by Curtis Turchin,&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, Curtis: ''Pulsing'' in: Energy and Character. Vol. 10, No.2, May 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; a practitioner of [[Postural Integration (PI)]]. After seeing Dr Milton Trager, founder of the [[Trager Approach]], demonstrate his movement-based bodywork at the [[Esalen Institute]] in the mid-1970s Turchin was inspired to develop a systematic approach that he called ''Pulsing''.&lt;ref&gt;Gladstone, G.: ''Pulsing-Massage in Motion'' in: Energy and Character, The journal of Biosynthesis. Vol 16, No2, August 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms and Practice ==
It involves the application of pressure and movement (stretching, lifting, shaking, rotating and swinging) to the soft tissue of the body (skin, muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia) within a continuous soft rhythmic rocking. The client is encouraged to be ''passive'' - in the sense of not ''trying'' to do anything, but allowing the body to relax into the movements. This in itself quickly highlights areas of muscular tension and holding. 

Children and adults will often rock themselves when distressed: there appears to be a deep comfort and security to be found in gentle movement. With its flowing and wave-like movements, Pulsing perhaps recalls a body-memory of the foetal experience in the womb, where the baby is constantly subject to rhythmic pulsation, or of being cradled and rocked during infancy. 

Pulsing can take a number of forms, distinguished by the intent with which it is approached by both client and therapist (for example, relaxing, playful or as deeper emotional therapy). In the 'lighter' modes, clients sometimes experience gentle emotional release and often enter a trance-like state. Sessions usually have a deeply relaxing yet energising effect.  Here the benefits may include a release of deep physical tension, an increase in flexibility and movement repertoire, and an improved general sense of well-being and energy. On a deeper level, it can also be performed explicitly as a form of [[body psychotherapy]], encouraging the client to become aware of their emotional responses, patterns of breathing and physical areas where "they feel tense, tight, weak, uncomfortable or painful and aware of protective holding patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, S. ''The Gentle Pulse.''  2005&lt;/ref&gt; In this way clients may discover and release deeply embodied emotions. Whichever form is used, many of the effects of Pulsing occur below the level of conscious awareness and continue to resonate in the bodymind for some time after sessions.

&lt;!-- External links removed after Herbythyme objected on the grounds of blatant advertising, which was not my intention. Pulsing is one of the less well-known somatic therapies and as far as I am aware there are only 3 schools of development worldwide: Silke Ziehl (Entelia Institute/Open Centre) in UK &amp; Germany; Guy Gladstone (Bodyspace) in the UK; finally, Tovi Browning has developed a form called Holistic Pulsing with training centres in Europe and Australasia.

There is no official Pulsing organisation, and the originator didn't write a book - so the only real information on the web is through teacher or practitioner websites. The external links I had were:

'''Rajmund Zamanja''' ('''DÅ¾amanjiÄ''') (1587 in [[Dubrovnik]] - March 1647 in [[Dubrovnik]]) or '''Raymundo Giamagnik''' was a [[Croatia]]n [[Theology|theologian]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Linguistics|linguist]] from [[Republic of Ragusa|Dubrovnik]].

==Biography==
He was born in Dubrovnik in 1587. He joined the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in 1601 from which he learned philosophy and theology. Four years later, in 1605, he went to the end of the study in [[Bologna]]. In 1612 he returned to Dubrovnik as a [[lecturer]]. Three times he was a general vicar of the Dominicans. Fourteen years later, in 1626, he established the first public [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] on the ground floor of the Dominican monastery (in 1685 it was taken over by the Jesuits). There he was a teacher and he emphasized the importance of learning [[Croatian language]].

He is the author of the first [[orthography]] of the Croatian language, which was intended for students of the gymnasium. In 1639 he published a language discussion ''Nauk za piisati dobro latinskiema slovima rieci yezika slovinskoga koyiemse Dubrovcani, i sva Dalmatia kakko vlasctitiem svoyiem yezikom sluzci'', where he proposed a simple and consistent consonant [[writing system]]: double letters only write voices Ä, Ä, lj, nj, Å¡ and Å¾, but also the complicated use of [[accent marks]]. His [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] suggestions did not survive in practice.

{{Immanuel Kant}}
'''''Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason''''' ({{lang-de|Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der bloÃen Vernunft}}) is a 1793 book by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. Although its purpose and original intent has become a matter of some dispute, the book's immense and lasting influence on the history of [[theology]] and the [[philosophy of religion]] is indisputable. It consists of four parts, called "Pieces" (''StÃ¼cke''), originally written as a series of four journal articles. He strongly criticises ritual, superstition and a church hierarchy in this work.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-religion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal censorship==
The First Piece originally appeared as a ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'' article (April 1792). Kant's attempt to publish the Second Piece in the same journal met with opposition from the king's censor. Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship. Kant was reprimanded for this action of insubordination. When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or even speak publicly about religion.

==Title meaning and translations==
The book's title is based on a metaphor Kant introduces in the Prefaces and uses throughout the book, whereby rational religion is depicted as a naked ("bare") body while historical religions are regarded as "clothing" that are not appropriate "vehicles" for conveying religious truths to the populace. The earliest translation treats this metaphor too literally: using "naked" ignores the fact that Kant's "''bloÃen''" can also mean "mere". The most recent translation solves this problem by using the English "bare", which also has both meanings.

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrates the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20Â° [[shear mapping]]. He does not discuss the [[evolution]]ary causes of such a structural change, and has accordingly been suspected of [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;]]

'''Biological''' or '''process structuralism''' is a school of biological thought that objects to an exclusively [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] or [[adaptationism|adaptationist]] explanation of [[natural selection]] such as is described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|20th century's modern synthesis]]. It proposes instead that [[Alternatives to Darwinism|evolution is guided differently]], basically by more or less physical forces which shape the development of an animal's body, and sometimes implies that these forces supersede selection altogether.

Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s. Before Darwin, [[Ãtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued that animals shared  [[homology (biology)|homologous parts]], and that if one was enlarged, the others would be reduced in compensation. After Darwin, [[D'Arcy Thompson]] hinted at [[vitalism]] and offered geometric explanations in his classic 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. [[Adolf Seilacher]] suggested mechanical inflation for "pneu" structures in [[Ediacaran biota]] fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]''. [[GÃ¼nter P. Wagner]] argued for developmental bias, structural constraints on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. [[Stuart Kauffman]] favoured [[self-organisation]], the idea that complex structure emerges [[holism|holistically]] and spontaneously from the dynamic interaction of all parts of an [[organism]]. [[Michael Denton]] argued for laws of form by which [[Universals|Platonic universals]] or "Types" are self-organised. [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] proposed [[spandrel (biology)|biological "spandrels"]], features created as a byproduct of the adaptation of nearby structures. [[Gerd B. MÃ¼ller]] and Stuart A. Newman argued that the appearance in the [[fossil record]] of most of the current [[phylum|phyla]] in the [[Cambrian explosion]] was "pre-Mendelian"{{efn|[[Gregor Mendel]] pioneered the study of [[genetics]].}} evolution caused by physical factors. [[Brian Goodwin]], described by Wagner as part of "a [[pseudoscience|fringe]] movement in evolutionary biology",&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt; denies that biological complexity can be [[reductionism|reduced]] to natural selection, and argues that [[pattern formation]] is driven by [[morphogenetic field]]s.

Darwinian biologists have criticised structuralism, emphasising that there is plentiful evidence both that natural selection is effective and, from [[deep homology]], that [[gene]]s have been involved in shaping organisms throughout [[evolutionary history]]. They accept that some structures such as the [[cell membrane]] self-assemble, but deny the ability of self-organisation to drive large-scale evolution.

==History==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Multiple [[alternatives to Darwinism]] have been offered since the 19th century to explain how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially objected to [[natural selection]]. Many of these theories, including structural or developmental constraints, led (solid blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows). These theories were largely swept aside by the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[genetics]] and natural selection in the early 20th century (dashed orange arrows).]]

===Geoffroy's law of compensation===
{{Main|CuvierâGeoffroy debate}}

In 1830, [[Ãtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued a structuralist case against the functionalist ([[teleology in biology|teleological]]) position of [[Georges Cuvier]]. Geoffroy believed that [[homology (biology)|homologies]] of structure between animals indicated that they shared an ideal pattern; these did not imply evolution but a unity of plan, a law of nature.{{efn|In this, Geoffroy's homologies were like [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle's forms]].}} He further believed that if one part was more developed within a structure, the other parts would necessarily be reduced in compensation, as nature always used the same materials: if more of them were used for one feature, less was available for the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Racine, Valerie |title=Essay: The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/essay-cuvier-geoffroy-debate |publisher=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia, Arizona State University |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D'Arcy Thompson's morphology===
{{main|On Growth and Form}}

In his "eccentric, beautiful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] revisited the old idea of "[[hylomorphism|universal laws of form]]" to explain the observed forms of living organisms.&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ruse, Michael |editor1-last=Henning |editor1-first=Brian G. |editor2-last=Scarfe |editor2-first=Adam |title=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |date=2013 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=419 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtosxAtq-EC|chapter=17. From Organicism to Mechanism-and Halfway Back?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science writer [[Philip Ball]] states that Thompson "presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how the structures of the living world often echo those in inorganic nature", and notes his "frustration at the '[[Just So Stories|Just So]]' explanations of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] offered by Darwinians." Instead, Ball writes, Thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |title=In retrospect: On Growth and Form |journal=Nature |date=7 February 2013|volume=494 |issue=7435 |pages=32â33 |doi=10.1038/494032a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v494/n7435/full/494032a.html|bibcode=2013Natur.494...32B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] similarly wrote that Thompson "had little time for natural selection", certainly preferring "mechanical explanations" and possibly straying into [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name="Ruse"/&gt;

===Seilacher's pneu structures===
[[File:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|''[[Dickinsonia]]'' fossil described as a "pneu" structure with chambers inflated like a quilted [[air mattress]]. In [[Adolf Seilacher]]'s structuralist view, the structure is determined mechanically by the need to distribute the tension across the surface, rather than having been guided by natural selection.]]

Like Thompson, the palaeontologist [[Adolf Seilacher]] emphasised fabricational constraints on form. He interpreted fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]'' in the [[Ediacaran biota]] as "pneu" structures determined by mechanical inflation like a quilted [[air mattress]], rather than having been driven by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seilacher |first1=Adolf |title=Constructional Morphology and Evolution |editor1-last=Schmidt-Kittler|editor1-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Vogel |editor2-first=Klaus |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-76158-4 |date=1991 |pages=251â271|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-76156-0_17 |chapter=Self-Organizing Mechanisms in Morphogenesis and Evolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seilacher |first1=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Seilacher |title=Vendozoa: Organismic construction in the Proterozoic biosphere |journal=Lethaia |date=July 1989 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=229â239 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1989.tb01332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner's constraints on development===

In his 2014 book ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation'', the evolutionary biologist [[GÃ¼nter P. Wagner]] argues for "the study of novelty as distinct from adaptation." He defines novelty as occurring when some part of the body develops an individual and quasi-independent existence, in other words as a distinct and recognisable structure, which he implies might occur before natural selection begins to adapt the structure for some function.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014&gt;[[GÃ¼nter P. Wagner|Wagner, GÃ¼nter P.]], ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation''.  Princeton University Press. 2014. {{ISBN|978-0691156460}}.

Wagner |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10283.html |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He forms a structuralist picture of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], using empirical evidence, arguing that [[homology (biology)|homology]] and biological novelty are key aspects requiring explanation, and that developmental bias (i.e. structural constraints on embryonic development) is a key explanation for these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Rachael L. |title=Why development matters |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=November 2015 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=889â899 |doi=10.1007/s10539-015-9488-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MullerWagner1991&gt;{{cite journal | last=Muller | first=G.

===Kauffman's self-organisation===
[[File:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|Darwinists and structuralists agree that cell structures like the [[cell membrane]] spontaneously [[self-organization#Biology|self-organize]]. They disagree on how important [[self-organization]] is in other areas of biology.]]

The mathematical biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]] suggested in 1993 that [[self-organization#Biology|self-organization]] may play a role alongside [[natural selection]] in three areas of [[evolutionary biology]], namely [[population dynamics]], [[molecular evolution]], and [[morphogenesis]]. With respect to molecular biology, Kauffman has been criticised for ignoring the role of [[energy]] in driving [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] in cells, which can fairly be called self-[[catalysis|catalysing]] but which do not simply self-organise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=Ronald F. |title=Review of Stuart Kauffman, The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution |journal=Biophys. J. |date=December 1993 |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=2698â2699 |pmc=1226010 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(93)81321-3 |bibcode=1993BpJ....65.2698F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denton's 'T&lt;!--U/C name--&gt;ypes'===
The biochemist [[Michael Denton]]&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Denton|Denton, Michael]]. ''[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis]]'', Adler &amp; Adler, 1985. ISBN 0-917561-52-X&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; has argued a structuralist case for self-organization. In a 2013 paper, he claimed that "the basic forms of the natural worldâthe Typesâare immanent in nature, and determined by a set of special natural biological laws, the so called 'laws of form'." He asserts that these "recurring patterns and forms" are "genuine [[universals]]".{{efn|Universals are central to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] theory, [[Platonic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=plato-metaphysics |title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology |last=Silverman |first=Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Form is in this view not shaped by natural selection, but by "self-organizing properties of particular categories of matter" and by "cosmic fine-tuning of the laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Michael J. |title=The Types: A Persistent Structuralist Challenge to Darwinian Pan-Selectionism |journal=BIO-Complexity |date=August 2013 |url=http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2013.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denton has been criticised by the biochemist Laurence A. Moran as anti-Darwinian and favouring [[creationism]].&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moran |first1=Laurence A. |title=What is "Structuralism"? |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/what-is-structuralism.html |website=Sandwalk (blog of a recognised expert) |accessdate=9 December 2016|date=2016-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gould and Lewontin's spandrels===
&lt;!--File:San Marco spandrel.jpg|in the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]], [[Venice]] --&gt;
[[File:Central Park New York City New York 33.jpg|thumb|An ornamented bridge [[spandrel]]. [[Steven J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] argued that the triangular area is a byproduct of the [[adaptation]] of structures around it.]]
{{main|Spandrel (biology)}}

In 1979, influenced by Seilacher among others, the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen J. Gould]] and the [[population genetics|population geneticist]] [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote what Wagner called "the most influential structuralist manifesto", "The [[spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]]s of San Marco and the [[Panglossian]] Paradigm".&lt;ref name=GouldLewontin1979&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proc.

Instead, architects couldn't help creating small triangular areas between [[arch]]es and [[pillar]]s, as arches need (evolve) to be curved, and pillars need to be vertical. The resulting spandrels are [[exaptation]]s, consequences of other evolutionary changes. Evolution, they argued, did not select for a protruding human chin: instead, reducing the length of the tooth row left the jaw protruding.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt;

===MÃ¼ller and Newman's pre-Mendelian evolution===

Extreme structuralists like [[Gerd B. MÃ¼ller]] and Stuart A. Newman, inheriting the viewpoint of D'Arcy Thompson, have proposed that physical laws of structure, not [[genetics]], govern major diversifications such as the [[Cambrian explosion]], followed later by co-opted genetic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Erwin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erwin |first1=Douglas H. |author1link=Douglas Erwin |title=Evolutionary uniformitarianism |journal=Developmental Biology |date=September 2011 |volume=357 |issue=1 |pages=27â34 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.01.020 |pmid=21276788 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611000443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=MÃ¼ller | first1=Gerd B. |author1link=Gerd B.

They note for example that [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between widely separated groups of organisms, such as the [[signalling pathway]]s and [[transcription factor]]s of [[choanoflagellate]]s and [[metazoa]]ns, demonstrate that genes have been involved throughout [[evolutionary history]].&lt;ref name="King2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Nicole |title=The Unicellular Ancestry of Animal Development |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=313â325 |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.010|pmid=15363407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from evolutionary biologists==
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified, Animals emphasized.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Laurence Moran notes that structuralism focuses mainly on [[animal]]s, but that animals (emphasized) form only a small portion of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;]]

While agreeing that pattern formation mechanisms such as those described by Goodwin exist, the biologists Richard Dawkins, Stephen J. Gould, [[Lynn Margulis]], and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have criticised Goodwin for suggesting that chemical signalling forms an alternative to natural selection.&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

Moran, a "skeptical biochemist", comments that 'structuralism' is a "new buzzword ... guaranteed to impress the creationist crowd because nobody understands what it means but it sounds very 'sciency' and philosophical."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt; The philosopher of science [[Paul E. Griffiths]] writes that structuralists "view this structuring of the space of biological possibility as part of the fundamental physical structure of nature. But the phenomena of phylogenetic inertia and developmental constraint do not support this interpretation. These phenomena show that the evolutionary pathways available to an organism are a function of the developmental structure of the organism."&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Paul E. |authorlink=Paul E. Griffiths |title=Darwinism, Process Structuralism, and Natural Kinds |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=63 |year=1996 |pages=S1âS9 |doi=10.1086/289930 |jstor=188505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran summarizes: "There's nothing in science that supports the views of the structuralists. We have perfectly good explanations for why bumblebees are different than mushrooms and why all vertebrates have vertebrae and not exoskeletons. There's no evidence to support the idea that if you replay the tape of life it will come out looking anything like what we see today. You can be confident that when you visit another planet you will not find vertebrates."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

The [[evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biologist]] [[Lewis Held]] wrote that "The notion that aspects of anatomy can be explained by physical forces (like expansion cracking) was advocated ~ 100 years earlier in D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 ''On Growth and Form'' and in [[Theodore Andrea Cook|Theodore Cook]]'s 1914 book ''The Curves of Life''.{{efn|The artist Theodore Cook's ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028937179 The Curves of Life]'', Constable, 1914 to some extent anticipated D'Arcy Thompson, exploring [[spiral]]s in art and nature.}} Over the intervening century, various traits have been proposed to arise ''mechanically'' rather than ''genetically'': brain convolutions, cartilage condensations, flower corrugations, tooth cusps, and fish otoliths. To this kooky list we can now add the crooked smile of the crocodile, or at least the cracked skin that surrounds it."{{efn |Held's final point was that the cracks in the crocodile's skin are genuinely explained by cracking, unlike all the other examples he lists.&lt;ref name=Held2014/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Held2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Held |first=Lewis Irving |title=How the snake lost its legs: curious tales from the frontier of evo-devo |titlelink=How the Snake Lost its Legs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom New York |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-62139-8 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Columbiad 1807.jpg|thumb|First edition title page, 1807]]
'''''The Columbiad''''' (1807) is a philosophical [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by the American diplomat and man of letters [[Joel Barlow]].  It grew out of Barlow's earlier poem ''The Vision of Columbus'' (1787).  Intended as a [[national epic]] for the United States it was popular with the reading public for a few years, and was compared with [[Homer]], [[Virgil]] and [[John Milton|Milton]], but it has since been for the most part dismissed as an overblown and tedious failure.

== ''The Vision of Columbus'' ==

''The Columbiad'' had its origins in ''The Vision of Columbus'', a philosophical poem begun in 1780 and continued through Barlow's service as a military chaplain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{sfn|Kettell|1829|p=2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Quinn |first1=Arthur Hobson |title=The Literature of the American People: An Historical and Critical Survey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47TvQKTcuX4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=%22which+he+had+been+writing+since+1780%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22which%20he%20had%20been%20writing%20since%201780%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 October 2013 |year=1951 |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |location=New York |page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A hymn of praise to America written in nine books, ''The Vision of Columbus'' took the form of a dialogue between [[Christopher Columbus]] and an angel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53516/Joel-Barlow |title=Joel Barlow |encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ousby|1993|p=194}}  Its panoramic range includes the whole history of both North and South America, and culminates in the Revolutionary War and the glorious post-Revolutionary future of the United States.{{sfn|Mulford|2000}}  In tone the poem is overtly Christian, and is coloured by Barlow's political sympathies, which were then [[Federalist Party|Federalist]].{{sfn|Haselby|2011}}  It was published in 1787 by subscription, the subscribers including [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Louis XVI of France]].{{sfn|Mulford|2000}}  ''The Vision of Columbus'' enjoyed an enormous success with the American reading public, establishing him as the leading poet of his country, and it attracted admiration in France and England.{{sfn|Kettell|1829|p=9}}{{sfn|Tucker|1917|pp=169â170}}

== Rewriting ==

Over the next 20 years Barlow laboriously reworked ''The Vision'', eventually expanding it from 4700 lines to 8350, building up a huge [[Critical apparatus|apparatus]] of prefaces and footnotes, and so altering the whole tenor of the work that it bore little resemblance to the original.  Barlow's religious convictions turned to [[Religious scepticism|scepticism]], while in politics he became a liberal democrat, and these changes were reflected in the poem.{{sfn|Ousby|1993|p=194}}{{sfn|Tucker|1917|p=170}}{{sfn|Haselby|2011}}  His hopes for the future of America were pinned on a new holy trinity of "equality, free election, and federal band", which would bring about a new age of artistic and scientific advance.{{sfn|Mulford|2000}}  ''The Columbiad'' shows human history reaching its climax in the formation of a world council in [[Mesopotamia]], the delegates to which have thrown aside the symbols of their religious faith.{{sfn|Haselby|2011}}  Barlow wrote that the object of his poem was "to inculcate the love of rational liberty, and to discountenance the deleterious passion for violence and war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caldwell |first1=Tanya |title=Virgil Made English: The Decline of Classical Authority |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsTIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=%22discountenance+the+deleterious+passion+for+violence%22+preface&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7RVUoSoBsmg7Ab9y4GwDw&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22discountenance%20the%20deleterious%20passion%20for%20violence%22%20preface&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 October 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230606760 |page=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

''The Columbiad'' was published in 1807 by the firm of C. and A. Conrad, in the form of a sumptuously printed, lavishly illustrated ''Ã©dition de luxe'' of unprecedented magnificence.  This has been described as "the [[graphic arts]] event of the decade",{{sfn|Bidwell|1983|pp=339â340}} and more than 20 years later it could still be claimed that it had been produced "in a style of elegance which few works, either American or European, have ever equalled".{{sfn|Kettell|1829|p=9}}  Since copies of the first edition were sold at the prohibitive price of $20 it was necessary to bring out a cheaper duodecimo edition in 1809.{{sfn|Bidwell|1983|p=339}}{{sfn|McDonald|2010|p=200-201}}  Altogether there were seven printings between 1807 and 1825, five in America and two abroad.{{sfn|Buel|2011|pp=301â302}}  Thereafter it remained out of print until in 1970 both ''The Vision of Columbus'' and ''The Columbiad'' were reprinted in Bottorff and Ford's edition of ''The Works of Joel Barlow in Two Volumes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Emory |authorlink1=Emory Elliott |title=Literature and Authority in the New Republic, 1725â1810 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmI6avgH0GoC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=%22All+references+to+Barlow%27s+The+Vision%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qWpaUvagE8nD0QXRkoCYDg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22All%20references%20to%20Barlow%27s%20The%20Vision%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 October 2013 |year=1986 |origyear=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0195039955 |page=288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Sales of the cheap second edition of ''The Columbiad'' were encouraging, and the newspaper publicity given to the poem was greater than that generated by many successful novels, but reviews were from the first mixed.{{sfn|McDonald|2010|p=202-205}}  James Dennie's ''Port Folio'', a Federalist paper which could hardly be expected to support a renegade from that party, pronounced ''The Columbiad'' "as a wholeâ¦devoid of interest", though Dennie later admitted the article had been an "obnoxious criticism".  Others praised it to the skies, comparing it favourably with Homer, Virgil and Milton, but [[Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey|Francis Jeffrey]] in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' found the plot incoherent and the style cumbrous and inflated.{{sfn|Buel|2011|pp=294â295}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Grassi's Present State of America |year=1823 |journal=North American Review |volume=16 (NS 7) |page=234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGACAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=%22columbiad%22+barlow+%22as+a+poem+equal%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22columbiad%22%20barlow%20%22as%20a%20poem%20equal%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British critics also objected to Barlow's taste for coining [[neologism]]s, such as ''crass'' and ''utilize''.{{sfn|Mottram|1971|p=25}}   In France the revolutionary leader and former bishop [[Henri GrÃ©goire]] published a vitriolic open letter taking grave exception to Barlow's secularist point of view, and this was extensively reprinted in the United States.  Barlow responded with a pamphlet, ''Letter to Henri GrÃ©goireâ¦in Reply to his Letter on the Columbiad'', which was likewise reprinted in many American newspapers, keeping the poem in the public eye.{{sfn|McDonald|2010|p=206-214}}  Partly as a result of this controversy sales of ''The Columbiad'' continued healthy, but by the 1820s interest in the poem was waning, either because it was too concerned with the issues of its own day, because the evangelized American public at the time of the [[Second Great Awakening]] were not ready to take such a [[Freethought|freethinking]] work to its heart, or because Barlow's [[Augustan poetry|Augustan]] conception of epic poetry seemed hopelessly old-fashioned in a [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] age.{{sfn|Buel|2011|pp=301â302}}{{sfn|Tucker|1917|p=170}}  In 1829 it was being reported that ''The Columbiad'' "is now fallen quite into neglect",{{sfn|Kettell|1829|p=11}} and in 1900 [[Barrett Wendell]] said that "few mortals now living have more than glanced at [it]".{{sfn|Wendell|1900|p=127}}

''The Columbiad''âs standing has not greatly improved in modern times.  It has been called "one of the strangest pieces of literature produced by a 19th-century American",{{sfn|Haselby|2011}} "more like a political treatise than a poem",{{sfn|Ousby|1993|p=194}} and simply "unreadable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=W.

In 1917 the ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|Cambridge History of American Literature]]'' conceded that "hidden away among these thousands of lines of laboured rhetoric, are passages really fine and free in both conception and execution";{{sfn|Tucker|1917|p=171}} the historian [[Vernon Louis Parrington]] wrote that while "it may not be good poetryâ¦the sentiments are those of an enlightened and generous man";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parrington |first1=Vernon Louis |title=Main Currents in American Thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6208">"'''The Use of Knowledge in Society'''" is a scholarly article written by economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], first published in the September 1945 issue of ''[[The American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=519â530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ200/spring01/hayek.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=519â530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society - F. A. Hayek|date=1 May 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written (along with ''The Meaning of Competition'') as a rebuttal to fellow [[economist]] [[Oskar R. Lange]] and his endorsement of a [[planned economy]], it was included among the twelve essays in Hayek's 1948 compendium ''[[Individualism and Economic Order]]''.&lt;ref name="hayek book"&gt;{{cite book | title=Individualism and Economic Order| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5BJcBHuvrsMC&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PP1#PPP1,M1| last=Hayek| first=F. A.| year=1996| publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago| isbn=0-226-32093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argument ==
Hayek's article argues against the establishment of a Central Pricing Board (advocated by Lange) by highlighting the dynamic and organic nature of market [[price|price-fluctuations]], and the benefits of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="book1"/&gt; He asserts that a centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the [[free market|open market]] because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society.&lt;ref name="kauffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.kauffman.org/cwp/appmanager/research/researchDesktop;jsessionid=GVJKUmhZQ8YdcdEwB2DGgQxpdz26X7E3ZO8TfnqSZE7nuSIAUScJ!973872261?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=research_resourceDetail&amp;keep=all&amp;id=Research/Resource/Journal_Article_2848.htm&amp;_nfls=false |title=The use of knowledge in society (abstract)|accessdate=2007-10-05|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hayek's words, "The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction."  The article also discusses the concepts of 'individual equilibrium' and of Hayek's notion of the divide between information which is useful and practicable versus that which is purely scientific or theoretical.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carl Menger and his legacy in economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir0g_PW5lAYC&amp;pg=PA393 |editor=Bruce J. Caldwell |year=1990 |pages=392â95 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-1087-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
"The Use of Knowledge in Society" was a sensation among economists, setting off a train of work in the economics of information and other areas, including the work of a number of future Nobel Prize winners, as noted by Nobel winner [[Leonid Hurwicz]]. UCLA economist [[Armen Alchian]] remembers the excitement of reading Hayek's essay and stopping fellow economists in the hallway to ask if they had read Hayek's essay. In 2011 "The Use of Knowledge in Society" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the ''American Economic Review'' during its first 100 years.&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{Citation|last1=Arrow|first1=Kenneth J.|last2=Bernheim|first2=B.

The division of philosophy into a [[practical philosophy|practical]] and a theoretical discipline has its origin in [[Aristotle]]'s moral philosophy and natural philosophy categories. In [[Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solvang|first1=Lin|title=Theoretical Philosophy|url=http://mcc.ku.dk/research/focus-areas/theoreticalphilosophy/|website=mcc.ku.dk|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoretical Philosophy - University of Helsinki|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/theoreticalphilosophy/|website=www.helsinki.fi|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoretical Philosophy {{!}} Philosophisches Seminar - English|url=http://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb05philosophieengl/institutes/theoretical-philosophy/|website=www.blogs.uni-mainz.de|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoretical Philosophy|url=https://www.uu.nl/en/research/philosophy/theoretical-philosophy|website=Universiteit Utrecht|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoretical Philosophy {{!}} Department of Philosophy, Lund University|url=http://www.fil.lu.se/en/research/teoretisk-filosofi/|website=www.fil.lu.se|accessdate=30 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theoretical Philosophy {{!}} Philosophy|url=http://uwm.edu/philosophy/theoretical-philosophy/|website=uwm.edu|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar schemeâsome [[Scotland|Scottish]] universities, for example, divide philosophy into [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[ethics]]âbut in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as [[SÃ¶dertÃ¶rn University College|SÃ¶dertÃ¶rns HÃ¶gskola]].

Theoretical philosophy is sometimes confused with [[Analytic philosophy]], but the latter is a philosophical movement, embracing certain ideas and methods but dealing with all philosophical subject matters, while the former is a way of sorting philosophical questions into two different categories in the context of a [[curriculum]].

==Examples of theoretical philosophy subjects==
*[[Epistemology]]
*[[Logic]]
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]]
*[[Philosophy of science]]
*[[Philosophy of language]]
*[[Philosophy of mind]]
*[[Metaphysics]]
*[[Ontology]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7993">[[File:Vasili-Sesemann-1912.jpg|thumb|right|Vasili Sesemann in 1912.]]
'''Vasily Seseman''' (several other [[Romanization|latinization]]s of his name exist, {{lang-lt|Vosylius Sezemanas}}, {{lang-ru|ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸Ð¹ Ð­Ð¼Ð¸Ð»ÑÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ Ð¡ÐµÐ·ÐµÐ¼Ð°Ð½}}) (June 11, 1884, [[Vyborg]] â March 23, 1963, [[Vilnius]]) was a [[Russia]]n and [[Lithuania]]n philosopher, a representative of Marburg school of [[Neo-Kantianism]]. He is mostly remembered for his role in fostering philosophy in newly independent Lithuania and developing [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] philosophical vocabulary (most remarkable are his translations of [[Aristotle]] into Lithuanian and contributions to Lithuanian encyclopedias). A close associate of [[Viktor Zhirmunsky]] and [[Lev Karsavin]], as a prisoner of [[Gulag]] he was also an informal philosophy tutor and supporter of [[Buddhist]] writer [[Bidia Dandaron]].

== Biography ==
Born to the family of a medical doctor of [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish Swedish]] descent and a [[Baltic German]] mother, he was initially named Wilhelm Sesemann and attended the Lutheran school (Katharinenschule) in [[St Petersburg]]. As he grew up, he adopted a more Russian identity, changing Wilhelm to Wassilij (Vasily) and embracing [[Russian Orthodox Christianity]].

After two years of medical studies he turned to philosophy, fervently studying classical authors under [[Nikolay Lossky]] and classical languages under [[Tadeusz Stefan ZieliÅski]] at [[St Petersburg University|University of St. Petersburg]]. In 1909-1911 the university sent him to Germany to prepare him for a teaching career. In Berlin and Marburg, he took courses in philosophy, psychology, and pedagogics under [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Paul Natorp]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Hermann Alexander Diels]], and [[Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin]]. In Germany he also met [[JosÃ© Ortega y Gasset]] who made a great impression on him, and re-established a lifelong friendship with [[Nicolai Hartmann]] who in St Petersburg had influenced Vasily's decision to switch from medicine to philosophy.

Upon his return to St. Petersburg, Seseman taught philosophy and classical languages until [[World War I]], when he enlisted as a volunteer in the Russian army.

From 1915 to 1917 he taught philosophy as a [[privatdozent]] at the University of St. Petersburg, and from 1918 to 1919 at the Viatka Pedagogical Institute. He received a docentship in Saratov, where he worked (together with Viktor Zhirmunsky) until 1921.

Later Seseman, as a Finnish citizen, emigrated to Finland and then to Berlin, where he finally found a teaching position at the Russian Institute.

In 1923 Seseman was invited to become a professor at [[Kaunas University]] in Lithuania. When Vilnius was [[SovietâLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty#In Vilnius Region|regained by Lithuania]], he moved there and worked at the [[Vilnius University|University of Vilnius]] until the Nazis closed it down in 1943. He worked as a [[German language]] teacher during the [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany#German occupation|German occupation]], and led a philosophy course in the Jewish ghetto.

According to his stepdaughter's interview, while living in poverty, at his place in central Vilnius he also hid from the Nazis a Jewish girl (who later disappeared), and supplied ghetto Jews with false documents allowing emigration. He made a narrow escape from being burnt alive for being a supporter of the Jews while the Nazi troops were abandoning the city for the Soviet troops. His efforts on behalf of the Jews were posthumously recognized by the Lithuanian government awarding him a medal.

He spent 1945-1950 teaching at the University of Vilnius again, but then was arrested by the Soviet authorities, accused of âanti-Soviet activitiesâ and ârelations with Zionist organizationsâ and sentenced to 15 years of labor camps. In Siberia he met a [[Buddhist tantra]] practitioner Bidia Dandaron who learned a lot from Seseman, as a result embracing Kantian ideas and developing his own synthesis of Tibetan Buddhist and European philosophical thought in his writings. Their friendship continued after they were released.

In 1956 Seseman was released, in 1958 [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] and resumed his professorship at Vilnius where he taught for the rest of his life.

== Philosophy ==
Seseman liked to call his philosophy âgnoseological idealismâ, trying to revive [[metaphysics]] through a re-evaluation of the metaphysical tradition of [[ontology]]. His other philosophical aim was to overcome the dichotomies between the subjective-psychological and the objective-realistic in the [[theory of knowledge]] and metaphysics in general.

He deliberated on the dangers of materialism and [[positivism]] for European thought.

Sesemanâs concern for formal questions in linguistics and aesthetics may make him a precursor of modern [[semiotics]].
