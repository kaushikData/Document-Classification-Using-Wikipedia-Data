{{italic title}}
'''''A Mother's Ordeal: One Woman's Fight Against China's One-child Policy''''' is a book written by [[Steven W. Mosher]], President of [[Population Research Institute]]. The book is written in biographical style that takes the reader from the earliest memories of Chi-An, a Chinese female born on the year of the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] (1949), through to her seeking asylum in the United States due to her pregnancy, which was illegal due to China's [[one-child policy]].

==Synopsis==
With names changed to prevent retribution by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), Mosher writes in the first person about "Chi An", a girl born to a Chinese family with the traditional beliefs that boys were worth more than girls. As such, her family had no birthday celebration for her and did not mark the date of her birth down. The first few chapters cover significant memories from childhood, including the death of her father and the trials underwent by her family during the [[Great Chinese Famine]] brought about by agricultural mismanagement as well as highly inflated reports of crop production figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jisheng, Yang|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958–1962; Book Review|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 3, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/books/review/tombstone-the-great-chinese-famine-1958-1962-by-yang-jisheng.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chi An grew up surrounded by the ideologies of the Communist Party and in her youth worked for the CPC. Later in life, Chi An studied to become a nurse where she performed her first abortion at age 16, thus beginning her career as a nurse carrying out the One-child Policy through abortion, contraception, and sterilizations all in efforts to meet the birth quotas imposed by party officials. Chi An finds a suitor and they become married, after a fashion, and have a healthy baby boy as their first child. The couple became pregnant with a second child, but were forced to abort the baby as it was illegal.

Chi An takes a job at the Liaoning Truck Factory as a company nurse, where all female employees are required once a month to write down on a public message board that they are obeying the CPC and its single-child directives by not becoming pregnant. Around this time, Chi An's husband is granted a student visa to study abroad in the United States. Chi An's husband invited her and their child to the United States to be with him after they had received temporary visas. During their time in the United States, Chi An becomes pregnant. Her superiors at the Liaoning Truck Factory and those involved in the enforcement of the One-child policy pressure Chi An to abort her child as it is a second child and thus illegal. In the story, Chi An reveals that CPC members visit her family and threaten them with punitive action unless "remedial measures" are taken, that is to say, an abortion on the second child. Chi An and her husband seek asylum in the United States in order to live there and have their second child far away from the reach of the CPC. With the help of Mosher, Chi An and family are granted asylum.

The '''Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) Act 1939''' (2 &amp; 3 Geo. 6 c. 78) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that modified the law in [[England and Wales]] with regards to [[juries in England and Wales]]. It was an emergency measure passed in anticipation of [[World War II|war with Germany]], and received [[royal assent]] on the day that [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]], beginning the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Among other things, it reduced the number of people required to serve on a [[jury]] in civil or criminal cases from twelve to seven (except in the most serious criminal cases).&lt;ref&gt;Section 7(1)&lt;/ref&gt; It also raised the age limit for jury service from 60 to 65,&lt;ref&gt;Section 7(3)&lt;/ref&gt; and abolished trial by jury in civil cases, except in cases where the judge ordered that a jury trial was to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the large numbers of people who were expected to be [[conscription|conscripted]] in the event of a war. The Act was to have effect until the end of the war, when it would be suspended by an [[Order in Council]].

Similar legislation was passed for [[Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1939 (c. 79)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Act 1939 (c. 105)&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, where a unanimous verdict was not always required, a majority verdict could be given by five of the seven jurors.&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1939, section 3(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected text==
Section 7(1) read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Notwithstanding anything in any enactment, for the purpose of any trial with a jury or inquiry by a jury in any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, it shall not be necessary for the jury to consist of more than seven persons:&lt;br&gt;
"Provided that the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to the trial of a person on any charge, if the court or a judge thinks fit, by reason of the gravity of the matters in issue, to direct that those provisions shall not apply, and shall not in any case apply in relation to the trial of a person on a charge of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] or [[murder]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Section 8(1) read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No question arising in any civil proceedings in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] or in any inferior court of civil jurisdiction shall be tried with a jury, and no writ of enquiry for the assessment of damages or other claim by a jury shall issue, unless the court or a judge is of opinion that the question ought to be tried with a jury or, as the case may be, the assessment ought to be made by a jury and makes an order to that effect."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While anecdotal evidence is typically unscientific, in the last several decades the ''evaluation'' of anecdotes has received sustained academic scrutiny from economists and scholars such as [[Felix Salmon]]&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/02/02/viral-math/ Viral as Anecdotal &lt;/ref&gt;  [[S. G. Checkland]] (on David Ricardo), [[Steven Novella]], R. Charleton, [[Hollis Robbins]], Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo, and others. These academics seek to quantify the value of the use of c awareness of a disease. More recently, economists studying choice models have begun assessing anecdotal value in the context of [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]; [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] suggest that choice models may be contingent on stories or anecdotes that frame or influence choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JOCS.0000037615.23350.f3|title=Modeling Patient Decision-Making: The Role of Base-Rate and Anecdotal Information|first1=Angela K.|last1=Freymuth|first2=George F.|last2=Ronan|date=1 September 2004|publisher=|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings|volume=11|issue=3|pages=211–216|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1023/B:JOCS.0000037615.23350.f3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an example, consider [[Joseph Stalin]]'s apocryphal quote:  The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.&lt;ref&gt;Solovyova, Julia (October 28, 1997) [http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html Mustering Most Memorable Quips] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504082655/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |date=2008-05-04 }}, ''The Moscow Times'' states: "Russian historians have no record of the lines, 'Death of one man is a tragedy.

The '''Bank of London and Montreal Limited''' was a [[joint venture]] between [[Bank of London and South America]] (BOLSA), a subsidiary of [[Lloyds Bank]], and [[Bank of Montreal]]. It was established in 1958 and headquartered in [[Nassau, Bahamas]].

==History==

*1958 Bank of London and South America, an associate of Lloyds Bank, and Bank of Montreal established Bank of London and Montreal as a 50-50 JV with headquarters in Nassau in the Bahamas.  BOLSA contributed its branches in the West Indies and northern South America, and Bank of Montreal contributed capital.
*1959 BOLAM established a branch in [[Jamaica]].
*1960 BOLAM established a branch in [[Trinidad]].
*1964 [[Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas)]] acquired one third of the shares of BOLAM.
*1965 [[Mellon Financial|Mellon National Bank]] acquired 15% of the shares in BOLAM. Lloyds' share fell to 24%. Bolam closed its offices in [[Venezuela]] and became a large shareholder in [[Banco La Guaira Internacional]], which had offices in [[Caracas]] and [[La Guaira]].
*1968 The [[Bank of England]] allowed Mellon to increase its shareholding to 25%.
*1970 BOLSA fully acquired BOLAM, which had 28 branches throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. In the divorce, Bolsa took back its branches.  Bank of Montreal got the Bahamian and Jamaican branches, and sold the branch and operations in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] to the government there, which used the acquisition as the foundation for a new bank, National Commercial Bank.  This is now [[First Citizens Bank]]. On April 17, 1970 Bank of Montreal incorporated the branches it took over as Bank of Montreal (Bahamas &amp; Caribbean), and in 1983 changed the name Bank of Montreal Bahamas Limited.
*1971 The Government of Jamaica purchased [[Bank of Montreal]]'s Jamaican operations, renaming them '''Bank of Surrey'''.  Bank of Surrey closed five months later. 
:In 1988 Bank of Montreal wanted to close the Bahamian operations so the Government of the Bahamas stepped in to keep them going.  The Government of The Bahamas created a 51-49 joint venture with [[Euro Canadian Bank]], which took over the new bank and renamed it Bank of The Bahamas.  This is now [[Bank of Bahamas International]].	
*1971 Lloyds combined Lloyds Bank Europe, BOLSA and BOLAM as subsidiaries of a new bank, Lloyds and Bolsa International Bank, of which Lloyds owned 55% and Mellon Bank 13%.  Within two years, Lloyds bought out Mellon Bank and the other minority shareholders.  It then renamed the bank Lloyds Bank International (LBI).   
*1975 LBI closed the Tokyo branch that BOLAM had established in 1971.
*1984 Lloyds merged in LBI.

'''''Bharat Forge Co Ltd v Uttam Manohar Nakate''''' [2005] [http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2005/45.html INSC 45] is an [[Indian labour law]] case concerning the dismissal of a worker who was found to be asleep in 1983. After 22 years, the [[Supreme Court of India]] upheld his dismissal.&lt;ref name="sleepysystem"/&gt;

==Facts==
Uttam was a helper in [[Bharat Forge]].&lt;ref name="Caught napping"/&gt; He was found lying fast asleep on an iron plate in the corner of the department at 11:40 a.m. on 26 August 1983.&lt;ref name="Uttam Manohar Nakate vs Bharat Forge Company Ltd., Pune"/&gt; This was the fourth time this had happened,&lt;ref name="Uttam Manohar Nakate vs Bharat Forge Company Ltd., Pune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uttam Manohar Nakate vs Bharat Forge Company Ltd., Pune|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/763806/|publisher=indiankanoon.org|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After five-month-long disciplinary hearings, the company fired him in January 1984.&lt;ref name="indiamodel"/&gt; Uttam went to court, which found the company guilty of "unfair labour practice" and forced the factory to take Uttam back and pay him 50 percent of his lost wages.&lt;ref name="indiamodel"/&gt; The case was appealed to the [[Bombay High Court]] and eventually to the national [[Supreme Court of India]], reported as AIR 2005 SC 947.

==Judgment==
In 2005 the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the company had the right to fire him.&lt;ref name="indiamodel"/&gt;

{{Cquote|If the punishment is harsh, albeit a lesser punishment may be imposed, but such an order cannot be passed on an irrational or extraneous factor and certainly not on a compassionate ground.

In ''Regional Manager, Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation v Sohan Lal'' (2004) 8 SCC 218, it has been held that it is not the normal jurisdiction of the superior courts to interfere with the quantum of sentence unless it is wholly disproportionate to the misconduct proved. Such is not the case herein. In the facts and circumstances of the case and having regard to the past conduct of the Respondent as also his conduct during the domestic enquiry proceeding, we cannot say that the quantum of punishment imposed upon the Respondent was wholly disproportionate to his act of misconduct or otherwise arbitrary.}}

==Significance==
Nakate's case is often used as an example of the problems with [[Indian labour law]] system of requiring government approval before dismissals can take effect.&lt;ref name="sleepysystem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sleepy-system/124536/|title=Sleepy system|publisher=Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caught napping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050130/spectrum/ultapulta.htm|title=Caught napping|publisher=The Tribune India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiamodel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060701faessay85401-p0/gurcharan-das/the-india-model.html|title=The India Model|author=Gurcharan Das|publisher=Foreign Affairs|date=July–August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307101534/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060701faessay85401-p0/gurcharan-das/the-india-model.html|archivedate=2009-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Aside from highlighting the problem of India's lethargic legal system, Uttam's case dramatizes how the country's labor laws actually reduce employment, by making employers afraid to hire workers in the first place. The rules protect existing unionized workers -- sometimes referred to as the "[[labor aristocracy]]" -- at the expense of everyone else. At this point, the labor aristocracy comprises only 10 percent of the Indian work force.|Gurcharan Das on the [[Foreign Affairs]] magazine.&lt;ref name="indiamodel"/&gt;}}

{{quotation|The fact that we finally got a sound judgement shows we do have a system of checks and balances for those with the stamina to travel the course. But the more important point is why did our judges take 22 years to decide the set of appeals? How long, then, will our court system take to handle more complex issues? One reason investors hesitate to put their money into India is the problem of getting any dispute adjudicated and enforced in a reasonable time. Uttam's case shows those fears are very real. Worse, what does it say about our system's ability to deliver simple and swift justice to the average Indian?|[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]]&lt;ref name="sleepysystem"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35838">'''The UK's Building regulations''' are [[statutory instrument]]s that seek to ensure that the policies set out in the relevant legislation are carried out. [[Building regulations approval]] is required for most building work in the UK.  Building regulations that apply across [[England and Wales]] are set out in the [[Building Act 1984]] while those that apply across [[Scotland]] are set out in the [[Building (Scotland) Act 2003]]. The Act in England and Wales permits detailed regulations to be made by the Secretary of State. The regulations made under the Act have been periodically updated, rewritten or consolidated, with the latest and current version being the Building Regulations 2010. The [[UK Government]] (at Westminster) is responsible for the relevant legislation and administration in England, the [[Welsh Government]] (at Cardiff) is the responsible body in Wales, the [[Scottish Government]] (at Edinburgh) is responsible for the issue in Scotland, and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] (at Belfast) has responsibility within its jurisdiction. There are very similar (and technically very comparable) Building Regulations in the Republic of Ireland.

The detailed requirements of Building regulations in England (and Wales) are scheduled within 16 separate headings, each designated by a letter ("Part A" to "Part Q"), and covering aspects such as "workmanship", "adequate materials", "structure", "waterproofing" &amp; "weatherisation", "fire safety" &amp; "means of escape", "sound isolation", "ventilation", "safe (potable) water", "protection from falling", "drainage", "sanitary facilities", "accessible access" &amp; "facilities for the disabled", "electrical safety", "security of a building","high speed broadband infrastructure", and so on.

For each Part, detailed specifications are available free online (in the English and Welsh governments's "approved documents") describing the matters to be taken into account. The approved documents are not literally legally binding in how the requirements must be met; rather, they present the expectation of the Secretary of State concerning the minimum appropriate standards required for compliance with the Building Regulations, and the common methods &amp; materials used to achieve these. The use of appropriate British Standards and/or European Standards is also accepted as one way of complying with the Building Regulations requirements.

However, the supply of gas (natural and/or LPG) is not controlled by the Building Regulations, as there are separate Gas Safety Regulations enforced by the Health and Safety Executive HSE).

Newer versions of Building Regulations are generally not retrospective, they are applied to each new change or modification to a building (or new part of a building) but do not require renovation of existing elements. There are general requirements for any change or improvement, that the building must not be left any less satisfactory in compliance than before the works, and areas worked on must not be left in unsafe condition by reference to current standards. The Regulations may also specify in some cases, that when enough work is done in an area (such as partial new insulation) the remainder of that area must be brought to an appropriate standard, however the standard required for an existing building may be less stringent than that required for a completely new building.

The Regulations also specify, that some types of work must be undertaken by an appropriate qualified professional (such as works on gas or certain electrical matters), or must be notified to the relevant [[local authority]]'s [[Building regulations approval]] for certification or approval.

However, it should be remembered that the Building regulations are separate and distinct from '''Town Planning''' and '''[[planning permission]];''' the building regulations control how buildings are to be designed or modified on the public grounds of safety and sustainability while '''''planning permission''''' is concerned with ''appropriate development'', the ''nature of land usage'', and the appearance of '''''neighbourhoods'''.'' Therefore, both must be considered when building works are to be undertaken.

==History and timeline of changes==
From 1 January 2005 the term ''building work'' includes work on ''household electrics''.

The [[Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006]] made provision for [[microgeneration]] to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on compliance with these aspects of the Building Regulations and steps proposed to increase compliance. However, no such regulations have been laid.

From 6 April 2006, the Building Regulations are extended by amendments to incorporate some of the European Directives requiring energy in existing and new buildings to be measured, etc. The core term ''building work'' was once again amended and extended in scope to include ''renovation of thermal elements'', and energy used by space cooling systems as well as energy used by space heating systems. Both are now subject to efficiency limits, and energy use controls are required. New additional ''competent persons'' schemes were proposed and authorised, in respect of energy systems and energy efficient design.
* A total rewrite of Approved Document for Part P (Electrical Safety) was also issued in 2006.
* New Approved Documents for Part F and Part L were issued along with specified 'second tier' guidance documents was also issued in 2006.
* A total rewrite of the Building Regulations was issued in 2010. However, this has since been amended several times again, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 &amp; 2016.
* A total rewrite of Approved Document for Part K (Protection against Falling, &amp; Glazing Safety, etc.) was also issued in 2012/2013. This new Part K now incorporates all that once was within Part N (Glazing Safety) comes into force, on 1.10.15..
* 2015 - Part Q ("security") comes into force, on 1.10.15.
* 2017 - Part R ("High Speed Broadband Infrastructure") comes into force on 01.01.2017.

==Approved documents and compliance==

There are currently sixteen parts (sections) to the building regulations (E &amp; W) and each is lettered as Part A to Part Q (however there is no Part I or N) accompanied by an ''approved document for that Part X''. The approved documents usually take the form of firstly stating the legislation and then providing a number of methods or ways which are ''deemed to satisfy'' the regulations.

The building regulations do not aim to stifle innovation, and each Approved Document's introduction states this Government Aim. Compliance with the legislation is what is ultimately required and there may be many ways of complying, other than just using the ways set out in the recommended provisions within each of the approved documents. In reality, an innovative solution may be hard to validate, and for most building work the tendency is to take the regulations literally.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

For example, bathroom manufacturers produce a 'Doc M Pack' for disabled toilets, which reproduces exactly the diagram in Part M,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebluebook.co.uk/static/18_3_1.asp?Specifying=&amp;digits=18:3:1 Doc M Standard Pack, page from manufacturer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and most public disabled toilets are now designed around this layout.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Many manufactured products have ''agrément certificates'' issued by the [[British Board of Agrément]] (BBA, a construction products certification service),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/ British Board of Agrément&lt;/ref&gt; certifying compliance with relevant standards. However, the BBA and other bodies (TRADA, BRE, Exova Warrington, etc.) may be able to test and certify to "CE" harmonised EU standards. "CE" marking of all construction materials and products is now a legal requirement, since 1 July 2013.

Most of the detailed information on the Building Regulations is now available on http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/ where general public users can access simplified building regulations guidance, and professional users have a better organised version of what was on the former DCLG building regulations website, including the full versions of the ''Approved documents'' and ''associated guidance'', held on the DCLG website (now a constituent part of the [[gov.uk]] website).

===Part A. Structure===

This Part requires buildings to be designed, constructed and altered so as to be structurally safe and robust, and also so as not to impair the structural stability of other buildings.

It stipulates design standards that should be adopted for use on all buildings and additionally gives simple design rules for most masonry and timber elements for traditional domestic buildings.

The weight of the building from the walls, furniture and people in the building will be transmitted to the ground, so as not to cause instability to the building or other buildings.

Requires buildings to be built in a way ensuring no collapse will occur disproportionately to its cause.

Ground movement such as freezing of subsoil will not impair the stability of the building.

'''The Party Wall, etc. Act 1996''' also controls walls and foundations being built near to existing buildings. However, it is "civil law" and is not enforced by Building Control Bodies.

===Part B. Fire safety===

The building regulations consider five aspects of fire safety in the construction of buildings:

'''Requirement B1''' - Means of early warning of fire and adequate means of escape from the building (including emergency lighting and fire exit signage).

'''Requirement B2''' - Control of Internally fire spread (linings)

The wall lining i.e. plaster, plasterboard or wooden boards on the walls and ceiling will resist the spread of flames and give off only reasonable levels of heat, if on fire.

'''Requirement B3''' - Control of Internal fire spread (structure) will be maintained during a fire, and fire spread will be prevented.

Fire and smoke will be prevented from spreading to concealed spaces in a building's structure by Fire Stopping and Fire Cavity Barriers.

'''Requirement B4''' External fire spread – The external walls and roof will resist spread of fire to walls and roofs ''of other buildings''.

However, Not all buildings are required to have non-combustible exterior finishes.

'''Requirement B5''' The building will be accessible for firefighters and their equipment, without delay.

Tall and Large buildings to have Fire Lifts and Fire Mains (Dry or Wet riser pipes), etc.

==== Alternative Means to comply ====

Using '''BS9999 : 2017''' for non-residential buildings

Using '''BS9991 : 2015''' for dwellings and other residential buildings

The use of a '''Fire Engineer''' to computer model the building layout and smoke behavior in such a building.

====Building Regulation 38====

This requires the designer and/or constructor to give the fire safety information (for a description of the information required – see Appendix G of approved document B) to the Responsible Person, upon completion. This is to enable a competent person to carry out a fire risk assessment.

===Other fire laws (England &amp; Wales and Scotland)===

Once a building is occupied the [[Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005|Fire Safety Order 2005]] requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the "Responsible Person(s)" for the building to provide and maintain "suitable and sufficient" general fire precautions. (Full citation is the ''Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005''). Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect.

The '''Fire Safety Order 2005''' is criminal law, and breaches of this law can result in the "Responsible Person" being jailed for up to two years and fined up to £10,000 for each offence. Corporate offences may have unlimited fines.

Enforcement is by the local [[fire authority]]. It may be necessary to exceed the recommendations of the guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b|title=Fire Safety : Approved Document B|last=|first=|date=7 December 2010|website=Building regulation in England covering fire safety matters within and around buildings.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting Part B of Schedule 1 to Building Regulations, in order to achieve a suitable and sufficient level of fire safety required under the Fire Safety Order 2005.

===Review of fire related building regulations in England, 2017===
[[File:Tower block with cladding exposed in Sheffield 2017.jpg|thumb|[[List of brutalist apartment blocks in Sheffield#Hanover House|Hanover House]], a residential tower block in [[Sheffield]], with its cladding partially removed after failing fire safety tests following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]].]]
Building regulations are technically under constant review by the DCLG (and are currently being urgently reviewed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety|title=Independent review of building regulations and fire safety - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of [[Grenfell Tower fire]]).  As following this fatal fire in London in June 2017, there is industry wide concern over fire safety issues with many other buildings{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.  Inappropriate combustible material combinations have been found on a broad range of tall [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|local authority]], private, NHS, educational and [[housing association]] buildings.

Combustible materials within the external construction of the outside of tall buildings must comply with the building regulations but this guidance has sometimes been interpreted as applying only to the insulation and not to the cladding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.  There are concerns that fire tests may not accurately reflect real life when a building, cladding and insulation are subject to wear and tear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40602991 Grenfell Tower: Government to review building regulations] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The DCLG has set up a weekly email newsletter for those interested in this topic.

===Part C. Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture===
Nothing should be growing on the ground covered by the building.

Precautions must be taken to stop gases and dangerous substances from previous land use from entering the building and endangering the health and safety of occupants.

Subsoil drainage will be in place, if needed, to stop the passage of ground moisture to the interior of the building and to prevent damage to the fabric of the building.

The walls, floors and roof of the building shall prevent moisture passing to the inside of the building.

The building must have provision to prevent condensation occurring in the roof structure.

Complaints arose in the Bristol area after [[2017–18 European windstorm season#Storm Emma|Storm Emma]] in February 2018 that the attics of more than 50 newly built homes had filled up with snow.  [[Barratt Developments]] and [[Redrow plc]] denied any liability, saying that “Lofts in modern homes are designed to act as home ventilators and to eradicate moisture and condensation issues. The vents are installed in order to comply with building regulations and as such the homes affected by the snow were not defective in any way.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Our ceiling could have caved in’: Families fuming after Bristol new-build homes fail to keep out Storm Emma snow|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/our-ceiling-could-caved-in-1314184|accessdate=10 March 2018|publisher=Bristol Post|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part D. Toxic substances===
Some Insulating Materials inserted into (existing) cavity walls can give off toxic fumes. Preventative measures must be taken to stop these fumes reaching occupants of the building. However now largely obsolete as injected materials are now mostly blown chopped fiber and not mixed on-site "chemical reaction" based methods.

See '''Part C''' for controls on toxic hazards from ''ground contaminants'' and/or ''brownfield'' development.

===Part E. Resistance to the passage of sound===

Approved Document E 2003 plus amendments 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_ADE_2003.pdf|title=Planning Portal|first=Planning|last=Portal|website=www.planningportal.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be read in conjunction with supplemental document 'Robust Details Part E - Resistance to the passage of sound'.

Separating floors and walls ''between domestic dwellings'' are required to meet a minimum sound insulation performance standard. This applies to both new 'purpose built' and converted 'material change of use' properties.
* Purpose built – the sound insulation value for each individual airborne test should be equal to or greater than 45&amp;nbsp;dB DnTw+Ctr. Each individual impact test should be equal to or less than 62&amp;nbsp;dB LnTw.
* Material change of use – the sound insulation value for each individual airborne test should be equal to or greater than 43&amp;nbsp;dB DnTw+Ctr.  Each individual impact test should be equal to or less than 64&amp;nbsp;dB LnTw.

New internal walls and floors within dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes, whether purpose built or formed by material change of use should achieve a minimum performance of Rw 40&amp;nbsp;dB when tested in a laboratory. Test data is to be taken from a [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service|UKAS]] accredited laboratory.

Pre-completion sound tests have been required since July 2003 to ensure compliance with Approved Document E, unless the '''[[Robust Details Limited|Robust Details]]''' approach is adopted, see Part L below. Testing is to be undertaken by a UKAS registered test organisation or European equivalent (e.g. ANC). A list of preferred UKAS accredited companies can be found at [http://www.ukas.org/testing/singlesearch.asp UKAS Organisation Search]. A list of preferred ANC accredited companies can be found at [http://www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk/index.php?*p=sitmembers www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk].

Care should be taken to ensure site conditions are appropriate before testing commences to ensure tests can be completed and that the best results are achieved.

===Part F. Ventilation===
Standards for ventilation and air quality requirements for all buildings are included in this part of the building regulations

Due to the increasing complexity of the Regulations, ventilation strategies and system design must be considered at the earliest stages of building design.

The Building Regulations consider three ventilation types:
* "Whole building" (formerly referred to as "background") ventilation to provide fresh air to dilute and disperse low levels of water vapour and other pollutants, usually by the provision of background ventilators or mechanical supply ventilation.
* "Local extract" (formerly referred to as "extract") ventilation in rooms where most water vapour or concentrated pollutants are released, usually by mechanical means such as extract fans.
* "Purge" (formerly referred to as "rapid") ventilation for the rapid dilution and removal of high concentrations of pollutants from occasional activities, usually by opening windows. The requirements for purge ventilation are set out in Appendix B of Part F1.

The performance rates for each of the "system" approaches set out in Part F are the minimum requirements needed to ensure that adequate air quality is provided for people indoors. The occupants' health could be at risk if these ventilation rates are compromised.

The performance rates do not take account of summer overheating.

Most systems may be manually or automatically controlled (with manual override).

For each system to be effective, air must be able to flow through the dwelling. The regulations make provision for this via internal door undercuts to maintain a minimum gap of 10mm above the finished floor surface. This provides a 7600mm² permanent opening when a door is closed.

There are alternative methods to achieve compliance with Part F. The following explanations are simplified versions of the most common methods of interpreting the "Systems" approach set out in the provisions section of the Regulation.

Background ventilators are now measured in equivalent area (mm² EA) which is a better measure of performance but does not directly relate to the physical size of the opening through the ventilator.
* System 1 - Intermittent extract fans and background ventilators
* System 2 - Passive stack ventilation and background ventilators
* System 3 - Continuous mechanical extract and background ventilators
* System 4 - Continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery

===Part G. Sanitation, hygiene and water efficiency===
Adequate sanitation facilities i.e. toilet.

A house must have either a bath or shower with the ability to heat hot water.

Unvented hot water storage systems – restrictions apply to who can install the system.

===Part H. Drainage and waste disposal===
An adequate system to carry water used for cooking, washing, toilet, bath or shower to a sewer, cesspool or settlement tank must be in place.

A cesspool or settlement tank must be impermeable to liquids and have adequate ventilation. It must also have means of access for emptying, not harm the health of any person and not contaminate water or water supply.

An adequate system to carry rainwater away from the roof of a building e.g. guttering carrying water to a sewer.

A place to put a wheelie bin or dustbin. The place must not harm anyone's health.

===Part J. Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems===

Must have an adequate air supply for combustion and for efficient working of a flue pipe or chimney.

Appliances shall discharge the products of combustion to the outside.

The appliance, fireplace and chimney shall reduce the risk of the building catching fire.

See '''Part B''' for general fire safety.

===Part K. Protection from falling, collision and impact===
Part K sets minimum standards for the safety of [[stairway]]s, [[Wheelchair ramp|ramps]] and [[ladder]]s, together with requirements for [[baluster|balustrading]], windows, and [[traffic barrier|vehicle barriers]] to prevent falling from floor edges, etc.

Glass and glazing safety is also covered. Also included are requirements for guarding where there is a risk of falling, pedestrian and vehicle barriers, and requirements to prevent injury from (opening) doors and windows.

Glazing that people come into contact with whilst in a building, should, if broken, break in a way unlikely to cause injury, resist impact without breaking or be shielded or protected from impact.

Buildings, other than dwellings that have transparent glazing which people come into contact with while moving around a building, must have features to make it apparent.

Windows that can be opened must be operated safely and provision made for safe accessible cleaning.

Part K also includes safety requirements relating to the use, operation, and cleaning of windows

Part K also includes safety requirements for automatic doors, barriers, shutters and gates.

===Part L. Conservation of fuel and power===

Approved documents '''L1''' is specific to dwellings and '''L2''' relates to all buildings other than dwellings.

As of 6 April 2006 (2010) (2014) split into four sections:
* L1A New dwellings
* L1B Existing dwellings
* L2A New buildings other than dwellings
* L2B Existing buildings other than dwellings

Part L controls the insulation values of building elements, the allowable area of windows, doors and other openings, [[air permeability]] of the structure, the heating efficiency of boilers and the insulation and controls for heating appliances and systems together with [[hot water storage]] and lighting efficiency. It also sets out the requirements for SAP ([[Standard Assessment Procedure]]) calculations and carbon emission targets for dwellings.

Regulation 16 requires the advertising of the SAP rating in all new dwellings, and in the '''EPC''' document.

Approved Document '''L1''' is supported by a set of 'robust' construction details, now known as "Accredited Construction Details".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/approveddocuments/partl/bcassociateddocuments9/acd Accredited Construction Details&lt;/ref&gt; which focus on way of limiting air leakage and thermal bridging in construction. By using these tried and tested details, expensive on-site testing can be avoided.

In addition to insulation requirements and limitation of openings of the building fabric, this part considers solar heating and heat gains to structures, it controls heating, mechanical ventilation and air conditioning systems, lighting efficiency, space heating controls, air permeability, solar emission, the certification, testing and commissioning of heating and ventilation systems, and requirements for energy meters.

Air permeability is measured by air tightness testing for new dwellings (based on a sampling regime), all new buildings other than dwellings and large extensions to buildings other than dwellings.

These four Approved Documents must be read in conjunction with the supplemental official and industry documents (the 'second tier' guidance documents).

====Energy Performance Certificate "EPC"====
All EPCs will be based on SAP 2009 calculations from 1 April 2011. It is highly unlikely that many dwellings built to Part L 2010 will be completed before 1 April 2011. However, in the event that any are, the EPC will need to be produced using SAP 2005.

Please note that all plots require a building control approval submission, and EPC regardless of how many identical properties are to be built in the same development.

====Part L new requirements====
Lighting, ventilation, solar heat gain and possible overheating will all impact on the potential to hit the 25% reduction target but until now have not really troubled the industry. As U-values falls (see table) and airtightness levels increases, heat loss through 'thermal bridges' becomes more significant. The new regulations give these issues more emphasis. They also require designs to avoid unwanted solar gains, leading to excessive summer temperatures. The need now exists to consider these issues at the design stage.

===Part M. Access to and use of buildings===
Part M requires the inclusive provision of ease of access to and circulation within all buildings, together with requirements for facilities for disabled people.

Buildings should have reasonable provision:
* For all people to gain access and use the building.
* Toilets provision shall be made available for all.
* If a building has seating such as audience or spectator seating, reasonable provision should be made for people with disabilities.

The [[Equality Act 2010]] imposed duties on service providers, schools and public bodies in relation to access for people with disabilities. However, the Part M approved document is not written as a means of ensuring compliance with these legal duties. It is written to ensure that the design of a building does not create physical barriers to a building's inclusive use, over its lifetime.

Part M of the Building Regulations relates to the 'Access to and Use of Buildings' and draws largely on the legislation covered by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and the [[Disability Discrimination (Employment) Regulations 1996]].

This document is particularly relevant to new build where such properties must comply. If in any doubt as to whether your alterations are affected by this document, the local building control department will be able to assist further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idealdoors.co.uk/|title=Ideal Doors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.idealdoors.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later alterations of a building must not remove or reduce its accessibility features.

=== Part N. Glazing – safety in relation to impact, opening and cleaning ===
Part N was Repealed in 2013 and these measures were moved into a new consolidated Part K in 2013 (See above).

===Part P. Electrical safety – dwellings===
{{redirect|Part P|the scientific journal|Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P}}
{{main|BS 7671|Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom}}
New rules for electrical safety in the home, the garden and its outbuildings. This part only applies to dwellings (in some cases, buildings that would be exempt but which take their electrical supply from a dwelling).
Several government approved ''competent persons'' schemes support Part P.

Reasonable provision shall be made in the design, installation, inspection and testing of electrical installations in order to protect persons from fire or injury.

Sufficient information shall be provided so that persons wishing to operate, maintain or alter an electrical installation can do so with reasonable safety.

Certain types of work require notification to the local authority for building control. In England this is only work within 'Zone 1' of a bathroom, and new consumer units and complete new circuits. In Wales there are more 'notifiable works' including wiring in kitchens and gardens. Installers who are members of an approved "Competent Persons Scheme" may carry out such electrical work without the need to submit many such formal building regulations applications, instead notification is performed via their trade body.

===Part Q. Security===
In 2015 a new requirement, Part Q, came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/approveddocuments/partq/approved|title=Security in dwellings: Approved Document Q - GOV.UK|website=www.planningportal.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part Q talks about security in a dwelling with reasonable provisions needing to have been made to resist unauthorised access to any dwelling or any part of a building from which access can be gained to a flat within the building.

===Part R. Physical infrastructure for high speed electronic communications networks===
Part R was introduced in 2016 and takes effect at the beginning of 2017. It requires "network termination points" in buildings to provide access to high-speed Internet via fiber or copper.

==Exempt buildings==

Exempt buildings include:
* CLASS I Buildings controlled under other legislation e.g. Any building in which explosives are manufactured or stored under a licence granted under the [[Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005]] or nuclear-related buildings or an [[ancient monument]].
* CLASS II Buildings not frequented by people (unless close to an existing building).
* CLASS III Greenhouses and agricultural buildings (not used for retail).
* CLASS IV Temporary buildings (erected for less than 28 days).
* CLASS V Ancillary buildings.
* CLASS VI Small detached buildings (garages, garden storage sheds/huts) (less than 30 square metres floor area with no sleeping accommodation therein).
* CLASS VII Extensions – porches, covered ways, conservatories, (less than 30 square metres floor area).

The Building Regulations 2000 have been amended five times since the original statutory instrument was published. A new consolidated edition was published in 2010 – the Building Regulations 2010. These have also now been amended five times since 2010. It is good practice to have exemption confirmed by the relevant local authority prior to starting construction works or alterations.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The latest statutory instrument gives the full conditions of exemptions (and any newly controlled buildings).

Crown buildings (national government buildings) are no longer totally exempt the Building Regulations. All Crown buildings must comply with the energy efficiency measures set out in Part L. This is due to EU laws requiring higher energy efficiency in all buildings (new and existing) under European "climate change" measures such as the EU [[Energy Performance of Buildings Directive]]. EU law requires public buildings to be "good energy practice" examples.

New energy regulations{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} have been made to fully implement these EU laws, where they fall outside the scope of the building regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8027">The '''Canada Agricultural Products Act''' (CAPA) institutes the [[Board of Arbitration]] and the [[Review Tribunal]], the decisions of which are cognizable by the [[Federal Court of Canada]]. Registered Establishments and Accredited Laboratories are under its purview, as are national Trade-Marks and Trade in agricultural products. It also enables the Inspectorate to search and to seize agricultural products.&lt;ref name=capa02&gt;[http://canlii.ca/t/hxzn canlii.ca: ``Canada Agricultural Products Act, RSC 1985, c 20 (4th Supp)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAPA enables the so-called ''Livestock and Poultry Carcass Grading Regulations'', a voluntary programme established for the better communication between retailers and consumers.&lt;ref name=ibg&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/retail-food/information-bulletins/beef-grades/eng/1331664546794/1331664630169 inspection.gc.ca: "Beef Grades – Retail Labelling &amp; Advertising Guidelines"], 2017-10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Now governed by the [[Canadian Beef Grading Agency]], the Canadian grading system began in 1929. Grade standards and regulations are now enforced by [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] employees. Significant changes were introduced to the grading system in 1992, 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref name=crmb&gt;[http://www.crmb.ca/beef_grading.php crmb.ca: "CANADIAN BEEF GRADING PROGRAM"], consulted June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The information collected through the grading process is used in making marketing and production decisions. Producers receive premiums for carcasses with a high grade. In 2016, the General Manager of the CBGA maintained that virtually all fed beef carcasses processed commercially in Canada were graded.&lt;ref name=brca&gt;[http://www.beefresearch.ca/research-topic.cfm/carcass-grading-41 beefresearch.ca: "Carcass Grading"], 26 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2016, there were 30 [[crop]]s, of which [[apple]]s and [[potato]]es were two,&lt;ref name=ip17/&gt; that came under the purview of the CAPA legislation.&lt;ref name=igca&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/fresh-fruits-and-vegetables/imports-and-interprovincial-trade/ministerial-exemptions-apples/eng/1352494295645/1352494372468#s1 inspection.gc.ca: ``Guidelines for Requesting and Administering Ministerial Exemptions for Apples''], 24 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Two executives of Mucci International Marketing Inc. and Mucci Pac Ltd. and their companies were levied fines by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency|CFIA]] tribunal that totalled $1.5 million. Their offense was fraudulently to put "Product of Canada" labels on large quantities of [[Bell pepper|peppers]], [[tomato]]es and [[cucumber]]s grown mainly in [[Mexico]]. The defendants supplied the mislabelled produce to [[Costco]], to [[Loblaws]] and to [[Sobeys]]. The fraud at the [[Ontario Food Terminal]] was discovered in 2012, and investigators later executed in 2013 and 2014 three [[search warrants]], which resulted in the seizure of more than 70 boxes of documents. A court in [[Windsor, Ontario]] heard the case. The agreed statement of facts quoted an email of a Mucci worker, that he was told "to make it Canada even though it is Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/it-says-product-of-canada-but-is-it-the-growing-problem-of-ferreting-out-counterfeit-vegetables financialpost.com: ``It says 'Product of Canada' but is it? The growing problem of ferreting out counterfeit vegetables''], 29 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The company, which was at the time located in [[Kingsville, Ontario]], was also sentenced to [[probation]] for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/kingsville-company-fined-1-5m-for-misrepresenting-products-country-of-origin-1.3621671 cbc.ca: "Kingsville company fined $1.5M for misrepresenting products' country of origin"], 8 Jun 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Apples are one of 30 domestically produced commodities whose trade is regulated the Canada Agricultural Products Act. The [[Canadian International Trade Tribunal]] ruled in 1995 that American dumping of a number of apple varietals "has caused, is causing and is likely to cause material injury to the production in Canada of like goods, excluding the period from July 1 to September 30 in each calendar year." As such, American growers are currently required to secure a ministerial exemption from the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] for bulk apple shipments. The CAPA was threatened in 2017 by [[President Trump]]'s renewal of [[NAFTA]] negotiations. Potatoes are another issue of contention under NAFTA negotiations: [[Canadian Horticulture Council]] trade chair Ken Forth told a Commons committee the CAPA "eliminate the potential dumping of large quantities of potatoes" that may not meet Canadian grade requirements. "Such dumping could severely impact the market price for high-quality Canadian products."&lt;ref name=ip17&gt;[https://ipolitics.ca/2017/06/27/forbidden-fruit-canadas-produce-industry-is-a-possible-nafta-target/ ipolitics.ca: ``Forbidden fruit: Canada’s produce industry is a possible NAFTA target'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2016, The maximum fine for an indictable offence under the Canada Agricultural Products Act was $250,000.&lt;ref name=pcom&gt;[https://www.producer.com/2017/03/ont-company-faces-legal-action-on-several-fronts/ producer.com: "Ont. company faces legal action on several fronts"], 9 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, a [[Maidstone, Ontario]] tomato processing company, that in addition had received a controversial $3-million provincial grant, was convicted of  fraudulently mislabelling products as [[Organic product|organic]] under the CAPA as well as other legislation. The owner and the company were also charged with falsifying the country of origin on their products between September 2013 and July 2015, passing off with labels that read "Product of Canada" produce that was American in origin. The owner was charged with lying to a federal food inspector on 8 January 2015. The case was heard in the [[Ontario Court of Justice]]. Separately, the company went bankrupt, owing more than a hundred creditors a total of over $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/thomas-canning-to-plead-guilty-to-mislabelling-products-as-organic windsorstar.ca: "Thomas Canning to plead guilty to mislabelling products as organic"], 12 Oct 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcom/&gt;

On 12 March 2018, a [[Leamington, Ontario]] greenhouse grower named AMCO Produce and its directors Fausto Amicone and Mark Wehby answered to charges brought by the CFIA for origin-of-vegetable fraud in a Windsor court. The corporation pleaded guilty to three charges under the [[Food and Drugs Act]], the [[Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act]] and the CAPA, and was fined $210,000.&lt;ref name=tpc21&gt;[https://www.thepacker.com/article/ontario-greenhouse-group-responds-amco-verdict thepacker.com: ``Ontario greenhouse group responds to Amco verdict''], 21 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals were let off in exchange for the guilty plea.&lt;ref name=ws13/&gt; The sentence included "intrusive" probation for a period of time under which the CFIA gains "unfettered" access to company records.&lt;ref name=ws13/&gt; The case began when the CFIA did in February 2013 a random inspection at the Ontario Food Terminal. Greenhouse peppers had been fraudulently mislabelled as Ontario produce at a time of year that was too cold for greenhouses to operate. The case covered offenses that occurred over a two-year span of time.&lt;ref name=tpc20&gt;[https://www.thepacker.com/article/canadian-company-fined-mislabeling-mexican-produce thepacker.com: ``Canadian company fined for mislabeling Mexican produce''], 20 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ws13&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/amco-produce-fined-210k-for-passing-off-foreign-vegetables-as-canadian windsorstar.com: "AMCO Produce fined $210K for passing off foreign vegetables as Canadian"], 13 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Competency Commissions''' were established by the [[United States Government]] in the early 20th century to determine whether individual [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] were competent to utilize their lands allotted to them during the [[General Allotment Act]] of 1887. Individuals who were determined to be competent were issued fee patents on their land. The lands of Indian allotees determined to be non-competent were leased by the Federal Government, often to non-tribal members.

While a fee patent gives power to the allottee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, provided the harsh economic reality of the time, lack of access to credit and markets, liquidation of Indian lands was almost inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It was known by the department of interior that virtually 95% of fee patented land would eventually be sold to whites (Robertson, 2002).

Indians who were determined to be non-competent often did not receive the income generated from the leasing of their lands. In 1996, the largest class-action lawsuit ever launched against the U.S. Government, [[Cobell v. Kempthorne|Cobell vs. Norton]], was filed on behalf of 300,000 [[trust fund]] beneficiaries who offered to settle for 27 billion dollars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31097">{{Property law}}
A '''covenant''' in its most general sense and [[covenant (historical)|historical sense]], is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action. Under historical English [[common law]] a covenant was distinguished from an ordinary contract by the presence of a [[seal (device)|seal]]. Because the presence of a seal indicated an unusual solemnity in the promises made in a covenant, the common law would enforce a covenant even in the absence of [[consideration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/def/c323.htm Covenant]. From the 'Lectric Law Library's Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt; In United States contract law, an [[good faith (law)|implied ''covenant'' of good faith]] is presumed.

A covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a [[contract]]ual [[terms and conditions|condition]]. The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant ([[American English|US]]) / positive covenant ([[England and Wales|E&amp;W]])) or not do some action (negative covenant). In [[real property]] law, the juristic term real covenants means conditions tied to the ownership or use of land. A "covenant running with the land", meeting tests of wording and circumstances laid down in [[precedent]], imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to [[easement]]s and [[equitable servitude]]s, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified;&lt;ref name="scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu"&gt;[http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2855&amp;context=wlulr Integration of the Law of Easements, Real Covenants and Equitable Servitudes]. ''Washington Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the US the [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Third) of Property]] takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez MV. (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1951138 Restating Implied, Prescriptive, and Statutory Easements]. ''Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Real covenant law in the US has been referred to as an "unspeakable quagmire" by one court.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas D. (2004). [http://scholarship.law.campbell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1407&amp;context=clr "There is a Porn Store in Mr. Roger's Neighborhood: Will You Be Their Neighbor? How to Apply Residential Use Restrictive Covenants to Modern Home Businesses"]. ''Campbell Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covenants for title are covenants which come with a [[deed]] or [[title (property)|title to the property]], in which the grantor of the title makes certain guarantees to the grantee.&lt;ref name=LegalDictionary/&gt;  [[Non-compete clause]]s in the United States are also called restrictive covenants.

Landlords may seek and courts may grant [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeiture]] of leases such as in [[leasehold estate]]s for breach of covenant, which in most jurisdictions must be relatively severe breaches, however the covenant to pay rent is one of the more fundamental covenants. The forfeiture of a private home involves interference with social and economic [[human rights]]. In the case of leases [[wikt:commute#verb|commuted]] to a large sum payable at the outset (a [[Lease#Leases of land|premium]]), this has prompted lobbying for and government measures of [[leasehold reform]] particularly in the law of [[ground rent]]s and [[service charge]]s.

__FORCETOC__

==Related to land==
In [[property law]], land-related covenants are called "real covenants" and are a major form of covenant, typically imposing restrictions  on how the land may be used (negative covenants) or requiring a certain continuing action (affirmative covenant). These may also "run with the land" (called a ''covenant appurtenant''), meaning that any future owners of the land must abide by the terms, or may apply to a particular person  (called a ''covenant in gross'' or ''of a purely personal nature'').&lt;ref name=LegalDictionary&gt;Covenant. (2008). West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2. Retrieved August 7, 2009, from http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Covenant.&lt;/ref&gt; Under English law, affirmative covenants typically do not run with the land; in the United States such covenants are examined more closely, but with exceptions affirmative covenants have been permitted to run with the land.&lt;ref&gt;New York has been one such exception; see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8919797924278132093 Nicholson v. 300 Broadway Realty Corp., 7 NY 2d 240 - NY: Court of Appeals 1959].&lt;/ref&gt;

The covenant may be shown in the [[trust deed (real estate)|deed]] and should be disclosed to prospective purchasers; it may also be [[recording (real estate)|recorded]], or in the case of [[Commonwealth]] countries shown in [[Torrens title]]. Real covenants and [[easement]]s or [[equitable servitude]]s are similar&lt;ref&gt;Schnably. [http://www.osaka.law.miami.edu/~schnably/EasementsandCovenantsRunningwiththeLand.pdf Easements, Covenants, and Equitable Servitudes]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717203839/http://www.osaka.law.miami.edu/~schnably/EasementsandCovenantsRunningwiththeLand.pdf |date=July 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1986, a symposium discussed whether the law of easements, equitable servitudes, and real covenants should be unified.&lt;ref name="scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu"/&gt; As time passes and the original promisee of the covenant is no longer involved in the land, enforcement may become lax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/cdonahue/courses/prop/out/OUTCovsExpanded.doc Expanded outline on covenants] Harvard Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covenants may be imposed through [[homeowner association]]s, and controversy has arisen over selective enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NeighborsAtWar.com Neighbors At War!], by Ward Lucas; Hogback Publishing (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, particularly in the United States exclusionary covenants were used to exclude racial minorities. Some covenants exist for safety purposes, such as a covenant forbidding the construction of tall buildings in the vicinity of an airport or one restricting the height of fences/shrubs at street corners (so as not to interfere with drivers' sight lines). Covenants may restrict everything from the height and size of buildings to the materials used in construction to superficial matters such as paint color and holiday decorations. In residential areas, covenants may forbid "dirty" businesses (such as [[feedlot]]s or chemical production facilities) or business use entirely, or modifications such as [[amateur radio]] antenna. Amateur radio restrictions have been particularly controversial; in 1985 the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] issued PRB-1 [[Federal preemption|preempting]] state and local restrictions, but not private restrictions; in 2012 after Congress passed a law requiring study of this issue (at the urging of amateur radio group [[ARRL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/payroll-tax-bill-includes-provision-for-amateur-radio-study |title=Payroll Tax Bill Includes Provision for Amateur Radio Study |date=17 February 2012 |work=ARRL News |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |location=[[Newington, Connecticut]] |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the FCC declined to extend this preemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2012/db0820/DA-12-1342A1.pdf |title=DA 12-1342 |date=16 August 2012 |author=Chief, FCC Wireless Telecommunications Bureau; Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some US states have enacted legislation requiring homeowners' associations to provide reasonable accommodations for amateur radio antennas under the rationale that amateur radio provides public service communications in the event of an emergency, major disaster, or special event.

In Canada, governmental authorities may use restrictive covenants as well as zoning. For instance, the city of Calgary's requirement that buildings in the general vicinity of [[Calgary International Airport]] be under a certain height is registered against virtually every title in the northeast quadrant of the city as a restrictive covenant, not as a zoning by-law.

===Requirements in US Law===
The covenant will typically be written in the deed, and must be in writing due to the [[statute of frauds]]. Although scholars have argued that some of the following should be significantly relaxed, in order for the burden to run with the land the following must apply:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/prop/prop33.htm Ch. 33 Real Covenants]. LexisNexis Study Outline.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The covenant must be in writing to satisfy the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]].
* The original parties to the agreement must have intended that successors be bound by the agreement.
* A subsequent owner must have had [[actual notice]], inquiry notice, or [[constructive notice]] (record) of the covenant at the time of purchase.
* The covenant must touch or concern the land. The covenant must relate to the use or enjoyment of the land.
* There must be horizontal privity between the original parties.
** Horizontal privity is found if, at the time the original parties enter into the agreement, those parties share some interest in the subject land independent of the covenant (e.g., [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]], mortgagee and mortgagor, or holders of mutual [[easements]]).  Individual state statutes can alter the requirements of horizontal [[privity of estate]]. Privity may be instantaneous and mutual; instantaneous privity is present when the restrictive covenant is within the deed initially conveyed from the grantor to the grantee.
* There must be strict vertical [[privity of estate]].
** Vertical privity characterizes the relationship between the original party to the covenant and the subsequent owner. To be bound by the covenant, the successor must hold the entire [[estate in land]] held by the original party (strict vertical privity of estate). Note that because strict vertical privity is required for a burden to run, a lessee could not have a burden enforced against them.  However, a benefited party could sue the owner of the reversion of the estate, and the owner could possibly sue the lessee for [[waste (law)|waste]].

===Enforcement and modification===
Courts interpret covenants relatively strictly and give the words of the agreement their ordinary meaning. Generally if there is any unclear or ambiguous language regarding the existence of a covenant courts will favor free alienation of the property.  Courts will not read any restrictions on the land by implication (as is done with easements for example). A covenant can be terminated if the original purpose of the covenant is lost. In some cases property owners can petition a court to remove or modify the covenants, and [[homeowner association]]s may include procedures for removing the covenants.

The covenant may be negative or affirmative. A negative covenant is one in which property owners are unable to perform a specific activity, such as block a scenic view. An affirmative covenant is one in which property owners must actively perform a specific activity, such as keeping the lawn tidy or paying homeowner's association dues for the upkeep of the surrounding area.

An agreement not to open a competing business on adjacent property is generally enforceable as a covenant running with the land. However, under the federal [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s holding in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', 334 [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 1 (1948), a covenant that restricts sale to a minority person (commonly used during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow era]]) is unenforceable, as enforcement would require the court to act in a racially discriminatory manner, contrary to the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

===England and Wales===
At common law, the benefit of a restrictive covenant runs with the land if three conditions are met:&lt;ref&gt;Gray et al., Property Law in New South Wales, second edition, p547&lt;/ref&gt;
* The covenant must not be personal in nature - it must benefit the land rather than an individual
* The covenant must 'touch and concern' the land - it must affect how the land is used or the value of the land
* The benefited land must be identifiable.

At common law, the burden of a restrictive covenant does not run&lt;ref&gt;Austerberry v Oldham Corporation (1885) 29 Ch D 750&lt;/ref&gt; except where strict privity of estate (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists.

The burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In ''Halsall v Brizell'' [1957] Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the successor in title to the original covenantor because he had elected to take the benefit. The rule in ''[[Halsall v Brizell]]'' is limited to cases where the benefit can be linked to a specific burden and where the covenantor's successors in title can physically elect to take the benefit. For example, a restrictive covenant to contribute to the maintenance costs of a common area will not be binding if the covenantor's successors in title have no legal right to use them.&lt;ref&gt;Thamesmead Town Ltd v Allotey (2000) 79 P &amp; CR 557)&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive burden can run in law, but not in equity, as it is deemed to be analogous to a contract, to which equitable principles do not apply (''[[Rhone v Stephens]]'' (1994)).

The burden of a restrictive covenant will run in equity if these prerequisites are met:&lt;ref&gt;Tulk v Moxhay (1848) 41 ER 1143)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The burden cannot be a positive burden (that is, it requires expenditure to meet it);
* The purchaser must have notice of the covenant
* The covenant must benefit the covenantee's land
* The covenant must be intended to run with the covenantor's land.

The leading case of restrictive covenants in equity is generally regarded as that of [[Tulk v Moxhay]] in which it was determined that the burden could run in equity subject to the qualifications listed above.

===In planned communities===
In contemporary practice in the United States, a covenant typically refers to restrictions set on contracts like deeds of sale. "Covenants, conditions, and restrictions," commonly abbreviated "CC&amp;Rs" or "CCRs", are a complicated system of [[restrictive covenants|covenants]], known generically as "deed restrictions," built into the [[deed]]s of all the lots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Evan| last= McKenzie| title=Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Governments| publisher= Yale University Press| isbn= 0-300-06638-4| page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a common interest development, particularly in the tens of millions of American homes governed by a [[homeowners association|homeowner association]] (HOA) or [[condominium association]].  There are some office or industrial parks subject to CCRs as well.

These CCRs might, for example, dictate the types of structures that can be built (e.g. a CCR may prohibit any type of modular, prefabricated, or mobile home, and/or may require the structure to be a minimum size), appearance (e.g. no junk cars), or other uses (e.g. no operation of home-based business, no pets except traditional household animals). The purpose of this is to maintain a neighborhood character or prevent improper use of the land. Many covenants of this nature were imposed in the United States in the 1920s through the 1940s, before [[zoning]] became widespread. However, many modern developments are also restricted by covenants on property titles; this is often justified as a means of preserving the values of the houses in the area.  Covenant restrictions can be removed through court action, although this process is lengthy and often very expensive. In some cases it even involves a [[plebiscite]] of nearby property owners. Although control of such [[urban planning|planning]] issues is often governed by local planning schemes or other regulatory frameworks rather than through the use of covenants, there are still many covenants imposed, particularly in states that limit the level of control over real property use that may be exercised by local governments.

===Exclusionary covenants===
{{Split section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Racial deed restriction.gif|right|thumb|250px|A Florida subdivision plat from 1926 with a racially-discriminatory deed restriction: "At no time shall the land included in said tract ... be occupied by any negro or person of negro extraction".]]
Before 1948, these covenants were legally used for [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins and Diffusion of Racial Restrictive Covenants'' Michael Jones-Correa Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 115, No. 4 (Winter, 2000&amp;ndash;2001), pp. 541&amp;ndash;568&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, covenants that restricted the sale or occupation of [[real property]] on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, or social class were common in the United States, where the primary intent was to keep "[[white people|white]]" neighbourhoods "white". Such covenants were employed by many [[real estate development|real estate developers]] to "protect" entire [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]]. The purpose of an exclusionary covenant was to prohibit a buyer of property from reselling, leasing, or transferring the property to members of a given race, ethnic origin, and/or religion as specified in the [[title deed]]. Some covenants, such as those tied to properties in [[Forest Hills Gardens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], also sought to exclude [[working class]] people; however this type of [[social segregation]] was more commonly achieved through the use of high property prices, minimum cost requirements, and application reference checks.&lt;ref name=Fogelson&gt;Fogelson, Robert M. (2005). ''Bourgeois Nightmares: Suburbia 1870-1930''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131–7}} In practice, exclusionary covenants were most typically concerned with keeping out African Americans; however, restrictions against [[Asian-Americans]], [[Jews]], and [[Catholics]] were not uncommon. For example, the Lake Shore Club District, in [[Pennsylvania]], sought to exclude various minorities, including  [[Black People|Negros]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], [[Greeks|Greeks]], and various other European ethnicities.&lt;ref name=Fogelson/&gt; Cities known for their widespread use of racial covenants include [[Chicago]], [[Baltimore]], [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[St. Louis]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

90% of the housing projects built in the years following [[World War II]] were racially restricted by such covenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.stetsonkennedy.com/jim_crow_guide/index.html|title=Jim Crow Guide: The Way it Was|last=Kennedy|first=Stetson|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Who May Live Where|chapter-url=http://www.stetsonkennedy.com/jim_crow_guide/chapter6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Racial covenants emerged during the mid-nineteenth century and started to gain prominence from the 1890s onwards. However, it was not until the 1920s that they adopted widespread national significance, a situation that continued until the 1940s. Racial covenants were an alternative to racially restrictive [[zoning]] ordinances ([[residential segregation]] based on race) that the 1917 [[US Supreme Court]] ruling of [[Buchanan v. Warley]] invalidated on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Correa-Jones, M. (2000). The Origins and Diffusion of Racial Restrictive Covenants. ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 115, No. 4, p543.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;Meyer, Stephen G. (2000). ''As long as they don't move next door: segregation and racial conflict in American neighborhoods''. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} 

During the 1920s, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People]] (NAACP) sponsored several unsuccessful legal challenges against racial covenants. In a blow to campaigners against [[racial segregation]], the legality of racial restrictive covenants was affirmed by the landmark Corrigan v. Buckley {{ussc|271|323|1926}} judgment that ruled that such clauses constituted "private action" and as such were not subject to the [[Due Process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;{{rp|31}}&lt;ref&gt;“1920s–1948: Racially Restrictive Covenants”, The Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston, http://www.bostonfairhousing.org/timeline/1920s1948-Restrictive-Covenants.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this decision, racial restrictive covenants proliferated across the United States during the 1920s and 1930s.

Even the invalidation of such a covenant by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1940 case of [[Hansberry v. Lee]] did little to reverse the trend, because the ruling was based on a [[technicality]] and failed to set a [[legal precedent]].&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;{{rp|57}} It was not until 1948 that the [[Shelley v. Kraemer]] judgment overturned the Corrigan v. Buckley decision, stating that exclusionary covenants were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and were therefore legally unenforceable.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;{{rp|94}}&lt;ref&gt;“1948: Shelley v. Kraemer”, The Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston, http://www.bostonfairhousing.org/timeline/1948-Shelley-v-Kramer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D. Gonda, ''Unjust Deeds: The Restrictive Covenant Cases and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement'' (U of North Carolina Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have attributed the popularity of exclusionary covenants at this time as a response to the [[urbanization]] of black Americans following [[World War I]], and the fear of "black invasion" into white neighborhoods, which residents felt would result in depressed property prices, increased nuisance (crime), and social instability.&lt;ref name=Fogelson/&gt;{{rp|97–8}} Many African Americans openly defied these covenants and attempted to "pioneer" restricted areas.&lt;ref&gt;"Moving On Out: Black Pioneering in Chicago, 1915-1950," Journal of Urban History 36:4 (July 2010), 485-506.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]) which outlawed housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1988, it was expanded to prohibit discrimination based on familial status (e.g. the presence of children) or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity|work=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exclusionary covenants today====
Although exclusionary covenants are not enforceable today, they still exist in many original property deeds as "underlying documents", and [[title insurance]] policies often contain exclusions preventing coverage of such restrictions. In 2010, it was found that more than 400 properties in [[Seattle]] suburbs alone retained (unenforceable) discriminatory language that had once excluded racial minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-08-03-racistcovenants03_ST_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Greg | last=Latshaw | title=Racism shadows property covenants | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples in U.S.====
* [[Forest Hills Gardens]], Queens, New York – covenants forbade the sale of real property to blacks, Jews, and working-class people.
* [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]], Queens, New York – covenants employed to restrict occupancy to white, non-immigrant Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Miyares, Ines M. (2004). From exclusionary covenant to ethnic diversity in Jackson Heights, Queens. ''The Geographical Review''. Vol. 94, No. 4, p463.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington Park Subdivision]], Chicago, Illinois – restrictive covenants used to exclude African Americans.
* [[Palos Verdes]], Los Angeles, California – covenants forbade an owner to sell or rent a house to anyone not of the white or [[Caucasian race]] ''or'' to permit African Americans on their property with the exception of chauffeurs, gardeners, and domestic servants.&lt;ref name=Fogelson/&gt;{{rp|15}}
* [[Upper Arlington, Ohio]] – covenants forbade the sale of real property to blacks or Jews, but  allowed for colored servants to reside in the homes in which they served.
* [[Guilford, Baltimore]], Maryland – covenants provided for exclusion against negros or persons of negro extraction.&lt;ref name=Fogelson/&gt;{{rp|65}}
* [[Kansas City metropolitan area]] (examples include [[Country Club District|Country Club]] and [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]]) – restrictive covenants used to exclude African American and "Semitic" persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article92156112.html|last=Thomas|first=Judy|date=2005|title=‘Curse of covenant’ persists — restrictive rules, while unenforceable, have lingering legacy|work=The Kansas City Star|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples outside U.S.====
Although most commonly associated with the United States, racially or ethnically restrictive covenants have been used in other countries:
* [[Canada]] – Subdivisions such as [[Westdale, Ontario]] employed racial covenants to bar a diverse array of ethnic groups, such as Armenians and foreign-born Italians and Jews.&lt;ref name=Fogelson/&gt;{{rp|103}} Opposition to exclusionary covenants was significant in Canada, culminating in the 1945 ''[[Re Drummond Wren]]'' ruling by the Ontario High Court which invalidated their use. This judgment was influential in guiding similar decisions in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, James W. St. G. (1997). ''Race, rights and the law in the Supreme Court of Canada: historical case studies''. Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press. pp204-205.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[France]] – During [[World War II]], under the [[Vichy regime]] in the [[Zone libre|Free Zone]] outside the [[Nazi occupation of france|Nazi occupied area]], some condominiums inserted clauses forbidding selling to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4442245&amp;ct=5851829|title=SWC: Reported Vichy-Era Statute Forbidding Côte d'Azur Property Sales to Jews Still In Force|last=|first=|date=23 March 2007|website=Simon Wiesenthal Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Africa]] – racial covenants emerged in [[Natal Province|Natal]] during the 1890s as an attempt to prevent Indians from acquiring properties in more expensive areas, and were commonplace across the country by the 1930s. They were later used as a tool to further the cause of [[apartheid]] against the black population.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, A. J. (2001). ''The Atlas of Changing South Africa''. 2nd Edition. London: Routledge. p181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zimbabwe]] – Asians and [[coloured people]] were excluded from purchasing or occupying homes in European areas{{when|date=March 2016}} by restrictive racial covenants written into most title deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Donald G. (1983). ''Race, ethnicity, and power''. London: Routledge. p109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title covenants===
Title covenants serve as guarantees to the recipient of property, ensuring that the recipient receives what he or she bargained for.  

;Outside of England and Wales
Outside of [[England and Wales]] the '''English covenants of title''', sometimes included in deeds to real property, are (1) that the grantor is lawfully seized (in fee simple) of the property, (2) that the grantor has the right to convey the property to the grantee, (3) that the property is conveyed without encumbrances (this covenant is frequently modified to allow for certain encumbrances), (4) that the grantor has done no act to encumber the property, (5) that the grantee shall have [[quiet enjoyment|quiet possession]] of the property, and (6) that the grantor will execute such further assurances of the land as may be requisite (Nos. 3 and 4, which overlap significantly, are sometimes treated as one item).&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Richmond v. Hall'', 251 Va. 151, 160, 466 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  The English covenants may be described individually, or they may be incorporated by reference, as in a deed granting property "with general warranty and English covenants of title...

;In England and Wales
Since 1989 the main covenants implied in England and Wales, on "limited" or "full title guarantee" are, (unless expressly overridden)&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 8(1)&lt;/ref&gt;:

#that the person making the disposition has the right (with the concurrence of any other person conveying the property) to dispose of the property as he purports to, and&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 2(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;
#that that person will at his own cost do all that he reasonably can to give the person to whom he disposes of the property the title he purports to give.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 2(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt;
#[In the case of a disposition of an existing legal interest] (a) where the title to the interest is registered, it shall be presumed that the disposition is of the whole of that interest; (b) [if unregistered and not leasehold, then the presumption it is of the fee simple]&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
#[If involving a lease] (a) that the lease is subsisting at the time of the disposition,&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 4(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; and
::(b) that there is no subsisting breach of a condition or tenant’s obligation, and nothing which at that time would render the lease liable to forfeiture.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 4(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Others as to charges, incumbrances, and third-party rights vary depending on whether full or limited title guarantee is agreed.{{explain|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dakshin Vrindavan'''( [[Tamil language|Tamil]] - தக்ஷிண் விருந்தாவன் ) ( [[Kannada]] - ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ವೃಂದಾವನ ), also known as "Care for Cows Dakshin Vrindavan Public [[Charitable trust]]" is a [[nonprofit organization]] registered in [[India]] for the protection of cows and bulls. The [[animal shelter]] is located at [[Chittur]], in [[Palakkad]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is the first [[Goshala|Gaushala]] in [[Kerala]]. Dakshin Vrindavan saves cows from slaughter houses and cruel transporters and protect them in their shelter. The trust  also maintain abandoned cows, bulls, retired oxen and calves in their shelter. Dakshin Vrindavan consist of volunteers who offer their talents and resources to tend to the neglected cows of India. It provides the cows with medical attention, clean water, lush pastures and lifetime accommodation. This charity was founded in the year 2013. This Gaushala is known to be the first and the largest Gaushala in State of kerala.&lt;ref name="Largest gaushala in kerala"&gt;[http://www.theweek.in/news/india/ensure-cow-protection-in-kerala-says-union-minister-ahluwalia.html Largest gaushala in kerala]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dakshin vrindavan KURMARUPA.jpg|thumb|263x263px|His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa, the mentor of Dakshin Vrindavan]]
The foundation of Dakshin Vrindavan was driven by Ashwin Sampatkumar's and Shankar Rama Varma's experience of visiting an [[Animal shelter]], Care for cows Vrindavan,&lt;ref name="Care for cows"&gt;[http://www.careforcows.org Care for Cows Vrindavan]&lt;/ref&gt; for welfare cows and bulls saved from slaughter houses in [[Vrindavan]], and the realisation that protection of cows is not a charity but a social responsibility . His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa, the founder of Care for Cows international, was instrumental in the founding of Dakshin Vrindavan. He personally Guided Ashwin Sampatkumar to open a shelter for cows. Ashwin Sampatkumar soon found his Mentor for life in His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa. His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa soon listed '''Dakshin Vrindavan''' as of the independent branches of Care For Cows International.&lt;ref name="Care for cows locations"&gt;[http://www.careforcows.org/locations Care for Cows International mentions Dakshin Vrindavan as an independent wing of Care for Cows International]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr Parasuram's keen interest in helping with the endeavor proved a catalyst in it growing into a vast volunteer network from a pet project.  Jaya parasuram (Mr Parasuram's wife), Girish Namboothiri, Ramesh K Varma and Prakash Srinivasan ( under the guidance of Shri. Thondanur Nambi Narayanan) were instrumental in founding and fleshing out the concept of Dakshin Vrindavan, and the seven of them formed a founding core around which friends, peers and the community came together to make the organisation a reality.

The first generation of Dakshin Vrindavan, started with the rescue of the first member of the shelter Balaram from a farmer who was about to sell him to a butcher, just because he was a bull calf, in 2013. Approximately 10 volunteers joined the cause, and a land was found out for accommodating the calf. The land belonged to a family who helped Dakshin Vrindavan a lot in the initial years . Then came the rescue of almost 5 cows and bulls from illegal transportation, which were also housed in that land and soon after which the organisation formally registered as a [[Nonprofit organization]].

From that point on, Dakshin Vrindavan grew exponentially. Many more rescue operation were carried out and abandoned bulls and cows were also rescued.

On June 2014, the Dakshin vrindavan team spotted a truck full of cows and Bulls in [[Mangalore]] which was on its way to slaughter house. The team intervened, sighted laws preventing slaughter of cows in [[karnataka]] and saved the cows. An astonishing eleven cows and bulls were saved from the rescue operation. This started the series of rescue operation done by Dakshin Vrindavan.

After few months of moving to the 10 acres of land, the Gaushala faced threats from Communist party as cow protection was against their party ideologies. The cows were relocated to a temporary land to ensure their safety.&lt;ref name="Gaushala in Palakkad Kerala Gets Death Threats, Relocates Temporarily"&gt;[http://www.hindupost.in/news/gaushala-palakkad-kerala-gets-death-threats-relocates-temporarily Gaushala in Palakkad Kerala Gets Death Threats, Relocates Temporarily]&lt;/ref&gt; The communist party workers threatened to kill the cows and conduct a beef festival if the gaushala is not shut down.&lt;ref name="Dakshin Vrindavan cow sanctuary threatened with violence in Kerala"&gt;[http://currentriggers.com/blog/dakshin-vrindavan-cow-violence Dakshin Vrindavan cow sanctuary threatened with violence in Kerala]&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently when the media approached the union Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare [[S. S. Ahluwalia]] also the National Vice president of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]],He was outraged and replied "This is not acceptable" " Gaushalas are constructed throughout the country under Article 48 of the Constitution. It is the duty of the Kerala government to take steps to improve the breeding of cows and bulls in the state and prevent them from being slaughtered. It should take action against the culprits in this case and let the Dakshin Vrindavan Gaushala function peacefully".&lt;ref name="Ensure cow protection in Kerala, says Union minister"&gt;[http://www.theweek.in/news/india/ensure-cow-protection-in-kerala-says-union-minister-ahluwalia.html Ensure cow protection in Kerala, says Union minister]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquiring land for cows==
[[File:New land.jpg|thumb|262x262px|The land acquired for Gaushala]]All these years cows were on leased land. In the starting years of Dakshin Vrindavan they were housed in the land provided by a family. But by the end of 2014, they were shifted to the land adjoining a temple near [[Nurani]] in [[Palakkad]].

10 acres of land was acquired on the banks of river Chittur by the generous participation of Mr and Mrs Sandeep Gopal, Mr and Mrs Balaji Krishnamachary Iyengar, Mr and Mrs Harish Sivarman, Mr and Mrs Santhosh Kovilakath, Mr and Mrs Sridhar krishnamoorthy, Mr and Mrs Chandru and Mr and Mrs Karthik Iyer and T.K Ramanathan. Dakshin Vrindavan has proposed a Gaushala for accommodating 150 cows with a budget of 50 Lakh Indian Ruppes.

==Building a permanent shelter for cows==
[[File:Gaushala Plan proj.jpg|thumb|334x334px|Rough plan for the new Gaushala]]All these years cows were on leased lands and the shelter made for them were temporary. Now that land has been acquired, Dakshin Vrindavan focuses on building the cows a permanent shelter in 1 acre of the 10 acre acquired. The estimated cost for the construction of this shelter is about 50 Lakh Indian Rupees.

Dakshin Vrindavan has started raising funds for this endeavor and expects the completion of this shelter by the mid of 2016.

{{refimprove|date=August 2018}}
'''Damnation''' (from Latin ''[[:wikt:damnatio|damnatio]]'') is the concept of [[Divine judgment|divine punishment]] and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth. In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian religious]] tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of [[Maat]] as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would be devoured by [[Ammit]]. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade through a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in [[Gehenna]] or [[heaven]] for their [[sin]] {{bibleref2c|Mark|3:29}}. A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in [[Hell]], or living in a state wherein they are divorced from [[Heaven]] and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In traditional Abrahamic [[demonology]], the [[Devil]] rules Hell, where he and his [[demons]] punish the damned.

Following the religious meaning, the words ''damn'' and ''goddamn'' are a common form of religious [[profanity]], in modern times often [[Semantic change|semantically weakened]] to the status of mere [[interjection]]s.

==Etymology==
[[Classical Latin]] ''damnum'' means "damage, cost, expense; penalty, fine", ultimately from a [[PIE]] root ''*dap-''. The verb ''damnare'' in [[Roman law]] acquired a legal meaning of "to pronounce judgement upon".

The word entered [[Middle English]] usage from Old French in the early 14th century.
The secular meaning survives in English "to condemn" (in a court of law), or "damning criticism". The noun ''damnation'' itself is mostly reserved for the religious sense in Modern English, while ''condemnation'' remains common in secular usage.

During the 18th century and until about 1930, the use of ''damn'' as an expletive was considered a severe profanity and was mostly avoided in print. The expression "not worth a damn" was recorded in 1802.&lt;ref name="Wood 1802"&gt;{{cite book |title= The History Of The Administration Of John Adams, Late President Of The United States |author= Wood, J. |date= 1802 |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofadminis00wood |page= 187 |lccn= 07013451 |oclc= 21065740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''damn'' as an adjective, short for ''damned'', was recorded in 1775. ''Damn Yankee'' (a Southern US term for "Northerner") dates back to 1812.

==Christianity==
{{further|Hell|Sin|Last Judgement|Christian eschatology|Universal reconciliation}}
In most forms of [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] belief, damnation to [[Christian views on hell|hell]] is what humanity deserves for its sins. [[Catholic]] and many [[Protestant]] denominations hold that human sin is the product of the [[fall of man]] of Adam and Eve in the [[book of Genesis]]. In some Christian denominations, only the sins that the [[Ten Commandments]] describe cause damnation, but others apply more strict terms. The reasons for being damned have varied widely through the centuries, with little consistency between different forms of Christianity (i.e., Catholic or Protestant). "Sins" ranging from murder to dancing have been said to lead to damnation.
Christian denominations have differing views on [[soteriology]], but a mainstream view is that believers can only escape damnation by salvation from [[Jesus]] Christ.

One conception is of suffering and denial of entrance to [[Heaven]], often described in the [[book of Revelation]] as burning in a [[Lake of Fire]]. Another conception, derived from the scripture about ''[[Gehenna]]'' is simply that people will be discarded (burned), as being unworthy of preservation by God.

In Eastern Christian traditions ([[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]), as well as some Western traditions, it is seen as a state of opposition to the love of God, a state into which all humans are born but against which [[Jesus Christ]] is the [[mediation|Mediator]] and Redeemer. Eastern traditions have established their views on Paradise and Gehenna from theologians like [[Isaac of Nineveh]] and [[Basil of Caesarea]] and the Fathers of the Church. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition theologians can describe God by presenting [[Apophatic theology|negative]] descriptions of what God is not, and describe Gehenna in similar ways.

==Hinduism==
In Hindusim, one of the three main acharyas, Acharya Madhva or Madhvacharya differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of [[eternal damnation]]. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, ''[[mukti-yogyas]]'', qualifies for liberation, another, the ''[[nitya-samsarins]]'', subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, ''[[tamo-yogyas]]'', who are condemned to eternal [[hell]] (''andhatamasa''). No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths.

==As profanity==
"Damn" is nowadays a mildly profane word in English, although "God damn" (or "Goddamn") may be considered blasphemous by religious people, who regard it as a violation of the commandment against [[taking God's name in vain]]. "Dang" (mainly US) or "darn" are common [[euphemism]]s, specifically [[minced oath]]s, for "damn".  The profanity of "damn" and its derivatives (e.g. "damned", "damnation") is effectively limited to cases where the word is not used in its literal meaning, e.g., "The damned dog won't stop barking!" (but the line of [[Arthur Miller]]'s character John Proctor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Arthur|title=The Crucible (play)|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; to his servant, "God damns all liars" uses the word in its literal sense and has not been seen as objectionable).  Use of the word or its derivatives in their figurative forms may impact on the ratings of movies and television programmes.

In [[Indian English]], there is an incorrect etymology connecting "I don't give a damn" with the [[Dam (Indian coin)|dam]], a 16th-century copper coin. [[Salman Rushdie]], in a 1985 essay on the dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms '[[Hobson-Jobson]]', ends with this:
:"'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a small copper coin weighing one [[tolah]], eight [[masha]]s and seven [[surkh]]s, being the fortieth part of a [[rupee]].' Or, to put it more concisely, a [[Dam (Indian coin)|dam]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Rushdie]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fApCKZT91kC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=frankly+my+dear+don't+give+small+copper+coin+weighing+tolah+eight+mashas+seven+surkhs+being+fortieth+part+rupee+put+more+concisely+dam Hobson-Jobson] essay, in the book ''Travelers' Tales India'' by James O'Reilly and Larry Habegger&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Denver University Law Review''''' is a [[law review|law journal]] published by the students of the [[University of Denver]] [[Sturm College of Law]]. It was established in 1923 as the '''''Denver Bar Association Record'''''. In 1928, the journal was renamed '''''Dicta''''' and in 1968 it was renamed '''''Denver Law Center Journal'''''. In 1985 the journal adopted its current name. The College of Law began co-publishing the law review in 1949 and became the sole publisher in 1966.

The journal publishes four issues per year, constituting approximately 1,000 pages of content. The review also hosts an online supplement featuring online symposia, previews of forthcoming articles, and student-written summaries of recent cases from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

== Candidacy ==
Like many law schools' law reviews and journals, first-year day and first and second-year night students may attempt to "write on" to the ''Denver University Law Review'' during its sole spring candidacy period. Traditional students must complete candidacy at the end of first year finals. Transfer students may attempt to write on immediately before the fall semester. Students who successfully join the law review have publication opportunities and take part in the law review's editing and publication process. Candidacy consists of a written case comment and a [[Bluebook]] editing exercise.

== Issues ==
The law review publishes four issues each year. The first and second issue have historically contained articles of general interest, although in recent years the law review has focused one of the first two issues around a specific legal theme.

The journal also publishes an annual 10th Circuit Survey examining recent developments in the law of the 10th Circuit, containing six to eight student comments on recent cases, and several introductory essays published by prominent 10th Circuit figures. In recent years, the law review has published introductory essays from Judges [[Timothy Tymkovich]], [[Michael W. McConnell]], and [[Marcia S. Krieger|Marcia Krieger]], as well as prominent scholars such as [[Dave Kopel]] and [[Marc Falkoff]].

Each spring the journal organizes a symposium that focuses on a developing legal topic, the proceedings of which are published in a special symposium issue in the spring.

The '''European Pirates''' ('''PIRATES''') or '''European Pirate Party''' ('''PPEU''') is an association of parties aspiring to be recognised as a [[European political party]] by the European Union. It was founded on 21 March 2014 at the European Parliament in Brussels in the context of a conference on "''European Internet Governance and Beyond"'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://europeanpirates.eu/programme PPEU founding &amp; European Internet Governance and Beyond - Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311021217/https://europeanpirates.eu/programme |date=2014-03-11 }}, PPEU
&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of [[Pirate Party|pirate parties]] of European countries. The parties cooperate to run a joint campaign for the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/institutional/115888|title='Pirates' to run joint campaign in next EU elections|date=16 April 2012|publisher=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding meeting elected [[Amelia Andersdotter]], Swedish [[Member of the European Parliament]] for [[Piratpartiet]], as the first chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/piratpartiet/pressreleases/europeiska-piratpartiet-bildat-975386]. euroelection.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's members elected to the European Parliament are in [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroelection.co.uk/article/greens_european_free_alliance|title=Greens - European Free Alliance|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ex factis jus oritur''''' ([[Latin (language)|Latin]]: the law arises from the facts) is a principle of [[international law]].

Cheng and Wilson were previously involved in [[Participatory Culture Foundation]], a nonprofit in the area of [[free culture movement|free culture]]. Initial funding for the organization was provided by [[Media Democracy Fund]].&lt;ref name="farrell" /&gt;

== Activities ==

=== SOPA and PIPA protests ===
Fight for the Future was involved in the [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA|online protests]] against the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and [[PROTECT IP Act]] in January 2012. The group was involved in coordinating the action in which a number of websites displayed messages advocating against the proposed bills.&lt;ref name="farrell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Wortham| first = Jenna| title = Public Outcry Over Antipiracy Bills Began as Grass-Roots Grumbling| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2012-12-14| date = 2012-01-19| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/technology/public-outcry-over-antipiracy-bills-began-as-grass-roots-grumbling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet Defense League ===
{{main|Internet Defense League}}
Fight for the Future has created the Internet Defense League as a means of coordinating possible future protests, similar to the ones it helped organize in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Sutter| first = John D.| title = A 'bat signal' to defend the open Internet| work = CNN.com| accessdate = 2012-12-14| date = 2012-05-29| url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/29/tech/web/internet-defense-league/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to WCIT-12 ===
Along with [[AccessNow.org]], the group has launched an online campaign opposing the changes proposed at the [[International Telecommunication Union#World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 (WCIT-12)|2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications]]. The organization believes the changes would threaten the openness of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McCullagh| first = Declan| title = U.N. summit rejects U.S., Europe hands-off-the-Internet plea| work = CNET| accessdate = 2012-12-14| date = 2012-12-12| url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57558887-38/u.n-summit-rejects-u.s-europe-hands-off-the-internet-plea/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reset the Net===
In response to reports of NSA [[mass surveillance]], Fight for the Future called for increased privacy protections on the internet to decrease the efficiency of surveillance efforts. The organization participated in a day of action on June 5, 2014 to protest NSA surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Zetter| first = Kim| title = New Movement Aims to ‘Reset the Net’ Against Mass Surveillance | work = Wired| accessdate = 2014-08-05| date = 2014-05-06| url = https://www.wired.com/2014/05/reset-the-net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership===
In the summer of 2016, Fight for the Future teamed up with musician [[Tom Morello]]'s label Firebrand Records to launch a Rock Against the TPP multi-city tour, featuring concerts, teach-ins, and protests of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kyle|title=Nationwide “Rock Against the TPP” Celebrity Concert Tour|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kyle-mccarthy/nationwide-rock-against-t_b_11556550.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 11, 2016|date=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality===
Fight for the Future organized The [[Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality]] on July 12, 2017 to advocate for [[net neutrality]].

== Controversies ==

Dr. David Lowery of the [[University of Georgia]] has accused Fight For The Future of being an [[astroturfing|"astroturf" organization]] funded by Silicon Valley interests disguised as a grassroots organization, and has documented large donations from what he unfoundedly refers to as [[shell companies]], claiming they represent corporations with vested interest in weakening copyright regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowery|first1=David|title=List of Corporations and Foundations Funding Astroturf Fight For The Future “Free Speech Graveyard”|url=https://thetrichordist.com/2016/05/12/list-of-corporations-and-foundations-funding-astroturf-fight-for-the-future-free-speech-graveyard/|website=The Trichordist|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=Source is full of unsubstantiated opinions and biases|date=October 2018}}

{{homicide}}
{{Violence against men}}

'''Fratricide''' (from the [[Latin]] words ''frater'' "brother" and ''cida'' "killer," or ''cidum'' "a killing," both from ''caedere'' "to kill, to cut down") is the act of killing one's brother.

It can either be done directly or via use of either a hired or an indoctrinated intermediary (an assassin). The victim need not be the perpetrator's biological brother. In a military context, fratricide refers to a service member killing a comrade. 

== Religion and mythology ==
Judeo-Christian religion recognizes the biblical account of [[Cain and Abel]], this fratricide was the first type of [[murder]] to be committed. In the [[Roman mythology|mythology of ancient Rome]], the city is founded as the result of a fratricide, when the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] quarrel over who has the favor of the gods and over each other's plans to build [[Rome]], and Romulus becomes Rome's first king and namesake after killing his brother.&lt;ref&gt;The political significance of the founding fratricide is discussed at length by [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995) ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mahabharata And The Ramayana===
In the Hindu epic [[Mahābhārata]], [[Karna]] was killed by [[Arjuna]] who didn't know that Karna was his eldest brother. Though not exactly fratricide the otherwise meticulously pious Arjuna's actions - where he pitilessly and against the rules of honorable warfare slayed an unarmed Karna - are nevertheless considered utterly deplorable and heinous. 
However, the context of the crime becomes markedly different when seen from the following angle:
1. Arjuna was oath-bound to avenge the death of his only son and heir apparent Abhimanyu who had been mercilessly slaughtered by a gang of bloodthirsty warriors which included Karna.
2. While Arjuna was blissfully unaware that Karna was his own blood-brother, the latter was apprised of the same by their common mother Kunti. And hence, even though he was privy to the bond of brotherhood, Karna still wholeheartedly (due to his allegiance to prince Duryodana) readily elected to indulge in fratricide. 
The 13th century poet, Kavi Kabila while commenting broadly on the [[Ramayana]] and on Rama's killing of Raavan with the active support of the latter's estranged younger brother Vibhisan - on whom Raavan had vowed black vengeance and on the killing of Bali (again by Rama) with the ready contrivance of his younger, disgruntled and banished, sibling Sugreev, has succinctly expressed this in a couplet:
"Irony? What Irony?! If not that the seed of destruction carried in the heart of one brother was sowed and reaped to the full by the hand of another!"

==Roman Empire==

The only known fratricide in the [[Roman Empire]] is the fairly well known murder of [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]] on the orders of his brother [[Caracalla]] in 211. The brothers had a longtime fraught relationship, and upon their father [[Septimius Severus]]'s death in February 211, they succeeded him as co-emperors. Their joint rule was very unsuccessful, and each of them kept conspiring to have the other one murdered. In December of that year, Caracalla pretended to be holding a reconciliation in their mother [[Julia Domna]]'s apartment, and Geta was lured to come unarmed and unguarded. Upon Geta's arrival, a group of [[Centurion]]s loyal to Caracalla murdered him, Geta dying in his mother's arms.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, "Caracalla"&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the fratricide would often come back to haunt Caracalla.

==Persian Empire==

There are many recorded fratricides in Persia. The most famous story is about [[Cyrus the Great]]'s sons where [[Cambyses II]] killed his brother [[Bardiya]]. Also there are stories about the sons of [[Artaxerxes I]], [[Xerxes II]], [[Sogdianus]] and [[Darius II]] where they fought for the throne. 
Also there were many fratricides in the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]].

==Ottoman Empire==

In the [[Ottoman Empire]] a policy of judicial royal fratricide was introduced by Sultan [[Mehmet II]] whose grandfather [[Mehmet I]] had to fight a long and bloody civil war against his brothers (which brought the empire near to destruction) to take the throne. When a new Sultan ascended to the throne he would imprison all of his surviving brothers and kill them by [[strangulation]] with a silk cord as soon as he had produced his first male heir. The largest killing took place on the succession of [[Mehmet III]] when 19 of his brothers were killed and buried with their father. The aim was to prevent civil war. Reflecting public disapproval, his successor [[Ahmed I]] abandoned the practice, replacing it with life imprisonment in the [[Kafes]], a section of the Ottoman palace.

== Mughal Empire ==
In the Mughal Empire, fratricides often occurred as a result of wars of succession. [[Shah Jahan]] had his eldest brother Khusrau Mirza killed in 1622. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Medieval India,|last=Mahajan|first=V.D.|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=81-219-0364-5|location=New Delhi|pages=126-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah Jahan also had his brother Shahriyar killed in 1628. Shah Jahan's son, [[Dara Shikoh]] was assassinated by four of his brother Aurangzeb's henchmen in front of his terrified son on the night of 30 August 1659 (9 September Gregorian).

==Antigone==

The events in the Greek tragedy Antigone unfold due to the previous war between the princely brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, who killed each other in combat. Polyneices had challenged his brother's claim to the throne of the city Thebes, and attacked the city with an army from Argos. Eteocles fought for Thebes to defend the city against Polyneices and his army. The two killed one another by each stabbing the other in the heart.

==Ashoka's Empire==

[[Ashoka]], also known as Chand-Ashoka (Cruel Ashoka), killed his real brothers as punishment for the kings's (his father) death and quarrel for the kingdom (war of succession). Later on, Ashoka conquered Greater India entire, before he adopted Buddhism and forsook war.

==In fiction==

=== Plays ===

* In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]], Claudius kills the elder Hamlet and marries his wife to take the throne

===Films===
* In the animated Disney film ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Scar (The Lion King character)|Scar]] commits fratricide on [[List of The Lion King characters|Mufasa]].
* In the religious horror film ''[[Mother!]]'', the older Brother commits fratricide on the younger brother, which is actually the retelling of Cain and Abel.

===Books===
* In [[Shahnameh]], the national epic of [[Greater Persia]], we can see many fratricides. Most famous story is about sons of [[Fereydun]], [[Salm (Shahnameh)|Salm]] and [[Tur (Shahnameh)|Tur]] commits fratricide on the younger brother, [[Iraj (Shahnameh)|Iraj]]. also there is other stories in this book. [[Rustam]], national hero of Greater Persia, and [[Aghrirat]], Prince of [[Turan]], have been killed by their brothers.
* In [[A Song of Ice and Fire]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has her brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] killed by her husband, [[Khal Drogo]], pouring molten gold over his head. [[Stannis Baratheon]] kills his younger brother [[Renly Baratheon]] with a shadow assassin, though Renly intended to usurp the throne and kill Stannis. [[Euron Greyjoy]] admits to his brother Aeron Greyjoy that he slew their oldest full brother [[Balon Greyjoy]], though not personally, and that he killed two of their half-brothers, Harlon Greyjoy and Robyn Greyjoy.
** Historically, during 'The Blackfyre Rebellion' Brynden Rivers slew his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre when he rose against their mutual half-brother Daeron II Targaryen. In [[The Hedge Knight]] Prince Maekar Targaryen accidentally kills his eldest brother Prince Baelor Targaryen in a trial by combat.
* In Dante's [[Divine Comedy]], Caina is the first of the four divisions of a Circle and takes its name from the first fratricide, the murderer Cain.
** In Canto 32 of Divine Comedy, Alessandro and Napoleone, sons of Alberto degli Alberti, lord of Falterona in the valley of the Bisenzio are examples of fratricide.

{{pp-pc1}}
{{USgunlegalbox}}
'''Gun laws in the United States''' regulate the sale, possession, and use of [[firearm]]s and [[ammunition]]. State laws (and the laws of [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[Territories of the United States#Current territories|U.S. territories]]) vary considerably, and are independent of existing [[gun law in the United States|federal firearms laws]], although they are sometimes broader or more limited in scope than the federal laws.

State level laws vary significantly in their form, content, and level of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] similar to the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], which protects the [[right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to keep and bear arms]]. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm |title=State Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Provisions|publisher=UCLA School of Law |date=2006|accessdate=November 23, 2011|first=Eugene|last=Volokh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/new-york/civil-rights/CVR04_4.html |title=New York Civil Rights – Article 2 – § 4 Right to Keep and Bear Arms |work=Law and Legal Research |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held in ''[[McDonald v. City of Chicago|McDonald v. Chicago]]'' that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.&lt;ref&gt;Liptak, Adam (June 28, 2010). [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/us/29scotus.html "Justices Extend Firearm Rights in 5-to-4 Ruling"], ''New York Times''. Retrieved February 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firearm owners are subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not exclusively their state of residence. [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|Reciprocity]] between states exists in certain situations, such as with regard to [[concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] permits. These are recognized on a state-by-state basis. For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so it is important to understand the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacarry.com/concealed_carry_permit_reciprocity_maps.html |title=U.S. Concealed Carry Reciprocity Map on |publisher=Usacarry.com |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, state firearms laws can be considerably less restrictive than federal firearms laws. This does not confer any ''[[de jure]]'' immunity against prosecution for violations of the federal laws. However, state and local police departments are not legally obligated to enforce federal gun law as per the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Printz v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;page=898 |title=Printz v.

{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y|limit=2}}

==Common subjects of state laws==

Firearm related matters that are often regulated by state or local laws include the following:

*Some states and localities require that a person obtain a license or permit in order to purchase or possess firearms.
*Some states and localities require that individual firearms be registered with the police or with another law enforcement agency.
*All states allow some form of [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]], the carrying of a concealed firearm in public.
*Many states allow some form of [[Open carry in the United States|open carry]], the carrying of an unconcealed firearm in public on one's person or in a vehicle.
*Some states have state preemption for some or all gun laws, which means that only the state can legally regulate firearms. In other states, local governments can pass their own gun laws more restrictive than those of the state.
*Some states and localities place additional restrictions on certain [[semi-automatic firearm]]s that they have defined as [[assault weapon]]s, or on [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]] that can hold more than a certain number of rounds of ammunition.
*[[Title II weapons|NFA weapons]] are weapons that are heavily restricted at a federal level by the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934 and the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] of 1986. These include [[automatic firearm]]s (such as [[machine gun]]s), [[sawed-off shotgun|short-barreled shotguns]], and [[short-barreled rifle]]s. Some states and localities place additional restrictions on such weapons.
*Some states have enacted [[castle doctrine]] or [[stand-your-ground law|stand-your-ground]] laws, which provide a legal basis for individuals to use deadly force in self-defense in certain situations, without a duty to flee or retreat if possible.
*In some states, peaceable journey laws give additional leeway for the possession of firearms by travelers who are passing through to another destination.
*Some states require a [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|background check]] of the buyer when a firearm is sold by a private party.  (Federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers, and for any interstate sales.)
*Some states have enacted  [[red flag law]]s that enable a judge to issue an order to temporarily confiscate the firearms of a person who presents an imminent threat to others or to themselves.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Guyana]] on 10 July 1978. The proposed change to Article 73 of the [[Constitution of Guyana|constitution]] would abolish the need for referendums to change the entrenched provisions of the constitution (including presidential powers, the dissolution of Parliament and the electoral system) and instead allow them to be changed by a two-thirds majority in parliament (which the ruling [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] had at the time).&lt;ref name=GJ&gt;[http://www.guyanajournal.com/rigged_referendum.html Rigged referendum] Guyana Journal, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It would also result in the postponement of the elections scheduled for later in the year, and instead the parliament elected in [[Guyanese general election, 1973|1973]] would be declared a Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p356 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill was passed by parliament on 10 April, with the referendum to be held three months later. The changes were reportedly approved by 97% of voters with a turnout of 70%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=gy011978 Guyana, 10 July 1978: Constitutional amendments of the Parliament] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the figures were subject to fraud by the government.&lt;ref name=N2&gt;Nohlen, p365&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition claimed that turnout was only between 10% and 14%.&lt;ref name=N2/&gt;

Following the referendum, the parliamentary term was prolonged and a new socialist constitution was written and promulgated in 1980.&lt;ref name=GJ/&gt;

The '''Legislature''' was the parliament of [[British Guiana]] between 1961 and 1964. A [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body, it consisted of an appointed [[Senate (British Guiana)|Senate]] and an elected [[Legislative Assembly (British Guiana)|Legislative Assembly]].

==History==
A new constitution was promulgated on 18 July 1961, replacing the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Legislative Council (British Guiana)|Legislative Council]] with the Legislature. The new body consisted of a 13-member Senate and a 36-member Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref name=P&gt;[http://parliament.gov.gy/GUYANA%20PARLIAMENT%20HISTORY%202009-1.pdf Historical information events and dates on the Parliament of Guyana from 1718 to 2006] Parliament of Guyana&lt;/ref&gt; The 13 members of the Senate were nominated, with eight nominated by the ruling party, three by the opposition and two by the [[List of Governors of British Guiana|Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter151.html The Constitutional Conference of (1960)] Guyana.org&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 36 Legislative Assembly members, 35 were elected in single-member constituencies, and the elected MPs then elected a Speaker.&lt;ref name=P/&gt;

[[British Guiana general election, 1961|Elections]] to the new Legislature were held on 21 August 1961. Both houses convened for the first time on 5 October 1961, when members elected [[Rahman Gajraj]] as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and [[Ashton Chase]] as President of the Senate.&lt;ref name=P/&gt;

Further constitutional amendments in 1964 scrapped the Legislature, replacing it with a unicameral [[House of Assembly (British Guiana)|House of Assembly]]. The Legislature was dissolved on 25 September 1964.&lt;ref name=P/&gt;

A referendum on a [[Constitution of Malta|new constitution]] was held in [[Malta]] between 2 and 4 May 1964.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1302 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 54.5% of voters, and came into effect on 21 September 1964. It was effectively a [[independence referendum|referendum on independence]], as the new constitution gave the country self-government.

==Question==
The question put to the electorate was "Do you approve of the constitution proposed by the Government of Malta, endorsed by the Legislative Assembly, and published in the Malta Gazette?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maltadata.com/ref-votes.htm Referenda in Malta: The Questions and the Voters' Responses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101516/http://www.maltadata.com/ref-votes.htm |date=2011-09-27 }} Elections in Malta&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Michelle Remembers''''' is a 1980 book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist [[Lawrence Pazder]] and his psychiatric patient (and eventual wife) Michelle Smith. A best-seller, ''Michelle Remembers'' was the first book written on the subject of [[satanic ritual abuse]] and is an important part of the controversies beginning in the 1980s regarding [[satanic ritual abuse]] and [[false memory syndrome|"recovered" memory]].  The book has subsequently been discredited by several investigations which found no corroboration of the book's events, and that the events described in the book were extremely unlikely and in some cases impossible.

==Background==
''Michelle Remembers'' chronicles Pazder's therapy in the late 1970s with his long-time patient Smith.&lt;ref name="MR"&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, Michelle |title=Michelle Remembers |publisher=Pocket |location=New York |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-671-69433-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Pazder first started treating Smith at his private psychiatric practice in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Macleans"&gt;{{cite news  |author = Paul Grescoe |title = Things That Go Bump in Victoria |work = [[Maclean's]] |date = October 27, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenegrat"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wenegrat, Brant |title=Theater of disorder: patients, doctors, and the construction of illness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] | url = https://books.google.com/?id=o5i5utgOjvgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2001 |page= |isbn=0-19-514087-7 |oclc= }}{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for [[clinical depression|depression]] (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided she felt that she had something important to tell him, but could not remember what it was.&lt;ref name="Wenegrat"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt; Over the next 14 months Pazder spent over 600 hours using [[hypnosis]] to help Smith recover alleged memories of [[satanic ritual abuse]] that occurred when she was five in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a "satanic cult" in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenegrat"/&gt;

===Summary===
The book documents Smith's memory of events recovered during therapy, documenting the many satanic rituals she believed that she was forced to attend (Pazder stated that Smith was abused by "the Church of Satan," which he states is a worldwide organization predating the [[Christianity|Christian church]]). The first alleged ritual attended by Smith took place in 1954 when she was five years old, and the final one documented in the book was an 81-day ritual in 1955 that summoned the [[devil]] himself and involved the intervention of [[Jesus]], the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]], who removed the scars received by Smith throughout the year of abuse and removed memories of the events "until the time was right." During the rites, Smith was allegedly [[torture]]d, locked in cages, [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]], forced to take part in various rituals, witnessed several murders and was rubbed with the blood and body parts of various murdered babies and adults.

After Smith had seemingly [[Repressed memory therapy|recovered her memories]], she and Pazder consulted with various church authorities, eventually traveling to [[Holy See|the Vatican]].

==Criticism and debunking==
Pazder was a credentialed psychiatrist and fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]], and the book states that its source material (therapy tapes) were scrutinized. However, questions about the accuracy of the allegations in ''Michelle Remembers'' were raised shortly after the book was published. Soon after the book’s publication, Pazder was forced to withdraw his assertion that it was the [[Church of Satan]] that had abused Smith when [[Anton LaVey]] (who founded the church years after the alleged events of ''Michelle Remembers'') threatened to sue for [[libel]].&lt;ref name="deYoung"/&gt;

In an October 27, 1980 article in ''[[Maclean's]]'', Paul Grescoe interviewed Smith's father, Jack Proby, who denied the allegations against Smith's mother, Virginia (who died in 1964), and claimed he could refute all the allegations in the book. Grescoe also interviewed the mother of a childhood friend of Smith who described Smith’s mother as a kind and charming woman. He also noted that the book failed to make any mention of Smith's two sisters, Charyl (younger) and Tertia (older), or that Pazder and Smith (both [[Catholic]]s) had divorced their spouses and married each other.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt;

By 1990, an article in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' exposed further inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations. ''The Mail on Sunday'' conducted a two-week investigation into the claims made in ''Michelle Remembers'' and found that other than Pazder and Smith, the people they interviewed described the events in ''Michelle Remembers'' as "the hysterical ravings of an uncontrolled imagination". In an interview with Jack Proby, Proby cited (as an example) "three specific points where … Michelle lied" in ''Michelle Remembers''. Proby indicated that although he decided not to sue, he did file a Notice of Intent to sue against the book's publisher should they go beyond the literary contract; thereby preventing the book from being made into a movie. ''The Mail on Sunday'' also interviewed the Smith’s childhood family doctor: "I believe it was … an over-active imagination"; former neighbors of the Probys: "I dismissed the book as crazy. The mother was a nice, gracious lady. A little girl could not have been tortured without someone hearing"; a former childhood friend of Smith: "Virginia was like a second mother to me. I certainly never had a bad feeling about her"; and her ex-husband: "Not once during their marriage or the birth of their daughter did Michelle ever mention her experience".&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday"/&gt;

''The Mail on Sunday'' reported that the local Catholic Church and Bishop [[Remi De Roo]] were also attempting to distance themselves from the claims in ''Michelle Remembers'': "He [De Roo] wants to distance himself from these people. More than ten years ago he asked the couple to provide him with details, but they never supplied all the information he required." ''The Mail on Sunday'' also reported the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] stated that there had never been a single prosecution in Victoria for satanic practices.  During the interview, Pazder was questioned about the truth of the claims in the book:
{{cquote|[The Mail on Sunday] asked Pazder: "Does it matter if it was true, or is the fact that Michelle believed it happened to her the most important thing?"

He replied: "Yes, that's right. It is a real experience. If you talk to Michelle today, she will say, 'That's what I remember'. We still leave the question open. For her it was very real. Every case I hear I have skepticism. You have to complete a long course of therapy before you can come to conclusions. We are all eager to prove or disprove what happened, but in the end it doesn't matter."&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday"/&gt;}}

A 1995 book found further inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations; the authors found no newspaper record of the car crash that the book describes in the time frame described despite the fact that the local newspaper reported on all vehicle accidents at the time. Former neighbors, teachers and friends were interviewed and yearbooks from Smith’s elementary school were reviewed and found no indication of Smith being absent from school or missing for lengthy periods of time, including the alleged 81-day non-stop ceremony. Ultimately the book's authors were unable to find anyone who knew Smith in the 1950s who could corroborate any of the details in her allegations.&lt;ref name="Nathan"/&gt;

A 2002 article by [[Kerr Cuhulain]]&lt;ref name="Cuhulain"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cuhulain | first = Kerr | title = Michelle Remembers | publisher = Pagan Protection Center | date = July 8, 2002 | url = http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=cabc&amp;c=whs&amp;id=4349}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only explored the inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations, but also their unlikeliness. Among other things, Cuhulain noted that it seemed unlikely that a sophisticated cult that had secretly existed for generations could be outwitted by a five-year-old; that the cult could hold rituals in the [[Ross Bay Cemetery]] unnoticed given that Smith claimed she was screaming and given that the Ross Bay Cemetery is surrounded on three sides by residential neighborhoods; that an 81-day non-stop ceremony involving hundreds of participants and a massive round room could have gone on in Victoria unnoticed; and that none of Smith’s tormentors (other than her mother) have ever been identified, especially given that some of them had cut off one of their middle fingers at the [[Black Mass]]. He also notes that during the alleged 81-day ritual, Michelle was confirmed to be attending school, with no remarkable absences and no apparent signs that she was being abused. Like other authors,&lt;ref name="Wenegrat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deYoung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan"/&gt; Cuhulain also noted that many of Smith's recovered memories appear to have reflected elements in popular culture at the time (e.g.: the movie ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'') and Pazder's own religious beliefs and experiences from when he was living and working in [[Africa]] in the early 1960s. Finally, Cuhulain hypothesized that Smith's motivation for making the allegations may have come from her desire to spend time with Pazder; though both were initially married to other people, they divorced their spouses and remarried each other after the publication of the book.&lt;ref name="Cuhulain"/&gt;

[[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], in ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'', wrote that ''Michelle Remembers'' "must be treated with great skepticism, not least because literally all the charges involved seem drawn from accounts of West African secret societies from the 1950s, imported to Canada."&lt;ref name="jameslewis"&gt;{{cite book|last      = Lewis|first = James R.|title = The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|year = 2003|page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=wpqKdDvLV0gC&amp;pg=PA233 233]|isbn = 0-19-514986-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wpqKdDvLV0gC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nichol Spanos has pointed out in addition to the lack of corroboration of Smith's memories, "skepticism appears warranted by the fact that some of these "memories" involve Michelle's encounters with supernatural beings."  Spanos also mentions that Smith's father and unmentioned two siblings contradict the allegations made by Smith, as well as Pazder's time in West Africa during a time when there was widespread concern over secret, blood-drinking, [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] cults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanos, NP | authorlink = Nicholas Spanos |title=Multiple Identities &amp; False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective |publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) |location= |year=1996|isbn=1-55798-340-2 |oclc= |accessdate= |page= 269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of evidence and inconsistencies surrounding the allegations made in ''Michelle Remembers'', there are still people who believe that Smith’s claims of abuse are the literal truth and that there is a vast, yet secretive worldwide conspiracy of inter-generational satanic worshipers abusing and murdering children and adults.&lt;ref name="Wenegrat"/&gt;

The book's contents have been unsubstantiated by any evidence beyond Smith's testimony.  Despite this, the book inspired copy-cat accusations throughout the world,&lt;ref name="Wenegrat"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurter&gt;{{cite book | last = Frankfurter  | first = David  | authorlink =  | title = Evil Incarnate: Rumors of Demonic Conspiracy and Ritual Abuse in History  | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]  | year = 2006 | location = Princeton, NJ  | pages = 60–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-691-11350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;{{cite book| chapter = The Assessment and Investigation of Ritual Abuse| last = Ney| first = Tara| title = True and False Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse: Assessment and Case Management| publisher = Psychology Press | year = 1995| page = 304 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BggJjhbBJzwC&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 9780876307588}}&lt;/ref&gt; against members of the [[Church of Satan]], other [[occult]]ists, and others with no connection to the occult.&lt;ref name="Aquino"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Aquino |isbn=0-919345-86-7 |title=Witchcraft, Satanism &amp; Occult Crime: Who's Who &amp; What's What, a Manual of Reference Materials for the Professional Investigator |url=http://www.holysmoke.org/sdhok/sat33.htm |format=reprint |publisher=Phoenix Pub |date=1994-01-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827051451/http://www.holysmoke.org/sdhok/sat33.htm |archivedate=2015-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Witchcraft in City''===

An appendix reprints the article "Witchcraft in City' Claim" by Paul Jeune; the article was referenced by Smith in the book in reference to the alleged [[black magic]] practised in Victoria. An [[evangelism|evangelist]] named Len Olsen claimed on televangelist [[David Mainse]]'s talk show ''[[100 Huntley Street]]'' that he and his wife were nearly [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in a satanic ritual by Mark Fedoruk, also known as Lion Serpent Sun.  Sun sued for [[defamation]], and in court it was revealed that Olsen had been delusional, apparently due to drug use and guilt; Sun was awarded $10,000 and an [[appeal]] was denied.  The lawsuit and result were not reported in ''Michelle Remembers,'' only the original [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crockford | first = R | year = 2006 | title =  Victoria: The Unknown City | publisher = [[Arsenal Pulp Press]] | page = 198 | isbn = 1-55152-195-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last2 = Ennis | first2 = Charles A | url = http://www.unsolvedmysteries.com/usm271496.html | last1 = Cuhulain | first1 = K | authorlink = Kerr Cuhulain | date = 2002-07-13 | title = Michelle Remembers- False "Survivor" Story of Satanic Abuse | accessdate = 2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Michelle Remembers'' was first publicized with articles in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and the ''[[National Enquirer]]''.&lt;ref name="deYoung"/&gt; In 1980, Pazder and Smith toured the United States to promote the book.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt;  Ultimately a publishing success, the book earned Pazder and Smith a $100,000 hard-cover advance, $242,000 for paperback rights, royalties, and a potential movie deal.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deYoung"&gt;{{cite book |author=de Young, Mary | authorlink = Mary de Young |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C |year=2004 |page= |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 |oclc= | url = https://books.google.com/?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate = 2008-10-20}}{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Grescoe article (see Criticism section) did not garner much attention and the allegations in ''Michelle Remembers'' were still considered by many in the early 1980s to be true. As a result, Pazder was considered to be an expert in the area of satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden emergence of satanic ritual abuse cases in the 1980s (likely due in part to the publication of ''Michelle Remembers'')&lt;ref name="Nathan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nathan|first=D |authorlink=Debbie Nathan|author2=Snedeker, M. | title=Satan's Silence: Ritual Abuse and the Making of a Modern American Witch Hunt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVVsAAAAIAAJ&amp;q |year=1995 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=0-87975-809-0 | pages = }}{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis, Bill |title=Raising the devil: Satanism, new religions, and the media |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2000 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 62]|isbn=0-8131-2170-1 |oclc= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pazder's expertise was called upon. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the [[McMartin preschool trial]] which featured allegations of satanic ritual abuse.&lt;ref name="Nathan"/&gt; Pazder also appeared on the first major news report on satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]’s ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Devil Worshippers | work =  | publisher = ABC News 20/20 transcript, show #521 | pages = 6–7 | date = May 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pazder was part of the Cult Crime Impact Network and lectured to police agencies about satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on satanic ritual abuse cases.&lt;ref name="Nathan"/&gt; By September 1990, Pazder had been consulted "in more than 1,000 'ritual abuse' cases".&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday"&gt;{{cite news |author = Denna Allen and Janet Midwinter |url = http://www.xeper.org/pub/lib/xp_lib_wh_DebunkingOfAMyth.htm |title = Michelle Remembers: The Debunking of a Myth |work = [[The Mail on Sunday]] |date = September 30, 1990 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040511131253/http://xeper.org/pub/lib/xp_lib_wh_DebunkingOfAMyth.htm |archivedate = May 11, 2004 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With people suddenly being prosecuted for satanic ritual abuse, prosecutors used the book as a guide when preparing cases against alleged satanists.&lt;ref name="Commercial Appeal"&gt;{{cite news |author = Shirley Downing and Tom Charlier |title = Justice Aborted:  A 1980s Witch-Hunt |publisher = [[The Commercial Appeal]] |date = January 17–23, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the start of the [[Kern County child abuse cases]] several local social workers had attended a training seminar that listed satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse and used ''Michelle Remembers'' as training material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324024950/http://members.shaw.ca:80/imaginarycrimes/michelleremembers.htm|title=Michelle Remembers: Fiction, not Fact|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19622">The '''Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)''' is a set of international guidelines for the investigation of suspicious deaths, particularly those in which the responsibility of a State is suspected (either as a result of act or omission).

The original version of the Protocol, from 1991, was entitled the '''Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions'''. It was designed to support the implementation of the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which were endorsed by the United Nations in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extrajudicial Arbitrary and Summary Executions (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The Manual became known as the Minnesota Protocol because of the central role played by the Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee in its development. The use of the term ‘Protocol’ reflects the forensic medicine element of the document rather than its legal status. In 2016, after a two-year process of revision, the new version of Minnesota Protocol was finalized by an international group of experts convened by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR).&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns: Addendum'' A/HRC/32/39/Add.4 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The revised version was published by the OHCHR in 2017.

==Background==

The original Minnesota Protocol was designed to be a technical document aimed at providing practical assistance to those investigating suspicious deaths. Confronting the question of how to address political killings during the mid-1980s, various civil society groups came to the conclusion that criminal investigation techniques were an obvious starting place.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Clark ''Diplomacy of Conscience: Amnesty International and the Changing of Human Rights Norms'' (Princeton, 2001) p.113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Amnesty International carried out its own survey of how various States dealt with autopsies of arbitrary killings. [[David Weissbrodt]], a professor at the University of Minnesota, was spending a sabbatical in the Legal Office of Amnesty International in 1982-3, which was when the idea for a Manual arose.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Clark ''Diplomacy of Conscience: Amnesty International and the Changing of Human Rights Norms'' (Princeton, 2001) p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for some kind of standard was highlighted by the [[assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.]] in August 1983. Despite public declarations of intent, the Government of the Philippines failed to conduct an adequate investigation. However, as Ann Marie Clark has subsequently observed: ‘At that time there were no internationally standardized death investigations procedures. There was no external norm, therefore, that could be used as a basis for criticism when governments failed to implement proper investigation of political killings in a case like the death of Aquino’&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Clark ''Diplomacy of Conscience: Amnesty International and the Changing of Human Rights Norms'' (Princeton, 2001) p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately the Protocol was prepared by a group of legal and forensic experts coordinated by the Minnesota International Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (now The Advocates for Human Rights), in collaboration with the Science and Human Rights Program of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns: Addendum'' A/HRC/32/39/Add.4 (2016) para.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several resolutions, the UN Commission for Human Rights mandated the OHCHR to update the Protocol. These resolutions were later quoted by the Human Rights Council in resolutions on forensic genetics and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;UN Commission on Human Rights Resolutions 1998/36, 2000/32, 2003/33, and 2005/26 and UN Human Rights Council Resolutions 10/26, and 15/5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Special Rapporteur on summary executions, [[Christof Heyns]], began a process of consulting relevant experts and, in collaboration with OHCHR and UNODC, bringing together a large group that would ultimately participate in the revision of the Minnesota Protocol. In 2015, in his report to the General Assembly, he noted that ‘[t]he extent of the continued reliance on the Manual in international jurisprudence and by national legal entities emphasizes the need for the document to be up to date and comprehensive. It is to be expected that if the document is more up to date, it will more often and more readily serve as a guide.’&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns'' A/70/304 (2015) para.61&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, two Working Groups, and a large international Advisory Panel undertook the revision, including with reference to two stakeholder consultations. As with the original version, the authority of the document relied upon the expertise of these drafting and review groups. Certain individuals had been involved in the processes of drafting both the original and the revised texts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theadvocatespost.org/2016/02/26/minnestota_protocol/ The Minnesota Protocol] ''The Advocates Post'' blogpost by Jennifer Prestholdt (26 February 2016) [accessed June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The finalized document was presented to the OHCHR in July 2016, and published in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21661&amp;LangID=E UN rights office launches global guidelines for investigating unlawful killings] OHCHR press release [accessed June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of the Protocol==
Announcing its release, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights highlighted that ‘Proper investigations into suspicious deaths are an integral part of the protection of the right to life’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21661&amp;LangID=E UN rights office launches global guidelines for investigating unlawful killings] OHCHR press release [accessed June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional human rights courts have referred to the Manual in reaching findings on the inadequacy of investigations into suspicious deaths.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, European Court of Human Rights, ''Nachova and other v. Bulgaria'' (applications Nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98), 6 July 2005; European Court of Human Rights, ''Finucane v. the United Kingdom'', application No. 29178/95, 1 July 2003 and 1 October 2003; Inter-American Court of Human Rights, ''Gonzalez et al. v Mexico'', case No. 281/02, 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; National courts have done the same when establishing guidelines for the investigation of killings by the police.&lt;ref&gt;See Supreme Court of India, Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction, ''People’s Union for Civil Liberties &amp; Anr. v. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors.'' (Criminal Appeal No. 1255 of 1999), 23 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) relied on the Principles and the Manual in its Study on customary international humanitarian law: a contribution to the understanding and respect for the rule of law in armed conflict (2005) and in its Guidelines for Investigating Deaths in Custody (2013).

The Minnesota Protocol is often grouped with another document with a similar medico-legal and human rights purpose, the [[Istanbul Protocol]], which is aimed at the documentation of torture. In his report to the UN General Assembly in 2014, the Special Rapporteur on torture, [[Juan E. Méndez]], encouraged the use of both documents when performing forensic autopsies, and highlighted capacity gaps in forensic services as contributing to lack of accountability for serious human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. Méndez'', A/69/287 (2014) paras.34-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of use==
The Minnesota Protocol aims to protect the right to life by promoting effective investigation of potentially unlawful death or suspected enforced disappearance. It sets common standards of
performance and a shared set of principles and guidelines for States, as well as for institutions and individuals who play a role in investigations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minnesota Protocol applies to investigations of all “potentially unlawful death”. This primarily includes situations where:

# the death may have been caused by acts or omissions of the State, its organs or agents, or may otherwise be attributable to the State, in violation of its duty to respect the right to life; 
# the death occurred when a person was detained by, or was in the custody of, the State, its organs, or agents; or
# the death occurred where the State may have failed to meet its obligations to protect life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol makes clear that protecting of the right to life means preventing the arbitrary deprivation of life, but also requires accountability for an arbitrary deprivation of life whenever it occurs. Therefore, in addition to their duties to respect and to protect the right to life, States must also investigate potentially unlawful death, ensure accountability and remedy violations. The Protocol states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The duty to investigate is an essential part of upholding the right to life. […] Where an investigation reveals evidence that a death was caused unlawfully, the State must ensure that identified perpetrators are prosecuted and, where appropriate, punished through a judicial process. […] A failure to respect the duty to investigate is a breach of the right to life. Investigations and prosecutions are essential to deter future violations and to promote accountability, justice, the rights to remedy and to the truth, and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to its scope, the Protocol also clearly establishes the “trigger” for the State’s duty to investigate, namely where the it knows or should have known of any potentially unlawful death, including where reasonable allegations of a potentially unlawful death are made.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.15&lt;/ref&gt; As the Protocol details, this includes all cases where the State has caused a death or where it is alleged or suspected that the State caused a death (for example, where law enforcement officers used force that may have contributed to the death) or where the State has failed to exercise due diligence to prevent a death at the hands of a third party. In all cases outside the conduct of hostilities in an armed conflict, this duty exists regardless of whether it is suspected or alleged that the death was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.16&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Protocol offers a particular note on the duty to investigate during the conduct of hostilities, which it highlights as a context that may provide practical difficulties for the application of much of the Protocol’s content. All suspected war crimes must be investigated. But the Protocol also emphasizes that, where, during the conduct of hostilities, it appears that casualties have resulted from an attack, a post-operation assessment should be conducted to establish the facts, including the accuracy of the targeting.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.21&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the Protocol also highlights that the State also has a duty to investigate all potentially unlawful death caused by private individuals, even if the State cannot be held responsible for failing to prevent such deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol also establishes standards for what it calls the ‘Elements and Principles of Investigations’, broadly that they should be
* Prompt 
* Effective and thorough 
* Independent and Impartial 
* Transparent &lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) paras.23-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol is explicitly non-prescriptive with respect to investigative mechanisms, noting that the duty to investigate does not necessarily require one particular investigative mechanism in preference to another. States may use a wide range of mechanisms, as determined or suggested by domestic law and practice, as long as those mechanisms meet international law requirements.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting an investigation==
The bulk of the Minnesota Protocol provides first strategies and principles and then detailed guidelines on practical steps that should be taken in an effective investigation. The overarching strategy of any investigation should be methodical and transparent, and all legitimate lines of inquiry should be pursued. An investigation may gather different types of material, not all of which will be used as evidence in a judicial proceeding. But all relevant materials or observations should be secured and logged.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) paras.48-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol establishes that a set of operational and tactical processes for the investigation should also be designed. These should seek to establish significant facts, preserve relevant material and lead to the identification of all the parties involved, including by managing the following:

* Collection, analysis and management of evidence, data and materials
* Forensic examination of important physical locations, including the death/crime scene 
* Family liaison
* Development of a victim profile
* Finding, interviewing and protecting witnesses
* International technical assistance
* Telecommunications and other digital evidence
* Financial issues
* Chronology of events&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular sections are dedicated to processes for interviewing witnesses and for recovering human remains.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) §IV.C &amp; §IV.D&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol then provides a great deal of detail attesting both to the importance of, and practical guidance for, the identification of human remains.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) §IV.E&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular guidance is offered on the techniques for collecting and sampling different types of evidence, including the following:

* Human biological evidence 
* Non-biological physical evidence
* Digital evidence 
* Forensic accounting
* Soil/environmental samples&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) §IV.F&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of potentially unlawful deaths will almost always be aided by the conduct of an [[autopsy]]. In a section setting out the general principles of an autopsy the Protocol provides an overview of the duties of a forensic doctor in relation to a death investigation, and then establishes the basic aims of autopsy will assist in fulfilling those duties.  The aims of the autopsy, principally are:

* discover and record all the identifying characteristics of the deceased (where necessary); 
* discover and record all the pathological processes, including injuries, present; 
* draw conclusions about the identity of the deceased (where necessary); and 
* draw conclusions as to the cause of death and factors contributing to death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.149&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the Protocol establishes in various places the requirement of professional ethics for investigators, including forensic doctors.  It highlights that any forensic doctor involved in an investigation has responsibilities to justice, to the relatives of the deceased, and more generally to the public. Whether or not they are employed by the police or the State, forensic doctors must understand their obligations to justice (not to the police or the State) and to the relatives of the deceased, so that a true account is provided of the cause of death and the circumstances surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)'', Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, (New York/Geneva, 2017) para.44&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[List of unrecognized countries|unrecognised country]] of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]] on 10 December 2006 to approve a draft [[constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defacto.am/index.php?OP=71319645 www.defacto.am&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which defined Nagorno-Karabakh as a sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=20271 Karabakh Ahead of Many Neighboring States on Democratic Values], ''[[Pan-Armenian]]'', 2006-12-04 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Azerbaijan]] condemned the referendum, saying it is an unconstitutional attempt to damage the peace process. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.today.az/news/politics/33428.html Constitution referendum in Nagorno Karabakh is aimed at damaging peace process], ''Today.AZ'', 2006-12-02 &lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution was approved by 99.28% of voters, with a turnout of 87%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=az012006 Berg-Karabach (Aserbeidschan), 10. Dezember 2006 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">The '''Naval Clemency and Parole Board (NC&amp;PB)''' is a board established by the [[United States Department of the Navy]] to serve as executive agent for the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] to decide questions of [[clemency]] and [[parole]] for members of the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] who are convicted by a [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]] for a violation of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].  It is located at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].

The Navy Clemency and Parole Board was established by SECNAVINST 5815_3J.  

NC&amp;PB hearings are non-adversarial. The NC&amp;PB is not the final say, and can ultimately be overridden by the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary takes special interest in cases involving an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] or a [[midshipman]] or issues of [[national security]].  In certain other cases, the NC&amp;PB only makes recommendations to the Secretary, specifically issues where (1) any offense carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years or more; (2) any offense involving a victim under 16 years of age or the offender's spouse; and (3) cases where a release might lead to [[United States Congress|Congressional]] or [[Media of the United States|media]] interest.

The NV&amp;PB is a member of the [[Secretary of the Navy Council of Review Boards]] and is overseen by the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)]].

'''''The North Carolina Journal of International Law''''' (ILJ) is a student-run [[law journal]] at the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].  Now in its [http://www.law.unc.edu/journals/ncilj/masthead/ 41st year of publication], ILJ is dedicated to stimulating the intellectual climate through legal scholarship in the area of international and foreign law.  It is the second-oldest law journal at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] behind [[North Carolina Law Review]]. [http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx?country=All+Countries&amp;subject=International+Trade ILJ ranks third among thirty-four journals worldwide] in the field of international trade law and thirty-ninth among 207 in the more general field of international law. In 2015, it shortened its name from "The North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation" in part to reflect the expansion from its original focus of commercial regulation.

ILJ publishes four issues each year featuring articles written by leading scholars, respected practitioners, and ILJ staff members. In 2015, it added a fifth, online-only issue.

==Journal Symposiums==

In order to foster discussion of international legal issues, ILJ also hosts an annual symposium that brings together the legal community for academic and public discourse on an important issue in [[international law]]. Its January 2015 symposium addressed the role of foreign law in U.S. federal and state courts, ranging from new applications of [[comity]], a long-standing principle under which U.S. courts recognize valid foreign judgments, to the rare but growing practice of U.S. courts citing foreign law as persuasive, a practice which is most closely associated with U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and which has generated a degree of controversy. ILJ's January 2016 symposium is expected to address the [[Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of Child Abduction]].

==Blog Posts==
ILJ regularly publishes [http://blogs.law.unc.edu/ncilj/ blog posts] on current events and issues in international law, including international arbitration and commercial regulation.

'''Philadelphia Bill No. 060345''', colloquially known as the '''Philadelphia blunt ban''', was an ordinance in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] which banned the retail sale of [[cigarettes]] or [[cigars]] sold one or two at a time, [[rolling paper]]s, flavored [[tobacco]] products, and drug consumption and packaging paraphernalia such as [[Hookah|water pipes]], roach clips, and bongs. It was an amendment to Chapter 9-600, the "Service Businesses" section, of the Philadelphia Code.&lt;ref name=Brainwash&gt;{{cite news|title=Philly Rolls Up the Blunt|author=Taylor W. Buley|date=2007-02-11|work=Brainwash|publisher=America's Future Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NETimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor signs bill to ban drug paraphernalia|author=William Kenny|date=2007-02-01|work=[[Northeast Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been overturned by court decree.

==Passage==
The ban was the result of a campaign by Philadelphia police officer and community activist Jerry Rocks, Sr.  Rocks's campaign, begun in October 2005, sought to restrict or prohibit [[convenience store]]s from selling the types of items eventually covered by the ordinance.  Rocks targeted his campaign particularly at [[Sunoco]] and [[Wawa Food Markets]].&lt;ref name=CBS3&gt;{{cite news|date=2007-01-23|title=Mayor Street Signs Anti-Drug Paraphernalia Bill|work=CBS 3|publisher=CBS Broadcasting Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Councilman [[Brian J. O'Neill]] sponsored the bill, introducing it into the [[Philadelphia City Council]] in May 2006.  It was passed unanimously by the Council and signed into law by Philadelphia Mayor [[John F. Street]] on January 23, 2007, with immediate effect.&lt;ref name=NETimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS3 /&gt;

==Invalidation==
In 2008, the [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania|Commonwealth Court]] held that the ban was partially preempted by the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. §§ 780-101-780-144. On January 19, 2011, in ''Holt's Cigar Co. v. Solvibile'', the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] reversed the Commonwealth Court's decision in part, holding that the entirety of the ban was preempted by the Controlled Substance Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080623/NEWS/80623013 | title=Court issues mixed verdict on Philly's 'blunt' ban | work=[[Pocono Record]] | date=June 23, 2008 | accessdate=April 5, 2012 | author=Scolforo, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Court tosses out city's tobacco-sales ordinance | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | date=January 21, 2011 |author1=Warner, Bob  |author2=Lucey, Catherine |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PlayStation mentality''' refers to the disassociation between combatants and the consequences of their actions, as a result of the use of weapon interfaces which resemble [[video games]].  The effect is named after the [[PlayStation]] games console, and is commonly cited in discussions of the problems of [[drone strike|drone warfare]], such as that conducted by the [[CIA]] in the [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Pakistan tribal areas]], typically using [[predator drones]].

{{cite bailii|litigants='''R  v Horncastle &amp; Others'''|court=UKSC|year=2009|num=14}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] regarding [[hearsay evidence]] and the compatibility of UK hearsay law with the right to a fair trial under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tomlinson|first=Hugh|title=Case Preview: R v Horncastle and others, Hearsay Evidence in Criminal Cases|url=http://ukscblog.com/case-preview-r-v-horncastle-and-others-hearsay-evidence-in-criminal-cases}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryder|first=Matthew|url=http://ukscblog.com/do-we-want-less-crime-maybe-not|publisher=UKSC Blog |title=Do we want less crime? Maybe not}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case represents another stage in the judicial dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Requa|first=Marny|title=Absent witnesses and the UK Supreme Court: judicial deference as judicial dialogue?|journal=International Journal of Evidence &amp; Proof|year=2010|volume=14|issue=3|pages=208–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) and the higher courts of the United Kingdom about whether it is acceptable to base convictions "solely or to a decisive extent" on evidence made by a witness who is identified but does not appear in court (for example, in a witness statement made to the police).

A panel of 7 judges sat in the case, including the [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|President of the Supreme Court]], [[Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips]], the [[Lord Chief Justice]], [[Lord Judge]] and the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Lord Neuberger]].&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14&lt;/ref&gt; The court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal and dismissed the appeals of several defendants who were convicted on the basis of statements of absent witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court differs from Strasbourg|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/reports/article6950245.ece|newspaper=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case can be viewed as a direct response&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Simon|title=Strasbourg rebuff|journal=Legal Executive|date=December 2010|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the European Court of Human Rights ruling in ''[[Al-Khawaja v United Kingdom]]'' (2009) 1 EHRR 49 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/110.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2009]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ECHR 110]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the facts were legally very similar. In this case the ECtHR ruled against the state and found that while it was justifiable to allow hearsay evidence in some circumstances, it was likely never permissible for a conviction to be based solely or decisively on such evidence.&lt;ref name=para37&gt;(2009) 49 EHRR 1 [37], quoting ''[[Doorson v Netherlands]]'' (1996) 22 EHRR 330 [76]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khawaja has been appealed by the United Kingdom and the decision by the Grand Chamber (a larger panel of judges which did not overturn the initial decision) is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cases pending before the Grand Chamber|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/The+Court/The+Court/The+Grand+Chamber/|publisher=European Court of Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lords in Horncastle do not look favourably upon the decision of the Grand Chamber stating "that although the domestic court was required to take account of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in applying principles which were clearly established, where, on rare occasions, the domestic court was concerned that the European court's decision insufficiently appreciated or accommodated particular aspects of the domestic process, it might decline to follow the decision".

==Background==

Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees a fair trial to anybody charged with a criminal offence. As a subset of this general right, accused persons are entitled to benefit from a number of "minimum rights", one of which under Article 6(3)(d) is the right to [[cross-examine]] prosecution witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Convention on Human Rights|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm|publisher=Council of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous cases in the European Court of Human Rights such as [[Lucà v Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;(2003) 36 EHRR 46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kostovski v Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;(1990) 12 EHRR 434&lt;/ref&gt; concerned trials in which either the testimony of anonymous witnesses or witness statements made by witnesses who were not called in court were accepted as evidence. The European Court accepted that while allowing this sort of evidence did ''[[prima facie]]'' breach a defendants rights under Article 6(3)(d), this was acceptable so long as sufficient counterbalances were present.&lt;ref&gt;(1990) 12 EHRR 434 at [43], (2009) 49 EHRR 1 [37], (1996) 22 EHRR 330 [72]&lt;/ref&gt; The court maintained the caveat that although this sort of evidence was normally acceptable, it was never appropriate for a [[conviction]] to be based solely or decisively on this sort of untested evidence.

In Al-Khawaja v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR 1, two applications to the ECtHR were made by men who had been convicted on criminal charges on the basis of untested hearsay statements. In one case a defendant was convicted of indecent assault on the basis of the statement of a woman who had subsequently committed suicide, in the other a defendant was convicted of wounding with intent (contrary to section 18 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]) on the basis of a statement made by the victim, who had been unwilling to testify in court. The ECtHR found that in both cases the state was in breach of Article 6 by allowing convictions to be based "solely or decisively" on hearsay evidence.&lt;ref name=para37/&gt;

==Facts==

Two of the Appellants had been convicted of committing [[grievous bodily harm]] with intent. Their convictions were based "to a decisive extent" on a statement made by the victim of the alleged offence, who had later died (the cause of his death was "not attributable to the injuries" he suffered). The other appellants were convicted of [[kidnapping]], in this case their conviction was found to have been based "to a decisive extent" on a statement made by the victim who had not attended the trial due to fear.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [1]-[4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], it was permissible for the trial judges in each case to allow this evidence to be presented in this way. The Act provided for a general presumption that hearsay evidence should not be allowed in criminal trials but this presumption could be defeated when witnesses were unavailable due to one of a number of prescribed reasons (including the witness having died before the trial under section 116(2)(a) or the witness being unavailable for trial due to fear under section 116(2)(e).&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice Act 2003, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/116 section 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also provided a number of safeguards and exceptions which allowed judges to exclude unsafe or unfair hearsay evidence,&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice Act 2003, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/126 section 126]; the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/78 section 78]&lt;/ref&gt; permitted opposing counsel additional grounds to attack the credibility of absent witnesses &lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice Act 2003, sections [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/119 119], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/120 120], and  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/124 124]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the judge a discretionary power to stop the case if the prosecution's case was based to any extent on hearsay evidence and was not convincing.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice Act 2003, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/125 section 125]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act did not make any mention of the evidence of absent witnesses which was the "sole or decisive" basis of a conviction, (although this rule is one of the criteria which must be considered by a judge when determining if a witness should be allowed anonymity).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/15/section/5 section 5(2)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)]] an augmented panel of five judges unanimously affirmed the convictions of the appellants, declining to follow the "sole or decisive" rule found in the ECtHR cases and expressing support for the code of statutory provisions on hearsay contained within sections 114 to 136 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/964.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2009]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Crim 964]&lt;/ref&gt; Their reasons were often similar to those in the Supreme Court, and in his judgment Lord Phillips expressed approval of the Court of Appeal's reasoning and stated that the two rulings were best read as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==

Arguments were made in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] between the 7 and 9 July 2009. Senior Counsel were [[Tim Owen]] [[Queens Counsel|QC]] and [[Shaun Smith (barrister)|Shaun Smith]] QC for the two sets of appellants and [[David Perry (barrister)|David Perry]] QC for the Crown in response.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [Representation]&lt;/ref&gt;   An extended panel of 7 Justices heard the case, which is common practice when a case raises important human rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Supreme Court|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/procedures/panel-numbers-criteria.html|title=Panel numbers criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2009, the Court ruled unanimously in favour of the crown and dismissed the appeals. The Court's President [[Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips]] gave the leading judgment, with which the rest of the court agreed, although [[Simon Brown, Baron Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood|Lord Brown]] added some brief comments&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 at [112]-[120] of the annexes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Lord Mance]] prepared an annex detailing the history of similar cases in the ECtHR.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [41]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court began by asserting that it was not bound by the ECtHR precedent. It confirmed that under section 2 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it was required to "take into account" Strasbourg cases and this meant that on rare occasions, they did not need to be followed.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [10]-[11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Phillips then set out his reasons for dismissing the appeal. His reasoning centred around the ECtHR's perceived failure to accommodate UK law, both in terms of a failure to appreciate the strengths of the [[common law]] tradition with regard to criminal evidence and those of the current law which "render the sole or decisive rule unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court felt that it was significant that UK law had long incorporated safeguards against untested, hearsay evidence and this had ensured that the rights encompassed by article 6(3)(d) had long been protected by English law.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [15]-[40]&lt;/ref&gt; The system in the UK was compared to that of France at the time of the Convention's creation. In this system, and other continental criminal procedures, a formal inquisitorial process was conducted by a judge before the trial itself, which lacked, according to Lord Phillips,  many of the constituent rights attached to the concept of a fair trial, for example a lack of rules of evidence and the interrogation of witnesses in the absence of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [59]-[62]&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the purpose of the rights codified in article 6 was to prevent this type of conduct, and was not designed to have a major effect on common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [14]-[15]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current statutory regime enacted by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was also praised as a "crafted code"&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [36]&lt;/ref&gt; which ensured that hearsay evidence was properly admitted. It was noted that the current system was heavily influenced by the [[Law Commission]] and by consultation with experts.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [29]&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that to introduce the "sole or decisive rule" without discussion or consideration would damage this code.

The court also noted that the rule would create practical difficulties in the criminal system,&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [87]-[90]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was virtually always the case that UK law did exclude evidence that fell within the "sole or decisive rule".&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [93]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another observation made was that the rule is [[paradoxical]]; it results in spurious or weak hearsay evidence which would not result in a conviction alone being admitted, while stronger, damning evidence which is likely to achieve a conviction even in the absence of further evidence being excluded. It was suggested that this approach did not make sense, and that good systems tend to exclude weak, not strong evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[2009] UKSC 14 [91]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, human sexuality is governed by God's law. Accordingly, sexual violation is regarded as a violation of moral and divine law.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=Leslie F.|title=Leslie F. Wolf; Sexual Violation in Islamic Law: Substance, Evidence, and Procedure By HINA AZAM|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|date=10 December 2016|pages=etw060|doi=10.1093/jis/etw060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam divided claims of sexual violation into 'divine rights' (''huquq Allah'') and 'interpersonal rights' (''huquq al-'ibad''): the former requiring divine punishment (''[[hadd]]'' penalties) and the latter belonging to the more flexible human realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Semerdjian|first1=Elyse|title=Sexual Violation in Islamic Law: Substance, Evidence, and Procedure|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|date=18 July 2017|volume=13|issue=2|pages=315–317|doi=10.1215/15525864-3861356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam. Classical [[Islamic law]] (''Shari'a'') regarded the crime of sexual violation as a coercive [[zina]], and therefore a [[hadd]] offence.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;

==Definition==
Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam, and can be defined in Islamic law as: "Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent".&lt;ref name="Noor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noor|first1=Azman Mohd|title=Rape: A Problem of Crime Classification in Islamic Law|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=1 January 2010|volume=24|issue=4|pages=417–438|doi=10.1163/157302510X526724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic law, like the legal systems of classical antiquity and the ancient Near East, does not contain a true equivalent of the modern concept of rape, which is in turn based on the modern notions of individual autonomy and inviolability of the body, particularly the female body. In modern terms, rape is at its most basic level a violation of another person's sexual autonomy. In the communally and patriarchically oriented societies of [[Late Antiquity]], a woman's sexuality was construed as something in control of her legal guardian or owner rather than in her individual control. Therefore, the category of coercive sexual violation was not clearly differentiated from other categories such as consensual violation of sexual norms (seduction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhy_CQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=S7yHCm137_&amp;pg=PA16|pages=16-17|title=Sexual Violation in Islamic Law: Substance, Evidence, and Procedure|author=Hina Azam|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terms ''ghasaba'' and ''ightasaba'' have been used by traditional jurists when discussing sexual assault and its punishment. Most jurists hold that rape is committing zinā by force, hence rape is known as ''zinā  bī  al-ikrāh'' ({{lang-ar|زنا بالإكراه}}). Al-Shāfi‘ī defined rape as: "Forcing a woman to commit zinā against her will". To the Ḥanafis, illegal intercourse is considered  rape when there is no consent and no deliberate action from the victim. In Mālik’s view, rape refers to any kind of unlawful sexual intercourse (zinā) by usurpation and without consent. This includes instances when the condition of  the victims prevents them from expressing their resistance, such as insanity, sleep or being under age. The Ḥanbalites, similar to the Mālikites, consider the use of any kind of force as a denial of consent from the victim. The threat of starvation or suffering the cold of winter are also regarded as against one's will.&lt;ref name="Noor" /&gt;

===Relationship with zina===
Classical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called "rape" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (''zināʾ'').&lt;ref name="Kassam"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kassam |first=Zayn |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Law |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113724/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic definition of rape as "coercive ''zināʾ''" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to ''zināʾ''{{spaced ndash}}its definition, punishment and establishment through evidence{{spaced ndash}}were also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of ''zināʾ'' was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; What distinguished a prototypical act of zināʾ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being "coercive" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of "coercion" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zināʾ'' should receive the ''ḥadd'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the ḥadd punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zināʾ'' due to their reduced capacity.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

The crime of rape, according to Sunni Ḥanafī and Mālikī jurists, is as an act of zinā. If the consent was granted under coercion or in a defective legal capacity such as by a mentally impaired person, it is considered non-consent or invalid consent.&lt;ref name="Marie A. Failinger, Elizabeth R. Schiltz, Susan J. Stabile 2013 Pp.328–329"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|author1=Marie A. Failinger |author2=Elizabeth R. Schiltz |author3=Susan J. Stabile |publisher=Ashgate|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4094-7481-4|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|pages=328–329|chapter=Competing Approaches to Rape in Islamic Law (Author: Hina Azam)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marital rape ===

According to Georgetown University professor [[Jonathan A.C. Brown]], Islamic law has historically handled [[marital rape]] differently from modern laws, which originated in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Brown|authorlink=Jonathan A.C. Brown|title=Apology without apologetics|publisher=Muslim Matters|date=Feb 16, 2017|access-date=July 31, 2017|url=https://muslimmatters.org/2017/02/16/apology-without-apologetics-jonathan-brown/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual abuse within marriage was conceptualized as harm inflicted on the wife rather than violation of consent.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Historical record shows that women were able to go to court and force their husbands to desist and pay damages in such cases.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

==Punishment of a convicted rapist==
Rape is punishable in some circumstances by the ḥadd of [[Zina|zinā]] as well as in some circumstances by the ḥadd of ḥirābah and it is also complemented by ta‘zīr.&lt;ref name="Noor" /&gt;

===Ḥadd of zinā===
Most classical scholars argued for applying the ḥadd penalty for zinā to a convicted rapist, which is [[stoning]] to death for the married (''muḥsān''), or a flogging of 100 lashes and deportation for the unmarried (''ghair-muḥsān''). They base their argument on a hadith which reports a rape case at the time of the Prophet, where the victim was excused and her rapist (who was married) was sentenced to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="Noor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/17 17:37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126101247/http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/17 |date=2013-01-26 }}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|38|4366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ḥadd of Ḥirābah as a penalty for rape===
Certain classical jurists ([[Al-Tabari]] and the Maliki [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi|Ibn al-'Arabi]]) and more modern interpretations ([[The Religious Council of Egypt]] among others) have classified the crime of rape not as a subcategory of zinā, but rather a separate crime of violence under ''[[hirabah]]'' (forcible and violent taking), i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an (5:33) as ''[[fasad]]'' (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Thus, the rapist will be considered to be under the category of people who are outlaws and a danger towards the peace and security of the society.&lt;ref name="Noor" /&gt;

===Rape as Ta‘zīr===
Some modern researchers maintain that offenders be allotted a ''[[ta'zir]]'' penalty upon the discretion of the authorities. To them, rape deserves a ta‘zīr penalty when a conviction is reached as a result of circumstantial evidence, such as marks of violence about the genitals, marks of violence on the body of the victim or accused, the presence of semen or blood-stains on the body or clothes of the victim or accused, or a medical report, all of which are sufficient for ta‘zīr only. Under the principle of ''al-fi‘l al-darr'' (Islamic law of Tort), it is possible for a victim to make a claim for moral damages, which may include violation of a person’s freedom, dignity, reputation, social or financial  status.&lt;ref name="Noor" /&gt;

===Financial compensation===
According to the Mālikī, Ḥanbalī, and Shāfiʾī schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a "right of God" (''ḥaqq Allāh''), provoking the ''ḥadd'' punishment; and a violation against a "human" (interpersonal) right (''ḥaqq ādamī''), requiring a monetary compensation. These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''buḍʾ''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation. The amount of this compensation, they reasoned, should be the amount that any man would normally pay for sexual access to the woman in question{{spaced ndash}}that is, the amount of her dower (''ṣadāq'' or ''mahr'').&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

==Prosecution of rape==
If a woman claims to have been raped or sexually abused under duress, she will be acquitted of adultery in light of Qur'anic verse 24:33, which states that a woman has not sinned when compelled to commit this crime.&lt;ref name="Zakariyah"&gt;{{cite book | last=Zakariyah | first=Luqman | title=Legal maxims in Islamic criminal law : theory and applications | publisher=Brill Nijhoff | publication-place=Leiden Boston | year=2015 | isbn=90-04-30487-8 | page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[Oliver Leaman]], the required testimony of four male witnesses having seen the actual penetration applies to illicit sexual relations (i.e. adultery and fornication), not to rape.&lt;ref name="Leaman78"&gt;{{cite book |title=Controversies in Contemporary Islam |last=Leaman |first=Oliver |publisher=Routledge |authorlink=Oliver Leaman |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-415-67613-7 |location=New York |pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements for proof of rape are less stringent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rape charges can be brought and a case proven based on the sole testimony of the victim, providing that circumstantial evidence supports the allegations. It is these strict criteria of proof which lead to the frequent observation that where injustice against women does occur, it is not because of Islamic law. It happens either due to misinterpretation of the intricacies of the Sharia laws governing these matters, or cultural traditions; or due to corruption and blatant disregard of the law, or indeed some combination of these phenomena.&lt;ref name="Leaman78" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Abortion==
As far as abortion in the context of rape, most jurist do not consider rape to be a valid reason: the sanctity of the new life takes precedence over the autonomy of the pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Moosa"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moosa |first=Ebrahim |title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3403500144&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dl|date=July 2017}}

Muslim scholars have held that the [[Pregnancy from rape|child of rape]] is a legitimate child and thus it would be sinful to kill this child.&lt;!-- Should this say "fetus", not "child"? I would assume they would call it sinful killing children actually born. Anyway, unsourced? But unborn, conflicting with source? --&gt; Scholars permit its abortion only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother.&lt;ref name="VRC"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Vardit |last=Rispler-Chaim |chapter=Chapter 4: The Right Not to Be Born: Abortion of the Disadvantaged Fetus in Contemporary Fatwas |editor-first=Jonathan E |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic Ethics of Life: Abortion, War, and Euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;pg=PA87#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location=Columbia, SC |pages=87–88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528211940/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;pg=PA87#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2016-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When the pregnancy is unplanned and therefore unwanted, as in the case of rape, the parents, [have to/should, as adoption is unlawful] abort the fetus and thus prevent the disgrace that awaits both mother and child [..] the child born of rape, like one born of [[adultery]] (walad zina) is a more lowly member of society with regard of the rights he or she is guaranteed and the social status he or she can attain.|&lt;ref name="VRC"/&gt;}}

Muslim scholars were urged to make exceptions in the 1990s following rapes of [[Kuwait]]i women by Iraqi soldiers ([[Gulf war|in 1991]]) and the rape of [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] women by [[Serb]] soldiers. In 1991, the [[Ekrima Sa'id Sabri|Grand Mufti of Palestine]], [[Ekrima Sa'id Sabri]] took a different position than mainstream Muslim scholars. He ruled that Muslim women raped by their enemies during the [[Kosovo War]] could take [[abortifacient]] medicine, because otherwise the children born to those women might one day fight against Muslims.&lt;ref name="VRC"/&gt;

'''Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork''' are common particularly in the [[West Asia|Middle East]] amongst [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. Swine were prohibited in ancient [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian of Samosata]] notes the prohibition of pork for followers of the Dea Syria ([[Atargatis]], the 'Syrian goddess') in ''De dea Syria'', noted in Jan N. Bremmer, "Attis: A Greek God in Anatolian Pessinous and Catullan Rome", ''Mnemosyne'', Fourth Series, '''57'''.5, (2004:534–573) p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phoenicia]],&lt;ref&gt;As the pagan [[Porphyry of Tyre]] noted in ''De abstinentia ab esu animalium'', late third century CE.&lt;/ref&gt; and the pig and its flesh represented a taboo observed, [[Strabo]] noted, at [[Comana, Pontus Polemiacus|Comana in Pontus]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xii.8.9.&lt;/ref&gt; A lost poem of [[Hermesianax]], reported centuries later by the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], reported an [[etiological myth]] of [[Attis]] destroyed by a supernatural boar to account for the fact that "in consequence of these events the [[Galatia]]ns who inhabit [[Pessinos|Pessinous]] do not touch pork".&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Bremmer 2004:538 and notes. Bremmer notes that the taboo regarding pork for followers of Attis is reported in [[Julian (jurist)|Julian]], ''Orationes v.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerning [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] religions, clear restrictions exist in [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] (Kashrut) and in [[Islamic dietary laws]] (Halal).

Although Christianity is also an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] religion, most of its adherents are permitted to consume pork – justified by [[Peter's vision of a sheet with animals]] and several verses of the New Testament which guides Christians with the Good News of the Gospels. Since Christianity lost most of its roots from Judaism, Christians are not bound to some restrictions of Mosaic Law. However, [[Seventh-day Adventists]] consider pork taboo, along with other foods forbidden by Jewish law. The [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref name="Ethiopian"&gt;Charles Kong Soo [http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2011/04/21/ethiopian-holy-week-clashes-christians Ethiopian Holy Week clashes with Christians'] 21 April 2011 [[Trinidad and Tobago Guardian]] Retrieved 11 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; do not permit pork consumption.
According to Dr. Clovis Karam in his trilogy on the Phoenician Religion, Symbols and Anthropology, the pork taboo mystery most likely is locked into  the story of the death of Adonis the God of vegetation and Tammuz Doumuzi who was slain by a wild boar. Tammuz Adonis the gardener par excellence of the Garden of Adon (falsely translated to the Garden of Eden) feast was celebrated during the Adoni in the whole Mediterranean by commemorating the " les jardins d'Adonis". Hence the meaning behind the naming in our Fertile Crescent calendar of : Hzeiran "hzyro=pig, the month of heat "June" that kills Tammuz-Adonai " July" the gardener par excellence.

==Prohibitions in the Torah==
The [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) contains passages in Leviticus that lists the animals people are permitted to consume. It first notes what qualifies an animal that is absolutely permitted:

{{Quote|text=Any animal that has a cloven hoof that is completely split into double hooves, and which brings up its cud that one you may eat.|title=[http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9912/jewish/Chapter-11.htm#v=3&amp;showrashi=true Leviticus 11:3]}}

Animals that have cloven hooves and chew their cud are ruminants such as cows, sheep, and deer. This text does not specify every possible animal by name, only their behaviors. 

The text goes on to describe specific animals that are known and meet one, but not both, of those qualifications, thereby prohibiting their consumption. It does not elaborate on the exact reason for prohibition other than physical characteristics. 

Pigs are described in this section as prohibited because they have a cloven hoof but don't chew their cud.

{{Quote|text=And the pig, because it has a cloven hoof that is completely split, but will not regurgitate its cud; it is unclean for you. You shall not eat of their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.|title=[http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9912/jewish/Chapter-11.htm#v=7&amp;showrashi=true Leviticus 11:7–8]}}

Deuteronomy expands on the list of permitted animals.

{{Quote|text=You shall not eat any abomination.
These are the animals that you may eat: ox, lamb, and kid,

gazelle, deer, and antelope, ibex, chamois, bison, and giraffe.	 	

And every animal that has a split hoof and has a hoof cloven into two hoof sections, [and] chews the cud among the animals that you may eat.|title=[http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9978/jewish/Chapter-14.htm#v=3&amp;showrashi=true Deuteronomy 14:3–6]}}Deuteronomy reiterates what Leviticus states on pigs.{{Quote|text=And '''the pig''', because it has a split hoof, but does not chew the cud; '''it is unclean for you'''. '''You shall neither eat of their flesh''' nor touch their carcass.|title=[http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9978/jewish/Chapter-14.htm#v=8&amp;showrashi=true Deuteronomy 14:8]}}

==Prohibitions in Islamic law==
One example of verses from the [[Quran]] on pig consumption:

{{quote|He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than God . But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/2/173 Quran, Al-Baqara 2:173] , [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-2/verse-173/ Quran Surah Al-Baqara ( Verse 173 )]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The prohibition of certain food is also linked to [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|Islamic Cosmology]]. Accordingly ''good'' and ''evil'' qualities are transferred by eating an object carrying a certain quality, that also affects the soul of human, the pig rendered with ''[[Shaitan|evil qualities]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr ''Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines, An'' SUNY Press 1993 {{ISBN|978-1-438-41419-5}} p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==

[[Scottish pork taboo]] was [[Donald Alexander Mackenzie]]'s phrase for discussing an aversion to pork among [[Scotland|Scots]], particularly [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]], which he believed stemmed from an ancient [[taboo]]. Several writers who confirm that there was a prejudice against pork, or a superstitious attitude toward pigs, do not see it in terms of a taboo related to an ancient cult. Any prejudice is generally agreed to have disappeared by 1800.

==Interpretations of restrictions==

The [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialistic]] anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]] thinks that the main reason for prohibiting consumption of pork was ecological-economical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Abominable Pig|last = Harris|first = Marvin|publisher = Touchstone Books|year = 1987|isbn = 0671633082|location = |pages = |url = http://etnologija.etnoinfolab.org/dokumenti/82/2/2009/harris_1521.pdf|work = The Sacred Cow and the Abominable Pig: Riddles of Food and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigs require water and shady woods with seeds, but those conditions are scarce in the Middle East. Unlike many other forms of [[livestock]], pigs are [[omnivorous]] [[scavengers]], eating virtually anything they come across, including [[carrion]] and refuse. This was deemed unclean; and a [[Middle East]]ern society keeping large stocks of pigs would destroy their ecosystem. 

Extrapolating all of this into a modern scientific context, one could surmise that the very close relationship between humans and pigs&lt;ref name=sci1&gt;{{cite news|title=Human to Pig Genome Comparison Complete|url = http://news.aces.illinois.edu/news/human-pig-genome-comparison-complete|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; also makes them undesirable as food.

It is speculated that chickens supplanted pigs as a more portable and efficient source of protein, leading to the religious restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redding|first1=Richard W.|title=The Pig and the Chicken in the Middle East: Modeling Human Subsistence Behavior in the Archaeological Record Using Historical and Animal Husbandry Data|journal=[[Journal of Archaeological Research]]|volume=23|issue=4|pages=325|date=13 March 2015|doi=10.1007/s10814-015-9083-2|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10814-015-9083-2|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]], the Jewish philosopher and legal codifier, who was also court physician to the Muslim sultan [[Saladin]] in the 12th century, understands the dietary laws chiefly as a means of keeping the body healthy. He argued that the meat of the forbidden animals, birds, and fish is unwholesome and indigestible. According to Maimonides, at first glance, this does not apply to pork, which does not appear to be harmful. Yet, Maimonides observes, the pig is a filthy animal and if swine were used for food, marketplaces and even houses would be dirtier than latrines.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, A Guide for the Perplexed III:48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rashi]] (the primary Jewish commentator on the Bible and Talmud) lists the prohibition of pig as a law whose reason is not known, and may therefore be derided by others as making no sense.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi on Leviticus 18:4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinuch [[Sefer ha-Chinuch|Sefer HaChinuch]]&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaChinuch Mitzvah 73&lt;/ref&gt; (an early work of [[Halachah]]) gives a general overview of the Jewish dietary laws. He writes "And if there are any reasons for the dietary laws which are unknown to us or those knowledgeable in the health field, do not wonder about them, for the true Healer that warns us against them is smarter than us, and smarter than the doctors".

'''''Takahashi v. Fish and Game Comm'n''''', 334 U.S. 410 (1948), was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The issue at hand was a restrictive law in California requiring American citizenship to get a fishing license. The Court held that this was an unreasonable restriction and was discriminatory to residents of Japanese ancestry.

==Background==

===Facts===
Torao Takahashi came from Japan to the United States and became a resident of [[Terminal Island]] in Los Angeles County, California in 1907.  Prior to 1943 California issued commercial fishing licenses to all qualified persons without regard to alienage or ineligibility to citizenship. From 1915 to 1942 Takahashi, under annual commercial fishing licenses issued by the State, fished in ocean waters off the California coast, apparently both within and without the three-mile coastal belt, and brought his fresh fish ashore for sale.  In 1942, while the United States country was at war with Japan, Takahashi and other California residents of Japanese ancestry were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly interned]] under military orders. The evacuation was legally challenged in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' but a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the evacuation.

In 1943, during the period of war and evacuation, an amendment to the California Fish and Game Code was adopted prohibiting issuance of a license to any "alien Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Stats. 1943, ch. 1100.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the state code was again amended by striking the 1943 provision for fear that it might be "declared unconstitutional" because directed only "against alien Japanese"; the new amendment banned issuance of licenses to any "person ineligible to citizenship," which classification included Japanese. Cal. Stats. 1945, ch. 181. Because of this state provision barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship under federal law, Takahashi, who met all other state requirements, was denied a license by the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife|California Fish and Game Commission]] upon his return to California in 1945.

===Claim===

Takahashi, an alien ineligible for citizenship, brought an action for mandamus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, to compel the Commission to issue him a commercial fishing license.

===California Superior Court===

The Superior Court first ordered issuance of a commercial fishing license authorizing Takahashi to bring ashore "catches of fish from the waters of the high seas beyond the State's territorial jurisdiction."

After appeal to the State Supreme Court by the State Commission the Superior Court amended its judgment so as to order a commercial license authorizing Takahashi to bring in catches of fish taken from the three-mile ocean belt adjacent to the California coast as well as from the high seas.  It held that lawful alien inhabitants of California, despite their ineligibility to citizenship, were entitled to engage in the vocation of commercial fishing on the high seas beyond the three-mile belt on the same terms as other lawful state inhabitants, and that the California code provision denying them this right violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

===Supreme Court of California===
A judgment granting the writ was reversed by the State Supreme Court, three judges dissenting.

The Court held that California had a proprietary interest in fish in the ocean waters within three miles of the shore, and that this interest justified the State in barring all aliens in general and aliens ineligible to citizenship in particular from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them to California for commercial purposes. 30 Cal. 2d 719, 185 P. 2d 805.

The state court held that this interest justified the state in barring all aliens in general, and aliens ineligible for citizenship in particular, from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them into the state for commercial purposes.

===Certiorari and arguments===
The Supreme Court granted certiorari. 333 U.S. 853, "to review this question of importance in the fields of federal-state relationships and of constitutionally protected individual equality and liberty".

==Opinion of the court==

The Court reversed.  [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] was joined by six other justices.

It held that the California statute forbidding the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to aliens ineligible to citizenship was held to violate the constitutional right of such aliens to the equal protection of the laws. The contention that the statute might be supported as a conservation measure was rejected.  The state could not, consistent with the United States Constitution, use federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring petitioner from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean water off the state coast. The refusal to issue petitioner a commercial fishing license violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and there was no special public interest to support the state ban on petitioner's commercial fishing.

A state prohibition of the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible to citizenship makes an unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (distinguishing ''[[Terrace v. Thompson]]'', 263 US 197; ''[[Porterfield v. Webb]]'', 263 US 225; ''[[Webb v. O'Brien]]'', 263 US 313; and ''[[Frick v. Webb]]'', 263 US 326).

1. A California statute barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons "ineligible to citizenship," which classification included resident alien Japanese and precluded such a one from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of the State, held invalid under the Federal Constitution and laws. pp.&amp;nbsp;412–422.

2. For purposes of decision by this Court, it may be assumed that the object of the statute was to conserve fish in the coastal waters of the State, or to protect citizens of the State engaged in commercial fishing from the competition of Japanese aliens, or both. P. 418.

3. That the United States regulates immigration and naturalization in part on the basis of race and color classifications does not authorize adoption by a State of such classifications to prevent lawfully admitted aliens within its borders from earning a livelihood by means open to all other inhabitants. pp.&amp;nbsp;418–420.

4. The Fourteenth Amendment and federal laws, 8 U. S. C. § 41, embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide "in any state" on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws. pp.&amp;nbsp;419–420.

5. Whatever may be the interest of the State or its citizens in the fish in the 3-mile belt offshore, that interest does not justify the State in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all other persons to do so. pp.&amp;nbsp;420–421.

6. Assuming their continued validity, cases sustaining state laws barring land ownership by aliens ineligible to citizenship, which rested on grounds peculiar to real property, can not be extended to control the decision in this case. P. 422.

===Concurrence===
[[Frank Murphy|Justice Murphy]], joined by [[Wiley B. Rutledge|Rutledge]], expressed agreement with these views, but thought that the statute should also be condemned as being the direct outgrowth of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry and as having no relation whatever to any constitutionally cognizable interest of California.

===Dissent===
[[Stanley F. Reed|Justice Reed]], joined by [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], dissented on the ground that a state has the power to exclude all aliens from enjoyment of its natural resources, including its fisheries, and that a classification excluding such aliens as are ineligible to citizenship is not unreasonable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11468">[[Gibraltar]] benefits from an extensive shipping trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international conference center. It is a well known and regulated international finance centre and has been a popular jurisdiction for European offshore companies. The financial sector, tourism, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods generate revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldoffshorebanks.com/gibraltaroffshorebanks.html Gibraltar as a finance centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[law of Gibraltar]] is based on [[English law]], but is separate from the [[Law of the United Kingdom|UK legal system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/ Gibraltar Laws]&lt;/ref&gt; Non-resident businesses do not pay income tax unless the source of this income is Gibraltar proper. There is no tax on capital income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltic-legal.com/offshores-company-gibraltar-eng.htm Gibraltar Offshore]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gibraltar there is no [[capital gains tax]], [[wealth tax]], [[sales tax]] or [[value added tax]]. [[Import duty]] is payable on most items at 12% The main tax for companies is Corporation Tax, and [[Social insurance]] contributions. There are also [[stamp duty|stamp duties]] on certain transactions, and [[property tax]]es ('rates').

Non-resident companies can take advantage of a number of offshore regimes in order to reduce taxation, although in line with the elimination of unfair tax practices this is being phased out. Individuals pay quite high taxes on their income in Gibraltar unless they are able to take advantage of [[high-net-worth individual]] status or gain exemption as an [[expatriate]] executive. Import duties are quite high on some items.

Assessment and collection of tax is administered by the Commissioner of Income Tax; the [[tax year]] runs from 1st July to the following 30 June.

The information in this article is taken from the publication "Gibraltar Tax facts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakertillygibraltar.gi/images/bakertilly/downloads/taxfacts_2012-13.pdf Gibraltar Tax facts]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be incorrect or out of date.

==Income tax rates==

Gibraltar has two tax systems, one based on gross income which does not provide any allowances, and another with different rates which does. The choice of which system to apply is made by the taxable person.

===Gross Income Based System===

1. Persons on gross income up to £16,000

|£2000
| 0%
| £18,001 - £23,000
| £3,600 - £4,600
|}

3. Persons on gross income between £25,001 and £35,000

A rate of 20% applies less tapering relief on gross income between £25,001 and £26,000. With the tapering relief on gross income of £25,000, there is a tax-free amount of £2000 that reduces by £2 for every £1 increase in gross income.

4. Persons on gross income between £35,001 and £100,000

The effective (average) tax rate is reduced by 0.5% from the previous year using a complex formula to give a maximum effective tax rate of 26.25% on gross income of £100,000. The tax liability is arrived at by first calculating using the previous year’s tax band (i.e. 20% for tax bands of £0 - £25,000 and 29% for £25,001 - £100,000), then reducing it by 0.5% and finally applying the resulting rate of taxable income (gross income less tapering relief).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">A '''tonnage tax''' is a [[Income tax|taxation mechanism]] that can be applied to [[Freight transport|shipping companies]]. The tax is determined by the [[Net tonnage]] of the entire fleet of [[Cargo ship|vessels]] under operation or use by a company. It is on the basis of this variable that taxation is applied. 
 
Given that the tax perceived is independent from the volume of material transported and from the [[Earnings before interest and taxes|operating profit]] of a shipping company, it is less complex to manage for [[Revenue service|tax authorities]] and shipping companies. This method of taxation is based on an objectively measurable variable - net tonnage - by independent certifying bodies that determine the transport capacity of the vessels. Under current international practice, tonnage tax regimes are used to incentivise the modernisation and improved environmental performance of merchant fleets. 
 
The first country to introduce a tonnage tax was [[Greece]] back in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Weintrit, Adam and Tomasz Neumann (Editors), 2013. ''Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation: STCW, Maritime Education and Training (MET), Human Resources and Crew Manning, Maritime Policy, Logistics and Economic Matters'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|9781138001046}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tonnage tax rules are applied in many countries, including 18 EU countries. The latest tonnage tax regime to have received the approval of the European Commission is the [[Malta|Maltese]] tonnage tax scheme on 19 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-5361_en.htm cf.

The '''Transparency Directive''' or '''Directive 2004/109/EC'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32004L0109|title=EUR-Lex - 32004L0109 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[European Union|EU]] [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] of 2004. In 2004, it was a revision of the Directive 2001/34/EC.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32001L0034&lt;/ref&gt; The Transparency Directive was amended in 2013 by the Transparency Directive Amending Directive (Directive 2013/50/EU).&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0050&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transparency Directive improves the harmonisation of information duties of [[issuers]], whose [[Security (finance)|securities]] are listed at a [[regulated market]] at a [[stock exchange]] within the [[European Union]], and further market participants. The aims of these amendments are to establish minimum requirements regarding the financial information distribution all over the [[European Union]] and an increase in transparency at the [[capital market]]s and in investor protection to meet information deficits in a developing financial market environment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gutzy, Jochen/Märzheuser, Michael (2007): Praxishandbuch Ad-hoc-Publizität, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Transparency Directive of 2004===
The process, which resulted in the 2004 version of the EU Transparency [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]], passed several years, consultations and revisions.
The first step towards the EU Transparency Directive of 2004 took place in July 2001 when the [[European Commission|Commission]] of the European Union announced the first consultation regarding the transparency on publicly traded companies. This first consultation period lasted from 17 July 2001 until 30 September 2001. During that time interested parties were able to contribute comments on the proposals, which the Commission drafted in its own consultation paper, regarding the new regime on disclosure requirements. Interested parties could be the issuers themselves, national agencies and associations, state authorities and European authorities, such as [[Committee of European Securities Regulators|CESR]]. The consultation paper of the Commission suggested a division of disclosure duties, in periodic and ongoing obligations,&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, Dr. Stephan/Kaulamo, Dr. Katja (2007): Das Transparenzrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz: Änderungen der anlassabhängigen Publizität, in: NJW 2007, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; for example for financial reports (periodical) and ad hoc notifications (ongoing), and a focus on the publications of those information through a medium on a Europe-wide basis&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; as well as the control of these duties by the national supervisory authorities. Until the end of the consultation period the Commission received 90 contributions from market participants all over Europe, whereas most of the answers came from British and German interest groups. Mostly these answers complied with the suggestions, which were made up by the Commission.

However there have also been some amendments:
* Reducing the lowest threshold regarding notifications of major voting rights
* Introducing [[International Financial Reporting Standards|International Accounting Standards]] into financial reports
* Publication of information via newspaper and internet
* Responsibility of state authorities for supervision (in cooperation with [[stock exchanges]])

After the first consultation the [[European Commission|Commission]] revised its consultation paper to present it to the public another time. In May 2002 the [[European Commission|Commission]] launched a second and final consultation period, which lasted from 8 May 2002 until 5 July 2002. The [[European Commission|Commission]] specified the information requirements regarding [[issuers]], listed in a regulated market at a [[stock exchange]], especially in terms of financial reporting, voting rights, directors’ dealing, stock options, employee shares schemes and equal treatment of shareholders.

In detail, those suggestions were:
* Financial reporting requirements based on the annual turnover
* Equal treatment of [[shareholders]] by admitting proxy voting rights and electronic voting
* Lower initial threshold for notifications of voting rights at 5%
* Introducing further thresholds at 15% and 30%
* Time limit for filing such notification: 5 calendar days
* Publication of such notifications on the [[issuer]]’s homepage, in a newspaper and further information/news providers

These suggestions were basically confirmed by the interested parties.

On 26 May 2003 the [[European Commission|Commission]] proposed its draft for the [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] to the [[European Parliament]] and to the [[Council of the European Union]]. About one year later, on 30 March 2004, the [[European Parliament]] approved the [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]], whereby the unofficial version of the [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] was published on 11 May 2004. This unofficial version covered all of the topics discussed in the former consultation process, such as periodical financial reporting, transparency in shareholder structure and publication of information.

The final version of the Directive 2004/109/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about [[issuers]] whose [[Security (finance)|securities]] are admitted to trading on a regulated market was adopted on 17 December 2004. After the announcement of the Directive in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] the [[Member state of the European Union|Member State]] should transform the regulations, agreed on in the Directive, into national law within the next two years, not later that 20 January 2007.

===The Transparency Directive Amending Directive of 2013===
The Transparency Directive was amended in 2013 by the Transparency Directive Amending Directive (TDAD), Directive 2013/50/EU. The final date for member states to implement the TDAD was 26 November 2015.
The TDAD contains these elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32013L0050|title=Document 32013L0050: Directive 2013/50/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013|date=22 October 2013|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Issuers are no longer obliged to publish interim reports (unless a Member State chooses to still impose it as an obligation)
* Issuers who have activities in the extractive or logging of primary forest industries should disclose in a separate report, on an annual basis, payments made to governments in the countries in which they operate
* Notification of major holdings of voting rights should include cash-settlement financial instruments with similar economic effect to holding shares and entitlements to acquire shares
* Issuers should prepare their annual financial reports in the European single electronic reporting format (ESEF) (from 1 January 2020 on)
* ESMA should develop and operate a web portal serving as a European electronic access point (EEAP) for regulated information

==Regulations==
The Directive specifies a range of regulations which have to be transformed into national law by the [[Member state of the European Union|Member State]], whereas the [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] only sets minimum standards. [[Member state of the European Union|Member State]] have the possibility to set up stricter rules.

===Scope===
This [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] is directed to [[issuers]] whose [[Security (finance)|securities]] are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a [[Member state of the European Union|Member State]] and regulates requirements regarding the disclosure of periodic and ongoing information.

===Definitions===
The [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] defines several terms, which are used in the new regulations, either by referring to other [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] or by its own definition.

===Periodic information===

====Annual financial reports====
The [[issuer]] has to publish its annual financial report not later than four months&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Hutter, Dr. Stephan/Kaulamo, Dr. Katja (2007): Das Transparenzrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz: Änderungen der Regelpublizität und das neue Veröffentlichungsregime für Kapitalmarktinformationen, in: NJW 2007, p. 551&lt;/ref&gt; after the end of the [[fiscal year]] and has to ensure that this report is accessible for at least five years. The annual financial report has to include the audited financial statements, a management report and a statement by officials that the financial statements were set up in compliance with the applicable accounting standards. In addition to the annual financial report the audit report should be published, as well.

====Half-yearly financial reports====
The [[issuer]] has to publish a financial report covering the first half of the [[fiscal year]] after the end of this relevant period. This report has to include the financial statements for the first half of the [[fiscal year]], an interim management report (including major events in the first half-year, a forecast for the next half-year and their possible impacts and further financial statements) and a statement by officials that the financial statements were set up in compliance with the applicable accounting standards. In case this half-yearly report gets audited, the audit report has to be published as well.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Ongoing information===

====Major Holdings of voting rights====
A [[shareholder]], acquiring or selling [[shares]], has to notify the [[issuer]] of such transactions, as soon as the acquisition or disposal of shares results in an amount of voting rights, that exceeds, falls below or reaches the threshold of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50% and 75%&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, Dr. Stephan/Kaulamo, Dr. Katja (2007): Das Transparenzrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz: Änderungen der anlassabhängigen Publizität, in: NJW 2007, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; of the total amount of voting rights issued.

This notification requirement can also be based on the following cases:
* Acting in concert with other [[shareholders]]
* Voting rights are held by a third party and will be transferred temporarily to a different [[shareholder]]
* [[Shares]] are lodged as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]
* Life interest
* Voting rights being held by a controlled undertaking
* Voting rights be deposited with a third person (whereas the third person is allowed to exercise the voting rights on its own discretion)
* Holding voting rights in behalf of the legal owner
* Exercising voting rights as proxy

This notification has to include the amount of voting rights held after acquisition/disposal, the day on which the event took place, the chain of controlled undertakings or the name of the (directly invested) [[shareholder]] from which the notifying party gets attributed the voting rights.
Furthermore a notification is required when a natural person or legal entity holds [[financial instruments]], which result in the entitlement to acquire voting rights, whereas the acquisition is based on the holder's initiative.
These regulations should not apply for [[shareholders]], holding the [[shares]] as [[market makers]], for [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] and settlement purposes and credit institutions, holding the [[shares]] in their trading book, and holding less than 10% of the total amount of voting rights issued.

====Information requirements for issuers====
Issuers are obliged to treat those [[shareholders]] equally, which are in the same position. Furthermore [[issuers]] have to make all available all kinds of information that are necessary for the [[shareholders]] to ensure the exercise of their rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, Dr. Stephan/Kaulamo, Dr. Katja (2007): Das Transparenzrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz: Änderungen der anlassabhängigen Publizität, in: NJW 2007, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- WHATS WRONG HERE? --&gt;person to exercise their voting and/or financial rights, either in paper or electronic form. After the [[annual general meeting]] the issuer has to publish decisions made at the [[annual general meeting]], if applicable, which are: payment of [[dividends]] and issue of new [[Share (finance)|shares]], including allotment-, subscription-, cancellation- and conversion rights of the new [[Share (finance)|shares]].

===General obligations===
As long as [[shareholders]] or [[issuers]] have to provide information to each other, e.g. disclose the holding of voting rights, this information has to be filed with the state authority at the same time as well. The same applies for issuers, who propose the annual meeting to change their articles of incorporation.

===Competent authorities and their power===
Each [[Member state of the European Union|Member State]] of the [[European Union]] has to designate a state authority, which should be responsible for carrying out the obligations regarding [[shareholders]] and [[issuers]]. Therefore the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to empower the authorities to achieve the aims of the [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]]. Especially the authorities should be able to require involved parties to provide them with information and documents regarding each single case or require the [[issuers]] and [[shareholder]] to disclose such information, which is necessary to fulfill their requirements. Additionally the authorities shall be empowered to carry out on-site inspection, to verify compliance with the statutory requirements.

Reznor and Ross [[Film score|scored]] the [[David Fincher]] films ''[[The Social Network]]'' (2010), ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'' (2011), and ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' (2014), winning the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for ''The Social Network'' and the [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media]] for ''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo''. In 1997, Reznor appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} list of the year's most influential people, and [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']] magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986206-18,00.html | title = Time's 25 most influential Americans | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = April 21, 1997 | volume = 149 | issue = 16 | page = 66 | accessdate = 2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Michael Trent Reznor was born on May 17, 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitor|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=May 18, 2012|issue=1207|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name="wargsancestry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/reznor.html |title=Ancestry of Trent Reznor compiled by William Addams Reitwiesner |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Nancy Lou (''née'' Clark) and Michael Reznor.&lt;ref name="George Reznor"&gt;{{cite web | title = George Watson Reznor | publisher = ''[[The Herald (Sharon)|The Herald]]'' | date = April 1, 2007 | url = http://www.sharon-herald.com/fullobits/local_story_093100425.html?start:int=0 | accessdate = 2007-11-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011161755/http://sharon-herald.com/fullobits/local_story_093100425.html?start:int=0 | archivedate = October 11, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has German and Irish ancestry,&lt;ref name="wargsancestry" /&gt; and is a descendant of businessman George Reznor, who founded the heating and air conditioning manufacturer The Reznor Company in 1888 (the business was sold in the 1960s).&lt;ref name="George Reznor" /&gt; Reznor grew up in [[Mercer, Pennsylvania]]. After his parents divorced, he lived with his maternal grandparents from the age of six, while his sister Tera lived with their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' | title = The Shadow of Death | first = Marc | last = Spitz | date = June 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing the piano at the age of 12 and showed an early aptitude for music.&lt;ref name="int12"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dougherty | first = Steve |author2=Bryan Alexander |author3=Tom Nugent |author4=John Hannah | title = The Music of Rage | publisher = ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' | date=  February 6, 1995 | url = http://nothing.nin.net/int12.html | accessdate = 2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Bill Clark, told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine in February 1995 that Reznor was "a good kid ... a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] who loved to skateboard, build model planes, and play the piano".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; He stated, "Music was his life, from the time he was a wee boy. He was so gifted."&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; His former piano teacher, Rita Beglin, said that he "always reminded [her] of [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] when he played".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt;

Reznor has acknowledged that his sheltered life left him feeling isolated from the outside world. In a September 1994 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, he referred to his choices in the music industry:

{{cquote|I don't know why I want to do these things, other than my desire to escape from Small Town, U.S.A., to dismiss the boundaries, to explore. It isn't a bad place where I grew up, but there was nothing going on but the cornfields. My life experience came from watching movies, watching TV and reading books and looking at magazines. And when your culture comes from watching TV every day, you're bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities. None of that happened where I was. You're almost taught to realize it's not for you.&lt;ref name="RS 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gold | first = Jonathan | title = Love it to Death | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | issue = 690 | date=  September 9, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in April 1995, Reznor told ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine that he did not "want to give the impression it was a miserable childhood".&lt;ref name="Details"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heath |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Heath |title=The Art of Darkness |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date=April 1995 |url=http://9inchnails.com/articles/the-art-of-darkness.php |accessdate=2015-04-15 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301233126/http://9inchnails.com/articles/the-art-of-darkness.php |archivedate=March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Mercer Area Middle-High School|Mercer Area Junior/Senior High School]], he learned to play the tenor saxophone and tuba, and was a member of both the [[jazz band|jazz]] and [[marching band]]. The school's former band director remembered him as "very upbeat and friendly".&lt;ref name="int12"/&gt; Reznor also became involved in theater while in high school, and was voted "Best in Drama" by classmates for his roles as [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and Professor Harold Hill in ''[[The Music Man]]''. He graduated in 1983 and enrolled at [[Allegheny College]] in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]], where he studied [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name="Film Spot"&gt;{{cite web | title = Trent Reznor Bio | publisher = Film Spot | url = http://www.filmspot.com/people/441775/trent-reznor/bio.html | accessdate = 2007-11-09 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==

===Early musical projects===
While he was a student at  Mercer Area Junior/Senior High School, Reznor joined local band Option 30 and played three shows a week with them. After a year of college, Reznor dropped out and moved to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, to pursue a career in music.&lt;ref name="int12"/&gt; His first band in Cleveland was the Urge, a cover band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/homegrown/index.ssf?/homegrown/more/reznor/conspire.html |title=Trent Reznor: Area Co-conspirators |publisher=Cleveland.com |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206074325/http://www.cleveland.com/homegrown/index.ssf?%2Fhomegrown%2Fmore%2Freznor%2Fconspire.html |archivedate=February 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/08/17/before-trent-reznor-was-metal-he-had-a-flock-of-seagulls-haircut/ | title=Before Trent Reznor Was Metal He Had A Flock Of Seagulls Haircut | date=August 17, 2011 | accessdate=29 December 2015 | author=Neilstein, Vince}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he joined The Innocent as a keyboardist; they released one album, ''Livin' in the Street'', but Reznor left the band after three months. In 1986, he joined local band Exotic Birds and appeared with them as a fictional band called The Problems in the 1987 film ''[[Light of Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal|last=Bukszpan|first=Daniel|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|year=2003|isbn=0-7607-4218-9|location=New York|page=173|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor also contributed on [[Keyboardist|keyboards]] to the band Slam Bamboo during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trent Reznor | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722153/ | accessdate = 2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor got a job at Cleveland's Right Track Studio as an assistant engineer and janitor.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web | author = Huey, Steve | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5033|pure_url=yes}} | title = Nine Inch Nails | accessdate = 2006-11-24 | publisher = [[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio owner Bart Koster later commented: "He was so focused in everything he did. When that guy waxed the floor, it looked great."&lt;ref name="int12"/&gt; Reznor asked Koster for permission to record [[Demo (music)|demos]] of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him "just a little wear on his tape heads".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt;

While assembling the earliest [[Nine Inch Nails]] recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], he played all the instruments except drums himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Truth About Trent | journal = Option | last = Fine | first = Jason | date=  July–August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor has continued in this role on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians, assistants, drummers and rhythm experts. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with [[TVT Records]].&lt;ref name="AMG" /&gt; Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1988 as ''Purest Feeling'' and many of these songs appeared in revised form on ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'', Reznor's first official release under the Nine Inch Nails name.

===Nine Inch Nails===
{{Main|Nine Inch Nails}}
[[File:Trent Reznor Lollapalooza 1991.jpg|thumb|upright|Reznor performing at the [[Lollapalooza]] festival, 1991]]
Most of Reznor's work as a musician has been as founding and primary member of Nine Inch Nails. ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''  was released in 1989 and was a moderate commercial success, certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="RIAA.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |title=Gold and Platinum database |accessdate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid pressure from his record label to produce a follow-up to ''Pretty Hate Machine'', Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference, resulting in an [[Extended play|EP]] called ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Nine Inch Nails  | journal = [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |date=March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Inch Nails was included in the [[Lollapalooza]] tour in the summer of 1991, and won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1993 under "Best Heavy Metal Performance" for the song "[[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|Wish]]".&lt;ref name="Lollapalooza"&gt;{{cite web | title = Nine Inch Nails – Timeline | publisher = rockonthenet.com | url = http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-n/nineinchnails_main.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in 1994 at number two,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/kidsnewsday/content.ssf?/homegrown/index.ssf?/homegrown/more/reznor/timeline.html |title=Trent Reznor: Timeline |publisher=Cleveland.com |accessdate=2006-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011112200/http://www.cleveland.com/kidsnewsday/content.ssf?%2Fhomegrown%2Findex.ssf%3F%2Fhomegrown%2Fmore%2Freznor%2Ftimeline.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America.&lt;ref name="RIAA.com"/&gt; To record the album, Reznor rented and moved into the [[10050 Cielo Drive|10050 Cielo Drive mansion]], where the 1969 [[Abigail Anne "Gibby" Folger|Manson Family murders]] took place.&lt;ref name="Le Pig"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ali | first = Lorraine | title = Making Records – Where Manson Murdered Helter Shelter | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = March 18, 1994 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301460,00.html | accessdate = 2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled on the front door in [[Sharon Tate]]'s blood by her murderers.&lt;ref name="Le Pig"/&gt; Reznor told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because he "looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most".&lt;ref name="Le Pig"/&gt; He has also explained that he was fascinated by the house due to his interest in "American folklore," but has stated that he does not "want to support serial-killer bullshit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhrs3.html |title=Lost Highway Article - Rolling Stone 3-6-97 |publisher=Lynchnet.com |date=1997-03-06 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine Inch Nails toured extensively over the next few years, including a performance at [[Woodstock '94]], although he admitted to the audience that he did not like to play large venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.9inchnails.com/articles/articles.php?id=8 | title = Love It To Death: Trent Reznor Of Nine Inch Nails Preaches The Dark Gospel Of Sex, Pain, And Rock &amp; Roll | author = Jonathan Gold | publisher = ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Issue #690, archived on Painful Convictions | date = September 8, 1994 | accessdate = 2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Trent Reznor | journal = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date=January 1998 | issue = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of a follow-up to ''[[The Downward Spiral]]''.&lt;ref name = "Hell"&gt;{{cite journal | title = To Hell and back | author = Chick, Steve | journal = [[Kerrang!]] | date = March 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999 the double album ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]]'' was released. It was partially successful, but lost money for Reznor's label, so he funded the North American Fragility Tour out of his own pocket. A further six years followed before the next Nine Inch Nails album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' was released. During the intermediary period between the two records Reznor went into rehab, and was able to manage his drug addictions. After ''[[With Teeth]]'' Reznor released the concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', which has an [[alternate reality game]] themed after the album (see [[Year Zero (game)]]) which is about how the current policies of the American government will affect the world in the year 2020. After ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'s'' release in 2007 Reznor broke from large record labels, and released two albums, ''[[Ghosts I-IV]]'' and ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'' independently on his own label, ''The Null Corporation''. In 2009 Nine Inch Nails went on hiatus, following the Wave Goodbye Tour. In 2013 Nine Inch Nails returned to large record labels, signing with Columbia Records. In September the album ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' was released, and earlier, in August, the ongoing Tension 2013 tour began.

===Collaboration with other artists===
One of Reznor's earliest collaborations was a [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] side project in 1990 under the name of [[1000 Homo DJs]]. Reznor sang vocals on a cover of [[Black Sabbath]]'s "[[Supernaut (EP)|Supernaut]]". Due to legal issues with his label, Reznor's vocals had to be distorted to make his voice unrecognizable. The band also recorded additional versions with [[Al Jourgensen]] doing vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/1000+Homo+DJs | title=1000 Homo DJs Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is still debate as to which version is Reznor and which is Jourgensen, it has been definitively stated that Reznor's vocals were used in the [[TVT Records]]' ''Black Box'' box set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/black-box-waxtrax-records--the-first-13-years-r209175 | title=Black Box: WaxTrax! Records – The First 13 Years – Various Artists |publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed with another of Jourgensen's side projects, [[Revolting Cocks]], in 1990. He said: "I saw a whole side of humanity that I didn't know existed. It was decadence on a new level, but with a sense of humor."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', March 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor then sang the vocals on the 1991 Pigface track "Suck" from their first album ''[[Gub]]'', which also featured [[Steve Albini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pigface Suck (Remastered) (NIN Trent Reznor on Vocals)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46yiMPeTdT8|website=DTF4Cottoncandy on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=December 6, 2014|format=Video upload|date=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pigface – Gub|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pigface-Gub/release/424832|website=Pigface on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=December 6, 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor sang backing vocals on "Past the Mission" on [[Tori Amos]]' 1994 album ''[[Under the Pink]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative's Greatest Year|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/1994-the-40-best-records-from-mainstream-alternatives-greatest-year-20140417/tori-amos-under-the-pink-19691231|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=December 6, 2014|date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced [[Marilyn Manson]]'s first album, ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' (1994), and several tracks on Manson's albums ''[[Smells Like Children]]'' (1995) and ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996). Relations between Reznor and Manson subsequently soured, and Manson later said: "I had to make a choice between being friends and having a mediocre career, or breaking things off and continuing to succeed. It got too competitive. And he can't expect me not to want to be more successful than him."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Collins, Andrew]]: 'And The Freak Shall Inherit The Earth', ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' #146, November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor was in the David Bowie video for the song "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]" in 1997.  In the video, Reznor is a stalker who shows up wherever David Bowie goes. In a 2016 Rolling Stone article after Bowie's death, Reznor recalled how touring with Bowie in 1995-96 inspired Reznor to stay sober.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/trent-reznor-recalls-how-david-bowie-helped-him-get-sober-20160126  |title=Trent Reznor Recalls How David Bowie Helped Him Get Sober}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor produced a remix of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s song "Victory", featuring [[Busta Rhymes]], in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Puff-Daddy-The-Family-Featuring-Notorious-BIG-The--Busta-Rhymes-Victory-Remixes/release/517450 |title=Puff Daddy &amp; The Family Featuring Notorious B.I.G., The* &amp; Busta Rhymes – Victory (Remixes) (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the stage name [[Tapeworm (band)|Tapeworm]], Reznor collaborated for nearly 10 years with [[Danny Lohner]], [[Maynard James Keenan]], and [[Atticus Ross]], but the project was eventually terminated before any official material was released.&lt;ref name="Tapeworm"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nin.com/access/5_08_04/index.asp | title = Nine Inch Nails: Access | author = Trent Reznor | publisher = [[Nine Inch Nails]] | date = May 8, 2004 | accessdate = 2007-05-21 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070718105114/http://www.nin.com/access/5_08_04/index.asp | archivedate=July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only known released Tapeworm material is a reworked version of a track called "Vacant" (retitled "[[Passive (song)|Passive]]") on [[A Perfect Circle]]'s 2004 album ''[[eMOTIVe]]'',&lt;ref name="Vacant/Passive"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Perfect Circle – eMOTIVe | publisher = Sputnik Music | date = July 26, 2005 | url = http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=1021 | accessdate = 2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a track called "Potions" on [[Puscifer]]'s 2009 album ''[["C" Is for (Please Insert Sophomoric Genitalia Reference Here)|"C" Is for]]''.

In 2006, Reznor played his first "solo" shows at [[Neil Young]]'s annual [[Bridge School Benefit]]. Backed by a four piece string section, he performed stripped-down versions of many Nine Inch Nails songs.&lt;ref name="Bridge School"&gt;{{cite web | last = Maher | first = Dave | title = Brian Wilson, Neil Young, Reznor Play Bridge Benefit | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] | date = September 12, 2006 | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38490-brian-wilson-neil-young-reznor-play-bridge-benefit | accessdate = 2007-11-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127101628/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38490-brian-wilson-neil-young-reznor-play-bridge-benefit | archivedate = January 27, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor featured on [[El-P]]'s 2007 album ''[[I'll Sleep When You're Dead]]'', providing guest vocals on the track "Flyentology". Reznor co-produced [[Saul Williams]]' 2007 album ''[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]'' after Williams toured with Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and 2006. Reznor convinced Williams to release the album as a free download, while giving fans the option of paying $5 for higher quality files, or downloading all of the songs at a lower quality for free.&lt;ref name="CNET Niggy Tadust"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sandoval | first = Greg | title = Trent Reznor: Take my music, please | publisher = [[News.com]] | date=  October 30, 2007 | url = http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9807934-7.html | accessdate = 2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Entertainment Niggy Tardust"&gt;{{cite web | last = Westhoff | first = Ben | title = Trent Reznor and Saul Williams Discuss Their New Collaboration, Mourn OiNK | publisher = ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' | date=  October 30, 2007 | url = http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/trent_reznor_and_saul_williams.html | accessdate = 2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor was also credited as "Musical Consultant" on the 2004 film ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328107/fullcredits |title=Man on Fire (2004) – Full cast and crew |publisher=Imdb.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie features six Nine Inch Nails songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722153/ |title=Trent Reznor |publisher=Imdb.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has produced a number of songs for [[Jane's Addiction]] in his home studio in [[Beverly Hills]].

Reznor appeared in a live performance with [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s Lindsey Buckingham, Dave Grohl, and Queens of the Stone Age at the January [[Grammy Award]] ceremony. In an interview with a [[New Zealand]] media outlet, Reznor explained his thought process at the time that he was considering his participation in the performance:

Scoring for film kind of came up unexpectedly. It was always something I'd been interested in and it was really a great experience and I've learned a lot."

The suit alleged that Reznor "reneged on every single contract he and Malm ever entered into", and that Reznor refused to pay Malm payments to which he was contractually entitled.&lt;ref name="stabbed"&gt;{{cite web

Weeks later, Reznor filed a counter-suit in the U.S. District Court of New York, charging Malm with fraud and breach of [[fiduciary]] duties.&lt;ref name="Ex-manager MTV"&gt;{{cite web

Artist Management. This contract, according to the suit, was unlawful and immoral in that it secured Malm 20% of Reznor's ''gross'' earnings, rather than his ''net'' earnings, as is the standard practice between artists and their management. The suit also alleged that the contract secured this percentage even if Malm was no longer representing Reznor, and for all Reznor's album [[advance payment|advances]].&lt;ref name="Bares Teeth"&gt;{{cite web

Reznor stated that he began to fully understand his financial situation after tackling his addiction to drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name="Bares Teeth" /&gt; Reznor requested a financial statement from Malm in 2003, only to discover that he had only $400,000 in [[liquid assets]].

=== Beats Music ===
In January 2013, Reznor and TopSpin Media founder Ian Rogers were chosen to head [[Beats Electronics]]' new music subscription service, Project Daisy, described by Beats co-founder [[Jimmy Iovine]] as having "hardware, brand, distribution partnerships, and artist relations to differentiate Daisy from the competition".&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Austin.

January 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There was some speculation as to what Reznor's role would be within the company, but he was later named [[chief creative officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatsmusic.com/about/company/trent-reznor |title=About |publisher=Beats Music |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised that he and the other members would strive to create a music subscription service that will be like "having your own guy when you go to the record store, who knows what you like but can also point you down some paths you wouldn't have necessarily encountered".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/trent-reznor-named-creative-chief-of-beats-daisy-music-service-20130110 "Trent Reznor Named Creative Chief of Beats' Daisy Music Service."] Rollingstone.com.

Reznor has continued on in a similar role under Beats' new ownership at [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], where he has been involved in the launch of [[Apple Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Welch|first1=Chris|title=Trent Reznor on his new role at Apple: 'it's everything I asked for'|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7139201/trent-reznor-talks-new-role-at-apple|website=The Verge|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the music industry==
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning [[Universal Music Group]]—the parent company of the band's record label, [[Interscope Records]]—for their pricing and distribution plans for Nine Inch Nails' 2007 album ''Year Zero''.&lt;ref name="RollingStoneKreps"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kreps | first = Daniel | title = Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor Slams Records Labels for Sorry State of the Industry | publisher = Rolling Stone |date = May 14, 2007 | url =  https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/14/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-slams-records-labels-for-sorry-state-of-the-industry/ | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He labeled the company's retail pricing of ''Year Zero'' in Australia as "ABSURD," concluding that "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off". Reznor went on to say that as "the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more."&lt;ref name="UMG"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nin.com/tr | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | last = Reznor | first = Trent | title = Updates from Trent | date = May 13, 2007 | publisher = Nine Inch Nails | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070517041353/http://nin.com/tr/| archivedate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.&lt;ref name="Reznor Smashes UMG"&gt;{{cite web | title = Reznor Smashes UMG, Websites Write About It | publisher = The NIN Hotline | date = May 17, 2007 | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=07&amp;m=5#1179461909 | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on Universal Music Group at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to "steal" his music online instead of purchasing it legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/steal-away-steal-steal-and-steal-some-more/2007/09/18/1189881482912.html | title = Nails frontman urges fans to steal music | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = September 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | last = Moses | first = Asher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=07&amp;m=9#1189989696 | title = Trent follows up on Universal AU | publisher = The NIN Hotline | date = September 16, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to major labels===
While on tour in [[Prague]] in 2009, Reznor realized the importance of the marketing aspect of a major label when he saw a lot of promotion for [[Radiohead]]'s then-upcoming tour, but little promotion for his current Nine Inch Nails tour or any of its recently released albums. Reznor said the marketing from a major label outweighed the aspects of being independent that he liked, namely the ability to release albums whenever he wanted to avoid leaking, and to take a larger cut of the profits from record sales.&lt;ref name="spin-returntomajor"&gt;{{cite web| last = Hogan| first = Marc| title = How Radiohead Inspired Trent Reznor's Return to Major Labels| work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]| publisher = [[Buzz Media]]| date = October 15, 2012| url = https://www.spin.com/2012/10/trent-reznor-david-byrne-major-labels-destroy-angels-radiohead/| accessdate = December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor's first album released through a major label after his return was How to Destroy Angels' ''[[An Omen EP]]'' released in November 2012 through [[Columbia Records]]. On working with Columbia for the release of the EP, Reznor said that "so far it's been pleasantly pleasant".&lt;ref name="spin-returntomajor"/&gt;

In 2013, Reznor returned to Columbia Records for ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'', the eighth Nine Inch Nails studio album.

== Musical style and influence ==
Reznor's style in the early days of Nine Inch Nails was described by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine in 1995 as "self-loathing, sexual obsession, torture and suicide over a thick sludge of gnashing guitars and computer-synthesized beats".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; The magazine also said that "[Reznor], like [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] before him, has built his name on theatrics and [[nihilism]]".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; Nine Inch Nails concerts were often [[Picketing|picketed]] by [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christians]].&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; Reznor's former high school band director considered him to be "very upbeat and friendly" in reality and theorized that "all that 'dark avenging angel' stuff is marketing".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; Conversely, the owner of the recording studio where Reznor recorded the [[Pretty Hate Machine|first Nine Inch Nails album]] said of Reznor's "pain-driven" stage act, "It's planned, but it is not contrived. He's pulling that stuff out from inside somewhere. You cannot fake that delivery."&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt; Pain and sorrow came to be regarded as such defining elements of Reznor's music that a group of fans once responded with joy when told that his dog had died because "it's good for his music when he is depressed" and that "it's good to see [Reznor] back in hell, where he belongs".&lt;ref name="int12" /&gt;

Reznor possesses a [[baritone]] vocal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2013/09/nine_inch_nails_and_trent_rezn.html|title=Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor score HUGE with "Hesitation Marks" (CD Review)|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fan of [[David Bowie]], and has cited Bowie's 1977 album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' as one of his favorite albums. Reznor has stated that he played the album constantly during the recording of ''The Downward Spiral'' for inspiration.&lt;ref name = "Details" /&gt; In 1995, Nine Inch Nails toured as a co-headlining act on the North American leg of David Bowie's [[Outside Tour]]. Reznor also appeared in Bowie's video for "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]", cast as Bowie's [[stalking|stalker]]. Reznor also made several remixes for the single release of the same song, as well as a remix of "[[The Hearts Filthy Lesson]]".&lt;ref name="Afraid of Americans"&gt;{{cite web | title = David Bowie – I'm Afraid of Americans | publisher = Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r338511|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor also states in the 2010 documentary ''[[Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage]]'' that the band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] had played a major part in his childhood influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdholes.blogspot.com/2010/05/rush-beyond-lighted-stage-review.html |title=Two Assholes Talking About Nerd Stuff: Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage review |publisher=Nerdholes.blogspot.com |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he considered Rush to be "one of the best bands ever" and had gained a perspective on how keyboards could be introduced into hard rock after listening to their 1982 album ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]''.

Reznor once said that "[[Freddie Mercury]]'s death meant more to [him] than [[John Lennon]]'s", and he covered [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[News of the World (album)|Get Down Make Love]]", which was co-produced by [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] frontman [[Al Jourgensen]] and released on the single for "[[Sin (song)|Sin]]". He also expressed the significant influence that [[Coil (band)|Coil]] had on his work, saying that ''[[Horse Rotorvator]]'' was "deeply influential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14600-trent-reznor-interview-coil-nine-inch-nails | title=Trent Reznor on Coil &amp; Nine Inch Nails, Plus Recoiled Review | author=Harry Sword | publisher=The Quietus | accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many interviews with ''Musician'', ''Spin'', and ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', Reznor mentioned [[Devo]], [[The Cars]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Pere Ubu]], [[Soft Cell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=88| title=Radio One Rock Show hosted by Trent Reznor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], Ministry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuP5Vt1sjeo | title=Trent Reznor and Al Jourgensen | publisher=YouTube | date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Numan]], and [[The Cure]]'s 1985 album, ''[[The Head on the Door]]'', as important influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=f_2Hb3bIqaQC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22trent+reznor%22+%22my+bloody+valentine%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trent%20reznor%22%20%22my%20bloody%20valentine%22&amp;f=false | title=Nine Inch Nails' "The Fragile" | author=Norris, Chris | journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=January 2000 | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Todd Rundgren]], Reznor told him that he listened to Rundgren's 1973 album, ''[[A Wizard, a True Star]]'' with "great regularity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=thodoris |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interview-todd-rundgren/84364 |title=Interview: Todd Rundgren – Hit Channel |publisher=Hit-channel.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview, Reznor stated the first song he ever wrote "Down in It" was a "total rip-off" of the [[Skinny Puppy]] song "[[Dig It (Skinny Puppy song)|Dig It]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trentreznor.us/nowiamnothing/xint55.html|title=The Holland Interviews|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085557/http://trentreznor.us/nowiamnothing/xint55.html|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor's work as Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from "generic imitations" dating from the band's initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a "truer, less imitative way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

For their work on ''Girl with a Dragon Tattoo'', Reznor and Ross were nominated for the 2012 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], and won the [[2013 Grammy Awards|2013 Grammy Award]] for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Neither Reznor nor Ross was present to accept the award, but Reznor published a thank you on his Twitter profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chad Childers|title=Trent Reznor + Atticus Ross Win 2013 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack|url=http://loudwire.com/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-win-2013-grammy-award-for-best-score-soundtrack/|website=Loudwire|publisher=Loudwire Network|accessdate=December 6, 2014|date=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
During the five years following the release of ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', Reznor suffered [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and the death of his grandmother (who raised him). During this period of intense grief, he began abusing [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], and other drugs.
In 2001, Reznor successfully completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with ''[[Kerrang!|Kerrang]]'', he reflected on his self-destructive past: "There was a persona that had run its course. I needed to get my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I took a couple of years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened."&lt;ref name = "Hell"/&gt; In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is "pretty happy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Tripod.com''' is a [[web hosting service]] owned by [[Lycos]]. Originally aiming its services to college students and young adults, it was one of several sites trying to build [[Virtual community|online communities]] during the 1990s. As such, Tripod formed part of the first wave of [[user-generated content]].

==Services==
Tripod offers free and paid web hosting services, including 20 [[megabyte]]s of storage space and the ability to run [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) scripts in [[Perl]]. In addition to basic hosting, Tripod also offers a [[blog]]ging tool, a photo album manager, and the [[Trellix]] site builder for [[WYSIWYG]] page editing. Tripod's for-pay services include additional disk space, a shopping cart, [[domain name]]s, web and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]/[[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] email.

==History==
Tripod originated in 1992 with two [[Williams College]] classmates, [[Bo Peabody]] and Brett Hershey, along with [[Dick Sabot]], an economics professor at the school. The company was headquartered in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], with Peabody as CEO. Although it would eventually focus on the Internet, Tripod also published a magazine, ''Tools for Life'', that was distributed with textbooks, and offered a discount card for students.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, Stuart. "Interpublic invests in an Internet provider aimed at 'the transition generation' of young adults". ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 28, 1997, p. D5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website launch===
The domain name Tripod.com was created on September 29, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tripod.com Tripod.com Site Info] Alexa&lt;/ref&gt; and the site officially launched in 1995 after operating in "sneak-preview mode" for a period. Billed as a "hip Web site and pay service for and by college students", it offered how-to advice on practical issues that might concern young people when first living away from home. It planned to charge a minimal fee and make money primarily on commissions from partners who would sell products on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Victoria. "Board Bulletin". ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 1995, p. R22.&lt;/ref&gt; Other services available included [[résumé]] writing features and a simple [[home page]] builder.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

Although the feature was an afterthought originally, Tripod soon became known as a place where people could create free web pages, competing with the likes of [[Yahoo! GeoCities]] and [[Angelfire]].&lt;ref&gt;Akst, Daniel. "So You're Ready for a Web Page". ''Los Angeles Times'', June 24, 1996, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticizing [[AOL]], the existing leader in this space, for its "[[Closed platform|walled-garden]]" approach, Peabody described the company's aims: "Our idea is to build a community through user-created and user-based content."&lt;ref&gt;Sreenivasan, Sreenath. "New Neighborhood, No Money Down". ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 1997, p. D5.&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer in ''The Washington Post'' recommended Tripod over GeoCities for giving users an easier URL to remember, and because GeoCities sites had a tendency to crash computers.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzman, Monica Neal. "It didn't take a miracle to share their trip. Just the Web". ''The Washington Post'', July 11, 1999, p. E1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment and buyout===
After receiving an initial investment of US$4 million in [[venture capital]], led by New Enterprises Associates, in May 1997 Tripod took an additional round of investment totaling US$10 million. By this time the company had grown to 40 employees and was hoping to reach profitability by the 1st quarter of 1998. The second group of investors included [[Interpublic Group of Companies|Interpublic]], which paid US$2.5 million for a stake in Tripod estimated at 10 percent, thus implying a valuation of US$25 million for the company overall.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt; As it turned out, Tripod would be sold in February 1998 to Lycos for a reported US$58 million in stock.&lt;ref&gt;Technology Brief. "Lycos Inc.: Acquisition of Tripod Inc. Expected to Be Announced". ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 3, 1998, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lycos also ended up owning Tripod's former competitor Angelfire, picked up as part of the acquisition of [[WhoWhere]]. The two properties were run concurrently, with Tripod continuing to focus on its college-age audience while Angelfire tended to attract [[Secondary school|high school]] users. In early 2001, Tripod reached 6 million registered users (up from nearly 1 million at the time it was acquired) and was expanding at an estimated 250,000 new sites per month. However, generating profits remained difficult, with an analyst opining that they needed better user profiling so the sites could generate the results expected by advertisers. They also had the challenge of not alienating users while trying to make money.&lt;ref&gt;Musgrove, Mike. "A Home Page Of One's Own: Free, Easy Site-Hosting Services Tap Into the Urge to Post". ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 28, 2001, p. H1.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, Tripod and Angelfire also introduced account options allowing users to pay in order to keep their sites ad-free. GeoCities, now acquired by [[Yahoo!]], would follow suit not long afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Leslie. "Many 'Free' Home-Page Sites Putting the Squeeze on Users". ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 10, 2002, p. H7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain name ==
Web sites generally are a [[subdomain]] of tripod.com. However, users can pay a monthly charge and own a domain name. Paying in this manner also allows for other benefits, such as more disk space for the site which allows the site owner to put more information onto it, and personalized email accounts, ''e.g.'', yourname@yoursite.com.

==Shutdown rumor==
On January 18, 2009, the [[blog]] [[TechCrunch]] erroneously reported that Lycos would be shutting down the Tripod service on February 15, 2009. In fact, the February shutdown applied only to Lycos Europe and so only users of that service were affected. By the afternoon following the initial TechCrunch article, Lycos posted an entry on its Lycos Buzz blog assuring readers that Lycos US and the Tripod service were not shutting down. TechCrunch subsequently corrected the error in its original article.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Geoff. [http://www.appscout.com/2009/01/lycos_mail_tripod_deathnot_so_1.php Lycos Mail, Tripod Death--Not So Fast]." AppScout. 18 Jan. 2009. Web. 22 Aug. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8612">This Wikipedia page deals with various aspects '''UAE company formation''' in [[Dubai]] and other emirates in [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]].

==Types of Business License==

The types of Business Licenses issued in Dubai and other emirates in United Arab Emirates (UAE) are professional, commercial and industrial. The professional license covers services offered by professionals, artisans and craftsmen; the commercial license covers all trading and commercial activities performed with an intention of making profit ; the industrial license covers all industrial and manufacturing activities. The type of license depends on the business activity of the company or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baijumasoodu.com/articles/details/39|title=Types of Business License|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction of the Company==

In UAE, a company can be formed in any of the following three jurisdictions: Mainland, Free Zone and Offshore. The licensing authority in mainland is the Department of Economic Development of the respective emirates. In Free Zones, the relevant Free Zone Authority will be the licensing authority and respective Offshore Authority in the case of Offshore jurisdiction.

==Legal Forms of Business==
The common legal forms of business in the UAE are:
* [[Sole proprietorship]]
* Civil Company
* [[Limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]] (LLC)
* [[Partnership]]
* Private Share [[Holding company|Holding Company]]
* [[Share (finance)|Public Share]] Holding Company
* Branches
* Representative Offices
Under UAE Law, there are five types of business establishments applicable to foreign entities interested in establishing a formal presence in the UAE. UAE government has implemented wide range of economic and administrative policies which has made UAE an attractive business destination.

A company can create a permanent establishment, create an entity in a UAE free zone, enter into a commercial agency agreement, establish a branch office, create a civil company (currently possible to establish a company in Dubai,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/dubai|title=Business Setup in Dubai FreeZone {{!}} Dubai Freezone Company Formation {{!}} WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharjah &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/sharjah|title=Sharjah Freezone Incorporation {{!}}Company Registration Sharjah {{!}}WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ajman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/ajman|title=Ajman Freezone {{!}}Company Formation &amp; Registration in Ajma FreeZone {{!}}WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Limited Liability Company ===

A [[Limited Liability Company]] (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 1 (as per Article 8 of the Federal Commercial Company Law of 2015) and a maximum of 50 [[shareholders]] whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum [[share capital]] (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company’s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line.

A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a [[Memorandum of Association]] or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.

=== Free Zone Company ===

Establishing a business entity in one of the UAE's many [[Free trade zone]]s (FTZs) can be an attractive option for foreign investors. UAE has over 35 FTAs of which more than 20 are located in Dubai. 
The main attraction for setting up a company in a free zone is that there is no UAE national shareholding required. All free zones in UAE offer the following incentives:
* 100% foreign ownership of the enterprises
* 100% cent import and export tax exemptions
* 100% repatriation of capital and profits
* No currency restrictions
* [[Corporate tax]] exemption for 15 years, renewable for an additional 15 years
* No personal [[income taxes]]

UAE Free Zone companies can only operate within the free zone boundaries and are generally limited to performing solely those activities listed in their license(s).

It is mandatory for every company registered in the Free Zone to lease minimum office space within that particular Free Zone. A Free Zone Company can obtain UAE residence visas for the director, shareholder and also employees of the company through the Free Zone where it is registered.

=== Offshore Company ===

UAE [[Offshore company]] registration is a very popular method of doing business in the Middle East region. 
In UAE there are three offshore jurisdictions – Dubai (Jebel Ali Offshore Company)  [[Ras Al Khaimah]]and Ajman. They offer similar services but serve different strategic goals of offshore company registration.The Jebel Ali Offshore Company is an International Business Crown/holds the only offshore vehicle that is permitted to own / hold real estate in the Emirate of Dubai.

The RAK Offshore and the RAK International Company (RAKIC) are International Business Companies. They provide a flexible and credible option for foreign investors to register an offshore company in UAE without the need to establish a physical presence in the UAE.

UAE Offshore companies offer the following benefits:
* No Corporate tax
* 100% foreign ownership
* Limited Liability Company
* No TIEAs
* Absolute Privacy and Confidentiality
* Ability to maintain multi-currency Bank accounts in the UAE
* Virtual office facilities available in the UAE

=== Branch / Representative Office ===

A branch office has the same legal identity as its [[parent company]] and conducts business under the name of its parent company. A branch office may only be engaged in activities similar to those of its parent company but it is not permitted to carry on the business of importing the products of its parent company, a function reserved for local trade agents. In some cases the Branch of a foreign company are required to obtain an additional license from UAE Ministry of Economy.

[[Representative office]], on the other hand, is limited to promoting its parent company’s activities i.e. gathering information and soliciting orders and projects to be performed by the company’s head office.

A UAE national must be appointed as a ‘service agent’ for the branch or representative office.

=== Civil Company ===

A civil company is a business partnership for professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants.
A civil company is 100% owned by the professional partners (except for engineering civil company), however, a UAE National Local Service Agent is normally required.  
A foreign company can be a partner in a civil company, as long as the foreign company is in the same field as the civil company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">'''The wrongful imprisonment of Victor Nealon''' occurred in 1996 when the British [[Mail carrier|postman]] Victor Nealon was mistakenly convicted of attempted rape. He was released in 2013 after spending 17 years in jail, 10 years more than his recommended tariff, because he continued to protest his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/31/miscarriage-justice-victims-compensation-victor-nealon|title=Miscarriage of justice victims will find it harder to get compensation, lawyers say|accessdate=7 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27468183|title=Wrongfully convicted man Victor Nealon gets apology||accessdate=18 January 2015|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/13/man-wrongly-convicted-sexual-assault-freed-17-years|title=Man wrongly convicted of sexual assault is freed after 17 years in jail|author=Gwyn Topham|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to a [[Murder_in_English_law#Sentencing|discretionary life sentence]] in 1998 and was refused [[parole]] because he refused to admit guilt. He was denied [[Legal_aid#England_and_Wales|legal aid]] and in 2014, the [[Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] turned down his claim for compensation and demanded he pay £2,500 costs claiming the [[DNA]] analysis "did not show beyond reasonable doubt that the claimant did not commit the offence." 

The [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] commented that they should have investigated the case more thoroughly and commission chairman Richard Foster said “I regret the fact in this particular case we missed something and I apologise to all concerned for the fact we did so.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/people/lawyer-in-the-news/compensation-fight-over-victor-nealons-wrongful-conviction/5045598.fullarticle|title=Compensation fight over Victor Nealon’s wrongful conviction|work=The Law Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wrongly-convicted-men-launch-new-case-against-the-justice-secretary-9985773.html|title=Wrongly convicted men launch new case against the Justice Secretary|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/irish-man-wrongfully-imprisoned-for-nearly-20-years-to-sue-british-government|title=Irish man wrongfully imprisoned for 17 years to sue British Government|work=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36012897&lt;/ref&gt;
