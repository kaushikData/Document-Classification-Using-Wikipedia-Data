==History==

Sigiran(d) or Sigiramnus, later known as [[Sigiramnus|Saint Cyran]], founded a monastery at Longoret around 632 CE on land offered to him by [[Dagobert I]] for that purpose. Dagobert frequently visited the monastery to hunt. The monastery later became an abbey and a royal foundation named after Saint Cyran. It kept Saint Cyran's relics, as well as those of saints Génitour, Sylvain and Fructueux, all of which were later re-housed in 1860 in a bronze reliquary.

In 1620 [[Jean Duvergier de Hauranne]], who introduced [[Jansenism]] into France, became the abbey's commendatory abbot. Opposed to the [[Jesuits]], he fell into disgrace under Cardinal [[Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu|Richelieu]] and was imprisoned. The abbey suffered from its association with his fall. It was officially suppressed in 1712 and destroyed on the orders of the [[archbishop of Bourges]]. The abbey's monks scattered and its goods were sold in 1739. The buildings were sold as state property in 1790, and all that remains of the main abbey buildings is the 15th-century ''chambre des hôtes''. Some of its granges, stables and mills also survive. A few decades after 1790 Moulins de Paris bought it and later turned it into holiday homes for its employees.

The abbey was converted to have a more varied frontage. In June 1975 it was bought by [[Marcel Lefebvre]]'s sister, who renamed it Saint-Michel Abbey and used it to house the sisters of the [[Society of St. Pius X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laportelatine.org/ordres/ordfsspx/soeursfsspx.php|title=Fraternité Sacerdotale Saint-Pie X - FSSPX - SSPX - La Porte Latine - Catholiques de Tradition - Mgr Lefebvre - Mgr Fellay - Les Soeurs de la Fraternité Saint-Pie X|first=District de France|last=FSSPX|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It protected [[Paul Touvier]], fleeing from charges of [[crimes against humanity]], until the police seized his baggage there on May 21, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud Thomazo: ''Les grands scandales de l'histoire de France'', éditions Larousse, 2013, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italics title}}
'''''Abhisheka''''' or '''''{{IAST|abhiṣeka}}''''' is a [[Sanskrit]] term akin that means a [[prayer|devotional activity]];  an enacted prayer,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meditation]], [[contemplation]], [[intention]]ality and [[wish]]ing are inherent in this use of prayer.&lt;/ref&gt; [[rite of passage]] and/or religious [[rite]]. Within this range of senses, ''abhiṣeka'' is common to [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

==Hinduism==
An abhiṣeka is conducted by priests by pouring libations on the image of the deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of [[mantra]]s. Usually, offerings such as [[milk]], [[yogurt]], [[ghee]], honey, [[panchamrita]], [[sesame oil]], [[rose water]], [[sandalwood]] paste may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed. This rite is routinely performed in some [[Hindu temple|Hindu]] and [[Jain temple]]s.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

A ''Rudrābhiṣeka'' or abhiṣeka of [[Rudra]] is performed on [[lingam]]s.

==Buddhism==
===Esoteric Buddhism===
{{Main|Empowerment (Vajrayana)}}
[[File:Name List of Abhiseka.jpg|thumb|right|List of Abhiseka initiates in 812 at Takaosan-ji (高雄山寺)]]
In [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], an abhiṣeka can be a method for performing [[pointing-out instruction]]s, a way to offer blessings of a lineage to participants, or it can be an [[empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] to begin a particular meditation practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward (2008) p.114&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual is present in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as well as in [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]] and in [[Shingon Buddhism]].

The abhiṣeka was originally used as a consecration rite. Water from the four oceans was poured out of golden jars onto the head of royalty. It was used during a monarch's [[accession day|accession ceremony]] and also his [[investiture]] ceremony.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=abhiseka|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tantric Buddhism===
The abhiseka rite is a prelude for initiation into mystical teaching. There are four classes of abhiseaka, each being associated with one of the four [[Tantra]]s. They are ''master consecration'', ''secret consecration'', ''knowledge of prajna'', and ''the fourth consecration''.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Shingon Buddhism===
The {{nihongo|abhiṣeka ritual|灌頂|kanjō}} in [[Shingon Buddhism]] is the initiation rite used to confirm that a student of esoteric Buddhism has now graduated to a higher level of practice. The [[kanji]] used literally mean "pouring from the peak", which poetically describes the process of passing on the master's teachings to the student. The rite was popular in China during the [[Tang dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;Orzech, Charles, D. (2011). [https://web.archive.org/web/20140317152400/http://www.shin-ibs.edu/documents/pwj3-13/07Orzech.pdf On the Subject of Abhiseka], Pacific World 3rd series, No 13, 113-128&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kūkai]], founder of Shingon, studied there extensively before introducing this rite to the Japanese Buddhist establishment of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Ryūichi | last = Abe | year = 1999 | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kūkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A separate initiation rite exists for the general public called the {{nihongo||結縁灌頂|kechien kanjō|}}, and symbolizes their initiation into esoteric Buddhism. This rite is generally only offered at [[Mount Kōya]] in [[Wakayama Prefecture]] in Japan, but it can be offered under qualified masters and under proper auspices outside Japan, albeit very rarely.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The Shingon rite utilizes one of the two [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], depending on the occasion. In esoteric ritual, after the student receives the [[samaya]] precepts, the teacher of the esoteric Buddhism assumes the role of the teacher, usually [[Vairocana|Mahavairocana Buddha]], while the master and student repeat specific mantras in a form of dialogue taken from esoteric Buddhist sutras. The student, who is blindfolded, then throws a flower upon the Mandala that is constructed, and where it lands (i.e. which deity) helps dictate where the student should focus his devotion on the esoteric path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Yoshito | last = Hakeda | year = 1972 | pages=44 | title = Kūkai: Major Works, Translated, with an Account of His Life and a Study of His Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the student's blindfold is removed and a [[vajra]] is placed in hand.

==Jainism==
''Abhisheka'' in Jainism means the ritual of consecration of the image of Jina.{{sfn|Maniura|Shepherd|2006|pp=73-74}}

==Famous Abhishekas==
*Mahaabhishekam conducted at the [[Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga|Mahakaleshwar]] temple in [[Ujjain]].

==Cultural examples==
*In the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra|Mahavairocana Sutra]]'', Mahavairocana Buddha reveals the Mandala of the [[Womb Realm]] to [[Vajrasattva]] and teaches the rites that relate to the Womb Mandala which are known as, and an example of, ''abhiṣeka''.
*In Hinduism, the god [[Rama]] performed abhiṣeka after installing a [[jyotirlinga]] in [[Rameswaram]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">__NOTOC__
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] continues a tradition found in Islam of not using depictions in art of people considered a [[Manifestation of God]]. This includes both images and drama. There exist several photographs and paintings of both  the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and these are viewed by Bahá'ís on rare occasions, typically on an organized [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to [[Haifa, Israel]].

The existence of images of the religion's founders is not offensive to Bahá'ís. However, they are encouraged to not display them in private homes or in public, and to treat them with a special degree of reverence and respect.

[[Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote:
:"There is no objection that the believers look at the [[Bahá'u'lláh#Photographs and imagery|picture of Bahá'u'lláh]], but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, December 6, 1939, republished in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 540)

Shoghi Effendi has also written in the ''Directives from the Guardian'' regarding the portrait of the [[Báb]]:
:"The portrait of the Báb should be regarded as an inestimable privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on."&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi: ''Directives from the Guardian'' Published in 1973.  Accessed on February 2, 2006 from http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-115.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jelle:  ''The Babi Question You Mentioned?The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of the Netherlands'', pg. 243.

In October 1982 [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]], a [[Hand of the Cause]], a position of prominence in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], presided at the official inauguration ceremony for the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Haiti Anis Zunuzi Baha'i School is dedicated|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1983 | number = 625 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =2 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial board of directors were Counsellor [[Farzam Arbab]], Dr. Nabil Hanna, Benjamin Levy, Dr. Iraj Majzub and Georges Marcellus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Zunuzi School Board of Directors named |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1983 | number = 625 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =4 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school principal came from Germany in 1980 (Hans J Thimm, later of [[List of schools in Haiti|Union School]], Haiti.&lt;ref name="facebk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =  Thimm | first = Hans J. | title =  Hans J.

The area has been built up with private homes and businesses&lt;ref name="anis"/&gt; and the school has been broken into twice forcing security infrastructure additions.&lt;ref name="CurrentAnis"/&gt; The arable land in the vicinity of the school is no longer being worked due to lack of water and lack of initiative on the part of the youth who prefer to find other means of employment that are easier or more lucrative.The [[Mona Foundation]] has supported the school with funding for support of satellite schools, scholarships, regular summer camps, and general funding as well as acting as a mediator of larger scale funding for infrastructure improvements.&lt;ref name="Mona-Anias"/&gt;

==Program==
The program at the school involves:&lt;ref name="CurrentAnis"/&gt;
* In September 2003 the school opened an afternoon program for children who were too old, too poor, or too busy to attend the morning sessions.
* There are classes on moral education, English, folk dancing, sewing, computer classes, and crafts and an annual school outing.
* Materials used start in Kindergarten through 4th grade were prepared in Columbia that concentrate on building spiritual qualities. In grades 3 and 4 they follow lessons from the [[The Virtues Project|Virtues Guide]] in French. In grades 5 to 9 they follow the pre-youth courses: “Brises of Confirmation”, “Glimmerings of Hope”, and “Walking the straight Path”.
* Teacher training has been a part of the school's schedule for the past 15 years. However, with the turnover in staff there are no teachers that have been here longer than five, and most only one or two, years. This requires a constant assessment of needs and further instruction to fill the gaps.&lt;ref name="AnisBack"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Anis Zunuzi School Background |work=Projects &amp; Initiatives; Projects we support |publisher=Mona Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.monafoundation.org/zunuzi/background.htm |accessdate=2010-02-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112181024/http://www.monafoundation.org/zunuzi/background.htm |archivedate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;
*The school has charged $10&lt;!--WHOSE DOLLARS. THE USA??--&gt; per month per child, although for many even this amount is not affordable.&lt;ref name="AnisBack"/&gt;
*The main school is responsible for two satellite schools in Guerot and Pont Benoit, each serving around 50 students:&lt;ref name="AnisBack"/&gt; the ''New Horizon School'', which is run by Bernard Martinod, a French architect and the ''Georges Marcellus School'' in the rural village of Gureot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What are some of the activities of Mona Foundation? |work=Mona Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Mona Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.monafoundation.org/faqs.htm#activities |accessdate=2010-02-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122100807/http://www.monafoundation.org/faqs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Development projects==
The school has acted as a base of a number of development projects:&lt;ref&gt;The main source of information about individual projects ended publication in 1990 so further information isn't available as yet.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1984 the school began publication of a quarterly newspaper, "Timun" (which in Haitian Creole means children or, more literally, "little people") and subtitled "Development of Baha'i Education in Haiti."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =The World; Haiti |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1984 | number = 645 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =13 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*With the help of [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], a food program was started. The first grade teacher noticed a great difference in his 6-8 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Haiti - Anis Zunuzi School: Annual report |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1985 | number = 645 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =3 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before, many children in the area only ate once a day (in the afternoon or evening), and were tired during the mornings. The poorer families with many children and little income even skipped a day or two. In this situation, the lunch provided by the school helped increase the students' receptivity.
*When the school started in 1980, the average age of students starting school was 10 years. When the school became the springboard for six pre-school centers managed by the school's Development Project in several neighboring villages, parents were even more encouraged to send their children to school at an earlier age. After about five years, the situation had normalized, and students entering first grade were now mostly 6-7 year olds.
*From 1983 to 1984 funding from the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and the [[Universal House of Justice]] was spent on a development project run through the school. 20 volunteers from the school were trained in various subjects. Initially a survey encompassing 98 households and 216 individuals in Lilavois, Depio, Savanne Blonde, Ségur and Cesleste was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Haiti-Zunuzi School aids development project |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1985 | number = 650 | ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=10–11 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mini-cooperatives and women's committees met discussing possible initiatives. In Lilavois and [[Liancourt, Artibonite|Liancourt]] they were interested in crafts, cooking, sewing and, to some extent, literacy and upgrading of those skills. In the Artibonite valley they created 17 mini-cooperatives composed of friends who invest in commercial or agricultural projects with their own money in a [[microfinance]] arrangement. "Animation" techniques and quotes from Bahá'í literature were compiled. Demonstration gardens were set up. The Local Spiritual Assembly of Liancourt carried development after the project in their area independently from the initial work through the school.  Four village early childhood education centers were built, with teachers being partially supported by the parents in those villages. Projects continued to advance in 1986.&lt;ref name="BN668"&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Haiti -Zunuzi School aids development project |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1986 | number = 668 | ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=8–12 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A technical-vocational program developed through the school in 1985 established a small iron and wood workshop in a modest building. With funding from the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), tools were procured, and the first seven apprentices were trained. The workshop produced furniture, seedling racks, a sand sifter, bee-keeping hives and frames, and decorative and protective ironwork for windows and gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = The World; Haiti |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1986 | number = 664 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =13 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this program ceased around 2002 when the schools program focused on primary grades.&lt;ref name="CurrentAnis"/&gt;
* After receiving seed funding from the [[Pan American Development Foundation]] in 1985-6, the school initiated a grafter tree project producing 80,000 seedlings a year. This was extended and accelerated in 1987.&lt;ref name="BN682"&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Development - A look at programs around the world; Americas; Agriculture and forestry;|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1987 | number = 682 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =4 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; And teacher orientation and training to further integrate school based development projects and schooling and the Spiritual Assembly of Lilavois supervised projects in its area.&lt;ref name="BN668"/&gt;
* In May 1986 filming for a documentary on the school was begun and it evolved into a 20-minute documentary video ''From Haitian Roots'' about education and development projects accomplished by the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Film documents Anis Zunuzi School's Development Project |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1986 | number = 668 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Nolley | first = Charles | title = Charles Nolley; Honors/Awards | work = Division of Digital Learning and Media Design | publisher = [[Governors State University]]| year = 2010| url =http://www.govst.edu/dlom/dlmd/default.aspx?id=24244#Honors | accessdate = 2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the first years, a primer (''Bondye Bon'') and a second-year reader (''Bo lakay nou'') were developed in Creole to help children read and write in their native language. In 1987 the school developed a third-grade French-language reader, ''Ouvrons la Porte'', to help in the transition from [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]] to [[French language|French]] by introducing one French sound at a time while otherwise using already known Creole letters and words. While methods employed by most other schools  enabled students to read (but not understand) French mainly by rote memorizing, the three books (developed by Matty Bellows Thimm, the second school principal) made students functional in literacy. All books use pictures and stories containing Bahá'í principles, although they do not refer specifically to the religion.&lt;ref name="BN682"/&gt;

==Recent situation==
The school has a [[Facebook]] presence.&lt;ref name="facebk"/&gt; In September 2009 there was filming for a documentary about Mona Foundation projects including the Anís Zunúzí school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Zamani | first = Payam | title = A Visit To Haiti: Could Education Be The Answer? | newspaper = Huffington Post | publisher = HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | date = November 24, 2009 | url =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/payam-zamani/a-visit-to-haiti-can-educ_b_368198.html | accessdate = 2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =  narom | first = | title = From Idaho to Haiti | work = | publisher = | date = September 13, 2009  | url =http://www.narom.net/2009/09/13/from-idaho-to-haiti/ | accessdate = 2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zandra |first=Ruhi |title=Video Project Notes – After the Interview |work=Projects &amp; Initiatives; Projects we support; Anis Zunuzi School; Growth |publisher=Mona Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.monafoundation.org/zunuzi/growth.htm#annexvideo |accessdate=2010-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202235854/http://www.monafoundation.org/zunuzi/growth.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=narom |first= |title=Haiti Highlights: Day 3 – CAFT &amp; Anis Zunuzi |work= |publisher= |date=September 20, 2009 |url=http://www.wushuzilla.com/2009/09/20/haiti-highlights-day-3-caft-anis-zunuzi/ |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=narom |first= |title=Haiti Highlights: Day 4 – Anis Zunuzi |work= |publisher= |date=September 21, 2009 |url=http://www.wushuzilla.com/2009/09/21/haiti-highlights-day-4-anis-zunuzi/ |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal of the Anís Zunúzí School reported on January 17, 2010 that the school buildings were generally still standing after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]&lt;ref name="facebk"/&gt; and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Events and Updates |work=Projects &amp; Initiatives; Projects we support; Anis Zunuzi School |publisher=Mona Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.monafoundation.org/news-events.htm |accessdate=2010-02-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122100830/http://www.monafoundation.org/news-events.htm |archivedate=22 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="BWN755"/&gt; The group has since organized under the name ''Love for Haiti''; it had organized spontaneously, largely through [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="Hobok"/&gt; The group gave a presentation on their Haiti experience at St. Matthews Parish Hall in Hoboken, NJ on Feb. 18, and returned to Haiti in March.

The '''Bahá'í Faith in Macao''' (also spelled Macau) was established much later than in China due, most likely, to the unique conditions of [[Macau]] being a Portuguese colony until 1999 and it being somewhat in the shadow of Hong Kong and larger centers in mainland China like Shanghai. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] arrived in Shanghai in 1862 and Hong Kong in 1870 but not in Macau until 1953.

== Beginnings and community growth ==

In 1953, along with other remaining parts of the globe where no Bahá'ís resided, Macau became a particular goal for expatriate Baha'is to locate. On October 20, 1953, Mrs. Frances Heller, a Bahá'í from California moved there to reside.
 
By 1954 there were four Bahá'ís in Macau – all expatriates – but they formed a cohesive group and became designated as a Bahá'í Group. 

On July 15, 1954 the first resident of Macau declared his belief in [[Bahá'u'lláh]] after studying this system of belief for five months—Mr. Harry P.F. Yim (Yen Pei-feng or Yim Pui Fung), a small-business proprietor from Canton (Guangzhou), China. In October 1954 the second Macanese, Mr. Paul Kao became a Bahá'í. In that year, Mr. Manuel Ferreira, became the first Portuguese to become a Bahá'í in Macau.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

By April 21, 1958 there were enough Baha’is so that Macau could elect its first [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]]. In 1960 the first all-Chinese Local Spiritual Assembly was elected.&lt;ref name="Sims"&gt;Sims, Barbara R. (1991) “The Macau Bahá'í Community in the Early Years”, http://bahai-library.com/east-asia/macau/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s more pioneers arrived to continue to lay the foundation of the Bahá'í community in Macau and to expand its presence to the nearby islands of Taipa and Coloane. By 1973, there were eighteen believers spread out in three localities, the [[Macau Peninsula]], [[Taipa]] and [[Coloane]]. Later the membership climbed to 32.

In March 1974, mainly due to teaching efforts of several pioneers and travel teachers from places such as Malaysia, the Bahá'í membership climbed to 36 adults with eleven youth. A few months later reports showed 47 adult Bahá'ís and twelve youth in the three areas of Macau. A later statistical report, indicated there were 68 Bahá'ís, including nineteen youth.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

In the years since the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Macau in 1989, the Macau Bahá'í community continued to expand, and in the ''2009 Macau Yearbook'' their numbers are listed as 2,500, with three Local Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;Macau Yearbook 2009. Government Information Bureau of the Macau Special Administrative Region, December 2009 http://yearbook.gcs.gov.mo/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==

Administratively, in the early 1950s Macau was under the jurisdiction of the [http://www.bahai.us/ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States], but after the National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia was elected in 1957 they were administered by that body.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt; 

In April 1974 the National Spiritual Assembly of Hong Kong was elected with Macau included in its jurisdiction. Two residents of Macau were elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Hong Kong|Bahá'ís of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

In 1982 the Local Spiritual Assembly of Macau (peninsular) was granted certification by the government which was equivalent to its recognition as an incorporated charitable body.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

In 1989 the number of Bahá'ís in Macau was such that, together with its status as a distinct territory, [[The Universal House of Justice]] gave permission for Macau to elect its own National Spiritual Assembly. It was the third National Spiritual Assembly in Chinese territory. Taiwan was the first, in 1967, with Hong Kong the second.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

== Modern community ==
 
Despite the agreement to transfer the sovereignty of Macau to the People's Republic of China in 1999 and its designation as a [[special administrative region]] (SAR) of China, the position of the Bahá'í Faith in Macau - its administration, membership and communities - in the context of local laws has remained unchanged. The "National" Spiritual Assembly is now referred to as the “Spiritual Assembly” or “Main Spiritual Assembly” in Chinese and still retains jurisdiction over the Local Spiritual Assemblies in Macau. 

The Local Spiritual Assemblies of the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane are elected respectively once a year. The nine members of each Local Spiritual Assembly are elected from the generality of Bahá'í residents of the community through secret votes in a form of [[non-partisan democracy]]. Electioneering of any sort, candidacy and other tactics common in most political elections is prohibited. 

The [Main] Spiritual Assembly of Macau is elected in a two-stage process. In the first stage, the entire Bahá'í population is divided into 19 electoral units, and each unit elects a delegate from the adult Bahá'ís residing within its electoral unit. The 19 delegates elect the nine members of the [Main] Spiritual Assembly at the annual National Convention. 

Like numerous communities around the world, the Macau Bahá'í Community is heavily engaged in community-building activities in Macau: “meetings that strengthen the devotional character of the community; classes that nurture the tender hearts and minds of children; groups that channel the surging energies of junior youth; circles of study, open to all, that enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on equal footing and explore the application of the teachings to their individual and collective lives. “ [ Ref: Universal House of Justice, “To the Bahá'ís of the World” Ridvan 2010) 

Bahá’ís all around the world as well as in Macau have adopted an education and training program which caters to the spiritual needs of its participants and is arranged for different age groups as follows:
Ages 5 – 7: Children’s spiritual education classes Grade 1; 
Ages 8 – 11: Children’s spiritual education classes Grade 2; 
Ages 12 – 14: Junior youth spiritual empowerment program; 
Ages 15 and onwards: A sequence of 8 courses

The above systematic sequence of training courses is able to develop in participants a meaningful spiritual life and enable them, in various ways, to serve society. The above programs are usually delivered in the participants’ homes in small groups. An individual need not be a Bahá’í to take these courses.

In public articles and briefings the Bahá'í Faith is recognized as one of the five major religions of the Macau SAR and was included in religious delegations to mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;See Chinese Articles: 1. ycwb.com/xkb/2006-09/21/content_1221043.htm 2. www.jxmzj.gov.cn/2006-12/20061218115701.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community relations initiatives ==

In 1988, the [[School of the Nations (Bahá'í – Macau)|School of the Nations]] - a Bahá'í-inspired school in Taipa - was established. It is owned by the [http://www.badi-foundation.org/ Badi Foundation]. As an international school, it provides an internationally oriented English-medium educational program to meet the needs of both expatriate and local families. Like many other initiatives around the world, both the Badi Foundation and the School of the Nations’ efforts are examples of endeavors to translate some of the ideals and concepts of the Bahá'í Faith into actions that are of benefit to society at large.

In recent years, [http://www.newlightbook.com/ New Millennium Publications], based in Macau, was established and makes more and more literature on the Bahá’í Faith in Chinese available to Chinese readers.

===Relations with the People's Republic of China===
Since there is no administrative structure for the Bahá'í Faith in mainland China at present, the Macau Bahá'í Community, together with the [[Baha'i Faith in Hong Kong|Hong Kong Bahá'í Community]], frequently act as liaison and contact points with the relevant government agencies of the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

The Macau Bahá'í Community has been involved with exchanges, conferences and events with government, academics, and non-governmental organizations that explore and share the application of the Bahá'í teachings to the advancement of society.

The following is a non-exhaustive timeline of some of the recent activities of the Macau Bahá'í Community involving various institutions and government agencies of the People's Republic of China.

{{Jainism}}
'''''Bandha''''' (also ''karma-bandha'') in Jainism, is the mutual intermingling of the [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] and ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' (fine matter).{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}} ''Bandha'' (Bondage) comes immediately after the ''[[asrava]]'' (influx of ''karmas'').{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=215}}

== Overview ==
According to the Jain text [[Tattvartha sutra]], the activities that causes the bondage (or ''bandha'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=113}}
*Wrong belief
*Non-abstinence
*Negligence
*Passions

According to the Jain text ''[[Samayasāra]]'', a right believer is free from the ''karma-bandha'' i.e. bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Kundkund's Samayasara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwPT79iyRHMC|year=2012|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-3-8|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Champat Rai Jain]], an influential Jain writer of the 20th century in his book ''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=622–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The next thing to understand in this connection is the effect of the action of matter on the soul. We have said that the fusion of spirit and matter results in the bondage of the soul. This is literally true; for the union of substances always tends to limit their natural functions, though new properties and faculties arise in consequence of it. As hydrogen and oxygen, which are gaseous by nature, are robbed of their natural ‘freedom’, i.e., of their gaseous nature, by combining with each other in the form of water, so does the soul become crippled in respect of its natural functions in consequence of its union with matter. This is the bondage, meaning, as it does, the suspension and vitiation of the natural functions and properties of the soul-substance, which are held in check for the time being...}}

== Classification ==
The bondage is of four kinds:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=114}}
# according to the nature or species of karma
# depending upon the duration of karma
# Fruition of karma, and
# The quantity of space-points of karma

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9981">'''Barbara G. Walker''' (born July 2, 1930, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is an American [[author]] and [[feminist]]. She is an influential [[knitting]] expert and the author of several classic encyclopedic knitting references, despite "not taking to it at all" when she first learned in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Malcolm | first = T | year = Fall 2007 | title = Knitting's old guard speaks out | journal = Vogue Knitting | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 68&amp;ndash;84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skep&gt;{{cite web|last1=Druchunas|first1=Donna|title=Barbara G. Walker, The Skeptical Feminist|url=http://skepchick.org/2009/01/barbara-g-walker-the-skeptical-feminist/|website=skepchic.org|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other topics she has written about are [[religion]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[spirituality]], and [[mythology]] from the viewpoint of [[Neolithic Europe|pre-Indo-European]] [[neolithic]] [[matriarchy|matriarchies]].

==Books==

===Knitting===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Walker authored several volumes of knitting references which have become landmarks for their comprehensiveness and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
  | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Kay
  | first2 = Ann | last2 = Shayne
  | title = Mason-Dixon Knitting: The Curious Knitter's Guide
  | publisher = [[Potter Craft]]
  | date = 2006
  | page = 115
  | isbn = 0-307-23605-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Knitting Treasury series documents over a thousand different [[knitting stitches]]. Other books considered [[mosaic knitting]], for producing multicolored designs while knitting only one color per row, and constructing knitted garments from the top down rather than the usual bottom-up method used in [[Western knitting]] tradition. Most of Walker's best-known knitting books have been reprinted, and starting in the mid-1990s, she has published new knitting books.

===Feminism and skepticism===
Walker writes about the problems with mainstream religion and how these problems have contributed to patriarchal societies and sexism.&lt;ref name=NJNOW /&gt;&lt;ref name=skep /&gt;  In ''The Skeptical Feminist: Discovering the Virgin, Mother, and Crone'', she writes about her belief that there is no god. However, she believes that people, and women in particular, can use the image of the [[goddess]] in their day-to-day lives. Walker often uses the imagery of the [[Mother Goddess]] to discuss [[Prehistoric religion|neolithic matriarchies]]. Her book ''Woman's Rituals: A Sourcebook'' is an attempt to show how she puts her "[[meditation]] techniques" into practice, and is meant as a guide for other women who wish to do the same.

====Criticism====
''The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets'' has been criticized for being based on the idea of the "Great Mother" by male writers like [[Robert Graves]] and [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]], and for rewriting myths so they would support the theory of a "Great Goddess".&lt;ref&gt;Diane Purkiss, "Women's Rewriting of Myth", in Carolyne Larrington (ed), ''The Feminist Companion to Mythology'', London, 1992, p. 444: "Given these constraints, it's surprising at first to discover that twentieth-century women writers and artists constantly strive to engage with and re-figure women's representation in classical myth, and that a particular group of them have found inspiration in Graves and Neumann for their efforts (Sjöö, 1990; Orenstein, 1982; Stein, 1989; Walker, 1985, 1986; Daly, 1978; ...) ... If the projects of Graves and Neumann are in thrall to a masculinist representation of woman, why have so many women appropriated their theories? Perhaps certain feminist 'misread' or re-read these texts productively to formulate a position from which to write and speak, by taking the Jungians' essentialist propositions for truths about the repression of woman's nature by patriarchy. They could cast themselves as the bearers of secret feminine knowledge actually unavailable to male writers. However, this means that radical feminist claims of utter separatism are invalid, since their theories are predicated not on stories produced thousands of years ago by women, but on a masculine discourse of myth. In Donna Haraway's influential terms, these women may wish to be goddesses, but they are cyborgs all the same (Haraway, 1989)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Walker studied journalism at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], then worked for the ''[[Washington Star]]'' in [[Washington, D.C.]] While serving on a local hotline helping battered women and pregnant teens in the mid-1970s, she became interested in feminism. Walker continued a personal study of comparative religions and feminist issues after she graduated&lt;ref name=skep/&gt; which led to her writing ''The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets'' (1983).&lt;ref name=NJNOW&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Profile: Barbara G. Walker|url=http://www.nownj.org/njNews/2005/0116%20humanist_profile-%20Barbara%20G.%20Walker.htm|website=NOW NJ|publisher=National Organization for Women of New Jersey (NOW-NJ)|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=January 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker describes herself as an [[atheist]]. The American Humanist Association named her "Humanist Heroine" in 1993, and in 1995 she received the "Women Making Herstory" award from the New Jersey [[National Organization for Women|NOW]].&lt;ref name=NJNOW /&gt;

She is an advocate of the [[Christ Myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Barbara G. (1983). [https://archive.org/stream/womansencycloped00walkrich#page/464/mode/2up ''Jesus Christ'']. ''In The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets''. Harper &amp; Row. 464-465. {{ISBN|0-06-250926-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Bunt'' means ''powerful man'' or ''warrior'' in the Kannada and [[Tulu language]].&lt;ref name="Alagodi2006p143" /&gt;

The word ''Nadava'' is a synonym for the Bunts used in the northern region of the erstwhile [[South Canara]] district.&lt;ref name=sree&gt;{{cite book|last1=J. Sreenath, S. H.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has had many critics, who have from time to time found fault with many of its teachings and precepts, discovered apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in its history, and even raised controversial questions about specific policies and actions of past and existing administrative bodies.

In recent times, some of the more common of these criticisms have been compiled in books and blogs. Many Bahá'í authors have also given their own responses to these criticisms.

==Criticism of Bahá'í teachings==

===Unity of religion===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
[[File: 4_Abrahamic_symbols.png|200px|thumbnail|left|Clockwise: [[Christian cross]], Islamic [[Star and crescent|star &amp; crescent]], Bahá'í nine-pointed star, and Jewish [[Star of David]]]]
A core teaching of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the unity of all the world's religions; They believe that the teachings of all the major religions are components of a single plan which is directed by the same [[God]], yet that religion is cyclical in nature and becomes corrupted with time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahaiteachings.org/bahai-principles-one-foundation-for-all-religions Article demonstrating unity of religion belief.]&lt;/ref&gt; The religions that the Bahá'í Faith claims to be congruent appear to have contradictory teachings. For instance, their attitude toward the Abrahamic prophets (Moses, Jesus, Muhammad) and the way in which followers partake in worship vary significantly among the major religions, and social laws and attitudes vary between traditions.

The principle of [[universalism]] itself has many opponents, such as Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], who claims that it not only demeans local and national traditions but also encourages widespread religious supremacy. Sacks disputes the principle of universalism on the grounds that there may not be just one truth about the essentials of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Jonathan |title=The Dignity of Difference |date=2002 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=9780826468505 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í authors have tried to refute the criticism by claiming to promote unity in diversity.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=139}}

Anthropologist Fiona Bowie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bowie |first=Fiona |date=2000 |title=The anthropology of religion. The Blackwell companion to the study of religion |page=4 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and author on comparative religion [[Karen Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=Karen |date=1994 |title=A history of God |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that religious ideas cannot be unified because they evolve out of primitive beliefs in [[animism]] and [[idolatry]], ideas at odds with [[monotheism]]. Armstrong says that idol worship predates monotheism, raising the question of whether the Bahá'í ideal of unity of religion can extend to ancient beliefs and practices.

[[Christians]] have been known to dismiss the Bahá'í Faith as a [[syncretism|syncretic]] combination of faiths&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2014/june/avoiding-pitfall-of-syncretism.html Christian website referring to Bahá'í Faith as syncretic]&lt;/ref&gt; or point to discrepancies between faiths to contradict the idea of unity of religion.{{sfn|Ankerberg|1999}} The Christian doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] is commonly understood to exclude all other religions as a path to God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/perspectives/universalism-dont-all-religions-lead-to-god/ Article from Christian Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Bahá'í teachings of peace and unity, [[Edward Granville Browne|Professor Browne]] argued that whilst they are admirable, they are, in his opinion, inferior to the simplicity and beauty of the teachings of Christ. He further argued that in the case of "Baha'ism, with its rather vague doctrines as to the nature and destiny of the soul of man, it is a little difficult to see whence the driving force to enforce the ethical maxims can be derived."{{sfn|Miller|1974|p=163}}

Christian apologist [[Francis J. Beckwith]] wrote of the Bahá'í teachings:
{{quote|The fact that the various alleged manifestations of God represented God in contradictory ways implies either that manifestations of God can contradict one another or that God’s own nature is contradictory. If manifestations are allowed to contradict one another, then there is no way to separate false manifestations from true ones or to discover if any of them really speak for the true and living God…. If, on the other hand, God’s own nature is said to be contradictory, that is, that God is both one God and many gods, that God is both able and not able to have a son, personal and impersonal, etc., then the Baha’i concept of God is reduced to meaninglessness.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Research Journal, Winter/Spring, 1989, p. 2. Quoted in {{sfn|Ankerberg|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bahá'í authors have attempted to address this criticism by claiming that the contradictory teachings are either social laws that change from age to age, or human error introduced to the more ancient faiths over time.{{sfn|Stockman|1997}}{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=274-275}}

Strict Muslim theology regards Muhammad as the last messenger that God has sent and Islam as the final religion for all humankind. In this view, it is impossible for either any prophet after Muhammad or any new religion to come into existence, and thus they reject the Bahá'í Faith.{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|2002|p=221}} Some Muslims claim that the idea of oneness of humanity is not a new principle; They claim that [[Universalism#Islam|Islam espouses such a principle]].{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|page=65}} Fanatical Shīʿites have been known to picture the faith as a "heresy" or "a political movement".{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|2002|pp=221-224}} Many Islamic scholars reject all prophets after [[Muhammad]], and regard Bahá'ís as apostates if they had been Muslims before conversion.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}} Critics also argue that, despite the Bahá'í Faith's claim of unity, there are numerous theological differences between Islam and the Bahá'í Faith,{{sfn|Ankerberg|1999}} with one critic, Imran Shaykh, arguing that the disparities are evidence to the Bahá'í Faith not being a natural progression of Islam, as is claimed.{{sfn|Shaykh|2010}}

===Gender equality===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality}}
Whilst Bahá'í teachings assert that men and women are spiritually equal, author Lil Abdo says that the Bahá'í understanding of sexual equality is different from that of secular feminists. Abdo presented the following list of criticisms of the Bahá'í Faith from a feminist perspective at an annual gathering for Bahá'í studies in 1995:

{{quote|the ineligibility of women to serve on the Universal House of Justice--this is of particular interest to supporters of women priests within the Christian tradition; the intestacy laws in the Kitab-i-Aqdas; the dowry laws with particular reference to the virginity refund clause; the exemption of menstruating women from obligatory prayers and the implication of menstrual taboo; the exemption of women from pilgrimage; the use of androcentric language and male pronouns in texts; the emphasis on traditional morality and family values...{{sfn|Abdo|1995}} }}

Quoting `Abdu’l-Bahā, Iranian critics claim he saw women as inferior to men. According to these critics, `Abdu’l-Bahā said: "Although women and men share the same capacities and abilities, there is definitely no doubt that men are superior and stronger.  Even  in  animals  like  pigeons,  sparrows,  peacocks,  and  other [birds]  this  advantage  is  visible,"{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=324-325}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Badā’i` al-āthār|author=Maḥmūd Zaraqani|volume=1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu’l-Bahā made the comments in light of being questioned as to why God didn't send any female prophets.

Azadeh Haiati claims that whilst "official statements from the Baha'i administration seemingly promote gender equality and the ideal of justice and equity in the world at large, Baha'i women themselves are treated with injustice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fallacy of Gender Equality in The Bahai Faith|author=Azadeh Haiati|url=http://www.bahaiawareness.com/bahai12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Cole notes that in 1988 the all-male House of Justice "permanently suppressed" an academic paper that was arguing for women to be able to serve in the UHJ. He says they insisted only men could serve.{{sfn|Cole|1998}}

Some critics have claimed that Bahá'í leaders have tried to portray themselves as women's rights advocates in order to make their religion more appealing to modern society.
{{quote|"By expressing sympathy for women - especially the women in Iran - [[Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi]] tries to portray Baha'ism as a creed with equal rights for the genders. When the Baha'i teachings are more closely analysed, it is apparent that there is no equality in rights, rather, there is a great inclination towards men."{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=464}}}}

===Science===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and science}}
According to [[Shoghi Effendi]], the harmony between science and religion is an important Bahá'í principle.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|pp=281–282}} However, there is tension over this principle due to several instances of Bahá'í scriptures disagreeing with current scientific knowledge. Prominent among them are references by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] that humans evolved over a long period, but were never animals. Many Bahá'í authors have commented&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Anjam Khursheed (1987). Science and Religion: Towards the Restoration of an Ancient Harmony; Craig Loehle (1990). [https://bahai-studies.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2.4-Loehle.pdf On Human Origins: A Bahá’í Perspective]. Journal of Baha’i Studies 2(4); Gary Matthews (1993). The Challenge of Baha’u’llah; Craig Loehle (1994). On the Shoulders of Giants; Eberhard von Kitzing (1997). [https://bahai-library.com/kitzing_bahai_view_evolution Is the Bahá'í view of evolution compatible with modern science?] Baha’i Studies Review 7; Keven Brown (2001). [http://bahai-library.com/?file=brown_evolution_bahai_belief Evolution and Bahá'í Belief: 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Response to Nineteenth-Century Darwinism]; Fariborz Alan Davoodi (2001).

One Country 19(3).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Excessive citations inline |date=June 2018}} that the intention of the comments "were in line with a modern understanding of evolution"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} and that the apparent conflict is "an unfortunate semantic mistake".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} One Bahá'í commentator acknowledged that the comments by `Abdu'l-Bahá are not in line with current scientific understanding, but that `Abdu'l-Bahá should not be regarded as infallible in scientific matters.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Oskooi (2009). [http://bahai-library.com/oskooi_disharmony_science_religion When Science and Religion Merge:A Modern Case Study].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientifically controversial ideas from [[Bahá'u'lláh]] include that the universe is [[Bahá'í Faith and science#Creation|without beginning or end]], that [[Bahá'í Faith and science#Life on other planets|every planet has "creatures"]], and that [[Bahá'í Faith and science#Transmutation of elements|copper can turn into gold]].

Critics claim Bahá'u'lláh said that every star has planets, and that every planet has its own creatures. They claim that science has already "proven the falsity of this claim".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=178}} In response, a Baha'i apologist by the name of Gary L. Mathews argued that Bahá'u'lláh's teachings explicitly stated that minerals are endowed with life. He further quotes a teaching of Bahá'u'lláh and a teaching of `Abdu'l-Bahá saying this. `Abdu'l-Bahá says this is even said in the Quran, where it supposedly says "All things are living".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=178-179}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathews|first=Gary|title=The Challenge of Bahá'u'lláh: Does God Still Speak to Humanity Today|publisher=George Ronald Pub Ltd.|date=2001|page=86|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics however point out that this is a misquote of the Quran, which actually says, '''We made '''from water''' everything living .'''&lt;ref&gt;Quran 21:30&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=179}} The critics further argue that in addition to this misquotation of the Quran, Mathews leaves out a part of the original quote which they argue has `Abdu'l-Bahá claim that materialists agree that every star has planets and that every planet has life. The critics summarise this by saying, "As if distorting the Quran wasn't enough `Abdu'l-Bahá puts the burden of his lies upon the materialists".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=180}}

===Claims of Divinity===
{{See|Manifestation of God}}
According to critics, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] claimed [[Apotheosis|to be God]]. [[William McElwee Miller|William Miller]] says that the wording of the [[Aqdas]] made it difficult to distinguish between the words of the author ([[Bahá'u'lláh]]) and the words of God. He further opines that "[[Bahá'u'lláh]] felt no such distinction was necessary" and that "[[Bahá'u'lláh]] claims to be not merely a human Messenger of God, but a Divine Manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;Elder, E.E., Miller, W.M. and Miller, W.M. eds., 1961. Al-Kitab Al-Aqdas Or the Most Holy Book (Vol. 38). Psychology Press. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Wilson writes that the fundamental assertion of the Bahá'í Faith is that Bahá'u'lláh is the incarnation of "God the Father". He further quotes `Abdu'l-Bahá saying, "Thanks to Baha Ullah, {{sic}} we arrived safely in Liverpool."{{sfn|Wilson|2018}} This supposed claim of divinity has been criticised by Imran Shaykh who points to this as an example of a discrepancy between faiths.{{sfn|Shaykh|2010}}

==Criticism based on historical events==
{{Expand section|small=no|date=June 2018}}
===Attitude towards Black Africans===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The Bahá'í Faith espouses the need to abolish racial prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, William S., and James Douglas Martin. The Baha'i faith: The emerging global religion. Baha'i Publishing Trust, 2002. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have claimed that comments made by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] are contrary to this principle, and show racial prejudice against Black Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Iranian |date=5 January 2009 |title=‘Abdul Baha Says about Africans |url=https://iranian.com/2009/01/05/abdul-baha-says-about-africans}};&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Twelve Principles'' (2014) `Abdu'l-Bahá is quoted as saying that Africans are "cows" with "human faces".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=70-71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=`Abdu’l-Bahā|title=Khaṭābāt|location=Tehran|volume=3|page=48|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition he is further quoted as saying: "The [black Africans] are like animals in human form. The [black Americans] are civilized, intelligent, and have culture. [...] what difference is there between these two types of blacks other than nurture, with one in utter ignorance and the other completely civilized?"{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=69-70}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=`Abdu’l-Bahā|title=Makātīb|location=Egypt|volume=1|page=331|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to this, a Bahá'í blogger (Sen McGlinn) claims to directly address the criticism by arguing that the racist references are examples of `Abdu'l-Bahá describing the opinions of others and that with the context of surrounding text `Abdu'l-Bahá does not appear racist and that the writings in question are using Africans as an example of humans "in a state of nature" that can be improved through education.{{sfn|McGlinn|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography of Sen McGlinn|url=https://bahai-library.com/author/Sen+McGlinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family of Bahá'u'lláh===
{{See|Bahá'u'lláh's family#Plurality of wives|Bahá'u'lláh's family}}
Although [[polygamy]] is forbidden by Bahá'í law, Bahá'u'lláh himself had three concurrent wives.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=273-274}}

===Bahá'í Faith and slavery===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and slavery}}
Bahá'u'lláh very specifically abolished the slave trade among his followers in 1874, but the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]] were raised in households that included slaves and, according to Abu'l Qasim, they owned slaves in adulthood too.&lt;ref&gt;Afnan, Abuʾl-Qasim. Black Pearls: Servants in the Household of the Báb and Baháʾuʾlláh. Kalimat Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babi split===
{{See|Bahá'í/Bábí split}}
The Bahá'í Faith identifies itself as the fulfillment of the Bábí Faith. The separation of the two began in 1863 and was accompanied by conflict and murders.{{sfn|Miller|1974|pp=70-87}}

===Guardianship===
{{See|Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)}}
The Bahá'í scriptures intend for a line of Guardians appointed by their predecessor - the Kitáb-i-Aqdas states that all Bahá'ís must leave a will, however [[Shoghi Effendi]] (the first guardian) broke this law and left no provision for the future administration and guidance of the faith. Due to the first Guardian leaving no appointment, the line ended.{{sfn|Miller|1974|p=316}}

===Divisions===
{{See|Bahá'í divisions}}
Although the Faith emphasizes its own unity, the Bahá'í Faith has had several challenges to leadership, resulting in the formation of breakaway factions.  Claimants challenging the widely accepted successions of leadership are shunned by the majority group as [[Covenant breaker|Covenant-Breakers]].{{sfn|Miller|1974|pp=184-185}} By the time of Shoghi Effendis passing, almost every member of Bahaullahs family had been expelled from the faith.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pages = 63–64}}

==Criticism of leadership==
===Politics===
{{See|Political accusations against the Baha'i Faith}}
Bahá'ís have been accused, particularly by successive Iranian governments, of being agents or spies of Russia, Britain, the Shah, the United States, and as agents of [[Zionism]]—each claim being linked to each regime's relevant enemy and justifying anti-Bahá'í actions. The last claim is partially rooted in the presence of the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in northern Israel.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}}

===Statistics===
{{See|Bahá'í statistics}}
There has been criticism of the Bahá'í Faith that has centered on what critics see as exaggerated statements concerning numbers of believers.{{sfn|Cole|1998}}

===Bahá'í review===
[[File:Censored section of Green Illusions by Ozzie Zehner.jpg|thumb|right|Critics class the Bahá'í review process as a form of censorship.]]
{{See|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'ís wishing to publish books about the Bahá'í Faith must first submit their work to their respective [[National Spiritual Assembly]] for approval through a review process. This process has had critics, some of whom have characterized this requirement as a form of [[censorship]].{{sfn|Momen|2007}}

Juan Cole refers to this process as "mandatory prepublication censorship" of everything Bahá'ís publish about their religion. He argues that Bahá'í leaders employ control mechanisms to "shape the speech and behavior of Bahá'ís". Furthermore, he says that when a group of editors proposed their idea of discontinuing censorship and having term limits for N.S.A. members, the N.S.A.'s response was to accuse the editors of engaging in "negative campaigning". The editors were then publicly denounced and  interrogated by assembly members, who privately expressed concerns that the publication of such a document might have prevented the current members from being reelected. According to Cole, the censorship instituted by the Bahá'í Faith has led to "intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of indepedent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers." He states that writers who publicly disagree with the policies of the Bahá'í institutions risk having their voting rights removed, being declared non-members and, the most serious sanction of all, being declared a "covenant breaker".{{sfn|Cole|1998}}

===Rejection of academic liberals===
[[Juan Cole]] was an American academic who resigned from membership in the Bahá'í Faith in 1996 after conflict with members of the Bahá'í administration, who perceived him as extreme and threatened him with a Bahá'í version of excommunication. Cole went on to critically attack the Bahá'í Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2002, describing a prominent Bahá'í as an "inquisitor" and "bigot", and describing Bahá'í institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, with financial irregularities and sexual deviance.{{sfn|Momen|2007}} Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/ |title=H-Bahai Website |publisher=H-net.org |date =  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Report on the H-Bahai Digital Library| author=Cole, Juan R. I. | journal=[[Iranian Studies (journal)|Iranian Studies]] | date=Winter–Summer 2002 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=191–196 | jstor=4311442 | doi=10.1080/00210860208702016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he wrote in 2002:

{{quote|... the Baha'i faith in the United States has become more fundamentalist in the past four decades. [There are] trends toward an increasing emphasis on doctrinal and behavioral conformity, resulting in greater exclusivism and sectarianism in what on the surface appears to be a liberal and universalistic tradition... Baha'i fundamentalists see the civil state and academic scholarship on religion as their negative counterparts... fundamentalist Baha'is have become powerful in some key sectors of the Baha'i administration and employ their authority to exclude Baha'i liberals. In some recent instances, Baha'i liberals have simply been dropped from the membership rolls with no formal procedure.{{sfn|Cole|2002}} }}

{{Ugarit}}
&lt;!--this article has used the convention BCE/CE since its inception--&gt;
'''Danel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|n|əl}}), father of '''Aqhat''', was a [[culture hero]] who appears in an incomplete [[Ugaritic text]] of the fourteenth century BCE&lt;ref&gt;Made during the reign of Niqmadu III, ca. 1360 BCE (Walton 1994:49).&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Ugarit]] (modern Ras Shamra), [[Syria]], where the name is rendered &lt;small&gt;DN'IL&lt;/small&gt;, "[[El (God)|El]] is judge".&lt;ref&gt;Virolleaud 1936, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Tale of Aqhat==
The text in ''Corpus Tablettes Alphabétiques'' ''[CTA]'' 17–19 is often referred to as the '''Epic of Aqhat'''. Danel was depicted as "judging the cause of the widow, adjudicating the case of the fatherless" in the city gate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ancient Near Eastern Texts]]'', 149–51.&lt;/ref&gt; He passed through trials: his son Aqhat was destroyed but apparently in the missing conclusion was revived or replaced by Danel's patron god, '''Rp'u''', who sits and judges with [[Hadad]] and [[Astarte]] and was likely considered to be the equivalent of [[El (god)|El]]. 

The text was published and translated in 1936 by [[Charles Virolleaud]]&lt;ref&gt;Virolleaud, "La légende phénicienne de Danel" vol. I of ''Mission de Ras Shamra'', C. F.-A. Schaeffer, ed. (Paris) 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been extensively analysed since then.&lt;ref&gt;See references section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Danel and the Book of Ezekiel ==

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] in three verses (14:14. 14:20, and 28:3) writes "Danel", which according to the [[Masoretic Text]] should be read as "Daniel". This notwithstanding, parallels and contrasts with Danel (without ''i'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%2014:13-14:19&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-20746a NIV footnote on Ezekiel 14:14]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Book of Ezekiel, placed between [[Noah]] and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel xiv.14, 20&lt;/ref&gt; and invoked as the very example of righteous judgement,&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel xxviii. 3: in an apostrophe to the prince of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], "you are indeed wiser than Daniel".&lt;/ref&gt; first pointed out by [[René Dussaud]] in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;René Dussaud, "Breves remarques sur les tablettes de Ras Shamra", ''Syria'' '''12''' (1931:77).&lt;/ref&gt; have led readers commonly to accept&lt;ref&gt;(Day 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; or occasionally to reject&lt;ref&gt;H.H.P. Dressler, "The identification of the Ugaritic Dnil with the Daniel of Ezekiel", ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' '''29''' (1979:152–61): "To sum up the Ugaritic material: Dnil is neither king, nor wise, nor righteous, nor able to save his son from hanging himself fron. The projector." (p. 155). Danel not meeting Dressler's definition of kingship, is termed "a village-elder or chief" (p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Daniel B. “Who is Ezekiel’s Daniel” http://bible.org/article/who-ezekiels-daniel&lt;/ref&gt;a degree of identification with Ugaritic Danel of the "Aqhat text", amounting virtually to the same figure.&lt;ref&gt;The author of the [[Book of Daniel]], a contemporary of Ezekiel exiled in Babylon, is not concerned here; the common assumption is that "features of the Daniel alluded to by Ezekiel have contributed to the depiction of the hero of the book of Daniel" (Day 1980:174). Christianist readers still assert the identity of the two figures.&lt;/ref&gt; The three figures referred to in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|14:14|niv}}&amp;nbsp;— "Even if [[Noah]], Danel and [[Job (Bible)|Job]] were in it..."&amp;nbsp;— links the name with two non-Israelites of great antiquity. In {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|28:3|niv}}, Danel is one noted for his wisdom in the prophecy addressed to the king of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]: "you are indeed wiser than Danel, no secret is hidden from you". The name, "Danel", had a long tradition in Hebrew culture: he is supplied as the father-in-law of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] in ''[[Jubilees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Jubilees'' iv.20, noted by Day 1980:181: ''Jubilees'', which supplies many "missing" names from the Hebrew Bible, was written considerably later than the book of Ezekiel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts in the [[Ugaritic language]], a Canaanite tongue, may provide an important clue.  The language was discovered by [[France|French]] [[archaeology|archaeologists]] in 1928, and known only from texts found in the lost city of [[Ugarit]] (modern Ras Shamra), [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=solve&gt;Edward L. Greenstein, "Texts from Ugarit Solve Biblical Puzzles," ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review|BAR]]'' 36:06, Nov/Dec 2010, pp. 48-53, 70. Found at [http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=36&amp;Issue=6&amp;ArticleID=5 Biblical Archaeology Review website].  Accessed October 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ugaritic has been used by scholars of the [[Old Testament]] to clarify Biblical Hebrew texts and has revealed ways in which ancient [[Ancient Israel|Israelite]] culture finds parallels in the neighboring cultures.&lt;ref name=solve /&gt;  Ugaritic was "the greatest literary discovery from antiquity since the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cyrus Herzl Gordon|Gordon, Cyrus Herzl]]|title=The Ancient Near East|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company Press|year=1965|isbn=0-393-00275-6}} at p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Literary texts discovered at Ugarit include the [[Aqhat|Aqhat Epic]] (or Legend of Danel) — all revealing a [[Canaan]]ite religion.  According to Edward L. Greenstein, a distinguished professor at [[Bar-Ilan University]], Ugaritic texts solved the [[Bible|biblical]] puzzle of the [[anachronism]] of [[Ezekiel]] mentioning [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] at {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|14:13-16|nrsv}}; it is because in both Ugaritic and the [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]] texts, it is correctly ''Danel'' -- the ''[[yodh|yod]]'' is missing in the originals.&lt;ref name=solve /&gt;

T.E. Gaston argues that there are reasons to doubt the identification of Danel with the Danel of Ezekiel. Firstly, Danel is never described as wise or righteous. Secondly, given he was a Baal-worshiper it is unlikely that a strict Yahwist like Ezekiel would have considered Danel to be righteous. Thirdly, over eight hundred years separate the Aqhat text and the book of Ezekiel, and Danel is not mentioned in any Jewish source in the intervening period.&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Gaston, ''Historical Issues in the Book of Daniel'', (2009), 10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it is argued that Danel would fit the pattern of being an ancient non-Israelite like Job and Noah. Ezekiel's literary arrangement may also support this position. Yahweh has compared Judah with foreign nations before ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|5:7|niv}}) and the context appears to contain similar comparison in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|14:13-19|niv}}. The hypothetical rebellious country, while a cipher for Israel is not specifically named and could represent any ancient Near Eastern country. Ezekiel's audience is clearly enamored with non-Israelite myths (cf. [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|8:14|niv}}), and so they could easily be aware of King Danel's legendary virtues. Thus, Ezekiel's triad, if they were three ancient, righteous, non-Israelite men, would fit the pattern of Yahweh judging Israel to some degree by the nations around them.&lt;ref&gt;College Press NIV Commentary on Ezekiel By Brandon Fredenburg, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The connection is more plausible when one considers that Ezekiel alludes to Danel in an oracle against Tyre (Eze. 28), for the cultures of [[Ugarit]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] were both [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]].&lt;ref&gt;Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible By David Noel Freedman, Allen C. Myers, Astrid B. Beck, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Danel also had a son and like Job, was unable to deliver him from divine harm (cf. {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|14:20|niv}}).&lt;ref&gt;Walther Eichrodt, Ezekiel: A Commentary, trans.

A '''Darvand''' is a child of an angel and a human, usually a male angel and a woman. Darvand creatures appear in [[Anne Eliza Smith|Anne Eliza Smith's]] novel "[[Seola]]" published in 1878. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (or angels) and Darvands are defined early on in the novel on page 15 and again later on page 64.

==Etymology==
{{In-universe|date=October 2009}}
Darvand, in its original Avestan form 'dregvant' means 'wicked.' It is an ethical appellation of unrighteous persons. Angra Mainyu, the Evil Spirit, is a 'dregvant' or 'darvand' or wicked, as Spenta Mainyu, the Good Spirit, is 'ashavan' or righteous.

Thou Ahura Mazda, dost recognize only two classes among mankind, the 'ashavan' or righteous and the 'dregvant,' 'darvand' or wicked to whatever religion they may belong. Those alone among Zoroastrians, who think good thoughts, speak good words and do good deeds are 'ashavan' or righteous in thy sight. Those who don Sudrah and Kusti, the sacred shirt and girdle, and call themselves the Mazda worshipping Zoroastrians yet think evil thoughts and speak evil words and do evil deeds, are 'darvands' or wicked. Those that profess to be good Mazdayasnians, but whose conduct gives the lie to their profession, are themselves 'darvands,' wicked indeed.

{{Alevism|Leadership}}
A '''dede''' is a socio-religious leader in the [[islamic]] [[Alevi]] and non-islamic [[Ishikism|Ishiki]] community. It is one of the 12 ranks of Imam in Alevism. The institution of dede is the most important of all the institutions integral to the social and religious organization of the Anatolian Alevis. Although much weakened as a result of the socio-economic transformation experienced in [[Anatolia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century, and particularly due to accelerated migration from the rural to the urban areas after the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]], it played a primary role in the survival of [[Alevism]] until today.

The institution of dedes is based on a three tiered hierarchy:
# [[Murshid]]
# [[Pir (Alevism)|Pir]]
# [[Rehber (Alevism)|Rehber]]

In some regions this hierarchy is modified in such a way that the Pir and Murshid change places. This is exclusively a functional hierarchy, as all involved come from a dede family. They fulfill functions that are complementary in nature, and would be meaningless in isolation from each other. The dede families, all of them called ''ocakzâdes,'' have distributed these duties among themselves.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

An Alevi dede focuses on the mystical Islamic teachings of [[the Twelve Imams]], the [[Buyruks]] (mainly the ''[[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Imam Câfer-i Sadık]] Buyruğu'') and [[Haji Bektash Veli]].

== Qualifications ==

According to the books of the ''[[Buyruks|Buyruk]]'' which include the basic principles of the Alevi faith, and the traditions that survive among the Alevis, a dede must have the following qualifications:&lt;ref&gt;On the issue of the qualifications and functions of dedes, Peter J. Bumke gives valuable information. Bumke, ibid, pp. 18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

* To be a descendant of the Prophet ''(ocakzâde).''
* To operate as an educator and a moral guide ''(mürebbi)'' for the community.
* To be knowledgeable and exemplary in his character and manners ''([[Al-Insān al-Kāmil]]).''
* To follow the principles written in the Buyruks, as well as the established traditions of Alevism.

== Functions ==

The main functions of the dedes can be summarized as follows:
* To guide and enlighten (irşad) the community in social and religious matters.
* To lead the religious rituals.
* To punish the criminals, and to serve as an arbiter between conflicting sides.
* To lead ceremonies during occasions such as a wedding or a funeral.
* To fulfill certain legal and educational functions.
* Provide health provisions.
* Provide socio-political leadership.
* In some exceptional cases, such as in the Tunceli province (formerly Dersim),&lt;ref&gt;Officially today there is no province called Dersim. For centuries, Dersim maintained a kind of autonomy under the leadership of the tribal chiefs, and covers a region that includes the provinces of Erzincan, Tunceli and parts of Sivas. In 1937, the name of Dersim was changed to Tunceli.&lt;/ref&gt; dedes share the leadership position with the large landowners, the [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Ağa]]s.

== Legal functions ==

For Alevis, ''[[tariqa|“Yol” (path)]]'' is a very important concept. The pedigrees of the ''dedes'' consistently emphasize this by saying “Yol cümleden uludur” [the Path is the most exalted of all].&lt;ref&gt;This and similar expressions are frequently encountered in the secere of the Ocak of Ali Abbas.&lt;/ref&gt; What is important is the Yol and not the personal desires and needs of an individual Alevi. All the latter are possible only in conformity with the former. Otherwise, the institution of düşkün would be activated. In other words, an Alevi would become a düşkün if he tries to satisfy his desires and needs without regard for the Yol. As Prof. Yusuf Ziya Yörükan noted “Dede declares one a "düşkün" by saying to him ''"may your face be darkened"''. Any more that person is deprived of the law of men."&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf Ziya, “Tahtacılar, Tahtacılarda Dini ve Sırri hayat’, DARÜLFÜNUN İLAHİYAT FAKÜLTESİ MECMUASI, year: 4, no: 15, May 1930, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are major crimes that lead one to the state of düşkün:&lt;ref&gt;Also see, [[Yaşar Nuri Öztürk|Öztürk, Yaşar Nuri]], ibid, pp. 78-81. In the old days, marrying a Sünni [Yezide kuşak çözmek] was also accepted as an offense that led to the state of "düşkün". See [[Alevi]] [[Buyruks]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* killing a person
* committing adultery
* divorce
* marrying a divorcee
* stealing

The '''Dhamnar Caves''' are caves located in the village of Dhamnar, located in [[Mandsaur district]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. This rock cut site consists of 51 caves, [[stupa]]s, [[Chaitya]]s, passages, and compact dwellings, carved in the 7th century CE. The site includes large statues of [[Gautama Buddha]] in sitting and [[Nirvana]] [[Mudra#Common Buddhist mudrās|mudra]].&lt;ref name=Archaeological&gt;{{cite web|last=Archaeological Survey of India, Bhopal Circle|title=Monument &gt;&gt; Mandsaur &gt;&gt; Dhamnar Buddhist caves No. 1 to 51|url=http://www.asibhopal.nic.in/monument/mandsaur_dhamnar_buddhistcavesn.html#des|publisher=Govt of India, Ministry of Culture|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen caves on the northern side are considered historically significant, among which ''Bari Kacheri'' (big courthouse) and ''Bhima Bazar'' are the most so.  The Bari Kacheri cave measures 20 feet square and includes stupas and chaityas. The porch includes stone railing with the wooden architecture. Bhima Bazar cave is the largest among the group, measuring 115 feet by 80 and including vzhara and ''chaityagruha''.  It consists of stupas. The roof is in poor condition with the support of wooden architecture.&lt;ref name=Imperial&gt;{{cite journal|title=DHAMPUR TAHSIL|journal=Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume=11|page=283|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/text.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_289.gif|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started [[Sachkhoj Academy]] which provides platform for independent researchers of [[Gurbani]] to perform unbiased research, and learning to use the Adi Granth dictionary lexical resource for the exegesis.&lt;ref name="dasamin"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born at Manupur-Goslan, [[Khanna, Ludhiana|Khanna]], Punjab to Bhagwan Singh and Harnam Kaur. At Khanna, he had his primary education and matriculated from AS High School in 1954. In 1956, he completed his Intermediate with [[Hindi]] as his major.&lt;ref name="dasamin"/&gt;

==Life and works at Buddha Dal==
He belongs to a Nihang family. His paternal uncles (Taya and Chacha) and first cousin served as [[Nihang]] in [[Budha Dal]]. His taya was jathedar of Budha Dal, [[Samrala]] Circle. Among others, Dharam Singh used to have discussions on Banis in Das Granthi with his coeval nephew.&lt;ref name="academyspeech"&gt;{{cite speech

In 1960, Dharam Singh began to participate in religious gatherings called Jorh Melas, with [[Budha Dal]]. In 1962, he enrolled as a Nihang in Budha Dal at [[Hola Mohalla]] function in [[Anandpur Sahib]], after Akhand Path of [[Dasam Granth]].

He served as a secretary in the Dal, which was under command of [[Akali Chet Singh]], and used to manage ledgers and other paper work, being among the most formally educated in the Dal during that time. In 1965, he participated in ''Path Antar Masla'' and ''Pothi Mangal'' conventions along with Buddha Dal representations and offered various suggestions on both topics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |pages=XII|last1=Missionary|first1=Gurcharan Singh |date=1999 |title=Sahij Samadh Banaam Sunn Samadhi|language=Punjabi |publisher=Sachkhoj Academy |location=Khanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gurbani research and Sachkhoj Academy==
He continued his research of Gurbani, led by the guidance in it such as, ''ਏਨਾ ਅਖਰਾ ਮਹਿ ਜੋ ਗੁਰਮੁਖਿ ਬੂਝੈ ਤਿਸੁ ਸਿਰਿ ਲੇਖੁ ਨ ਹੋਈ ॥੨॥([[Adi Granth]], 432) and ''ਬਿਦਿਆ ਸੋਧੈ ਤਤੁ ਲਹੈ ਰਾਮ ਨਾਮ ਲਿਵ ਲਾਇ॥''(Adi Granth, 938): he concluded that [[Gurbani]] is self-contained and that it provides its own explanations by itself. That the exposition of Gurbani can only be conducted best taking the ‘formless being’ as focal point, and not like the way the subject has been treated in the previous Expositions.

From 1970-92, he had discourses with people of various religious affiliations like [[Yogi]]s, [[Bairagi]]s, [[Kabirpanthis]], [[Muslim]]s, [[Pundit]]s etc., during his stay in [[Garhmukteshwar]], ([[Uttar Pradesh]]). In 1992, he returned to Khanna and started [[Gurmat]] classes on request of Bhai Iqbal Singh of Missionary College aftertheir mutual discussions. In 1994, [[Sachkhoj Academy]] came into being.&lt;ref name="dasamin"/&gt;

'''Divorce in Islam''' can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are ''talaq'' (repudiation), ''khulʿ'' (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], though they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]], and in general, historical practices sometimes diverged from legal theory.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Historical Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dehlvi, Ghulam Rasool|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/triple-talaq-muslim-law-board-should-take-cues-from-divorce-rules-in-22-islamic-nations-not-delay-reforms-3382416.html|title=Triple talaq: Muslim law board should take cues from divorce rules in 22 'Islamic nations', not delay reforms|publisher=[[Firstpost]]|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quranic principles ==
According to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, as indicated by its characterization as a "firm bond" and by the rules governing divorce.&lt;ref name=EoQ-279&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=279|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the spouses should ideally be based on love (''mawadda wa rahma'', 30:21) and important decisions concerning both spouses should be made by mutual consent.&lt;ref name=EoQ-279/&gt; When marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows and even advises the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231), although this decision is not to be taken lightly, and the community is called upon to intervene by appointing arbiters from the two families to attempt a reconciliation (4:35).&lt;ref name=EoQ-279/&gt; The Quran establishes two further means to avoid hasty divorces.&lt;ref name=EoQ-279/&gt; It prescribes two waiting periods of three months before the divorce is final in order to give the husband time to reconsider his decision.&lt;ref name=EoQ-279/&gt; Moreover, a man who takes an oath not to have sexual intercourse with his wife, which would lead to automatic divorce, is allowed a four-month period to break his oath (2:226).&lt;ref name=EoQ-279/&gt;

The Quran substantially reformed the gender inequity of divorce practices that existed in pre-Islamic Arabia, although some patriarchical elements survived and others flourished during later centuries.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Abed Awad and Hany Mawla|title=Divorce. Legal Foundations|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Islam, divorce among the Arabs was governed by unwritten customary law, which varied according to region and tribe, and its observance depended on the authority of the individuals and groups involved. In this system, women were particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name=EoQ-281/&gt; The Quranic rules of marriage and divorce provided a fixed set of norms for all Muslims, backed by divine authority and enforced by the community.&lt;ref name=EoQ-281&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|pages=280–281|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Islamic reforms included giving the wife a possibility to initiate divorce, abrogation of the husband's claim to his wife's property, condemnation of divorce without compelling reason, criminalizing unfounded claims of infidelity made by the husband, and institution of financial responsibilities of the husband toward his divorced wife.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; In pre-Islamic times, men kept their wives in a state of "limbo" by continually repudiating them and taking them back at will. The Quran limited the number of repudiations to three, after which the man cannot take his wife back unless she first marries another man.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; Additionally, the pre-Islamic [[Bride price|bridewealth]] (''mahr''), which was paid by the groom to the bride's family, was transformed into a [[dower]], which became property of the wife, though some scholars believe that the practice of giving at least a part of the ''mahr'' to the bride began shortly before the advent of Islam.&lt;ref name=EoQ-281/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Spies. "Mahr." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Vol. 6, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of divorce is addressed in four different surahs of the Quran, including the general principle articulated in 2:231:&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt;

{{quote|If you divorce women, and they reach their appointed term, hold them back in amity or let them go in amity. Do not hold them back out of malice, to be vindictive. Whoso does this does himself injustice".}}

== Classical sharia ==
=== Legal context ===
Classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] is derived from the scriptural sources of Islam ([[Quran]] and [[hadith]]) using various [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|methodologies]] developed by different [[Madhhab|legal schools]].&lt;ref name=OEIP-vikor&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Knut S. Vikør|title=Sharīʿah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Emad El-Din Shahin|year=2014|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was historically interpreted by jurists (''[[mufti]]s'') who were expected to give a legal opinion (''[[fatwa]]'') free of charge in response to any query.&lt;ref name=Hallaq-Intro&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Wael B. Hallaq]]|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law |year=2009|publisher=[[Cambridge University]] Press|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family disputes were handled in sharia courts presided over by a judge (''[[qadi]]'') who had enough legal education to decide some legal questions and queried a mufti if faced with a difficult legal issue.&lt;ref name=OEIP-vikor/&gt; The judges were active members of the local community and were also involved in informal arbitration, which was the preferred method of resolving disputes.&lt;ref name=Hallaq-Intro/&gt; In court proceedings, they mediated between the letter of the law and exigences of the local social and moral concerns, with the overarching aim of ensuring social harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 11, 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=giunchi&gt;{{cite book|volume=Adjudicating Family Law in Muslim Courts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VFJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|title=From Jurists' ''Ijtihad'' to Judicial Neo-Ijtihad: Some introductory observations|author=Elisa Giunchi|editor=Elisa Giunchi|publisher=Routledge|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual legal practice sometimes deviated from the precepts of the legal school that was dominant in the area, at times to women's benefit and at times to their disadvantage.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; Members of all social classes and their witnesses argued their cases in court without professional legal representation, though members of the upper class generally did so through a representative.&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 11, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were commonly involved in litigation, usually as plaintiffs, were assertive in arguing their cases, and they were often treated sympathetically by the judge.&lt;ref name=giunchi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 11, 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legal doctrine, a woman's testimony in most areas of law carried half the weight of that of a man, though available evidence suggests that practical effects of this rule were limited and the legal standing of women in pre-modern Islam was comparable to or higher than that of their European contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Knut S.|last=Vikør| year=2005|title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talaq (repudiation) ===
==== Jurisprudence ====
The term ''talaq'' is commonly translated as "repudiation" or simply "divorce".&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; In classical Islamic law it refers to the husband's right to dissolve the marriage by simply announcing to his wife that he repudiates her.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; Classical jurists variously classified pronouncement of ''talaq'' as [[Haram|forbidden]] or [[Makruh|reprehensible]] unless it was motivated by a compelling cause such as impossibility of cohabitation due to irreconcilable conflict,&lt;ref name=Hallaq-Sharia&gt;{{cite book|author=Wael B. Hallaq|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Kindle edition)|page=Loc. 7921–7950}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they did not require the husband to obtain court approval or provide a justification.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; The jurists imposed certain restrictions on valid repudiation.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; For example, the declaration must be made in clear terms; the husband must be of sound mind and not coerced. Upon talaq, the wife is entitled to the full payment of ''mahr'' if it had not already been paid. The husband is obligated to financially support her until the end of the waiting period or the delivery of her child, if she is pregnant. In addition, she has a right to child support and any past due maintenance, which Islamic law requires to be paid regularly in the course of marriage.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt;

Giving the husband a prerogative of repudiation was based on the assumption that men would have no interest in initiating a divorce without good cause, given the financial obligations it would incur.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hallaq-Sharia/&gt; Additionally, classical jurists were of the opinion that "the female nature is wanting in rationality and self-control".&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; Requiring a justification was seen as being potentially detrimental to the reputation of both spouses, since it may expose family secrets to public scrutiny.&lt;ref name=Hallaq-Sharia/&gt;

Talaq is considered in Islam to be a [[Makruh|reprehensible]] means of divorce.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; The initial declaration of talaq is a revocable repudiation (ṭalāq rajʿah) which does not terminate the marriage. The husband can revoke the repudiation at any time during the waiting period (''[[Iddah|‘iddah]]'') which lasts three full menstrual cycles. The waiting period is intended to give the couple an opportunity for reconciliation, and also a means to ensure that the wife is not pregnant. Resumption of sexual relations automatically retracts the repudiation. The wife retains all her rights during the waiting period. The divorce becomes final when the waiting period expires. This is called a "minor" divorce (''al-baynuna al-sughra'') and the couple can remarry. If the husband repudiates his wife for the third time, it triggers a "major" divorce (''al-baynuna al-kubra''), after which the couple cannot remarry without an intervening consummated marriage to another man.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; This is known as ''tahlil'' or ''[[nikah halala]]''. Making the third pronouncement irrevocable prevents the husband from using repeated declarations and revocations of divorce as a means of pressuring his wife into making financial concessions in order to "purchase her freedom".&lt;ref name=esposito-30&gt;{{Cite book|authors=John L. Esposito, with Natana J. DeLong-Bas | year=2001 | title=Women in Muslim Family Law|publisher=Syracuse University Press |edition=2nd|pages=30–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOmaDq8HKCgC&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acts as a deterrent to rash repudiations.&lt;ref name=Hallaq-Sharia/&gt;

==== Practice ====
Women often entered marriage with substantial capital in the form of ''mahr'' and the trousseau provided by their family, which they were not obliged to spend on family expenses, and they frequently loaned money to their husbands. Because of this, and the financial obligations incurred, talaq could be a very costly and in many cases financially ruinous enterprise for the husband. Many repudiated women used the divorce payment to buy their ex-husband's share in the family house. In the historical record talaq appears to have been less common than khul'.&lt;ref name=HallaqIntro-P66-67&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Available evidence from Mamluk Egypt indicates that talaq was not the principal means of divorce.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; Talaq was considered to be disastrous for the woman because it deprived her of long-term protection and financial support, preventing her from remarrying, since this would cause her to lose child custody. This led to repudiation without good reason being considered socially improper.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; Studies of the Ottoman Levant showed that women could invalidate a declaration of talaq by stating that the husband had shown signs of "diminished rationality" when he made it, while others used a husband's unrevoked declaration of talaq to obtain divorce at a later date if they could prove that he made it.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

==== ''Talaq al-bid'ah'' and triple talaq ====
Talaq types can be classified into ''talaq al-sunnah'', which is thought to be in accordance with Muhammad's teachings, and ''talaq al-bid'ah'', which are viewed as a [[bid'ah]] (innovation) deviations from it. ''Talaq al-sunnah'' is further subdivided into ''talaq al-ahsan'', which is the least disapproved form of talaq, and ''talaq al-hasan''. The ''ahsan'' talaq involves a single revocable pronouncement of divorce and sexual abstinence during the waiting period. The ''hasan'' divorce involves three pronouncements made during the wife's state of ritual purity with menstrual periods intervening between them, and no intercourse having taken place during that time.&lt;ref name=esposito-30/&gt;

In contrast to ''talaq al-sunnah'', ''talaq al-bid'ah'' does not observe the waiting period and irrevocably terminates the marriage.&lt;ref name=esposito-30/&gt; It may involve a "triple talaq", i.e., the declaration of talaq repeated three times, or a different formula such as "you are ''haram'' for me".&lt;ref name=esposito-30/&gt;&lt;ref name=doi&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Abd ar-Rahman I. Doi | year=2008 | title=Shari'ah: Islamic Law|publisher=Ta-Ha Publishers|edition=2nd|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal schools held that a triple talaq performed in a single meeting constituted a "major" divorce, while others classified it as a "minor" divorce.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; ''Talaq al-bid'ah'' reflects pre-Islamic divorce customs rather than Quranic principles, and it is considered to be a particularly disapproved, though legally valid form of divorce in traditional Sunni jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=esposito-30/&gt; According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad denounced the practice of triple talaq, and the second caliph [[Umar]] punished husbands who made use of it.&lt;ref name=doi/&gt;

Shiite jurisprudence does not recognize ''talaq al-bid'ah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Mohammed Hashim Kamali|title=Islamic Law: Personal Law|editor=Lindsay Jones|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|edition=2nd|publisher=MacMillan Reference USA|year=2005|volume=7|page=4708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tafwid (delegated talaq) ====
{{main article|Tafwid}}
The husband can delegate the right of repudiation to his wife.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract ([[nikah]]) or during the marriage, with or without conditions.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tafwid|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-2300|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women included such terms in their marriage contracts. Commonly, the contract gave the wife the right to "repudiate herself" if the husband married a second wife.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; Delegated repudiation is called ''ṭalāq al-tafawud'' or ''tafwid''.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Khulʿ is a contractual type of divorce that is initiated by the wife. It is justified on the authority of verse 2:228:&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt;

{{quote|It is not licit for you to take back anything you have given them unless the two of them fear that they cannot conform to the bounds of God, no blame attaches to them both. If the woman gives back that with which she sets herself free. These are the bounds set by God; do not transgress them.}}

It is further based on a hadith in which Muhammad instructs a man to agree to his wife's wish of divorce if she gives back a garden received from him as part of her ''mahr''. A khul' is concluded when the couple agrees to a divorce in exchange for a monetary compensation paid by the wife, which cannot exceed the value of the ''mahr'' she had received, and is generally a smaller sum or involves forfeiting the still unpaid portion.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt;  [[Hanafi]]s and [[Maliki]]s do not require a compensation paid by the wife.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; The divorce is final and irrevocable, effective when the contract is concluded.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt;  The couple cannot reconcile during the waiting period, defined as in the case of talaq, but the husband is required to pay maintenance during its term, unless the requirement is waived by the contract.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; As in the case of ''talaq'', remarriage is possible until a khul' is concluded for a third time. If the husband pressures his wife to agree to khul' instead of pronouncing talaq, which would let him avoid attendant financial responsibilities, the divorce is considered to be invalid.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; Like talaq, khulʿ takes place out of court.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

==== Practice ====
Relative frequency of khul' has been noted in studies of Istanbul, Anatolia, Syria, Muslim Cyprus, Egypt and Palestine.&lt;ref name=HallaqIntro-P66-67/&gt;

In studies of Mamluk Egypt and the Balkans under Ottoman rule, khul' was shown to have been the principal means of divorce. Women employed a number of strategies to force a settlement from their husbands. Some neglected their marital and household duties, making family life impossible for the husband. Others demanded immediate payment of the deferred mahr, knowing that the husband had no means to comply and would be jailed if he failed to do so.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

In some cases the khul' contract involved no compensation from the wife, while in other cases women would waive all of their husband's financial obligations.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; According to studies of the Ottoman Levant, various court procedures were put in place to ensure that a khul' was not actually a talaq.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

=== Judicial divorce ===
==== Jurisprudence ====
A marriage can also be dissolved by means of judicial divorce. Either spouse can petition a [[qadi]] court to obtain judicial divorce, but they must have compelling grounds for dissolving the marriage. The court starts the process by appointing an arbitrator from each of their families in order to seek a mediated reconciliation. If this effort fails, the court adjudicates the dispute by apportioning fault for the breakdown of the marriage with the associated financial consequences.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; Examples of fault are cruelty; husband's failure to provide maintenance or pay the immediate installment of ''mahr''; infidelity; desertion; moral or social incompatibility; certain ailments; and imprisonment harmful to the marriage.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; Judicial divorce can also be sought over violations of terms stipulated in the marriage contract. Different legal schools recognized different subsets of these grounds for divorce.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt; The Maliki school, which recognized the widest range of grounds for divorce, also stipulates a category of "harm" (ḍarar), which gave the judge significant discretion of interpretation.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

==== Practice ====
In some areas under Ottoman rule it was hardly possible for women to obtain divorce except through khul' due to the restriction imposed by the prevailing Hanafi school, though some exceptions have been found. The most serious problem was abandonment, which was not recognized as grounds for judicial divorce. To address this, in some cases a man setting out for travel would leave his wife a letter authorizing talaq if he did not return within a specified period of time. In other cases, Hanafi judges invited a Maliki or Hanbali colleague to pronounce divorce, or the woman herself took the initiative to seek out a judge from one of these schools. The same approach was used to effect a divorce in cases of failure to provide maintenance. In the Ottoman Balkans a woman could file for divorce on the grounds that her husband was "not a good Muslim".&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

Since marriages between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are forbidden under Islamic law, when a married woman converted to Islam but her husband did not, the marriage would be considered void by Muslim authorities and the woman obtained custody of the children. Seventeenth-century sources indicate that non-Muslim women throughout the Ottoman Empire used this method to obtain a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conversion|author=Tijana Krstić|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|editors=Gábor Ágoston and Bruce Alan Masters|publisher=InfoBase Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oaths ===
==== Jurisprudence ====
The husband can end marriage through three types of oaths: the oath of continence (''īlāʿ'' and ''iẓhar''), the denial of paternity (''liʿan''), and conditional ṭalāq.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; The first two types were pre-Islamic practices confirmed by the Quran (2:226–227 for ''ila'', and 58:2–4 for ''izhar''), which also makes clear that ''izhar'' is reprehensible despite being legally valid.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

''Ila'' is an oath whereby the husband vows to refrain from sexual relations with his wife for at least four months. If he fulfils his oath, the marriage is dissolved; if he breaks it, the marriage continues. In the ''izhar'' (or ''ẓihār'') oath a man declares that his wife is as sexually prohibited to him as his mother. The husband is able to break the oath and resume the marriage. Breaking either oath requires expiation by means of feeding the poor or fasting.&lt;ref name=OEIW-found/&gt;

In the ''li'an'' oath, the husband denies paternity of his wife's child. The wife is given an opportunity to take an oath denying infidelity, and if she does so and the husband persists in his accusation, the marriage is dissolved by a judge and the couple can never remarry.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

In the oath of conditional ṭalāq, the husband declares that he will divorce his wife if he or she performs a certain act. This oath can serve as a protection for the wife or as a threat by the husband, depending on the specified act.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

==== Practice ====
Studies of practices under Mamluk and Ottoman rule found no instances of the oaths of li'an or abstinence being used, while conditional talaq seems to have played a prominent role. It was used to issue various threats to the wife as well as to make promises. In Ottoman Egypt marriage contracts commonly included stipulations of conditional talaq which were not otherwise recognized by the prevailing Hanafi school as grounds for judicial divorce, such as non-payment of maintenance or marrying a second wife.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

===Other consequences of divorce===
Islamic law does not recognize the concept of communal property, and division of property is based on its attribution to either spouse. The wife obtains custody of the children until their majority (whose definition varies according to legal school), while the father retains guardianship.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

Child custody practices under Ottoman rule appear to have followed the rules of Hanafi juridprudence, although in Ottoman Egypt children generally stayed with their divorced mother beyond the prescribed age. A divorced woman could keep custody of the children unless she remarried and her husband claimed custody, in which case it generally passed to one of her female relatives. Under the Mamluks, women could waive the right to child support in order to obtain extended custody.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt;

===Dower (''mahr'') in divorce===
''[[Mahr]]'' is a nuptial gift made by groom to the bride at the time of marriage. Upon receipt, it becomes her sole property with complete freedom of use and disposal. The marriage contract is not valid without the mahr. The amount of the mahr generally depended on the socio-economic status of the bride. The payment of a portion of the mahr was commonly deferred and served as a deterrent to the exercise of the right of unilateral divorce by the husband, although classical jurists disagreed about the permissibility and manner of deferring payment of the mahr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ghazala Anwar|title=Mahr|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0286|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic jurisprudence has clear guidance on handling of mahr in the case of divorce, depending on who asks for the divorce and whether or not the intercourse occurred. If the husband asks for a divorce and intercourse has occurred, he pays full ''mahr''; if the husband asks for a divorce and the intercourse has not occurred, the husband pays half the dower; if the wife asks for a divorce and intercourse has occurred, the husband pays half the ''mahr''; and if the wife asks for a divorce and is still an intercourse has not occurred, then no ''mahr'' is required to be paid by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sayyid Moustafa|first1=al-Qazwini|last2=Saleh|first2=Fatma|title=A New Perspective on Women in Islam|url=https://www.al-islam.org/a-new-perspective-women-islam-fatma-saleh-moustafa-al-qazwini/chapter-3-divorce-divorce-and-mahr#divorce-and-mahr|website=Al-Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|paying half the mahr if the wife asks for divorce doesn't seem to be a classical rule|date=February 2017}}

== Modern era ==
=== Legal transformation ===
In the modern era, sharia-based laws were widely replaced by statutes based on European models, and its classical rules were largely retained only in [[Status (law)|personal status]] (family) laws.&lt;ref name=OEIP-vikor/&gt; Different explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon. Several scholars have argued that because these laws are more extensively specified in the Quran and hadith than others, it has been difficult for believers to accept deviating from these rules.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt; In contrast, [[Wael Hallaq]] sees it as a legacy of colonialism: changing family laws would have provided no benefit in colonial administration, and colonial powers promoted the theory that these laws were sacred to the population, advertising their preservation as a mark of respect, which in turn led to them being taken up as a point of reference in modern Muslim identity politics.&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important changes in family laws took place in the modern era. The laws underwent codification by legislative bodies and were also displaced from their original context into modern legal systems, which generally followed Western practices in court procedure and legal education.&lt;ref name=OEIP-vikor/&gt; This severed them both from the classical interpretative tradition and from the institutional foundations of the pre-modern legal system into which they were embedded.&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq (2009), pp. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state, though they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law".&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;

=== Methods of reform ===
Changing social conditions have led to increasing dissatisfaction with traditional Islamic law of divorce since the early 20th century. Various reforms have been undertaken in an attempt to restrict the husband's right of unilateral repudiation and give women greater ability to initiate divorce.&lt;ref name=EI2-10-155&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|authors=Schacht, J. and Layish, A.| year=2000| title=Ṭalāḳ|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|volume=10|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms have utilized a number of methods, of which the most important are:&lt;ref name=EI2-10-155/&gt;

* Selection among classical juristic opinions without restriction to a single [[Madhhab|legal school]] (''takhayyur'') during state law codification
* Extending discretionary powers of the court
* Administrative measures justified with reference to the classical doctrine of ''siyasa shar'iyya'', which authorizes the ruler to enact policies in consideration of equity and expedience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Felicitas Opwis|title=Siyāsah Sharʿīyah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Emad El-Din Shahin|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199739356.001.0001/acref-9780199739356-e-0062|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Imposition of penal sanctions
* Modernistic interpretation of scriptures (sometimes called ''neo-[[ijtihad]]'') 
* Appeal to the doctrine of public interest (''[[maslaha]]'')

The [[All India Muslim Personal Law Board]] issued a code of conduct in April 2017 regarding talaq in response to the controversy over the practice of [[Triple Talaq in India|triple talaq]]. It also warned that those who  divorce for reasons not prescribed under Shariat will be socially boycotted in addition to calling for boycott of those who use triple talaq recklessly and without justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shaurya, Surabhi|date=17 April 2017|title=Triple Talaq: All India Muslim Personal Law Board issues code of conduct; here's what it says|url=http://www.india.com/news/india/triple-talaq-all-india-muslim-personal-law-board-issues-code-of-conduct-heres-what-it-says-2035881/|publisher=[[India.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bajpai, Namita|date=16 April 2017|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/apr/16/all-india-muslim-personal-law-board-announces-code-of-conduct-for-triple-talaq-1594233.html|title=All India Muslim Personal Law Board announces code of conduct for triple talaq|newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2017, The [[BJP]] Government Lok Sabha passed [[The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-the-triple-talaq-bill/article22319663.ece|title=Lok Sabha passes triple talaq bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill make instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddah) in any form — spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as email, SMS and WhatsApp illegal and void, with up to three years in jail for the husband. MPs from RJD, AIMIM, BJD, AIADMK and AIML{{clarify|what do these abbreviations mean?|date=January 2018}} opposed the bill, calling it arbitrary in nature and a faulty proposal, while Congress supported the Bill tabled in Lok Sabha by law minister [[Ravi Shankar Prasad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-backing-of-triple-talaq-bill-indicates-its-gradually-withdrawing-from-muslim-appeasement-politics-4279223.html|title=Congress' backing of triple talaq bill indicates it's gradually withdrawing from Muslim appeasement politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/congress-backs-triple-talaq-bill-khurshid-strikes-discordant-note/articleshow/62283011.cms|title=Congress backs triple talaq bill, Khurshid strikes discordant note}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
According to Yossef Rapoport, in the 15th century, the rate of divorce was higher than it is today in the modern [[Middle East]], which has generally low rates of divorce.&lt;ref name=Rapoport&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage, Money and Divorce in Medieval Islamic Society|first=Yossef|last=Rapoport|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84715-X|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 15th century [[Egypt]], [[Al-Sakhawi]] recorded the marital history of 500 [[Women in Islam|women]], the largest [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] on marriage in the [[Middle Ages]], and found that at least a third of all women in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] of Egypt and [[Syria]] married more than once, with many marrying three or more times. According to Al-Sakhawi, as many as three out of ten marriages in 15th century [[Cairo]] ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport (2005) pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, some villages in western [[Java]] and the [[Malay peninsula]] had divorce rates as high as 70%.&lt;ref name=Rapoport/&gt;

== History ==

GREC was started in 1997 at the initiative of Huguette Pérol, widow of the ambassador of France to Italy [[Gilbert Pérol]].

For twelve years, the group met monthly, inviting various speakers and organizing a much-noted 2003 colloquium on the theme "Tradition and Modernity".&lt;ref name="Golias"/&gt;

After having organized discreet meetings between the SSPX and the Holy See at the nunciature in Paris, it decided to place itself in abeyance in 2009, when [[Society of St. Pius X#Discussions_with_the_Holy_See|doctrinal discussions]] began.

== Members ==

* Alain Lorans, priest member of the [[SSPX]] and director of its press service DICI.
* [[Claude Barthe]] (b. 1947), priest of the diocese of Auch.
* [[Michel Lelong (prêtre)|Michel Lelong]] (b. 1925) of the White Fathers, formerly very active in dialogue with Muslims.
* Olivier de la Brosse (b. 1931), a priest long assigned at Rome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3166">[[File:Hama-ya,Hama-yumi,katori-city,Japan.jpg|thumb|Hama Yumi, with Hama Ya]]
The {{nihongo|'''Hama [[Yumi]]'''|[[wiktionary:破魔弓|破魔弓]]}} is a [[sacred]] bow used in 1103 [[Common Era|C.E.]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenko.org/bows.htm Zenko.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bow is said to be one of the oldest and most sacred Japanese weapons; the first Emperor Jimmu is always depicted carrying a bow.  

According to legend, at that time, the Imperial Palace was taken over by an [[evil]] [[demon]], which caused the [[Emperor]] to fall ill with great anxiety and suffering.  When the Imperial High Priests tried and failed in their efforts to destroy the demon and dispel the Imperial household of its influence, they were at a loss.  Finally, an [[Archery|archer]], [[Minamoto clan|Yorimasu Minamoto]], was summoned to the Imperial Palace in the hopes of slaying the demon with his [[bow and arrow]], ridding the palace of this plague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyudo.org/html/articles/evil_destroyingyumi.html Kyudo.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220085839/http://www.kyudo.org/html/articles/evil_destroyingyumi.html |date=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a steady hand and a [[Virtue|virtuous]] heart, Yorimasu Minamoto vanquished the demon with the first arrow, and his bow was declared to be a ''Hama Yumi''; an "Evil-Destroying Bow", (and the first arrow a ''Hama Ya''; a "Evil-Destroying Arrow").  

Since then, Hama Yumi have been used in [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Shinto]] [[ritual]]s of purification. (For example--Shihobarai--the Purification of the Four Directions.  In Japan, it is universally believed that merely the twanging of the [[Bowstring]] will frighten ghosts and evil spirits from the house.  A [[Miko]] will carry a Hama Yumi and a set of Hama Ya as part of their religious regalia, while back in [[Feudal Japan]], they were used quite literally in defense of the temple.  

As a result, Hama Ya are sold even today at shrines as [[Engimono]], (good-luck charms); smaller replicas have been placed in shrines and people's homes.  It is believed that even one Hamaya which has been blessed by a Shinto Priest carries great spiritual power, will bring protection against the forces of evil, and for purification, and they are also believed to have the ability to attract vast good fortune.  Hama Ya and Hama Yumi are often given as gifts to celebrate the first New Year of a male baby's life.  

Hama-yumi replicas are scale versions of the Sacred Japanese Bow, coated with [[Urushi]], wrapped in fine [[Rattan]] and accented in [[Gold leaf]]. They are displayed in a stand, along with two arrows tipped with Yanone, (traditional warrior tips), one representing [[male]] and the other [[female]].

The '''Heilongdawang Temple''' (literally '''Temple of the Great Black Dragon King''') is a prominent [[Chinese folk religion]]/Shenist temple located in [[Shanbei]], [[Shaanxi]] province, in [[China]].&lt;ref name=FanChen&gt;Fan Lizhu and Chen Na, "Resurgence of Indigenous Religion in China" (2013) p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; The temple enshrines the Black Dragon King with the imperially conferred title of Marquis of the Efficacious Response (灵应侯, ''Lingyinghou'').&lt;ref name=FanChen/&gt; [[Dragon king]]s (龙王, ''longwang'') are water [[deity|deities]] popular in droughty Northern China.&lt;ref name=FanChen/&gt;

The temple was completely destroyed during the anti-religious campaigns of the [[Cultural Revolution]], but rebuilt from scratch in 1982,&lt;ref name=FanChen/&gt; and since then has enjoyed growing popularity in Shanbei, becoming a [[case study]] of the revival of Chinese folk religion in sociological research.&lt;ref name=FanChen/&gt; The temple is located in an area known as the Dragon King Valley (''Longwanggou'').&lt;ref name=FanChen/&gt;

==Political career==

===Candidate for United States Senate===
In 1998 Peckman ran for the [[United States Senate]] as a member of the [[Natural Law Party]] &lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; receiving [[United States Senate elections, 1998|0.31%]] of the votes, and coming in fifth in a field of seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1998/98senate.htm |title= 1998 U.S. Senate Results |publisher= Federal Election Commission |location= Washington, DC |date=April 1999 |accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballot Initiative 101: Safety Through Peace===
In 2003, Peckman got an initiative on the ballot in Denver which said "Shall the voters for the city and county of Denver adopt an initiative ordinance to require the city to help ensure public safety by increasing peacefulness?" &lt;ref Name=CNN&gt;{{cite episode |transcript= transcript |transcripturl= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0308/13/ltm.06.html |title= Stress Test: Peace Ballot Initiative Approved in Denver |series= American morning |network= [[CNN]] |date= 13 August 2003 |accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-78316218.html |last= Chadwick |first= Alex |title= Interview: Jeff Peckman discusses a ballot initiative question in Denver which aims to reduce stress in that city |work= [[National Public Radio]] |date= 18 August 2003 |accessdate= 30 May 2007 |subscription= yes |via= Highbeam |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative failed to gain enough votes to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |url= http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16437219/detail.html# |title= Denver Man Shows 'Proof' Of Alien Visitors |station= [[KMGH-TV]] |series= ABC 7 News |location= Denver CO |date= 30 May 2008 |accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Solomon |first= Lewis D. |title= From Athens to America: Virtues and the Formation of Public Policy |publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2006 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=exd7n2hjwN8C&amp;pg=PA122 122–125] |isbn= 9780739115954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballot Initiative 300: Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission===
Since 2008 Peckman has attempted to create an Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission within the Denver city government, to prepare for visits from [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/may/08/et-call-denver-city-hall/ |last= Chacon |first= Daniel J. |title= It's a close encounter for Denver space alien initiative |newspaper= [[Rocky Mountain News]] |date= 8 May 2008 |accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thedenverdailynews.com/article.php?aID=623 |last= Davis |first= Gene |title= Petition is out there; Man says he has proof of aliens; wants commission |newspaper= [[Denver Daily News]] |date= 30 May 2008 |accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/05/05/2008-05-05_et_meet__greet_on_agenda.html |title= E.T. meet &amp; greet on agenda |newspaper= [[Daily News (New York)]] |date= 5 May 2008 |accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peckman gathered 4000 signatures to place his proposal for the seven-member commission on the November 2008 general-election ballot in Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.newschannel9.com/news/blue_968452___article.html/deal_bramanti.html |title=Beer Coffins and Space Aliens |station=[[WTVC]] News Channel 9 |location=Chattanooga, TN |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=30 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602085234/http://www.newschannel9.com/news/blue_968452___article.html/deal_bramanti.html |archivedate= 2 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he declined to file the paperwork for the November 2008 election, in the hope that an incoming Obama administration would release material on extraterrestrials to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Peter |last= Marcus |title= Liftoff for ET measure |newspaper= Denver Daily News |date= 2 December 2009 |pages= 1, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the initiative received over 7000 signatures for the 2010 Ballot. After validation by the Denver Elections Division, it was determined that the number of valid signatures was insufficient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denvergov.org/elections/ForVoters/BallotInitiatives/tabid/434412/Default.aspx#ord |author= Denver Elections Division |title= Current initiated ordinance proposals |publisher= Denver City Government |date= 29 September 2009 |accessdate= 19 October 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091107102921/http://www.denvergov.org/elections/ForVoters/BallotInitiatives/tabid/434412/Default.aspx#ord |archivedate= 7 November 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving 1000 valid signatures still required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2009/10/wake-up_call_et_phone_home_--.php |last= Calhoun |first= Patricia |title= Wake-Up Call: ET, phone home -- but use good manners |work= [[Westword]] |type= blog |date= 13 October 2009 |accessdate= 19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insufficiency was resolved by the end of November 2009, and Initiative 300 was put on Denver's November 2010 election ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Denver's Initiative 300: An Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission |date= 26 October 2010 |first= Lori |last= Kozlowski |work= Los Angeles Times website |type= blog |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/10/extraterrestrial-affairs-commission-aliens-denver-initiative-300.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was opposed by a group calling itself M.I.B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= M.I.B. |url= http://www.denveretcommission.org/ |title= The Denver ET Commission: The Truth is Here |accessdate= 3 November 2010 |publisher= The Rocky Mountain Paranormal Research Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the election, initiative 300 was rejected by 82.34% of Denver voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1= Christopher N. |last1= Osher |first2= Kyle |last2= Glazier |url= http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16505981 |title= Denver voters shoot down otherworldly measure |newspaper= [[The Denver Post]] |date= 3 November 2010 |accessdate= 3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this defeat, Peckman filed a complaint with the Denver Board of Ethics, where he questioned the "unethical, incompetent, and suspicious behavior" of Denver officials, whom he claimed assisted other "very disreputable, incompetent, unethical, and hostile persons" during the campaign, and further ponders whether these were acting in conjunction with the CIA, NSA, or other covert groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Peckman |first= Jeff |url= http://www.extracampaign.org/uploads/PRESS_RELEASE_-_Ethics_Complaint.pdf |title= Ethics Complaint Text |date= 9 March 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140107171230/http://www.extracampaign.org/uploads/PRESS_RELEASE_-_Ethics_Complaint.pdf |archivedate= 7 January 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Denver ethics board dismissed this complaint "for lack of jurisdiction, and because the complaint did not deal with any issues that are covered by the Denver Code of Ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= City and County of Denver |url= http://www.denvergov.org/Portals/5/documents/DigestOfOpinionsJan_June2011.PDF |title= Digest of Opinions |date= 1 January to 30 June 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140107173715/http://www.denvergov.org/Portals/5/documents/DigestOfOpinionsJan_June2011.PDF |archivedate= 7 January 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denver Mayoral Candidacy===
Jeff Peckman appeared on the [[Denver mayoral election, 2011|May 3, 2011 Denver Mayoral ballot]] in a field of 10 other candidates, though one had dropped out before the election.  Out of over 110,000 votes cast, Peckman received only 796 votes, coming in second to last place.

==New Age Claims==

===Metatron Technology===
He promotes Metatron Technology, which he says defends against "harmful electromagnetic waves" by transforming them into "desirable healthy energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alien ambassadors: A bizarre ufological scheme and an alleged ET video in Denver, Colorado |first=David |last=Sutton |date=June 2008 |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ufofiles/1206/alien_ambassadors.html |work=Fortean Times |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107181713/http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ufofiles/1206/alien_ambassadors.html |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraterrestrials===
Peckman is an advocate for disclosure of UFO and extraterrestrial phenomena who gained media attention in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,359563,00.html |work= Fox News |title= Video purportedly showing space aliens to be released | date= 29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he publicly displayed a video of a purported [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Quirks/2008/05/29/upi_newstrack_quirks_in_the_news/6885/ |title=UPI NewsTrack Quirks in the News: Man claims to have footage of real E.T. |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=30 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530070902/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Quirks/2008/05/29/upi_newstrack_quirks_in_the_news/6885/ |archivedate=30 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peckman publicly screened the video on May 30, 2008 at [[Metropolitan State College]] in Denver and forbid photos by reporters. The three-minute video contained images of a "white creature with a balloon-shaped head" and large dark eyes that blinked and looked through a window said to be 8 feet above the ground.

The video was said to have been made by [[Stan Romanek]], July 17, 2003, in [[Nebraska]]. A documentary including the footage was scheduled for release in 2008 but was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.denverpost.com/2008/05/30/alien-video-puppet-or-real-e-t/ |last= Mitchell |first= Kirk |title= Purported alien video confab concludes |newspaper= [[The Denver Post]] |date= 30 May 2007 |accessdate= 30 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Area skeptics used a rented alien costume and video editing software to produce a hoax version of the video that reproduced many of the movements, although experts who viewed the Romanek video assert there was no post-production editing of that video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/may/30/alien-commission-causes-commotion/ |title= Space alien video lands in Denver: Was it real or fake? : Updates |newspaper= The Rocky Mountain News |date= 30 May 2008 |accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rain Music===
In the summer of 2012, wildfires burning in the mountains of Colorado became the most destructive in the state's history.  By the middle of June, the fires had destroyed over 180 homes and taken one life.  Peckman's solution was to propose that certain music "replicates the frequencies present in nature when it rains", and that playing such music was historically proven to increase the chance of rain.  He suggested local radio and broadcast stations, government frequencies, and people in the path of the fire, play this music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mass airing of rain melody may end High Park fire, UFO enthusiast says |url= http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20892754/mass-airing-rain-melody-may-end-high-park |accessdate= 27 June 2012 |newspaper= The Denver Post |date= 19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the days after his proposal the fires worsened, bringing the destruction to at least 651 and taking six lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stanley |first =Deb |title= 220,000+ acres burned in Colorado in 2012 |url= http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/31245142/detail.html |work= thedenverchannel.com |accessdate= 4 July 2012 |date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9631">{{Greek myth}}

According to the [[Greek mythology]], the '''Korybantes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒr|ɪ|ˈ|b|æ|n|t|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Κορύβαντες}}) were the armed and crested dancers who worshipped the [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] goddess [[Cybele]] with drumming and dancing. They are also called the '''''Kurbantes''''' in [[Phrygia]]. The conventional English equivalent is "'''Corybants'''". The Korybantes were the offspring of [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] and [[Apollo]].

==Etymology==
The name Korybantes is of uncertain etymology. Edzard Johan Furnée and [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] have suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Edzard Johan Furnée, ''Die wichtigsten konsonantischen Erscheinungen des Vorgriechischen mit einem Appendix über den Vokalismus'', 1972, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 755.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others refer the name to *κορυβή (''korybé''), the Macedonian version of κορυφή (''koryphé'') "crown, top, mountain peak", explaining their association with mountains, particularly [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].&lt;ref&gt;* A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p. 107, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterparts==
The '''Kuretes''' or '''Kouretes''' ({{lang|grc|Κουρῆτες}}) were nine dancers who venerate [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the [[Crete|Cretan]] counterpart of [[Cybele]]. A fragment from [[Strabo]]'s Book VII&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], "The Kouretes and Zeus Kouros: A Study in Pre-Historic Sociology", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''15''' (1908/1909:308-338) p.&amp;nbsp;309; Harrison observes that Strabo's not very illuminating statement serves to show "that in Strabo's time even a learned man was in complete doubt as to the exact nature of the Kouretes" and second, "that in current opinion, [[Satyr]]s, Kouretes, Idaean Daktyls, Korybantes and Kabeiroi appeared as figures roughly analogous".&lt;/ref&gt; gives a sense of the roughly analogous character of these male confraternities, and the confusion rampant among those not initiated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many assert that the [[Samothrace temple complex|gods worshipped in Samothrace]]&lt;!--worshipped in original--&gt; as well as the Kurbantes and the Korybantes&lt;!--Korybantes in original--&gt; and in like manner the Kouretes and the [[Dactyl (mythology)|Idaean Daktyls]]&lt;!--Daktyls in original--&gt; are the same as the [[Cabeiri|Kabeiroi]],&lt;!--Kabeiroi in original--&gt; but as to the Kabeiroi they are unable to tell who they are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Initiatory dance==

[[File:Corybantian dance from Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities (SALTATIO article).png|thumb|left|A decorous Corybantian dance, as pictured in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith's]] ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''&amp;thinsp;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Saltatio".&lt;/ref&gt; (1870).]]

These armored male dancers kept time to a drum and the rhythmic stamping of their feet. Dance, according to Greek thought, was one of the civilizing activities, like wine-making or music. The dance in armor (the "Pyrrhic dance" or [[pyrrhichios]] [Πυρρίχη]) was a male coming-of-age initiation ritual linked to a warrior victory celebration. Both Jane Ellen Harrison and the French classicist Henri Jeanmaire&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 1908/09; Jeanmaire,''Couroi et Courètes: essai sur l'éducation spartiate et sur les rites d'adolescence dans l'antiquité hellénique,'' Lille, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that both the Kouretes (Κουρῆτες) and Cretan Zeus, who was called "the greatest ''kouros'' (κοῦρος)",&lt;ref&gt;At Palaikastro the inscribed "hymn of the Kouretes" dates to ca. 300 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; were intimately connected with the transition of boys into manhood in Cretan cities.

The English "Pyrrhic Dance" is a corruption of the original ''Pyrríkhē'' or the ''Pyrríkhios Khorós'' "Pyrrhichian Dance". It has no relationship with the king [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], who invaded Italy in the 3rd century BC, and who gave his name to the [[Pyrrhic victory]], which was achieved at such cost that it was tantamount to a defeat.

==Ecstatics==
The [[Phrygia]]n Korybantes were often confused by Greeks with other ecstatic male confraternities, such as the Idaean [[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyls]] or the Cretan Kouretes, spirit-youths (''[[Kouros|kouroi]]'') who acted as guardians of the infant [[Zeus]]. In [[Hesiod]]'s telling of Zeus's birth,&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 478-91.&lt;/ref&gt; when Great Gaia came to Crete and hid the child Zeus in a "steep cave", beneath the secret places of the earth, on Mount Aigaion with its thick forests; there the Cretan Kouretes' ritual clashing spears and shields were interpreted by Hellenes as intended to drown out the infant god's cries, and prevent his discovery by his cannibal father [[Cronus]]. Emily Vermeule observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This myth is Greek interpretation of mystifying Minoan ritual in an attempt to reconcile their Father Zeus with the Divine Child of Crete; the ritual itself we may never recover with clarity, but it is not impossible that a connection exists between the Kouretes' weapons at the cave and the dedicated weapons at [[Arkalochori]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vermeule, "A Gold Minoan Double Axe" ''Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts'' '''57''' No. 307 (1959:4-16) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the offerings recovered from the cave, the most spectacular are decorated bronze shields with patterns that draw upon north Syrian originals and a bronze [[gong]] on which a god and his attendants are shown in a distinctly Near Eastern style.&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Hoffman, ''Imports and Immigrants: Near Eastern Contacts with Early Iron Age Crete'', 1997, noted by Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008:157; "A bronze [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanum]], several cymbals, and sixty-odd shields, many finely decorated, evoke the dance of the Curetes, which is also depicted on the tympanum, even if the bearded god and his attendants are rendered in Oriental style", observes Noel Robertson, "The ancient Mother of the Gods. A missing chapter in the history of Greek religion", in Eugene Lane, ed. ''Cybele, Attis and Related Cults: Essays in Memory of M.J. Vermaseren'' 1996:248 and noted sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Korybantes also presided over the infancy of [[Dionysus]], another god who was born as a babe, and of [[Zagreus]], a Cretan child of Zeus, or child-doublet of Zeus. The wild ecstasy of their cult can be compared to the female [[Maenads]] who followed Dionysus.

[[Ovid]], in ''Metamorphoses'', says the Kouretes were born from rainwater ([[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] fertilizing [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]). This suggests a connexion with the [[Pelasgian]] [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]].

==Other functions==
The scholar [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] writes that besides being guardians, nurturers, and initiators of the infant Zeus, the Kouretes were primitive magicians and seers. She also writes that they were metal workers and that metallurgy was considered an almost magical art.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter I: The Hymn of the Kouretes, p. 1 and 26. On page 26, specifically, she writes: "The Kouretes are also, as all primitive magicians are, seers (''μαντεις''). When [[Minos]] in Crete lost his son Glaukos he sent for the Kouretes to discover where the child was hidden. Closely akin to this magical aspect is the fact that they are metal-workers. Among primitive people metallurgy is an uncanny craft and the smith is half medicine man."&lt;/ref&gt; There were several "tribes" of Korybantes, including the [[Cabeiri]], the Korybantes Euboioi, the Korybantes Samothrakioi. Hoplodamos and his [[Gigantes]] were counted among Korybantes, and [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Anytos]] was considered a Kourete.

[[Homer]] referred to select young men as ''kouretes'', when Agamemnon instructs [[Odysseus]] to pick out ''kouretes'', the bravest among the Achaeans to bear gifts to [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''[[Iliad]]'' xix.193.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks preserved a tradition down to [[Strabo]]'s day, that the Kuretes of [[Aetolia]] and [[Acarnania]] in mainland Greece had been imported from Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, x.462, quoted in Harrison 1908/09.309 note 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic church in [[Tunisia]] presently comprises only a single Latin [[archbishopric]], in the national capital [[Tunis]] : 
* the non-Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis]].

There are no Eastern Catholic, pre-diocesan or other exempt jurisdictions in Tunisia.

As this solo-episcopate warrants no national conference, it parttakes in the regional [[Episcopal conference]] of Northern Africa (French: ''Conférence Episcopale Régionale du Nord de l’Afrique'',  C.E.R.N.A.) together with [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] (hosting the headquarters in [[Rabat]]), [[Western Sahara]] and [[Libya]], the 'Great [[Maghreb]]' (Arab region West of Egypt).

There is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] (papal diplomatic representation at embassy-level) to Tunisia, which is however vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to neighbour [[Algeria]] (in [[Algiers]]).

All defunct jurisdictions are precursors of current (residential or, mostly, titular) sees.

The '''Lower Swat Valley''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|وادی سوات زیریں}}}}) in [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Lower Dir District]]s in [[Pakistan]] is an area of important archeological sites.

The lower valley of the [[Swat River]] has been occupied for the last 3000 years. The area between [[Chakdara]] Bridge and [[Saidu Sharif]] is littered with the remains of pre historic [[Aryan]]'s [[Gandhara grave culture]], [[Buddhist]] shrines and buildings of the [[Shahi]] Period. These archaeological sites are concentrated around three towns: [[Barikot]], [[Odigram]] and [[Saidu Sharif]].

==Barikot==
Near the Chakdara Bridge there are ruins from the Hindu Shahi Period and stupas at '''Haibatgram''', '''Top Dara''' and '''Landakai'''.

About 25 kilometres from Chakdara Bridge (About 20 kilometres before Saidu Sharif ),  Birkot  is the site of ancient town '''''Bazira'''''  sacked by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 326 BC. This town is situated on ancient route on the River Swat from Nawa Pass. Here ancient route  take a turn to south through '''Karakar Pass''' into Buner which  further lead to Shabaz Garhi in Peshawar Valley.

'''Gumbat Stupa''' is situated 9 kilometres south of Birkot (locally known as Barikot) in the Kandag Valley. This is one of the best preserved stupas of Swat. It consists of a cell of about 12 feet square with windows. It is surrounded on all sides by a narrow passage intended to walk around sacred images while worshipping. Before Gumbat is a large building known as '''Kanjar Kot''', meaning  ''Dancer’s Mansion''. The place is beautiful but it is not advisable to walk there without the help of locals. From the end of the road to the stupa you need to walk about 30 minutes (at least).  Besides the remains of the stupa, there are some remains of the monastery. Nothing has been done so far to preserve the site, but the stupa itself is in a rather good condition.

'''Mount Elam''', 2811 meter High Mountain is considered sacred since ancient times. In the valley of Amluk-Dara near the foot of Mount Ilam is the ruin of a stupa.

Three kilometers from [[Barikot]] towards [[Saidu Sharif]] is '''Shingerdar Stupa''' (on your right hand side). You can easily access up to the stupa by car. The site is close to the road and safe. 1.5 kilometers from Shingerdar is a large '''Buddha Carving''' on a cliff facing the road.. Further after 6 kilometers is the '''Gogdara Rock Carvings'''. These 3000-year-old engraving consist of different animals. There are some carvings that show people driving two-wheeled war chariots. These carvings were probably works of ancient Aryans. On the same rock there are some Buddhist carvings.

'''The gateway of Swat Barikot.''' 
Barikot is a town in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, located in the Swat valley region (ancient Udyana). Barikot is the present day name of the ancient "Bazira", which was besieged by Alexander the Great. Ancient fortifications by the name of Barikot-Ghwandai, located on the outskirts of the town, are being excavated by an Italian Archaeological mission since 1984. The oldest layer built of bricks and stone probably corresponds to the fortress besieged by Alexander. However, no traces of the Macedonian occupation have been found yet. The sequent layers consist of fortifications built by the Indo-Greek kings. A stone wall in Hellenistic style was built around the city, with equidistant quadrangular bastions, all according to Attic measurements. Ruins of palatial quarters as well as areas related to the Buddhist have been unearthed During the Kushan period, Barikot experienced rapid development with the creation of building dedicated to workmanship. Barikot has become a very important archaeological site, rivaling [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], for the study of history in northern Pakistan. A large quantity of the artefacts are preserved in the National Museum of Oriental Art of Rome, and the MAO in Turin. The nearby sanctuary of Butkara I has been very valuable in the study of the development of Greco-Buddhist art.

==Odigram==
[[Odigram]] is located 8 kilometers from [[Saidu Sharif]]. [[Aurel Stein]] identified this with '''''Ora''''', a city where [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] fought one of his battles. Italian archaeologists excavated this site in the 1950s. This site was occupied from 1000 BC to the 14th century AD.

During the Hindu Shahi period from the 8th century to the 10th century this was the regional capital of Swat. Ruins of  '''Raja Gira’s Fort''', the last Hindu ruler, were excavated by the Italians in the 1950s. The first mosque; [[Mahmud Ghaznavi Mosque (Odigram)|Mahmud Ghaznavi Mosque]] built in Swat was excavated in 1985 below the Hindu Shahi Fort in 1985.

==Sites around Mingora==
[[Mingora]] is one of the most important towns of the Swat Valley. It is situated 2&amp;nbsp;km from Saidu Sharif. On the other side of River Swat near Mingora Airport a site of ''Gandhara Grave Culture'' was discovered by Italian-led excavations at [[Aligrama]]. The site was dated to 1000 BC.
Sites are known as "Butkara I" (easily accessible, small fee) and Butkara II (an excavation lost in the hills and harder to find, free access).  Both sites are safe.

Near Mingora in Jambill River Valley many Buddhist remains and carvings have been found. At Panr, a stupa and monastery from the 1st century AD have been excavated. At Loebanr and Matalai, Italians archaeologist unearthed 475 Aryan graves dated 1700 BC.

'''McGavock Dickinson "Mac" Gayden''' is an American rock and [[country music|country]] singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is also president of '''Wild Child Records''', formed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildchildrecords.net/ |title=Wild Child Records |publisher=Wild Child Records |date= |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gayden was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In the early 1970s, he helped establish two critically acclaimed bands, [[Area Code 615 (band)|Area Code 615]] (signed with Polydor) and [[Barefoot Jerry]] (signed with Capitol Records), in which he played guitars and keyboards and sang. Gayden left [[Barefoot Jerry]] in 1972 to form his own band, Skyboat. He also served as producer of an album by Dianne Davidson ("Baby") and one by Steve Young ("To Satisfy You").

==Biggest hit==
Gayden's biggest hit as a writer is considered to be the song "[[Everlasting Love]]", which he co-wrote with [[Buzz Cason]], recorded originally by [[Robert Knight (musician)|Robert Knight]], a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967. It became a number one hit in the United Kingdom when covered by the [[Love Affair (band)|Love Affair]] in January 1968. [[Carl Carlton]]'s popular disco version was a number six hit in the U.S. in 1974 and has logged over five million plays, according to BMI. Gayden wrote part of the song when he was five years old on his grandmother's piano. The song is one of two that has had hit status every decade for the last four. Gayden was performing at a fraternity house at Vanderbilt, when on break he heard the voice of Robert Knight at another frat house, ran down and introduced himself, and got together with Knight to write a song for his voice. He then proceeded to meet with Knight, and finish up the song with a friend Buzz. Gayden is known for his R&amp;B hits and influences.

==Other recordings of "Everlasting Love"==
Many artists have recorded the song, including German singer [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra]], who had a hit with it in Germany and all across Europe in 1987, and [[Gloria Estefan]], who reached the top of the Billboard [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in 1995. [[U2]] recorded the song on the [[B-side]] of "All I Want is You", Jamie Cullum had a hit with the song in 2009, and it was used in the films ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'' (two versions were used), ''[[America's Sweethearts]]'', ''[[Forces of Nature (1999 film)|Forces of Nature]]'', and ''[[Veronica Guerin (film)|Veronica Guerin]]''.

==Other songs==
Gayden wrote another hit entitled "She Shot a Hole in My Soul" recorded by [[Clifford Curry]], also covered by the [[The Box Tops|Box Tops]]. Gayden as a writer favored R&amp;B music; as he said, "Nashville was an R&amp;B rivertown, until country music came in and started giving the blues artists on the street citations for playing on the street and then called it a Country Music Town." Gayden wrote songs for several black singing groups, Robert Knight (see above), the Valentines, and Clifford Curry, who in 2009 was honored in a compilation CD, ''Night Train to Nashville'' and won a [[Grammy]]. Gayden performed with [[Bob Dylan]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and the [[Stone Poneys]], [[John Hiatt]], [[Loudon Wainwright III|Loudon Wainwright]], [[Joe Simon]], [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], [[Margie Hendrixs]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Gregg Allman|Gregg]] and [[Duane Allman]], [[Steve Young]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Ian &amp; Sylvia]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Hoyt Axton]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] among others. Gayden has written country hits for [[Bobby Bare]] and [[Porter Wagoner]].

Gayden is also a session guitarist and is renowned for his innovative [[wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]] slide guitar technique, as showcased on the early 1970s [[J. J. Cale]] hit "Crazy Mama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgayden.com/MacMainPage_content.html |title=Mac Gayden legendary slide wah guitarist song writer Everlasting Love |publisher=Macgayden.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a number of successful songs, including "Hayride", which was a major Australian hit for [[Flying Circus (band)|Flying Circus]]. "La La" was an even bigger hit. He also co-wrote and co-produced Robert Knight's "[[Love on a Mountain Top]]". [[Simon Cowell]] recorded Gayden's "Love on a Mountaintop" on Sinitta (Top 20, 1989). When Gayden played on Bob Dylan's album ''Blonde on Blonde'', Dylan's producer Bob Johnston asked to produce an album for him; the album, ''McGavock Gayden'', was released by EMI Records.

==Producing==
Gayden is currently producing groups, one is his daughter Oceana Gayden, and has performed at [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo]] and other festivals with her.

{{Vaishnavism}}

The '''Madhva tradition''' (also referred  as '''Madhva Sampradaya''', or '''Sad Vaishnavism''') is a denomination within the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of [[Hinduism]], founded by the thirteenth century philosopher [[Madhvacharya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Krishnas: Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=K0XqbG0LKBUC|publisher=SUNY Press|author=Guy L. Beck|year=2012|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rajasthan Through the Ages: Art, architecture and memoirs|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vZrpAAAAMAAJ|page=333|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|author=Suresh K. Sharma, Usha Sharma|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a movement in [[Hinduism]] that developed during its classical period around the beginning of the Common Era. Philosophically, Madhva tradition is aligned with [[Dvaita Vedanta]], and regards [[Madhvacharya]] as its founder or reformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion: A Continuing Series--, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uec1E8DpiH8C|author1=Nagendra Kr Singh|author2=A. P. Mishra|publisher=Global Vision Pub House|year=2005|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Madhva tradition, the creator is superior to the creation, and hence [[moksha]] comes only from the grace of [[Vishnu]], but not from effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Hindu Lord of Many Names: An Encyclopedia of the Hindu Lord of Many Names|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4fw2DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165|author=Lavanya Vemsani|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=13 June 2016|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''Madhva'' is derived from the name of the tradition's founder, Madhvacharya. The term ''sampradaya'' refers to a Hindu religious tradition. The term ''Sad Vaishnavism'' is derived from ''sad'', meaning "true", and the Hindu deity [[Vishnu]], whose worshipers are known as Vaishnavism; this name of the tradition may thus be translated as "true Vaishnavism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grace in Christianity and Hinduism|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pujRGufjKBAC|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co|page=179|author=Sabapathy Kulandran|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Saints of India|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QoQaBgAAQBAJ|publisher=Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog|year=2014|page=contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Schuhmacher |title=The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Zen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpP8770qVakC |date=1994 |publisher=Shambhala |isbn=978-0-87773-980-7 |page=397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of ''Sad Vaishnavism'' are known as ''Sad Vaishnavas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Famous Indian sages: their immortal messages|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dKnXAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Sagar Publications|page=356|year=1982|author=Vivek Ranjan Bhattacharya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and theology==
According to Madhvism, the Divine and the soul are completely distinct from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Viṣṇu, the Ever Free: A Study of the Mādhva Concept of God|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hITXAAAAMAAJ|page=227|publisher=Dialogue Series|author=Ignatius Puthiadam|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhva Sampradaya worships Vishnu as the highest Hindu deity and regards [[Madhva]], whom they consider to be an incarnation of Vishnu's son, [[Vayu]], as an incarnate saviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=
Encyclopedia Americana: M to Mexico City|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=U_gWAQAAMAAJ|page=59|publisher=Scholastic Library Publishing|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhvism regards Vayu as [[Vishnu]]'s agent in this world, and [[Hanuman]], [[Bhima]], and [[Madhvacharya]] to be his three incarnations; for this reason, the roles of Hanuman in the [[Ramayana]] and Bhima in the [[Mahabharata]] are emphasised, and Madhvacharya is particularly held in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prāci-jyotī: Digest of Indological Studies, Volume 13|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=28A5AQAAIAAJ|page=245|publisher=Kurukshetra University|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vayu is prominently shown by Madhva in countless texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Madhva's Philosophy of the Viṣṇu Faith|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GITXAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Dvaita Vedanta Studies and Research Founda|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|year=1992|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Culture: Journal of the Indian Research Institute, Volume 3, Issues 3-4|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8mBDAAAAYAAJ|year=1984|publisher=I.B. Corporation|page=505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhvacharya, was a staunch Vaishnava who pushed strongly the belief that Vishnu was the highest of Hindu deities, and refused to accept any claims that other Hindu deities, such as [[Brahma]] or [[Shiva]], might be equally the highest among the deities. Madhvacharya says that in the beginning there was only one God and that was [[Narayana]] or [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Famous Indian sages: their immortal messages|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dKnXAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Sagar Publications|page=356|year=1982|author=Vivek Ranjan Bhattacharya}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhvacharya states that the ultimate divine reality, which Hindu traditions refer to as [[Brahman]], and the individual souls, known as [[jiva|jīvātman]]s, exist as independent realities, and that these are distinct. Madhvacharya asserted, ''yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}}

Madhvism rejects not only the [[Advaita Vedanta]], or monism, of [[Shankaracharya]], but also the [[Vishistadvaita]], or qualified monism, of [[Ramanujacharya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian Encyclopaedia: La Behmen-Maheya|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4LqRXZPJTUoC|publisher=Genesis Publishing|author=Subodh Kapoor|year=2002|page=4425}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Madhva rejects Shankara's conception of the ''Nirguna Brahman''--that is, Brahman without characterisations--and accepts the conception of the ''Saguna Brahman''--that is, Brahman with characterisations--as the ultimate divine reality. In Madhva philosophy, Brahman possess all positive qualities; at the root of these are existence, consciousness, and bliss. An impersonal Brahman, such as Shankara's Nirguna Brahman cannot perform these functions. For Madhva, the personal Brahman is not different from Vishnu, whom Vaishavas consider to be the creator, the maintainer and destroyer of the world. According to the Madhva viewpoint, nothing can condition Brahman. According to Madhva, Brahman is neither the limited infinite divine reality of the [[Nyaya]] school nor a being in inseparable relation with matter and selves as in the philosophy of [[Ramanuja]]. Rather, Brahman is viewed as completely independent, but whilst the jivas are viewed as dependent upon Brahman for activity, knowledge, and existence. According to the Vaishnava viewpoint, Vishnu creates the world by his will and brings into existence the world of objects and selves. Objects and selves, the though real and irreducible to each other, are dependent on Brahman. At the time of dissolution of the world, material and objects are considered to be transformed into undifferentiated matter and selves into disembodied intelligence by Brahman; it is believed, even in the state of dissolution, that Brahman, matter, and the jivas remain distinct from one another, and do not merge with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion: Hinduism : J-R|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0TBTVPax4E8C|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|author1=Nagendra Kr Singh|author2=A.

===Haridasa movement===
{{Main article|Haridasa}}

The devotional movement of the [[Haridasa]] of [[Karnataka]] was an expression of [[Madhva]]'s religious thought. The Haridasa movement initiated by Madhva has had a deep impact on the people in different parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=President R.

==Institutions==
Madhvacharya established many Mathas by defeating various acharya's of different sampradaya's.

The '''''Mikraot Gedolot''''' (מקראות גדולות) "Great Scriptures," often called the "[[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic]] Bible" in English,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker ''An introduction to Judaic thought and rabbinic literature'' 2007 Page 158 "Moreover, the so-called Rabbinic Bible, the Mikraot Gedolot (“Great Scriptures”), may have as many as ten different commentaries, and notes on the commentaries accompany the text, thus providing a range of possible interpretations of ..."&lt;/ref&gt; is an 
edition of the [[Tanakh]] (in Hebrew) that generally includes four distinct elements:
*The Biblical text according to the ''[[Masoretic Text|masorah]]'' in its letters, [[niqqud|vocalization]], and [[cantillation marks]].
*Masoretic notes on the Biblical text.
*Aramaic [[Targum]].
*[[Bible commentary|Biblical commentaries]] (most common and prominent are medieval commentaries in the ''peshat'' tradition).

Numerous editions of the Mikraot Gedolot have been and continue to be published.

== Commentaries ==
In addition to [[Targum Onkelos]] and [[Rashi]]'s commentary – the standard Jewish commentaries on the Hebrew Bible – the Mikraot Gedolot will include numerous other commentaries. For instance, the [[Romm publishing house]] edition of the Mikraot Gedolot contains the following additional commentaries:&lt;ref name="Rommedition"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mikraot Gedolot: Vayikra|year=1899|publisher=Romm Publishing House|location=Vilna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahQwAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dPHuUeq5IMvi4AOekYHYDQ&amp;ved=0CEMQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2013|language=Hebrew, Aramaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ben Hayyim edition==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Miqraoth Gdoloth Bomberg001.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[1524]]]] --&gt;

First published in 1516–17 by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in [[Venice]], the Mikraot Gedolot was edited by the masoretic scholar [[Yaakov ben Hayyim]]. All of its elements - text, [[Masoretic Text|masorah]], [[Targum]], and commentaries were based upon the manuscripts that Ben Hayyim had at hand (although he did not always have access to the best ones according to some, Ginsburg and some others argued that it was a good representation of the [[Ben Asher]] text).

The Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim, though hailed as an extraordinary achievement, was riddled with thousands of technical errors. Objections were also raised by the Jewish readership, based on the fact that the very first printing of the Mikra'ot Gedolot was edited by [[Felix Pratensis]], a Jew converted to Christianity. Furthermore, Bomberg, a Christian, had requested an ''imprimatur'' from the Pope. Such facts were not compatible with the supposed Jewish nature of the work; Bomberg had to produce a fresh edition under the direction of acceptable Jewish editors. Nevertheless, this first edition served as the textual model for nearly all later editions until modern times. With regard to the Biblical text, many of Ben Hayyim's errors were later corrected by [[Menahem Lonzano]] and [[Jedidiah Norzi|Shlomo Yedidiah Norzi]].

The Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim served as the [[textus receptus]] for the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in 1611 and the Spanish [[Reina-Valera]] translation.

==Recent printed editions==

Most editions until the last few decades, and many editions even today, are reprints of or based on late nineteenth century Eastern European editions, which are in turn based more or less on the Ben Hayyim edition described above.

In the last generation fresh editions of the Mikraot Gedolot have been published, based directly on manuscript evidence, principally the ''[[Aleppo Codex|Keter Aram Tzova]]'', the manuscript of the Tanakh kept by the Jews of Aleppo.  These also have improved texts of the commentaries based on ancient manuscripts.  Three of these editions are:

The proverbial expression of  the '''''mills of God grinding slowly''''' refers to the notion of slow but certain [[divine retribution]].

[[Plutarch]] (1st century AD) alludes to the metaphor as a then-current adage in his ''[[Moralia]]'' (''De sera numinis vindicta'' "On the Delay of Divine Vengeance"):
:"Thus, I do not see what use there is in those mills of the gods said to grind so late as to render punishment hard to be recognized, and to make wickedness fearless."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://archive.org/details/plutarchondelayo00plut|title=Plutarch on the Delay of Divine Justice|author=A. P. Peabody|date=1885}}.
{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0U-hsAonP1AC&amp;pg=PA253 |title=Essays |chapter=On God's Slowness to Punish|author=Plutarch, Ian Kidd, Robin Waterfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plutarch no doubt here makes reference to a hexameter by an unknown poet, cited by sceptic philosopher, [[Sextus Empiricus]] (2nd century) in his ''Adversus Grammaticos'' as a popular adage:&lt;ref&gt;
''Adversus Mathematicos I'' [https://la.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Pagina:Sexti_Empirici_Adversus_mathematicos.djvu/49&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 Cap. 17]
D.L. Blank, trans. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nuh8IOQiCH8C&amp;pg=PA311 p. 311].
{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YjaHwdvEVZAC&amp;pg=PA31 |title=Israel and Hellas |volume=3 |author=John Pairman Brown}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
:{{lang|grc|Ὀψὲ θεῶν ἀλέουσι μύλοι, ἀλέουσι δὲ λεπτά. }} 
:"The millstones of the gods grind late, but they grind fine."&lt;ref&gt;The Greek μύλοι is plural, referring to two [[grindstone]]s (i.e. [[Quern-stone|quern]] and handstone) forming a single mill; the Latin translation by [[Gentian Hervetus]] (1569)  renders this as ''mola'' "mill" in the singular: ''{{lang|la|Est mola tarda dei, verum molit illa minutim}}''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The same expression was invoked by [[Celsus]] in his (lost) ''[[The True Word|True Discourse]]''.
Defending the concept of [[ancestral fault]], Celsus reportedly quoted  "a priest of Apollo or of Zeus":
:{{lang|grc|Ὀψὲ, φησι, θεῶν ἀλέουσι μύλοι, κἆϛ παίδων παῖδας τοί κεν μετόπισθε γένωνται.}}
:'The mills of the gods grind slowly', he says, even 'To children's children, and to those who are born after them.'&lt;ref name="Gagné2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gagné|first=Renaud |title=Ancestral Fault in Ancient Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fbn1AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-107-03980-3|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Sibylline Oracles]] (c. 175) have ''Sed mola postremo pinset divina farinam'' ("but the divine mill will at last grind the flour").&lt;ref&gt;Book 8 verse 15 ''Sibylline Oracles'' trans. M. S. Terry (1890) "Late will the mills of God grind the fine flour".
On the date of c. AD 175 for book 8, verses 1&amp;ndash;216 see:  J. J. Collins "Sibylline Oracles (Second Century B.C.–Seventh Century A.D)" in: Charlesworth (ed.), Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, vol. 1, Hendrickson Publishers (1983), 317–472 (here: p. 416).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb was in frequent use in the [[Protestant Reformation]], often in the Latin translation ''Sero molunt deorum molae'' due to [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] (''[[Adagia]]'', 1500),&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus of Rotterdam, ''Adagia'' 3382 (4.4.82) ''Sero molunt deorum molae: 
Plutarchus in commentario cui titulus Πέρι τὦν ὑπὸ τοῦ θείου βραδέως τιμωρουμένων : Ὥστε οὐχ ὁρὦ τί χρήσιμον ἔνεστι τοῖς ὀψὲ δὴ τούτοις ἀλεῖν λεγομένοις μύλοις τὦν θεὦν, id est Itaque non video quidnam utilitatis insit istis deorum molis quae sero dicuntur molere. Caeterum ex his quae praecedunt eodem in loco, colligere licet dici solitum de his qui, licet serius, tamen aliquando poenas dant malefactorum vindici deo.''&lt;/ref&gt; but also in German translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Early New High German]] variants: ''Gots mül steht offt lang stil; Die götter malen oder scheren eim langsam, aber wol.'' Nina-Maria Klug, ''Das konfessionelle Flugblatt 1563–1580: Eine Studie zur historischen Semiotik und Textanalyse'', volume 112 of ''Studia Linguistica Germanica'', Walter de Gruyter, 2012
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=JkduWGwdQcsC&amp;pg=PA189  p. 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression was anthologised in English translation by  [[George Herbert]] in his collection of proverbs entitled ''Jacula Prudentum'' (1652), as "God's mill grinds slow but sure" (no. 743).
German [[epigram]]matist  [[Friedrich von Logau]] in his ''Sinngedichte'' (c. 1654) composed an extended variant of the saying, under the title "Göttliche Rache" (divine retribution),&lt;ref&gt;"Göttliche Rache", ''Sinngedichte'' III, 2, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:''{{lang|de|Gottes Mühlen mahlen langsam, mahlen aber trefflich klein,&lt;br/&gt; ob aus Langmut er sich säumet, bringt mit Schärf 'er alles ein.}}'' 
translated into English  by  [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] ("Retribution", ''Poetic Aphorisms'', 1846):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1=Hugh Rawson |editor2=Margaret Miner |work=The Oxford Dictionary of American Quotations| title=God, 8| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whg05Z4Nwo0C&amp;pg=PA289|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-516823-5|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Though the mills of God grind slowly; Yet they grind exceeding small;''
:''Though with patience He stands waiting, With exactness grinds He all.''

The proverb was used by [[Agatha Christie]] in her novel ''Hercule Poirot's Christmas'', as a person quoted it when they saw the corpse of a man who had lived an evil life. It was also referred to by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] in the novel [[The Moon and Sixpence]] wherein it is used, somewhat piously, by a family member to imply a certain justice in the demise of the central character Charles Strickland,

{{Quote
|text=Then I told them what I had learned about Charles Strickland in Tahiti. I thought it unnecessary to say anything of Ata and her boy, but for the rest I was as accurate as I could be. When I had narrated his lamentable death I ceased. For a minute or two we were all silent. Then Robert Strickland struck a match and lit a cigarette.

"The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small," he said, somewhat impressively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1959">Mount Mainak ([[Sanskrit]]: मैनाक [[IAST]]) or '''Mainak Parvat''' is a mountain from the [[Hindu]] epic [[Ramayana]] who also is the brother-in-law of Lord [[Shiva]] and brother of Goddess [[Parvati]]. Mainak had the ability to fly and also grow in size and was also known as the Golden Mountain.

==Birth==
Once King [[Himalaya]] who was also known as Shailraj who once ruled the north, desired to get married have a family. At the request of the gods, all elders started considering their daughters to him and soon he got married to Maina. She was the daughter of Swadha (daughter of [[Daksha]]). While at the wedding Lord [[Vishnu]], [[Indra]] informed the couple that divine birth of Lord Shiva's Wife [[Parvati]] on earth was due and hence they advised the couple to pray to Goddess [[bhagavathi|Bhagwati]] that she be born as their daughter. So for 27 years [[Himalaya]] and Maina prayed to Goddess [[bhagavathi|Bhagwati]] at the end of which she appeared before them and asked them for a boon. Maina asked for boon of having 100 sons and also wished that Goddess [[bhagavathi|Bhagwati]] be born as her Daughter. In due time Maina had hundred sons, the eldest of them was Mainak. Also they had a beautiful daughter whom they named Uma who later came to be known as [[Parvati]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Gajanan-God-Elephant-Head-Ganesha/dp/812840024X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gloriousindia.com/scriptures/puranas/shiva_purana/birth_of_parvati.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainak Submerged==
As per Hindu mythology many ancient mountains had wings and had the divine power of flight. However due to some misunderstanding Lord Indra chopped off the wings of Mainak's 99 brothers. However Mainak sought help from Vayu God and so Vayu placed Mainak into the ocean blocking demons from coming out from the underworld.He later came out to serve Hanuman in his mission for Ram Karya.

A '''''pandal''''' ({{my|မဏ္ဍပ်}} or '''''mandat''''' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], from [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''[[Tamil_loanwords_in_other_languages]]'') is a fabricated structure, either temporary or permanent, that is used{{where |date =July 2016}} in a religious event that gathers people together, such as a wedding or festival.

==In Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], a ''pandal'' is a temporary structure set up to venerate the god [[Ganesha]] during [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] or the goddess [[Durga]] during [[Durga Puja]], known as ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] pandal''.{{clarify |post-text = Are these all the uses or just two examples?|date=July 2016}}

==In Buddhism in Sri Lanka==
[[File:Durga Puja, Matri Mandir, Safdarjung Enclave, Delhi, 2014.JPG|thumb|''Durga Puja Pandal'' with theatre performances, [[Matri Mandir]], [[Safdarjung Enclave]], [[Delhi]], 2014]]
In a ritual unique to [[Sri Lanka]], ''Vesak thorana'' pandals are set up during the [[Vesak]] festival, with illuminated panels illustrated with episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jataka tales|Jathaka Katha]] or stories based on [[Buddhist culture]]. 

The fundamental concept of a Vesak Pandal is a creatively made, massive structure, decorated with a large number of lights and paintings mounted on a huge supporting structure. This supporting structure is traditionally built with ''Puwak Gasa'' ([[Arriconut]] trees). Creating the structure requires creativity, inventiveness and the high-level expertise of a number of artists and [[light-system]] electricians, not to mention funding and planning in advance. The goal is to create a very beautiful and colorful experience. Many different and dedicated groups of experts  participating often pass down this work from generation to generation or master to student. 

The most significant part of this display uses simple techniques in an intelligent way to create lighting on the front of the pandal. Most of the time this is a 2D structure.

==Other types of pandals==
Pandals are also set up during [[Gammaduwa]] (village rebirth) festivals, honouring the goddess [[Pattini]].{{clarify |post-text = Is this also only in Sri Lanka, only elsewhere, or both?|date=July 2016}}

Pandal also refers to platforms from which people splash water during the new year celebrations of the [[Thingyan]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/water08/wa04.htm|title=Constructing a pandal for festival fun|author=Kyaw Zin Htun|author2=Yadana Htun|date=24 March 2008|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pandal can also be a [[ceremonial gate]], built to welcome visitors.

A city in the Nilgiris district of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] is named [[Pandalur]].{{clarify |post-text = Is this city name's origin connected with pandals or is it only spelled similarly?|date=July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3360">'''Qallu''' is a name in which the people (person) who are believed to be the descents of Sayyid  [[Abu Bakr]] al-Siddiq, the first [[Caliph]] of [[Islam]],  are known in [[Ogaden|Eastern Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]].

==Etymology==

Qallu is a common name known in Oromo, Somali, Harari, Afar traditions because there is a clan called “Qallu’’ within each of these ethnic groups. However, it is the Oromos or the Somalis who enthusiastically refer to the name.&lt;ref name="BRAUK"&gt;Ulrich Braukämper: ''Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia. Collected Essays'', Göttinger Studien zur Ethnologie 9, 2003, {{ISBN|978-3-8258-5671-7}}, pp.112-123, 117&lt;/ref&gt;
It is said{{Who|date=May 2012}} that “Qallu” to mean "people of the religion", and it describes the Qallu’s main occupation in their societies. That means in the past, most of the persons who belong to Qallu clan were dominantly the teachers of Islam in the areas that they reside.&lt;ref name="BRAUK"/&gt;

==Variations in the Descriptions of Qallu==

The Qallu inhabit [[Hararghe]], [[Somali Region]], and [[Dire Dawa]] as well as the Republics of [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]]. The Qallu’s in Ethiopia trace back their genealogy mostly to a man called “Aw Omar Ziyad”, and then to “Aw Qutub”, and Aw  [[Abadir Umar Ar-Rida]], a scholar to whom the Harari’s refer as the Patron Saint of [[Harar]].  And all Qallus in Ethiopia claim they have the same blood with [[Sheekhaal]], a clan whom [[Sir Richard Burton]] repeatedly mentioned in his book titled [[First Footsteps in East Africa]].&lt;ref name="Richard Burton 1966 p. 165"&gt;Richard Burton, First Footsteps in East Africa, 1856; edited with an introduction and additional chapters by Gordon Waterfield (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Somalia, there is a little bit unclear tradition of the Qallus. Some people categorize them under the well known [[Sheekhaal]] clan. Others group them under [[Fiqi Omar]] clan.

==Geographical Dispersions of the Qallu==

Richard Burton describes that Qallu (Sheekhaash) is dispersed among its brothers (other clans) and they can be found from Ifat up to [[Ogaden]].&lt;ref name="Richard Burton 1966 p. 165"/&gt; This is an exact description of the highly reverend clan of Qallu. Today, as Burton witnessed 150 years ago, the Qallu inhabit an area from [[Somlia]] up to [[Wello]].  However, the highly concentrated communities of the Qallu can be found in the following areas.

* in [[Babille, Oromia (woreda)|Babille]], [[Deder (woreda)|Deder]], [[Jarso (Hararge)|Jarso]] and [[Gursum, Oromia (woreda)|Gursum]] in [[Misraq Hararghe Zone|East Hararghe]];
* in the Walled City of [[Harar]];
* in [[Shinile]] Zone and in Dire Dawa [[Administrative divisions of Ethiopia|chartered city]];
* in  [[Jijiga]] woreda of the [[Somali Region]];
* in [[Habro]], [[Gubba Qoricha]], [[Qunni]], [[Chiro]], [[Boke (woreda)|Boke]] and [[Mieso]] woredas of [[Mirab Hararghe Zone|West Hararghe]],  Zone.

[[File:St. Yves.JPG|thumb|Reliquary and skull of Saint [[Ivo of Kermartin]] (St. Yves or St. Ives), (1253–1303) in [[Tréguier]], [[Brittany]], France]]
In religion, a '''relic''' usually consists of the physical remains of a saint or the personal effects of the saint or venerated person preserved for purposes of [[veneration]] as a tangible memorial. Relics are an important aspect of some forms of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Shamanism]], and many other religions. ''Relic'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''reliquiae'', meaning "remains", and a form of the Latin verb ''relinquere'', to "leave behind, or abandon". A [[reliquary]] is a [[shrine]] that houses one or more religious relics.

==In classical antiquity==
[[File:Hero cult Louvre CA308.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Amphora]] depicting [[Greek hero cult]] in honor of Oedipus ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure]], 380–370 BC)]]
In [[ancient Greece]], a [[polis|city]] or [[Greek temple|sanctuary]] might claim to possess, without necessarily displaying, the remains of a venerated [[hero]] as a part of a [[Greek hero cult|hero cult]]. Other venerable objects associated with the hero were more likely to be on display in sanctuaries, such as spears, shields, or other weaponry; [[chariots]], ships or [[Figurehead (object)|figureheads]]; furniture such as chairs or [[Sacrificial tripod|tripods]]; and clothing. The sanctuary of the [[Phoebe (Leucippides)|Leucippides]] at [[Sparta]] claimed to display the egg of [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunnel Ekroth, "Heroes and Hero-Cult", in ''A Companion to Greek Religion''  (Blackwell, 2010), pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bones were not regarded as holding a particular power derived from the hero, with some exceptions, such as the divine shoulder of [[Pelops]] held at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Miracles and healing were not regularly attributed to them;&lt;ref name="Ekroth-p110-111"&gt;Ekroth, "Heroes and Hero-Cult", pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt; rather, their presence was meant to serve a [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] function, as the tomb of [[Oedipus]] was said to protect [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fainlight and Robert J. Littman, ''The Theban Plays: Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bones of [[Orestes]] and [[Theseus]] were supposed to have been stolen or removed from their original resting place and reburied.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Alcock, "Tomb Cult and the Post-Classical Polis", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 95 (1991), p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of the [[Delphic Oracle]], the [[Sparta]]ns searched for the bones of Orestes and brought them home, without which they had been told they could not expect victory in their war against the neighboring [[Tegea]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'' 1.46, as cited by Fainlight and Littman, ''The Theban Plays'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] says that the Athenians were likewise instructed by the oracle to locate and steal the relics of Theseus from the [[Dolopia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Theseus'' 36, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Theseus*.html#36 Bill Thayer's edition] of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation at [[LacusCurtius]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of the legendary [[Eurystheus]] was also supposed to protect Athens from enemy attack,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Heracleides'' 1032–34; [[Aeschylus]], ''Eumenides'' 763ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], that of the prophet [[Amphiaraus]], whose cult was oracular and healing.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 8.134 and Aeschylus, ''Seven Against Thebes'' 587–588, as cited by Fainlight and Littman, ''The Theban Plays'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch narrates transferrals similar to that of Theseus for the bodies of the historical [[Demetrius I of Macedon]] and [[Phocion|Phocion the Good]]&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Demetrius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demetrius*.html#53 53] and ''Phocion'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Phocion*.html#37 37–38], English translations at [[LacusCurtius]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bones or ashes of [[Aesculapius]] at [[Epidaurus]], and of [[Perdiccas I]] at Macedon, were treated with the deepest veneration.

As with the relics of Theseus, the bones are sometimes described in literary sources as gigantic, an indication of the hero's "larger than life" status. On the basis of their reported size, it has been conjectured that such bones were those of [[History of paleontology|prehistoric creatures]], the startling discovery of which may have prompted the sanctifying of the site.&lt;ref name="Ekroth-p110-111" /&gt;

The head of the poet-prophet [[Orpheus]] was supposed to have been transported to [[Lesbos]], where it was enshrined and visited as an [[oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus III|Philostratus]], ''Heroicus'' 5.3 and ''Life of Apollonius'' 4.14; Joseph Falaky Nagy, "Hierarchy, Heroes, and Heads: Indo-European Structures in Greek Myth", in ''Approaches to Greek Myth'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), pp. 210–212. [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vase paintings]] also depict the head of Orpheus prophesying.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] reported that the bones of Orpheus were kept in a stone vase displayed on a pillar near [[Dion, Pieria|Dion]], his place of death and a major religious center. These too were regarded as having oracular power, which might be accessed through dreaming in a [[incubation (ritual)|ritual of incubation]]. The accidental exposure of the bones brought a disaster upon the town of Libretha, whence the people of Dion had transferred the relics to their own keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 9.30.4–5, as cited and discussed by Nagy, pp. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', the bones of the Persian [[Zoroaster]] were venerated,&lt;ref&gt;Dindorf, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; but the tradition of [[Zoroastrianism]] and its scriptures offer no support of this.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Hinduism ==
In [[Hinduism]], relics are less common than in other religions since the physical remains of most saints are cremated. The veneration of corporal relics may have originated with the ''[[śramaṇa]]'' movement or the appearance of [[Buddhism]], and burial practices became more common after the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Muslim invasions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aymard |first=Orianne |date=2014 |title=When a Goddess Dies: Worshipping Ma Anandamayi after Her Death |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4hSAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=71 |isbn=0199368635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}
[[File:Buddha relics.JPG|thumb|right|Buddha relics from [[Kanishka]]'s [[stupa]] in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, now in [[Mandalay]], Burma (2005)]]
{{Main|Śarīra}}
In [[Buddhism]], relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and various sages are venerated. After the Buddha's death, his remains were divided into eight portions. Afterward, these relics were enshrined in [[stupa]]s wherever Buddhism was spread.

Some relics believed to be original remains of the body of the Buddha still survive, including the much-revered Sacred [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha]] in Sri Lanka.

A stupa is a building created specifically for the relics. Many Buddhist temples have stupas and historically, the placement of relics in a stupa often became the initial structure around which the whole temple would be based. Today, many stupas also hold the ashes or [[ringsel]] of prominent/respected Buddhists who were [[cremation|cremated]]. In rare cases the whole body is conserved, for example in the case of [[Dudjom Rinpoche]], after his death his physical body was moved a year later from France and placed in a stupa in one of his main monasteries near [[Boudhanath]], Nepal in 1988. Pilgrims may view his body through a glass window in the stupa.

The Buddha's relics are considered to show people that enlightenment is possible, to remind them that the Buddha was a real person, and to also promote good virtue.

==Christianity==
[[File:BJ23-reliquary.jpg|thumb|[[Reliquary]] at [[Pope St. John XXIII National Seminary]] in the [[United States]], with relics of [[James the Greater|St. James]], [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew]], [[Philip the Apostle|St. Philip]], [[Simon the Zealot|St. Simon]], [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]], [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]] and other [[saint]]s.]]

===History===
One of the earliest sources that purports to show the efficacy of relics is found in {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|13:20–21|KJV}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man's body into Elisha's tomb.  When the body touched Elisha's bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet. ''([[New International Version|NIV]])''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also cited is the veneration of Polycarp's relics recorded in the ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' (written 150–160 AD).&lt;ref name=head&gt;[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/religion/hagiography/cult.htm Head, Thomas. "The Cult of the Saints and Their Relics", The On-line Reference Book for Medieval Studies (the ORB), College of Staten Island, City University of New York] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717041711/http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/religion/hagiography/cult.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to relics that are objects, an often cited passage is [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19:11–12, which says that Paul's handkerchiefs were imbued by God with healing power. In the gospel accounts of [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman]] and again at [[Gospel of Mark]] 6:56, those who touched Jesus's garment were healed.

The practice of venerating relics seems to have been taken for granted by writers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], St. [[Ambrose]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], St. [[Chrysostom]], and St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]]. Dom Bernardo Cignitti, O.S.B., wrote, “...[T]he remains of certain dead are surrounded with special care and veneration. This is because the mortal remains of the deceased are associated in some manner with the holiness of their souls which await reunion with their bodies in the resurrection.”&lt;ref name=mangan&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0331.html Mangan, Charles. "Church Teaching on Relics", Catholic Education Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] (d. 1274) pointed out that it was natural that people should treasure what is associated with the dead, much like the personal effects of a relative.&lt;ref name=odonnell/&gt; In an interview with Catholic News Service, Fr. Mario Conte, executive editor of the Messenger of St. Anthony magazine in Padua, Italy, said, "Saints' relics help people overcome the abstract and make a connection with the holy. ...Saints do not perform miracles. Only God performs miracles, but saints are intercessors."&lt;ref name=griffin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/news/report.aspx?id=4106|title=Catholic News - Saints' Relics Help People Make Connection to the Holy - American Catholic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early church the disturbance, let alone the division, of the remains of martyrs and other saints was not practiced.  They were allowed to remain in their often unidentified resting places in cemeteries and the [[catacombs of Rome]], always outside the walls of the city, but [[martyrium (architecture)|martyrium]]s began to be built over the site of the burial, and it was considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to the remains of saints, several large "funerary halls" being built over the sites of martyr's graves, including [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]. These were initially not regular churches, but "covered cemeteries" crammed with graves, and celebrating funerary and memorial services. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia it may have been thought that when the souls of the martyrs went to heaven on [[resurrection of the dead|resurrection day]] they would be accompanied by those interred nearby, who would gain favour with God.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;

The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 drew on the teaching of St. [[John Damascene]]&lt;ref name=butterfield/&gt; that homage or respect is not really paid to an inanimate object, but to the holy person, and indeed the veneration of a holy person is itself honour paid to God.&lt;ref name=odonnell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carmelite.org/index.php?nuc=content&amp;id=127|title=Relics|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301045514/http://carmelite.org/index.php?nuc=content&amp;id=127|archivedate=2016-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council decreed that every altar should contain a relic, making it clear that this was already the norm, as it remains to the present day in the Catholic and Orthodox churches. The veneration of the relics of the saints reflects a belief that the saints in heaven intercede for those on earth. A number of cures and miracles have been attributed to relics, not because of their own power, but because of the holiness of the saint they represent.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;[http://www.bostoncatholic.org/Being-Catholic/Content.aspx?id=11478 "Relics of Saints", ''Boston Catholic'', Archdiocese of Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tales of [[miracle]]s and other marvels were attributed to relics beginning in the early centuries of the church. These became popular during the Middle Ages. These tales were collected in books of [[hagiography]] such as the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' or the works of [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]]. These miracle tales made relics much sought-after during the Middle Ages. By the late Middle Ages the collecting of, and dealing in, relics had reached enormous proportions, and had spread from the church to royalty, and then to the nobility and merchant classes.

The [[Council of Trent]] of 1563 enjoined bishops to instruct their flocks that "the holy bodies of holy martyrs ... are to be venerated by the faithful, for through these [bodies] many benefits are bestowed by God on men". The council further insisted that "in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics and the sacred use of images, every superstition shall be removed and all filthy lucre abolished."&lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12734a.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Relics." ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 13 Mar. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many [[relics attributed to Jesus]], perhaps most famously the [[Shroud of Turin]], said to be the burial [[shroud]] of [[Jesus Christ]].

[[File:Reliquary of St. Francis Xavier's humerus.jpg|thumb|St. [[Francis Xavier]]'s [[humerus]], [[St. Joseph's Seminary and Church|St. Joseph's Church]], [[Macau]]]]

The cult of [[Martin of Tours]] was very popular in Merovingian Gaul, and centered at a great church built just outside the walls of Tours. When Saint Martin died November 8, 397, at a village halfway between [[Tours]] and [[Poitiers]], the inhabitants of these cities were well ready to fight for his body, which the people of Tours managed to secure by stealth. Tours became the chief point of Christian pilgrimage in Gaul, a place of resort for the healing of the sick.&lt;ref name=sourcebook/&gt; [[Gregory of Tours]] had travelled to the shrine when he had contracted a serious illness. Later, as bishop of Tours, Gregory wrote extensively about miracles attributed to the intercession of St Martin.
 
In his introduction to Gregory's ''History of the Franks'', Ernest Brehaut analyzed the Romano-Christian concepts that gave relics such a powerful draw. He distinguished Gregory's constant usage of ''sanctus'' and ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'',  the first with its familiar meaning of "sacred" or "holy", and the second as "the mystic potency emanating from the person or thing that is sacred. ... In a practical way the second word ''[virtus]''  ... describes the uncanny, mysterious power emanating from the supernatural and affecting the natural. ... These points of contact and yielding are the miracles we continually hear of.&lt;ref name=sourcebook&gt;Medieval Sourcebook, Gregory of Tours (539–594), ''History of the Franks'', Books I–X, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#brehaut Introduction by Earnest Brehaut (from his 1916 translation), pp. ix–xxv] [Note: ''Many of Brehaut's opinions and prejudices would not be upheld by modern historians. Students should not rely on this'' Introduction ''as a guide'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relics and pilgrimage===
Rome became a major destination for Christian pilgrims as it was easier to access for European pilgrims than the Holy Land. Constantine erected great basilicas over the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. A distinction of these sites was the presence of holy relics. Over the course of the Middle Ages, other religious structures acquired relics and became destinations for pilgrimage. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, substantial numbers of pilgrims flocked to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, in which the supposed relics of the apostle [[James, son of Zebedee]], discovered {{circa}} 830, are housed.&lt;ref name=sorabella&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pilg/hd_pilg.htm|title=Pilgrimage in Medieval Europe|work=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago de Compostela remains a significant pilgrimage site, with around 200,000 pilgrims, both secular and Christian, completing the numerous pilgrimage routes to the cathedral in 2012 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beardsley|first1=Eleanor|title=An Ancient Religious Pilgrimage That Now Draws The Secular|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/05/20/185577205/Modern-Pilgrims-Find-New-Meaning-Walking-An-Ancient-Path|website=NPR|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela in Pictures|url=http://www.santiago-compostela.net/|website=Camino de Santiago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By venerating relics through visitation, gifts, and providing services, medieval Christians believed that they would acquire the protection and intercession of the sanctified dead.&lt;ref name=head/&gt;  Relics of local saints drew visitors to sites like Saint Frideswide's in Oxford, and San Nicola Peregrino in Trani.&lt;ref name=sorabella/&gt;

Instead of having to travel to be near to a venerated [[saint]], relics of the saint could be venerated locally. Relics are often kept on a circular decorated theca, made of gold, silver, or other metal.

Believers would make pilgrimages to places believed to have been sanctified by the physical presence of Christ or prominent saints, such as the site of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]].

====Economic effect====
As holy relics attracted pilgrims and these religious tourists needed to be housed, fed, and provided with souvenirs, relics became a source of income not only for the destinations that held them, but for the abbeys, churches, and towns en route. Relics were prized as they were portable.&lt;ref name=ekelund&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ByFRavb95AYC&amp;pg=PA139 Ekelund, Robert B., Tollison, Robert D., Gary M.

According to Patrick Geary, "[t]o the communities fortunate enough to have a saint's remains in its church, the benefits in terms of revenue and status were enormous, and competition to acquire relics and to promote the local saint's virtues over those of neighboring communities was keen".&lt;ref name=patg&gt;[http://sacredspace.barrystephenson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Geary-Sacred-Commodities-Medieval-Relics.pdf Geary, Patrick.

On occasion guards had to watch over mortally ill holy men and women to prevent the unauthorized dismemberment of their corpses as soon as they died.&lt;ref name=butterfield&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/92804/medieval-christian-art-relics Butterfield, Andrew. "What Remains", ''New Republic'', July 28, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Geary also suggests that the danger of someone murdering an aging holy man in order to acquire his relics was a legitimate concern.&lt;ref name=patg/&gt;

Relics were used to cure the sick, to seek intercession for relief from famine or plague, to take solemn oaths, and to pressure warring factions to make peace in the presence of the sacred. Courts held relics since Merovingian times.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; St. [[Angilbert]] acquired for Charlemagne one of the most impressive collections in Christendom.&lt;ref name=ekelund/&gt; An active market developed. Relics entered into commerce along the same trade routes followed by other portable commodities. Matthew Brown likens a ninth-century Italian deacon named Deusdona, with access to the Roman catacombs, as crossing the Alps to visit monastic fairs of northern Europe much like a contemporary art dealer.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/bown/art-value5-25-10.asp Brown, Matthew.

Canterbury was a popular destination for English pilgrims, who traveled to witness the miracle-working relics of Thomas Becket, the sainted archbishop of [[Canterbury]] who was [[Thomas Becket#Assassination|assassinated by knights]] of King Henry II in 1170.&lt;ref name=sorabella/&gt; 
After Becket's death his successor and the Canterbury chapter quickly used his relics to promote the cult of the as-yet-uncanonized martyr. The motivations included the assertion of the Church's independence against rulers, a desire to have an English (indeed [[Anglo-Normans|Norman English]]) saint of European reputation, and the desire to promote Canterbury as a destination for pilgrimage. In the first years after Becket's death, donations at the shrine accounted for twenty-eight percent of the cathedral's total revenues.&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EDQH9Pi5eT0C&amp;pg=PA31 Freeman, Charles. ''Holy Bones, Holy Dust: How Relics Shaped the History of Medieval Europe'', Yale University Press, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
Many churches were built along pilgrimage routes. A number in Europe were either founded or rebuilt specifically to enshrine relics, (such as San Marco in Venice) and to welcome and awe the large crowds of pilgrims who came to seek their help. Romanesque buildings developed passageways behind the altar to allow for the creation of several smaller chapels designed to house relics. From the exterior, this collection of small rooms is seen as a cluster of delicate, curved roofs at one end of the church, a distinctive feature of many Romanesque churches. Gothic churches featured lofty, recessed porches which provided space statuary and the display of relics.

Historian and philosopher of art Hans Belting observed that in medieval painting, images explained the relic and served as a testament to its authenticity. In ''Likeness and Presence'', Belting argued that the cult of relics helped to stimulate the rise of painting in medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=butterfield/&gt;

====Reliquaries====
[[File:10.2006 Brazos relicario.jpg|thumb|Reliquaries in the Church of San Pedro, in [[Ayerbe]], Spain]]
[[Reliquary|Reliquaries]] are containers used to protect and display relics. While frequently taking the form of caskets, they have many other forms including simulations of the relic encased within (e.g., a gilded depiction of an arm for a relic consisting of arm bones). Since the relics themselves were considered valuable, they were enshrined in containers crafted of or covered with gold, silver, gems, and enamel.&lt;ref name=boehm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/relc/hd_relc.htm|title=Relics and Reliquaries in Medieval Christianity|work=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory was widely used in the Middle Ages for reliquaries; its pure white color an indication of the holy status of its contents.&lt;ref name=speakman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Reliquary.php|title=Reliquary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects constituted a major form of artistic production across Europe and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages.

===Counterfeits===
In the absence of real ways of assessing authenticity, relic-collectors became prey to the unscrupulous, and some extremely high prices were paid. Forgeries proliferated from the very beginning. [[Augustine]] already denounced impostors who wandered around disguised as monks, making a profit from the sale of spurious relics.{{cn|date=December 2017}} In his ''Admonitio Generalis'' of 789, [[Charlemagne]] ordered that "the false names of martyrs and the uncertain memorials of saints should not be venerated".&lt;ref name=head/&gt; The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) the Church condemned such abuses such as counterfeit relics and exaggerated claims.&lt;ref name=odonnell/&gt;

Pieces of the [[True Cross]] were one of the most highly sought after such relics; many churches claimed to possess a piece of it, so many that [[John Calvin]] famously remarked that there were enough pieces of the True Cross to build a ship from.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, ''Traité Des Reliques''&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 1870&lt;ref&gt;de Fleury, ''Mémoire sur les instruments de la Passion''&lt;/ref&gt; found that, put together, the claimed relics of the cross at that much later time weighed less than 1.7&amp;nbsp;kg.

Due to the existence of some counterfeit relics, the Church began to regulate the use of relics. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] required the authentication of relics if they were to be publicly [[Veneration|venerated]]. They had to be sealed in a [[reliquary]] and accompanied by a certificate of authentication, signed and sealed by someone in the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|Congregation for Saints]],&lt;ref name="Vatican Website"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vatican Website |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20070517_sanctorum-mater_en.html#Authentication |website=http://www.vatican.va/ |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510033439/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20070517_sanctorum-mater_en.html#Authentication |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the local Bishop where the saint lived. Without such authentication, relics are not to be used for public veneration.&lt;ref name=AmericanCatholic.Org&gt;{{cite web|title=AmericanCatholic.Org|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Jan1998/Wiseman.asp|website=AmericanCatholic.Org|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation for Saints, as part of the [[Roman Curia]], holds the authority to verify relics in which documentation is lost or missing. The documents and reliquaries of authenticated relics are usually affixed with a [[Seal (emblem)|wax seal]].&lt;ref name="Vatican Website"/&gt;

===Classification and prohibitions in the Catholic Church===
In Catholic theology, sacred relics must not be worshipped, because only God is worshipped and adored. Instead, the veneration given to them was "[[dulia]]". [[Saint Jerome]] declared, "We do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that we should bow down to the creature rather than to the Creator, but we venerate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore Him whose martyrs they are."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Ad Riparium'', i, P.L., XXII, 907.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Classes}}&lt;!-- [[First-class relic]], [[Second-class relic]], [[Third-class relic]] redirect here --&gt;The Catholic church divides relics into three classes:
*[[File:Blessed Maria Gabriela first class relic ex corp.jpg|thumb|First-class relic of Blessed [[Maria Gabriella Sagheddu|Maria Gabriella]] [[Trappists|OCSO]]]][[File:Marie Rose Ferron 2d class soil relic.jpg|thumb|Second-class relic (soil) from the grave of [[Marie Rose Ferron]]]]'''First-Class Relics:''' items directly associated with the events of Christ's life (manger, cross, etc.) or the physical remains of a saint (a bone, a hair, skull, a limb, etc.). Traditionally, a martyr's relics are often more prized than the relics of other saints. Parts of the saint that were significant to that saint's life are more prized relics. For instance, King St. [[Stephen of Hungary]]'s right forearm is especially important because of his status as a ruler. A famous theologian's head may be his most important relic. (The head of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] was removed by the monks at the Cistercian abbey at [[Fossanova]] where he died.) If a saint did a lot of traveling, then the bones of his feet may be prized. Catholic teaching prohibits relics to be divided up into small, unrecognizable parts if they are to be used in liturgy (i.e., as in an altar; see the rubrics listed in Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar).
*'''Second-Class Relics:''' items that the saint owned or frequently used, for example, a crucifix, [[rosary]], book, etc. Again, an item more important in the saint's life is thus a more important relic. Sometimes a second-class relic is a part of an item that the saint wore (a shirt, a glove, etc.) and is known as ''[[ex indumentis]]'' ("from the clothing").
*'''Third-Class Relics:''' any object that is touched to a first- or second-class relic.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Source Book ''A Comprehensive Collection of Information about the Catholic Church {{ISBN|0-15-950653-0}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Most third-class relics are small pieces of cloth, though in the first millennium oil was popular; the [[Monza ampullae]] contained oil collected from lamps burning before the major sites of Christ's life, and some reliquaries had holes for oil to be poured in and out again. Many people call the cloth touched to the bones of saints "''ex brandea''". But ''ex brandea'' strictly refers to pieces of clothing that were touched to the body or tombs of the apostles. It is a term that is used only for such; it is not a synonym for a third-class relic.

The sale or disposal by other means of relics without the permission of the Apostolic See is nowadays strictly forbidden by canon 1190 of the Code of [[Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4D.HTM |title=The '&amp;#39;Code of Canon Law'&amp;#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003850/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4D.HTM |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relics may not be placed upon the altar for public veneration, as that is reserved for the display of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] (host or prosphora and Eucharistic wine after consecration in the sacrament of the Eucharist).&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur288.htm|title=Venerating Relics at Mass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[File:SaintNinoCross.jpg|thumb|[[Grapevine cross]] of [[Saint Nino]] of Georgia ([[Sioni Cathedral]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]])]]

The importance of relics in the Byzantine world can be seen from the veneration given to the pieces of the [[True Cross]]. Many great works of [[Byzantine enamel]] are staurothekes, or relics containing fragments of the True Cross. Other significant relics included the [[Cincture of the Theotokos|girdle worn by the Virgin]], and pieces of the body or clothing of saints. Such relics (called [[contact relic]]s, or secondary relics) were, however, scarce and did not provide most believers with ready access to proximity to the holy. The growth in the production and popularity of reproducible contact relics in the fifth and sixth centuries testifies to the need felt for more widespread access to the divine. These contact relics usually involved the placing of readily available objects, such as pieces of cloth, clay tablets, or water then bottled for believers, in contact with a relic. Alternatively, such objects could be dipped into water which had been in contact with the relic (such as the bone of a saint). These relics, a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period, increased the availability of access to the divine but were not infinitely reproducible (an original relic was required), and still usually required believers to undertake [[pilgrimage]] or have contact with somebody who had.

The earliest recorded removal, or [[Translation (relic)|translation]] of saintly remains was that of [[Saint Babylas]] at [[Antioch]] in 354, but, partly perhaps because Constantinople lacked the many saintly graves of Rome, they soon became common in the Eastern Empire, though still prohibited in the West.  The Eastern capital was therefore able to acquire the remains of Saints [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] and [[Saint Luke|Luke]], and the division of bodies also began, the 5th century theologian [[Theodoretus]] declaring that "Grace remains entire with every part".&lt;ref&gt;"Sectis corum corporibus, integra et indivisa gratia perseverat" appearing in Sermon on the Martyrs (de Martyribus), ch. 8, in, The Cure of Pagan Maladies (Cure of the Pagan Diseases; Cure for Hellenic Maladies; Cure of Greek Maladies; Cure of Pagan Ills). [Graecorum affectionum curatio, Graecarum affectionum curatio, Graecarum affect. Curatio, Graec. Aff. cur.], (ante A.D. 449)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the West a decree of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] only allowed the moving of a whole [[sarcophagus]] with its contents, but the upheavals of the barbarian invasions relaxed the rules, as remains needed to be relocated to safer places.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; p. 73; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[veneration]] of relics continues to be of importance in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].  As a natural outgrowth of the concept in [[Orthodox theology]] of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], the physical bodies of the [[saint]]s are considered to be transformed by [[divine grace]] — indeed, all Orthodox Christians are considered to be [[sanctification|sanctified]] by living the mystical life of the Church, and especially by receiving the [[Sacred Mysteries]] ([[Sacraments]]). In the Orthodox [[Euchologion|service books]], the remains of the departed faithful are referred to as "relics", and are treated with honour and respect.  For this reason, the bodies of Orthodox Christians are not traditionally [[embalming|embalmed]].

The veneration of the relics of the saints is of great importance in Orthodoxy, and very often churches will display the relics of saints prominently.  In a number of [[monastery|monasteries]], particularly those on the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]] (Mount Athos in Greece), all of the relics the monastery possesses are displayed and venerated each evening at [[Compline]]. As with the veneration of [[icons]], the [[veneration]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]; δουλια, ''dulia'') of relics in the Orthodox Church is clearly distinguished from [[adoration]] (λατρεια, ''[[latria]]''); i.e., that worship which is due to God alone. Thus Orthodox teaching warns the faithful against [[idolatry]] and at the same time remains true to scriptural teaching (vis. 2 Kings 13:20–21) as understood by Orthodox [[Sacred Tradition]].

The examination of the relics is an important step in the [[glorification]] (canonization) of new saints. Sometimes, one of the signs of sanctification is the condition of the relics of the saint. Some saints will be [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]], meaning that their remains do not decay under conditions when they normally would (natural [[mummy|mummification]] is not the same as incorruption){{clarify|date=June 2018}}. Sometimes even when the flesh does decay the bones themselves will manifest signs of sanctity. They may be honey colored or give off a [[odour of sanctity|sweet aroma]]. Some relics will exude myrrh. The absence of such manifestations is not necessarily a sign that the person is not a Saint.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Relics play a major role in the [[Consecrations in Eastern Christianity#Consecration of a church|consecration of a church]]. The consecrating bishop will place the relics on a [[diskos]] (paten) in a church near the church that is to be consecrated, they will then be taken in a [[Crucession|cross procession]] to the new church, carried three times around the new structure and then placed in the [[Holy Table]] (altar) as part of the consecration service.

The relics of saints  (traditionally, always those of a martyr) are also sewn into the [[antimension]] which is given to a priest by his bishop as a means of bestowing [[Liturgical|faculties]] upon him (i.e., granting him permission to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries). The antimens is kept on the [[High Place]] of the [[Holy Table]] (altar), and it is forbidden to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] (Eucharist) without it. Occasionally, in cases of fixed altars, the relics are built in the altar table itself and sealed with a special mixture called [[wax-mastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomov |first1=Nikola |last2=Dzhangozov |first2=Januarius (Yanko) |title=Wax Embedding as a Method for Preservation of Body Relics Used by the Orthodox Church |journal=Acta Morphologica et Anthropologica |volume=25 |issue=1-2 |page=122-125 |url=http://www.iempam.bas.bg/journals/acta/acta25a/122-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necessity of provide relics for antimensions in new churches often necessitates continuous division of relics. An account of this process can be found in a treatise of a pre-revolutionary Russian church historian Nikolay Romansky ([[:ru:Романский, Николай Алексеевич|ru]]). According to Romansky, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church operated a special office, located in the Church of Philip the Apostle in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where bones of numerous saints, authenticated by the church's hierarchs, were stored, and pieces of them were prayerfully separated to be sent to the dioceses that needed to place them into new antimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://lib.pravmir.ru/library/readbook/410|first=Nikolay (Николай Романский)|last=Romansky|title=Что такое святые мощи и как совершается их раздробление (What are holy relics and how their division is carried out)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Orthodoxy does not make use of the strict classification system of the Roman Catholic Church, it too recognizes and venerates relics which may pertain to [[Jesus Christ]] or a saint, such as a relic of the [[True Cross]], the Chains of [[Saint Peter]] ([[feast day]], 16 January), the grapevine cross of [[Saint Nino]] of Georgia, etc. Places can also be considered holy. When one makes a [[pilgrimage]] to a shrine he may bring back something from the place, such as soil from the [[Holy Land]] or from the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] of a saint.

==Islam==
[[File:DSC04740 Istanbul - Impronta del piede di Maometto ad Eyüp - Foto G. Dall'Orto 30-5-2006.jpg|thumb|Footprint of the Islamic [[prophet]] [[Muhammad]], preserved in the [[türbe]] (funerary mausoleum) in [[Eyüp]], [[Istanbul]]]]
The veneration of the relics of [[saint]]s became an incredibly important part of devotional piety in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Islam throughout the classical and medieval periods, with "the ubiquity of relics and ritual practices associated with them" becoming a mainstay of "the devotional life of the Muslims ... [all over the world but particularly in] the [[Near East]] and [[North Africa]]."&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri, “Relics of Piety and Power in Medieval Islam,” ''Past and Present'' 103.5, in ''Relics and Remains'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; With the latter-day influence of the reformist movements of [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], there is, according to some scholars, an erroneous perception which persists both among some modern Muslims and Western observers opining that "the Islamic experience['s relationship with relic-veneration] is marginal, because of the perceived absence of relics
in Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri, “Relics of Piety and Power in Medieval Islam,” ''Past and Present'' 103.5, in ''Relics and Remains'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, evident that "the historical reality of relics in Islam" was very different, and that the classical Islamic thinkers posed various reasons for why the veneration of the relics of prophets and saints was permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri, “Relics of Piety and Power in Medieval Islam,” ''Past and Present'' 103.5, in ''Relics and Remains'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relics of the prophets===

===In Istanbul===
{{Main|Sacred Relics (Topkapı Palace)}}
While various relics are preserved by different Muslim communities, the most important are those known as [[The Sacred Trusts]], more than 600 pieces treasured in the [[Privy Chamber]] of the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı Palace Museum]] in [[Istanbul]].

Muslims believe that these treasures include:
*Hair from [[Prophet Muhammad]]'s beard and footprint
*Sword of [[Ali]]
*Staff of [[Moses]]
*Turban of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Joseph]]
*Sword of [[David]]
*Pot of [[Abraham]]
*Forearm and hand of Yahya

Most of the trusts can be seen in the museum, but the most important of them can only be seen during the month of [[Ramadan]]. The [[Qur'an]] has been recited next to these relics uninterruptedly since they were brought to the Topkapı Palace, but Muslims do not worship these relics.

===Sacred Cloak of the Prophet===
{{Main|Mosque of the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed}}
A cloak (''kherqa'') believed to have belonged to the prophet Mohammed is kept in the central mosque in [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]]. According to local history, it was given to [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah]] by [[Mured Beg]], the Emir of [[Bokhara]]. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis. In 1996 [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], leader of the Afghan [[Taliban]], took it out, displayed it to a crowd of ''[[ulema]]'' (religious scholars) and was declared ''Amir-ul Momineen'' ("Commander of the Faithful"). Prior to this, the last time it had been removed had been when the city was struck by a [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|cholera epidemic]] in the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Christina (2002).

==Contact relics==
A '''contact relic''', or '''secondary relic''', is a physical object which has acquired the status of a relic due to a physical closeness to the body of a holy figure.&lt;ref name="Promey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifton|first=James|editor=Sally M.

==Marxism-Leninism==

While [[Marxism–Leninism]] is an [[ideology]] rather than a religion, many communist states placed importance on the preservation of the remains of their respective founders, and making them available for veneration by citizens, in "secular cathedrals"&lt;ref name=ryan/&gt; of sorts. In both the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] the mausolea of, respectively, [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Mausoleum of Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong]] were the focal points of the two nations' capitals. The communists did not rely on the natural [[incorruptibility]] of the remains, but used an elaborate [[embalming]] process to preserve the lifelike appearance of the bodies.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
	
Minor communist nations would often seek the help of the USSR&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16283257|title=Who, What, Why: How do you embalm a leader?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; or PRC to preserve the remains of their own founders in a similar way to how it was done in Moscow or Beijing. See [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]] ([[Bulgaria]], 1949), [[Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum]] ([[Vietnam]], 1973), [[Kumsusan Memorial Palace]] ([[North Korea]], 1994). The bodies of the founders of the socialist Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and Angola were also at some point made available for display and veneration in similar mausolea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717230042/http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-09-10/news/17156997_1_mao-mausoleum-tiananmen-square-chairman-mao/3 A letter from China: the pickled dictator tour. 30 years after death, Mao's cured corpse beckons the curious]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Soviet Communism is commonly viewed as anti-religious in general, and anti-Christian in particular, parallels between the veneration of Lenin's body in his mausoleum (and, for a while, that of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s body as well&lt;ref name=ryan/&gt;) and that of the relics of Christian saints in their reliquaries have not been lost on many observers.&lt;ref name=ryan&gt;{{citation

==Cultural relics==
Relic is also the term for something that has survived the passage of time, especially an object or custom whose original culture has disappeared, but also an object cherished for historical or memorial value (such as a keepsake or heirloom).

"Cultural relic" is a common translation for "Wenwu" ([[:wikt:文物|文物]]), a common Chinese word that usually means "[[antique]]" but can be extended to anything, including object and [[monument]], that is of historical and cultural value. However, this has some issues since 文物 has little resemblance to the English usage of "relic".  In most cases, artifact, archaeological site, monument, or just plain archaeology would be a better translation.

'''Simbiling Monastery''', also known as '''Shambuling [[Gompa]]''', '''Shepeling''' [[Dzong]] and '''Taklakot Gompa''', was located next to the large fort of Tegla Kar (Lying Tiger Fort) on a ridge near [[Taklakot]], above the town of [[Burang Town|Purang]], in the [[Ngari]] province, which is just over the border from [[India]], in western Tibet in the valley of the [[Karnali River]], which is known in Tibet as the [[Mapchchu Khambab]] - the 'Peacock Mouth River' or 'River Formed from the Mouth of a Peacock'.&lt;ref&gt;Snelling, John.

It was set above a ridge of cave dwellings, high above the town, about 15 km to the east of the [[Sakya]] [[Khorzhak Monastery]] which has survived, and been restored.

In 1841, [[General Zorawar Singh]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Dogra]] forces, after conquering almost all of Ladakh and much of Western Tibet, including [[Mt. Kailash]], and lakes [[Mansarowar]] and Rakas Tal, and all the territory from Ladakh to the Mayum Pass, east of Mansarowar, from where the road lead temptingly on to [[Shigatse]] and [[Lhasa]], backed by a garrison he had stationed at the strategically important Shepeling ''dzong''. He was, however, killed the next year fighting a large Tibetan force, bringing to an end [[Gulab Singh]]'s dream of an extensive Dogra empire including large sections of Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;''Ladkah: Crossroads of High Asia''. 2nd edition, pp. 84-85. (1996) Janet Rizvi. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-564546-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Simbiling Monastery had over 100 rooms and was inhabited by several hundred [[Gelugpa]] monks. There was also a fort which was the residence of the regional administrator, and a smaller Sakya monastery in the complex. They were all completely flattened by Chinese artillery in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Allen (writer)|Allen, Charles]]. (1999) ''The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History'', pp. 55-56.

The present Chinese military garrison and cantonment is just across the Karnali river northeast from the ruined fort and monasteries. The town centre and some ancient ruins are also on this side of the river, which runs right through the town. The route to [[Mt.

&lt;!--Basic introduction; name and a description of its defining characteristics--&gt; 
The '''Slavic Native Faith''', also known as '''Rodnovery''',{{refn|group=note|The term derives from the [[Proto-Slavic]] roots *''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|rod]]'' (род), which means anything "indigenous", "ancestral" and "native", also "genus", "generation", "kin", "race" (cf. Russian родная ''rodnaya'' or родной ''rodnoy''), and is also the name of the universe's supreme God according to Slavic knowledge; and *''vera'', which means "faith", "religion".{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2014|p=36}} The term has many [[emic and etic|emic]] variations, all [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]], in different [[Slavic languages]], including:

* {{lang-be|Раднавер'е|translit=Radnaverje}}
* {{lang-bg|Родноверие|translit=Rоdnoverie}}
* {{lang-bs|Rodnovjerje}}
* {{lang-mk|Родноверие|translit=Rodnoverie}}
* {{lang-cz|Rodnověří}}
* {{lang-hr|Rodnovjerje}}
* {{lang-pl|Rodzimowierstwo; Rodzima Wiara}}

* {{lang-sr|Родноверје|translit=Rodnoverje}}
* {{lang-uk|Рідновірство; Рідновір'я|translit=''Ridnovirstvo''; ''Ridnovirya''}}

From some variations of the term, the English adaptations "Rodnovery" and its adjective "Rodnover(s)" have taken foothold in English-language literature, supported and used by Rodnovers themselves.{{sfnm|1a1=Petrović|1y=2013|1loc=''passim''|2a1=Rountree|2y=2015|2p=217}}}} is a [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[religion]]. Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. "Rodnovery" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as '''Orthodoxy''', '''Old Belief''' and '''Vedism'''.

&lt;!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices--&gt;  
Rodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious "double belief" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious "double belief" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and even non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]]. [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]—worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.

&lt;!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity--&gt;  
Rodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central place in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|Western thought and what they call "mono-ideologies"]].

&lt;!--History of the movement--&gt; 
The contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly [[Pagan studies|studied in academic scholarship]].

{{See also|Slavic paganism}}

[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] regard Slavic Native Faith as a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013a|1pp=6–7|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=62|3a1=Skrylnikov|3y=2016|4a1=Shizhenskii|4a2=Aitamurto|4y=2017|4p=115}} They also characterise it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Dostálová|3y=2013|3p=165|4a1=Gaidukov|4y=2013|4p=315|5a1=Shnirelman|5y=2013|5pp=62, 73}} The movement has no overarching structure,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} or accepted religious authority,{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as "an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}

The scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described "Slavic Neopaganism" as a term pertaining to "all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions".{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which "harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} while according to the historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor A. Shnirelman]], Rodnovers present themselves as "followers of some genuine pre-Christian Slavic, Russian or Slavic-[[Aryan]] Paganism".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}}

Some involved in the movement avoid calling their belief system either "paganism" or "religion".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Many Rodnovers refer to their belief system as an "[[ethnic religion]]",{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1a2=Filip|1y=2013|1pp=34–35|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=105}} and Rodnover groups were involved in establishing the [[World Congress of Ethnic Religions]].{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|pp=34–35}} The usage of this term suggests that the religion is restricted to a particular ethnic group.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=35}} Some practitioners regard "ethnic religion" as a term synonymous with "Native Faith", but others perceive there as being a distinction between the two terms.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=35}}

According to Shnirelman, it was the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[state atheism|official "scientific" atheism]], which severely weakened the infrastructure of universalist religions, combined with anti-Westernism and the research of intellectuals into an ancient "Vedic" religion of Russia, that paved the way for the rise of Rodnovery and other modern Paganisms in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|loc=''passim''}} After the Soviet Union, the pursuit of Rodnovery matured into the spiritual cultivation of organic folk communities (''ethnoi'') in the face of what Rodnovers consider as the alien cosmopolitan forces which drive global assimilation, chiefly represented by the [[Abrahamic religions]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|pp=43–44}} In the Russian intellectual milieu, Rodnovery also presents itself as the ideology of "nativism" (''narodnichestvo''),{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=141}} which in Rodnovers' own historical analysis is destined to supplant what they call the "mono-ideologies" whose final bankruptcy the world is now witnessing.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=123}}

===Rodnovery as a new synthesis===

Shnirelman states that—contrary to the beliefs of Rodnovers themselves—their religion does not actually constitute the "restoration of any pre-Christian religion as such". Rather, he describes the movement as having been "built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=19}} In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood—at least in part—as an [[invented tradition]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=236|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=136}} or a form of ''[[Folklorismus]]''.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=69}} Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}}

In developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}} Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathenry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=289|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=90}} [[Siberian shamanism]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} as well as ideas drawn from various forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2017|1p=88|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2p=71}} Other influences include documents like the ''[[Book of Veles]]'', which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, "a ''new'' religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=14}} Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of [[syncretism]] and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the "purity" of the religion and thus maintain its "authenticity".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=141}}

===Slavic folk religion and double belief===

A different perspective is offered by Svetlana Chervonnaya, who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to "the mass religious mind" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over [[Asia]], and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Alybyna |first=Tatiana |year=2014 |title=Vernacular Beliefs and Official Traditional Religion |url=https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |journal=Approaching Religion |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=89–100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707181157/https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |archive-date=7 July 2017}} Cites: Chervonnaya, Svetlana (1998).

Miklukho-Maklaya, Tsentr po izucheniyu mezhdunarodnykh otnoshenij.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that modern Rodnovery is closely tied to the historical Slavic religion is a very strong one among practitioners.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=39}}

In crafting their beliefs and practices, Rodnovers adopt elements from recorded folk culture, including from the ethnographic record of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=78}} Practitioners often legitimise the incorporation of elements from folk culture into Slavic Native Faith through the argument that Slavic folk practices have long reflected the so-called "double belief" (''dvoeverie''), a conscious preservation of pre-Christian beliefs and practices alongside Christianity. This is a concept that was especially popular among nineteenth-century ethnographers who were influenced by [[Romanticism]] and retains widespread popularity across Eastern Europe, but has come under criticism in more recent times.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} Slavic Christianity was influenced by indigenous beliefs and practices as it was established in the Middle Ages and these folk practices changed greatly over the intervening millennia;{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=132–133}} according to this, Rodnovers claim that they are just continuing living tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''vide'' {{cite magazine |last=Sadowski |first=Marcin |date=2015 |title=Polityka jedności w rodzimowierstwie polskim |trans-title=Politics of unity in Polish Rodnovery |magazine=Gniazdo. Rodzima wiara i kultura |volume=1/2 |issue=14/15 |language=pl |issn=2081-9072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of double belief is especially significant in Russia and for the identity of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]; in that country, it is an oft-cited dictum that "although Russia was [[baptism|baptised]], it was never Christianised".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=18}} Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a new wave of scholarly debate on the subject within Russia itself. A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the "problem of double belief" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an "undefeated paganism", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}

Ivakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a "thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212–214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J. Ivanits reports ethnographic studies documenting that even in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russia there were entire villages maintaining indigenous religious beliefs, whether in pure form or under the cover of a superficial Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=4}} According to her, the case of Russia is exceptional compared to western Europe, because Russia neither lived the intellectual upheavals of the [[Renaissance]], nor the [[Reformation]], nor the other movements which severely weakened folk spirituality in Europe.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=3}}

===Symbolism===

[[File:Rodnover symbols.png|thumb|140px|From left to right: [[Swastika#Slavic|Kolovrat]], Hands of Svarog, Thundermark, symbol of [[Veles (god)|Veles]].]]

The most commonly used religious symbol within Rodnovery is the ''kolovrat'' ("spinning wheel"), a variant of the ''[[swastika]]'' (Sanskrit: "wellbeing", "wellness").{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=282}} As such, it represents wholeness, the ultimate source of renewal, the cosmic order and the four directions.{{sfn|Leeming|2005|p=369: ''Svastika''}} According to the studies of [[Boris Rybakov]], whirl and wheel symbols, which also include patterns like the "six-petalled rose inside a circle" (e.g. [[File:RozetaSolarSymbol.svg|30px]]) and the "thunder mark" (''gromovoi znak''), represent the supreme God (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), expressing itself as power of birth and reproduction, in its various forms (whether Triglav, Svetovid, Perun and other gods) and were still carved in folk traditions of north Russia up to the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=14, 17}} The contemporary design of the symbol called ''kolovrat'', the eight-spoked wheel, used by Rodnovers was already present in [[woodcut]]s produced in the 1920s by the Polish artist Stanisław Jakubowski, under the name ''słoneczko'' ("little sun").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stanisław Jakubowski |title=Prasłowiańskie motywy architektoniczne |year=1923 |publisher=Orbis |location=Dębniki, Kraków}} [http://www.slowianie.republika.pl/drzeworyty.htm Illustrations of Jakubowski's artworks].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

==="Rodnovery" (Native Faith)===

The majority of practitioners of modern Slavic Paganism call their religion "Native Faith".{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=27}} This term appears in slightly different forms depending on the Slavic language in question: in Ukrainian, it is ''Ridnovirstvo'' or ''Ridnovirya'', in Russian ''Rodnoverie'', in Polish ''Rodzimowierstwo'', and in Czech ''Rodnovĕří''.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=27}} The term derives from the [[Proto-Slavic]] roots *''rod'' (род), which means anything "indigenous", "ancestral" and "native", also "genus", "generation", "kin", "race" (cf. Russian родная ''rodnaya'' or родной ''rodnoy''); and *''vera'', which means "faith", "religion".{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2014|p=36}} Within the community, it has also been used to define an elective community, namely the community of Native Faith practitioners themselves.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=125}} The term has different histories and associations in each of these languages.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=27}} The suffix ''-ism'' is usually avoided in favour of others that describe the religion as if it were a practice or craft (which is the meaning of the Ukrainian and Russian suffix ''-stvo'', thus translatable with the English suffix "[[:wiktionary:-ery|-ery, -ry]]").{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=33}} Sometimes the term "Rodnovery" has also been interpreted as meaning "faith of Rod", a reference to [[Rod (Slavic religion)|an eponymous concept]] found in ancient Russian and Ukrainian sources.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1a2=Filip|1y=2013|1p=36|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2p=125}}

[[File:Svetoary community celebrating Mokosh 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Svetoary community of the [[Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities]] celebrating Mokosh.]]

The earliest known usage of this term was by the Ukrainian emigree [[Lev Sylenko]], who in 1964 established a [[mimeograph]]ed publication in Canada that was titled ''Ridna Vira'' ("Native Faith").{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=36}} As an [[endonym]], the term ''Ridnovir'' was in use among Ukrainians involved in the movement by at least 1995.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=37}} From Ukraine, the term began to spread throughout other Slavic countries.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=37}} In 1996, it was adopted by a Polish group, the "Association of Native Faith" (''Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary'') and in 1997 by the Russian "[[Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities]]" (Союз Славянских Общин Славянской Родной Веры).{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=37}} By the early 2000s, the term was widespread across Slavic language countries.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=35}} In 2002, six Russian Rodnover organisations issued the "Bittsa Agreement" (''Bittsevskoe Obraschchenie''), in which they expressed the view that "Rodnoverie" should be regarded as the foremost name of the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=38}} The spread of the term reflected the degree of solidarity in establishing a broader brand and a sense of international movement despite the disagreements and power struggles that permeated the groups.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=38}} The term also came to be applied to the modern Pagan religions of non-Slavic groups; for instance, in the Polish language Lithuanian [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]] has been referred to as ''Rodzimowierstwo litewskie'' ("Lithuanian Native Faith") and Celtic Paganism has been referred to as ''Rodzimowierstwo celtyckie'' ("Celtic Native Faith").{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=38}}

Aitamurto stated that in addition to being the most used term, it is appropriate because of its meanings.&lt;ref name="Aitamurto2007"&gt;{{cite article |last=Aitamurto |first=Kaarina |year=2007 |title=Neoyazychestvo or rodnoverie? Reflection, ethics and the ideal of religious tolerance in the study of religion |publisher=Aleksanteri Institute, Finnish Centre for Russian and East European Studies|isbn=9785988670094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from its immediate acceptation, it has deeper senses related to its Slavic etymology that would be lost through translation, expressing the central concepts of the Slavic Native Faith.&lt;ref name="Aitamurto2007"/&gt; ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'' is conceived as the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], primordial God, supreme ancestor of the universe, that begets all things,&lt;ref name="Aitamurto2007"/&gt; and at the same time as the kin, the lineage of generation which is the ancestral bond to the supreme source.&lt;ref name="Aitamurto2007"/&gt; ''Rodna'' or ''rodnaya'' is itself a concept which can denote the "nearest and dearest", and such impersonal community as one's native home or land.&lt;ref name="Aitamurto2007"/&gt;

==="Orthodoxy", "Old Belief", "Vedism" and other terms===

[[File:Shrine at the Temple of Svarozhich's Fire in Krasotinka, Kaluga, Russia (4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Outdoors shrine (''kapishche'') at the Temple of Svarozhich's Fire in Krasotinka, [[Kaluga Oblast]], Russia.]]

The appropriate name of the religion is an acute topic of discussion among practitioners active on [[social media]].{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=324}} Many Rodnovers have adopted terms that are already used to refer to other religions, namely the [[historical Vedic religion]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=13}} For instance, the Saint Petersburg-based "Union of the Veneds" (''Soyuz Venedov'') is one of the major organisations of the branch of Rodnovery known as "[[Peterburgian Vedism]]".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|p=200}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} They explain that "Vedism" derives from the word "to know" and implies that rather than dogmatically believing (''verit''), Vedists "know" or "see" (''vedat'') spiritual truths. The term was first employed by Yuri P. Mirolyubov—the writer or discoverer of the ''[[Book of Veles]]''—in the mid-twentieth century, and later adopted by the founder of Peterburgian Vedism, Viktor Bezverkhy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}

In Ukraine and Russia many important Rodnover groups advocate the designation of "Orthodoxy" (Russian: Православие ''Pravoslaviye'', Ukrainian: Православ'я ''Pravoslav'ya'') for themselves.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=13}} They claim that the term, which refers to the universal order (''[[Prav]]'', cf. Vedic ''[[Ṛta]]''), was usurped by the Christians.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=31}} Another term employed by Rodnovers, but historically associated to the Orthodox Christian movement of the [[Old Believers]], is "Starovery" (cf. Russian: Старове́ры ''Starovéry'', "Old Faith").{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}}

Some Slovenian practitioners use the [[Slovenian language]] term ''ajd'', which is a loan-word of the Germanic-language ''[[paganism#Heathen|heathen]]''.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=29}} When using [[English language]] terms to describe their religion, some Rodnovers favour "Heathen", in part due to a perceived affinity with the [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|contemporary Germanic Heathens]] who also commonly use that term.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=30}} Another term employed by some Rodnovers has been "practice of the Slavs", which appears especially in Polish (''Słowiaństwo'') and in Slovakian (''Slovianstvo'').{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=35}} Some Russians refer to their religion as "Slavism" and claim that the word "Slav" originally meant "he who praises his gods".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|p=200}}

===General descriptors: Western "pagan" and Slavic ''yazich''===

[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Ирина 52.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism|Ringing Cedars']] Rodnovers gathering on Kupala holiday, at the kinship settlement "Silver Forest" (Серебряный Бор, ''Serebrany Bor'') in Ustinka, [[Belgorod Oblast]], Russia.]]

In Slavic languages the closest equivalent of "[[paganism]]" is ''poganstvo'' (taking for instance Russian; it itself deriving from Latin ''paganus''), although Rodnovers widely reject this term due to its derogatory connotations.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=6}} Indeed, many Slavic languages have two terms that are conventionally rendered as "pagan" in Western languages: the aforementioned ''pogan'' and языч ''yazich''. The latter, which is a derivation of the near-homophonous язык ''yazik'', "tongue", is prevalent and has a less negative acceptation, literally meaning "pertaining to (our own) language".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=13}} It is often more accurately (though by no means thoroughly) translated as "[[Gentile]]" (i.e. pertaining "to the ''[[gens]]''", "to the kin"), which in turn it itself renders in Slavic translations of the Bible.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=30}} Some Russian and Ukrainian Rodnovers employ, respectively, ''Yazychestvo'' and ''Yazychnytstvo'' (i.e. "our own language craft", "Gentility"), but it is infrequent.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=6}} ''Yazich'' has been adopted especially among Rodnovers speaking [[West Slavic languages]], where it has not any connotations related to "paganism".{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=31}} Thus, Czech Rodnover groups have coined ''Jazyčnictví'' and Slovak Rodnovers have coined ''Jazyčníctvo''.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=31}}

By the mid-1930s, the term "Neopagan" had been applied to the Polish [[Zadruga (movement)|Zadruga]] group.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=1}} It was adopted among Rodnovers in the 1990s—when it appeared in such forms as the Russian ''Neoyazychestvo'' and the Polish ''Neopogaństwo''—but had been eclipsed by "Slavic Native Faith" in the 2000s.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=32}} However, the prefix "neo-" within "Neopaganism" is a divisive issue among Rodnovers.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=32}} Some practitioners dislike it because it minimises the continuity of indigenous pre-Christian beliefs.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=32}} They regard themselves as restoring the original belief system rather than creating something new.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=199–200}} Others embrace the term as a means of emphasising what they regard as the reformed nature of the religion; the Polish Rodnover Maciej Czarnowski for instance encouraged the term because it distinguished his practices from those of the pre-Christian societies, which he regarded as being hindered by [[superstition]] and unnecessary practices like [[animal sacrifice]].{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=32}} Many Rodnovers straightforwardly reject the designator "paganism", whether "neo-", "modern", "contemporary" or without prefixes and further qualificators, asserting that these are "poorly defined" concepts whose use by scholars leads to a situation in which Rodnovery is lumped together with "all kinds of cults and religions" which have nothing to do with it.{{sfn|Petrović|2013|p=2}}

{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology}}
{{Further|Deities of Slavic religion}}

Prior to their Christianisation, the Slavic peoples were [[polytheism|polytheists]], worshipping multiple deities who were regarded as the emanations of a supreme [[God]]. According to [[Helmold]]'s ''[[Chronica Slavorum]]'' (compiled 1168–1169), "obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods".{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=5}} Belief in these deities varied according to location and through time, and it was common for the Slavs to adopt deities from neighbouring cultures.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}} Both in Russia and in Ukraine, modern Rodnovers are divided among those who are [[monotheism|monotheists]] and those who are polytheists.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013|1p=90|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=65|3a1=Shnirelman|3y=2017|3p=90}} Some practitioners describe themselves as [[atheism|atheists]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} believing that gods are not real entities but rather ideal symbols.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}}

Monotheism and polytheism are not regarded as mutually exclusive. The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God—generally identified by the concept of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' ("Judge") and ''Prabog'' ("Pre-God", "First God") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}}

The root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the "primordial God", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and "kin", "birth", "origin" and "fate" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as ''Prav'' (literally "Right" or "Order"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[Ṛta]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] ("White God") and [[Chernobog]] ("Black God"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] ("Three-Headed One") and [[Svetovid]] ("Worldseer") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}

When emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', "believers in God"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or "in nativity", "in genuinity"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called "manifestationism" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit–matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that "we are not God's slaves, but God's sons".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the "Giving God", "Day God").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}

Pantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289–290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;&lt;ref name="Adversus paganos"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry [[Veles (god)|Veles]] is called upon as the god of literature and communication.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}}

In Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} Conversely, Sylenko's [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] (RUNVira; also called "Sylenkoism") regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God who they identify with the name Dazhbog.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=225|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=90|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=130}} For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}}

Sylenko characterised Dazhbog as "light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or [[panentheism|panentheistic]] rather than monotheistic.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=91}} A similar view is adopted by Russian [[Ynglism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that "we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} For Native Ukrainian National Faith's members, polytheism is regarded as backward.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}}

===Morality and ethics===

[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]
[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping Perun in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a ''kapy'' (pole) of [[Perun]], in [[Ternopil Oblast]], Ukraine.]]

Rodnovery emphasises the "this-worldliness" of morality and moral thinking, seen as a voluntary and thoughtful responsibility towards the others that sprouts from the awareness of the interconnectedness of all things and of the continuity of spirit–matter and not as a strict set of rules. Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that "[[turning the other cheek]]", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}

Rodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[Émile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is "egoistic individualism", not "moral individualism".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the umbegoing context and the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines "ecological responsibility".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}

Rodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}

Within Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards "public" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the "private" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}

Ideas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society—which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate—are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that "hardly any women" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word "feminism" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misognyistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dostálová|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be "difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72–73|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143|}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}

The Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions—compared to those of other organisations—about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan "unity in diversity".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}

==Identity and political philosophy==

{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}

[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate. Dark green represents East Slavic languages, pale green represents West Slavic languages, and sea green represents South Slavic languages.]]

There is no evidence that the [[early Slavs]] ever conceived of themselves as a unified ethno-cultural group.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=211|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2017|2p=144}} There is an academic consensus that the [[Proto-Slavic]] language developed from about the second half of the first millennium BCE in an area of Central and Eastern Europe bordered by the [[Dnieper]] basin to the east, the [[Vistula]] basin to the west, the Carpathian Mountains to the south and the forests beyond the [[Pripet]] basin to the north.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}} Over the course of several centuries, Slavic populations migrated in northern, eastern and south-western directions.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}} In doing so, they branched out into three sub-linguistic families: the Eastern Slavs (Ukrainians, Belarussians, Russians), the Western Slavs (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks) and the Southern Slavs (Slovenes, Serbs, Croats, Macedonians and Bulgarians).{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}} The belief systems of these Slavic communities had many affinities with those of neighbouring linguistic populations, such as the [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Thracian language|Thracians]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranians]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}} [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] studied the origin of ancient Slavic themes in the common substratum represented by [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and what [[Georges Dumézil]] studied as the "[[trifunctional hypothesis]]". [[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}

The scholar of religion Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is "fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity",{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} while folklorist Nemanja Radulovic described practitioners as placing "great emphasis on their national or regional identity".{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=65–66}} Rodnovery typically displays greater concern for [[individual and group rights|collective rights than individual rights]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}

===Ethnic nationalism===

[[File:Great fire kudesniki.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Ukrainian Rodnovers wearing traditional costume for their ceremonies.]]

Slavic Native Faith's world-view is often [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] in basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that "the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group", that they "have—or their heritage has—some superior qualities", and that "this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}}

Many Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=235}} Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethno-cultural groups,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=229}} and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} Some Rodnovers promote [[racial segregation]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|p=98}} and have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Some Rodnovers regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of [[social injustice]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} and encourage the removal of those regarded as "aliens" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} an approach that could require [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic,{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=234|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284}} for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}} and endorsing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto 2006|p=190}}

Many Rodnovers oppose what they regard as "culturally destructive" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]] and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} The political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic "[[thing (assembly)|thing]]".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2–3}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as "outer" freedom, contrasting with Slavic "inner" freedom of the mind; in Rodnovers' view, Western liberal democracy is "destined to execute the primitive desires of the masses or to work as a tool in the hands of a ruthless elite", being therefore a mean-spirited "rule of demons".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=6-7}} Some Rodnovers interpret the ''veche'' in ethnic terms, thus as a form of "ethnic democracy", in the wake of similar concepts found in the French ''Nouvelle Droite''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=6}}

There are Rodnovers with extreme right-wing nationalist views,{{sfn|Simpson|2017|pp=72–73}} including those who are [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] and openly inspired by [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=296}} Many other Rodnovers deny or downplay the racist and Nazi elements within their community,{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=62}} and claim that extreme right-wingers are not true believers in Slavic Native Faith because their interests in the movement are primarily political rather than religious.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=62}} Shnirelman noted that there was a loose boundary between the explicitly politicised and less politicised wings of the Russian movement,{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} adding that ethnic nationalist and racist views were present even in those Rodnovers who did not identify as explicitly political.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} Rodnover ideas and symbols have also been adopted by many Russian nationalists—including in the Russian skinhead movement{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=67|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2pp=115–116}}—not all of whom embrace Rodnovery as a religion.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=156}} Some of these far-right groups merge Rodnover elements with others adopted from Germanic Heathenry and from Russian Orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=68}} A number of young practitioners of Slavic Native Faith have been detained on [[terrorism]] charges in Russia;{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} between 2008 and 2009, teenaged Rodnovers forming a group called the Slavic Separatists conducted at least ten murders and planted bombs across Moscow targeting [[Muslim]]s and non-ethnic Russians.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=70|2a1=Skrylnikov|2y=2016}}

In countries like Poland and Russia there has been an increasing de-politicisation of the Slavic Native Faith community in the 21st century.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=62|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2p=114|3a1=Simpson|3y=2017|3p=71}} Aitamurto and Shizhenskii suggested that expressions of ultra-nationalism were considered socially unacceptable at one of the largest Rodnover event in Russia, the Kupala festival outside Maloyaroslavets.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=129}}
Aitarmurto suggested that the different wings of the Rodnover movement "attract different kinds of people approaching the religion from quite diverging points of departure".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=205}} For instance, the Circle of Pagan Tradition characterise themselves as "patriots" rather than "nationalists", avoid ethnic nationalist ideas, and recognise Russia as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural state.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|pp=201–202}}

===Views on Slavic and Indo-European history===

[[File:Swieto Plonow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mazovian Temple (''Chram Mazowiecki'') of the [[Native Polish Church]].]]

Shnirelman notes that the movement is "obsessed with the idea of ''origin''".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} Many Rodnovers legitimise their practices by according their Slavic ancestors great cultural achievements.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Academics studying the movement have described these views of the past as "extremely imaginative and exaggerated",{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}} "rather fantastic",{{sfn|Dulov|2013|p=206}} and linked to [[pseudohistory|pseudo-historical]] ideas.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=55}} However, Aitamurto and Gaidukov later noted that the "wildly imaginative" ideas typical of the 1980s were in decline, and that—within Russia at least—"a more realistic attitude" to the past was "gaining ground" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=155}}

Many within the movement regard the ''[[Book of Veles]]'' as a holy text,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=219}} and as a genuine historical document.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}} Some Rodnovers take their cosmology, ethical system, and ritual practices from the ''Book''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=219}} The fact that many scholars outspokenly reject the ''Book'' as a modern, twentieth-century composition has added to the allure that the text has for many Rodnovers. According to them, such criticism is an attempt to "suppress knowledge" carried forward either by Soviet-style [[scientism]] or by "Judaic cosmopolitan" forces.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include ''The Songs of the Bird Gamayon'', ''Koliada's Book of Stars'', ''The Song of the Victory on the Jewish Khazaria of Sviatoslav the Brave'' or ''The Rigveda of Kiev''.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=291}} Some Rodnovers pejoratively dismiss movements such as that of the ''Vseyasvetnaya gramota'' as "[[New Age]]" and claim that reliance on them discredits the Slavic Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=159}}

[[File:Ukraine, outdoor Sylenkoite worship (0).png|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Worship ceremony led by the priests of the General Fire of Slavic Native Faith.]]

Some Rodnovers believe that Slavs constitute a race whose origin is distinct from that of other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to them, Slavs are the directest descendants of an ancient Aryan race, whom they equate with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} Some Rodnovers believe that the Aryans originated at the [[North Pole]] but moved south as a result of declining temperatures,{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=187|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=292}} while others claim that the Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=103}}

Some Rodnovers regard Slavic countries as having a messianic role in humanity's future, for instance with the belief that Ukraine will be the world's future geopolitical centre,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=15}} or that Russia will be the home of a post-apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} Such racially eschatological beliefs are explicitly rejected by other Rodnovers, like the Circle of Pagan Tradition.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}

Although their understanding of the past is typically rooted in spiritual conviction rather than in arguments that would be acceptable within academia, many Rodnovers seek to promote their beliefs about the past among academics.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=155}} For instance, in 2002 Serbian Rodnovers established Svevlad, a research group devoted to historical Slavic religion which simulated academic discourse but was "highly selective, unsystematic, and distorted" in its examination of the evidence.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=60–61}} In several Slavic countries, many archaeologists and historians have been hesitant about giving credence to Rodnover interpretations of the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=120|2a1=Aitamurto|2a2=Gaidukov|2y=2013|2p=155}} In turn, practitioners have accused academics of being part of a conspiracy to conceal the truth about the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=292|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2pp=61–62}}

===Views on Christianity===

[[File:Initiation of a woman into the Native Faith (Rodnovery), near Moscow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The initiation of a woman into Rodnovery, in [[Moscow]], Russia.]]

{{main|Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies}}

Many Rodnovers actively reject Christianity or adopt anti-Christian views.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=223|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=7|3a1=Simpson|3y=2013|3p=121}} Practitioners generally regard [[Abrahamic religions]] as a destructive force that erodes what they view as organic peoples,{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|pp=43–44}} with Christianity being perceived as a foreign force that is destroying Slavic culture.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=131}} Some Rodnovers also take a hostile stance toward [[Judaism]], which they regard as having spawned Christianity,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} or believe that Christianity has left Russia under the control of Jews.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} Rodnovers often reject Christian ideas of humility, regarding them as antithetical to a Rodnover emphasis on courage and fighting spirit.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=73}} Christianity is considered as a system that destroys morality by casting human responsibility away from the present world and into a transcendent future,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} and it is also criticised as being anthropocentric, and thus responsible for ecological disruption.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} In Russia, Rodnovers often criticise Christianity for its claim to have a monopoly on truth; in regarding it as a mono-ideology, they compare it to [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Marxism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} Some practitioners also regard [[capitalism]] as a creation of Abrahamic religions and seek to return to a pre-capitalist society,{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|p=43, note 7}} believing that their ideology will supplant "mono-ideologies" like Christianity in the future.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=123}}

Rodnovers express their anti-Christian views in various ways. Many Native Faith groups organise formal ceremonies of renunciation of Christianity (''raskrestitsia'', literally "de-Christianisation"), in which they adopt a new Slavic name.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}} The folklorist Mariya Lesiv observed Rodnovers marching in [[Kiev]] in 2006 chanting "Out with Jehovah! Glory to Dazhboh!"{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=3}} Simpson noted that in Poland, several Rodnovers launched a poster campaign against [[Valentines Day]], which they regarded as not being an authentically Polish celebration.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=120}} In Russia, Rodnovers have vandalised and torched various churches.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=70}}

Christians have also been responsible for opposition to Slavic Native Faith, for instance through the establishment of social media groups against the movement.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=325}} The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has expressed opposition to the growth and spread of Slavic Native Faith across Russia on various occasions.{{Sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} Some Russian Rodnovers have however attempted to improve relations with the Orthodox Church, arguing that Russian Orthodoxy had adopted many elements of historical Slavic belief and rites.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1pp=198–199|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=290}} In this way they argue that Russian Orthodoxy is distinct from other forms of Christianity,{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} and seek to portray it as the "younger brother" of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|p=199}} The Orthodox Christian [[Old Believers]], a movement that split out from the Russian Orthodox Church during the reform of [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] in the seventeenth century, is seen by Rodnovers in a more positive light than the mainstream Russian Orthodox Church, as Old Believers are considered to have elements similar to those of the Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=61}}

Rodnovery is essentially a religion of the community, with most adherents actively joining organisations; only a minority of believers choose solitary practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=118|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=63}} Sometimes, Slavic Native Faith groups send guests to the religious meetings of other groups, including those in other countries.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=79}} Most Slavic Native Faith groups strongly emphasise the commemoration of ancestors in their religious practices.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} For many Rodnovers, greater importance is given to creating what they perceive as "genuine" Slavic rituals rather than those which will be psychologically empowering.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}}

There is much variation in the patterns of organisation and practice between different groups, and depending on the level such groups intend to represent, whether national or local. For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian [[Sylenkoite]] branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly "Holy Hour of Self-Realisation", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's ''Maha Vira'', sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources—such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]—into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}

[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]

Adherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of "Paganisation", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these "Paganised" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138–139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}

Rituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', "circle"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes "traditional clothes", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}

Besides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slvic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the "renaming", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second "life line" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new "blood bond" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}

===Communities, citadels and temples===

[[File:Славянский Кремль.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]

Rodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of ''[[sobornost]]'' formulated in 20th-century Russian philosophy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=191}} ''Veche'' is used as the name of many Rodnover overarching organisations, including the international "Veche of Slavic Native Faith", an assembly held each summer, to which adherents from Slavic countries take part. Aitamurto (2008) characterises the ''veche'' as a model of organisation "from below and to the top", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves—that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses. The Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova is one of such centres, located in the Podolsky District of Moscow Oblast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slavkreml.ru/ |title=Славянский Кремль Виталия Сундакова |website=slavkreml.ru |accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Rodnover networks have established thorough villages all over Russia; this is the case, among other examples, of those Rodnovers who are part of the [[Ringing Cedars]]' movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}}

Rituals and religious meetings are often performed in rural settings, such as clearings in woodland.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The basic structure of a [[temple]] of the Slavic Native Faith (капище, ''kapishche''; or храм, ''khram'') is constituted by a sacred precinct at the centre of which are placed poles with carved images of the gods enshrined. These poles, or statues, are called ''rodovoi'', ''stolb'', ''chur'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=67–70}} but also ''kapy'' ("poles"). There are many such basic temples throughout Russia, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. A large, elaborate temple of this type is projected to be built in [[Khabarovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arhinovosti.ru/2012/11/27/konkursnaya-rabota-sevastyana-aleksandra-mnogofunkcionalnyjj-kompleks-kapishhe-khabarovsk-rossiya/ |title=Конкурсная работа Севастьяна Александра.

The statue remained in place for some time until being removed by the authorities in 2007 when a decision was made to construct a church nearby.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|pp=327, 332}}

===Priesthood===
{{Main|Volkhv}}

[[File:Rodnover shrine in Kaluga, Russia.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Sacrificers officiating at a simple temple (''kapishche'') in [[Kaluga]], [[Kaluga Oblast]], Russia.]]

In Slavic Native Faith, priests are distinguishable into the orders of ''volkhv'' (translatable as "wiseman", "wizard", i.e. "[[shaman]]", or "[[wikt:mage#Noun|mage]]") and ''zhrets'' ("sacrificers"). They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}

Though the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' ("seeresses"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

===Calendars and holidays===

{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}

[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokreš holiday in the countryside.]]

According to Aitamurto, rituals play "a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}

The common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following "the cycles of nature".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23–24), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24–25), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide—called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally "Red Hill", celebrated between April 30–May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}

Usually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising "core" of practitioners, who are often professionally-affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose "periphery" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as "aesthetically lavish", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}

Some Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138–139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138–139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a "Christmas of Dazhboh's Light" and an "Easter of the Eternal Resurrection".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as "Ukrainian Ancient Literature" and "New Ukrainian Literature".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}

===Artistic and other pursuits===

[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Ирина 60.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]

A number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.&lt;ref name=Gizbrekht2016&gt;{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=Образы деятелей российской истории в дискурсе современного «Языческого искусства» (на материале изобразительного творчества) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern "Pagan art" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=Краснодарского государственного института культуры}} УДК 298.9:7.044/.046.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (Славяно-горицкая борьба, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are "bench wrestling" (''lavochki'') and "wall against wall" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}

==History==

The origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against [[rationalism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} This was accompanied by a growth in [[nationalism]] across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}

In 1818, the Polish ethnographer Zorian Dołęga-Chodakowski (Adam Czarnocki) in the work ''O Sławiańszczyźnie przed chrześcijaństwem'' ("About Slavs before Christianity") declared himself a "pagan" and stated that the Christianisation of the Slavic peoples had been a mistake.{{sfn|Gajda|2013|pp=46–48}} Thus he became a precursor of return to Slavic religion in Poland and all Slavic countries.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=12}} Similarly, the Polish philosopher [[Bronisław Trentowski]] saw the historical religion of the Slavs as a true path to understanding the divine creator, arguing that Christianity failed to do so.{{sfn|Gajda|2013|pp=49–51}} It was this Romantic rediscovery and revaluing of historical and pre-Christian that prepared the way for the later emergence of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Gajda|2013|p=58}}

===1930s–1940s: Early developments===

[[File:Дощечка Изенбека (Жар-птица).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|One of the earliest copies (dated 1955) of one of "Isenbek's Planks" (the n. 16), upon which the ''Book of Veles'' was supposedly written.]]
 
In Ukraine, the first practitioners of Slavic Native Faith appeared in the 1930s.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} One of the most influential Ukrainian Rodnover ideologues was Volodymyr Shayan, a linguist and philologist who worked at [[Lviv University]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} He claimed that in 1934 he underwent a spiritual revelation atop Mount Grekhit in the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} Particularly interested in the ideas of an ancient Aryan race that were popular at the time,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=129}} he subsequently began promoting what he called a "pan-Aryan renaissance".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=216}} He turned to recorded Ukrainian folklore to find what he regarded as the survivals of the ancient Slavic religion.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=129}} In 1944, he fled the Soviet government and travelled to refugee camps in Germany and Austria. There, he established the Order of the Knights of the Solar God (''Orden Lytsariv Boha Sontsia''), a religio-political group that he hoped would affiliate itself to the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=216–217}}

In Poland, [[Jan Stachniuk]] established the ''Zadruga'' magazine in 1937;{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=113|2a1=Strutyński|2y=2013|2p=295}} the term "Zadruga" itself was a reference to a [[Zadruga|South Slavic tribal unit]].{{sfn|Strutyński|2013|p=288}} Continuing on from Dołęga-Chodakowski, Stachniuk's own work criticised [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Catholicism in Poland]], arguing that it had had a negative effect on the country's national character.{{sfnm|1a1=Strutyński|1y=2013|1p=288|2a1=Potrzebowski|2y=2016|2pp=45, 177}} He did not develop his ideas into a religion, and those who shared his views remained "a very loose and diverse intellectual clique".{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} The magazine and its associated group embraced members with a wide variety of viewpoints, ranging from secularly [[Humanism|humanistic]] to religiously Slavic Native Faith stances.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=51}} He was nevertheless labelled a ''neopoganin'' ("Neopagan") by the Polish popular press, a term that he embraced as a self-descriptor in later life.{{sfn|Strutyński|2013|p=294}}

Władysław Kołodziej later claimed to have established a pre-war Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid (''Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida''), although there is no evidence that they conducted regular meetings until many years later.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} During the Second World War, Stefan Potrzuski led a unit in the Peasant Battalion which battled the Nazi German occupation forces. His unit had a shrine to the god [[Svetovid]] in their secret forest base and held group rites in which they toasted a wooden image of the deity with mead.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Stachniuk fought against the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi occupation]] during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. Following the end of the war and the incorporation of Poland under a Stalinist regime, both Stachniuk and Kołodziej were arrested, preventing the establishment of a Slavic Native Faith community.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=113|2a1=Strutyński|2y=2013|2p=295}} In 1954, a student group known as Klan Ausran was established at the [[University of Łódź]]; officially dedicated to a study of Indo-European society, its members provided hymns and prayers.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=114}}

A key influence on the movement was the circulation of the ''Book of Veles'' among Russian and Ukrainian emigrees.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1pp=217–218|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=285}} This text was brought to the public by Yuri Mirolyubov, who claimed that it had been discovered by a friend of his, Fodor Arturovich Isenbek, while serving as a [[White movement|White Army]] officer during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Mirolyubov alleged that the original text had been etched on wooden boards, but that these had been lost during the Second World War, leaving only his own copies.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}} It is probable that the ''Book of Veles'' was a literary composition produced by Mirolyubov himself.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}} In following decades the work would have caused a sensation,{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=218|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2006|2pp=185–186}} with many emigrees regarding it as a genuine tenth century text.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}

===1960s–1980s: Soviet Union and Slavic diaspora in the West===
One of those who joined Shayan's group was Lev Sylenko.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} He subsequently left Europe and moved first to Canada and then the United States. It was in [[Chicago]] that he established the earliest groups of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] in 1966.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} Sylenko presented himself as a prophet of Dazhbog who had been sent to the Ukrainian people.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} In his view, the Ukrainians were the superior manifestation of the European peoples,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} and Kyiv the oldest city of the [[white race]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} Sylenko was a [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leader]], whose followers praised his talents and oratorical skills.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=135}} In 1979 he published ''Maha Vira'', a book which he claimed chronicled the ancient history of the Ukrainian people.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=217}} The system of Slavic Native Faith that he developed was influenced by [[deism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} A Native Ukrainian National Faith centre, the Temple of Mother Ukraine, was established in [[Spring Glen, New York]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=224}} Native Ukrainian National Faith congregations were established among Ukrainian emigree communities in other parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=224|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=130}}

During the Stalin era in the Soviet Union, research into prehistoric societies was encouraged, with some scholars arguing that pre-Christian society reflected a form of communitarianism that was damaged by Christianity's promotion of entrenched class divisions. In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=285–286}} Russian Native Faith originated in the [[Soviet dissidents]]' circles of the 1970s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian [[samizdat]] nationalist journal ''Veche'' (1971–1974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942–1974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to "Arism" or "Slavism", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled "The Christian Plague" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26–27}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' ("De-Sionisation") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' ("The Strike of Russian Gods").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}

In the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev; although not explicitly Pagan, they were influenced by occult Pagan thinkers like [[Guido von List]] and sought a return to a pre-Christian [[Aryan]] world.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} In the early 1980s, the "Pamyat" movement was established by figures active at the Metropolitan Moscow Palace of Culture, which similarly looked with fondness on ancient Aryan culture.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} Several Russian nationalists also began to state that pre-Christian belief systems were the true religion of the Russian people; Apollon Kuzmin did so in his 1988 book ''Padenie Peruna'' ("The Fall of Perun").{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=288}} In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy established the Leningrad ([[Saint Petersburg]])-based Society of the Mages (''Obshchestvo Volkhvov''), an explicitly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and anti-Semitic organisation; it was followed by the Union of the Veneds, founded in 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1pp=288–289|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=35}} These organisations gave rise to the stream of Rodnovery known as "[[Peterburgian Vedism]]".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}

===1990s–2000s: Post-Soviet growth===

After [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s Soviet government introduced the policy of ''[[perestroika]]'' in the 1980s, Slavic Native Faith groups established themselves in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=220}} The collapse of the Soviet Union and its official policy of [[state atheism]] resulted in a resurgence of open religious adherence across the region.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} Many individuals arrived at Slavic Native Faith after exploring a range of different alternative spiritualities, with Asian religious influences being particularly apparent within Slavic Native Faith at that time.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=149}}

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent republic, with many Ukrainians turning to strongly nationalistic agendas; among those to have done so are [[pseudo-archaeology|pseudo-archaeologists]] like Yuri Shylov, who posits Ukraine as the "cradle of civilisation".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=221}} It is within this broader milieu of cultural nationalism and interest in alternative spiritualities that Slavic Native Faith re-emerged in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} The United States-based [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] established itself in Ukraine soon after independence, with the first congregation in Ukraine gaining official recognition in [[Kiev]] in 1991.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=224|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} There had been schisms in the international organisation of Native Ukrainian National Faith.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} A number of senior followers broke with Sylenko during the 1980s, rejecting the idea that he should be the ultimate authority in the religion; they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=227}} A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his ''Maha Vira'' as a sacred text.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in the country, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established; in contrast to the anti-Russian slant taken by Sylenko, it embraced a Pan-Slavic perspective.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|pp=139–140}}

The social context of Slavic Native Faith's growth in Russia differed from that in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Russian nationalists had welcomed the collapse of the Soviet system but were disappointed with the arrival of [[capitalism]] and the dramatic economic downturn that Russia faced in that decade.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=147}} Large numbers became unemployed, and many turned to the past, including in ethnic terms.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|pp=87–88}} In this context, the growth of Rodnovery can be seen as a nationalistic project to regain national pride.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Many leaders of early post-Soviet Rodnovery were intellectuals that were already practising members of the movement in late Soviet times, for instance, Grigory Yakutovsky (Vseslav Svyatozar), Aleksei Dobrovolsky (Dobroslav), and Viktor Bezverkhy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} Other leaders that emerged in this period were Aleksandr Asov, publisher of numerous versions of the ''Book of Veles'', and Aleksei Belov, founder of the martial arts style known as "Slavic-hill wrestling".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=37–38}}

Russian Rodnovers started to organise by the mid-1990s; in 1994 the Moscow Slavic Community was the first Rodnover group to be registered by the government. Concerted efforts by the communities of Moscow and [[Kaluga]] led to the establishment of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in 1997. The communities of Moscow and [[Obninsk]] later left the organisation for ideological differences. Another organisation, the Circle of Veles, which is one of the largest and administers communities also located in the territory of Ukraine, was founded in 1999. The [[Ynglist Church]] too was formally established in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} In 2002, the same year of the Bittsa Agreement, the Circle of Pagan Tradition was established in Moscow.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|pp=184–185}} Its purpose was to bring together Russian Rodnovers who did not share the extreme right-wing views then dominant in much of the community.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=203}} In 2009, the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities and the Circle of Pagan Tradition issued a joint statement against Ynglism, disapproving what they reck as Ynglists' "pseudo-Pagan teachings, pseudo-linguistics, pseudo-science and outright fiction".{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

In Poland, the [[Wrocław]]-based publishing house ''Toporzeł'' has reissued Stachniuk's works and those of his disciple Antoni Wacyk.{{sfn|Potrzebowski|2016|p=183}} Zadruga also inspired the registered religious Association of Native Faith (''Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary''; now called simply ''[[Rodzima Wiara]]'' [RW], lit.

Another Slavic Native Faith group registered with the Polish authorities in 1995 is the [[Native Polish Church]] (''Rodzimy Kościół Polski''), which represents a tradition that goes back to Władysław Kołodziej's Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid.&lt;ref&gt;''vide'' {{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Scott |year=2000 |title=Native Faith: Polish Neo-Paganism At the Brink of the 21st Century |publisher=Zakład Wydawniczy "Nomos" |isbn=9788388508073}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a Czech Native Faith group called ''Rahoŝť'' was founded by an Italian-born academic specialist in [[Slavic studies]], Giuseppe Maiello.{{sfn|Dostálová|2013|p=170}} In 2000 this group merged with the extreme-right nationalist National Front of the Pures (''Národní Fronta Kastitů'') to form the ''Rodná Víra'' group.{{sfn|Dostálová|2013|p=170}} This organisation subsequently nurtured strong links with Rodnover groups in Slovakia, Poland, and Russia.{{sfn|Dostálová|2013|p=171}} The group broke apart following a schism in 2005.{{sfn|Dostálová|2013|p=171}}

Rodnovery emerged in the former Yugoslav countries in the early 21st century.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=60}} A Serbian Native Faith group known as Slavic Circle (''Slovenski krug'') existed during the 1990s and 2000s, merging historical Slavic religion with a ritual structure adopted from that of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=56}} In Slovenia, a group called the Svetovid Parish of the Old Belief (''Staroverska Župa Svetovid'') was established around 2005 through a union of an older group, ''Ajda'', with the followers of military historian Matjaž Vratislav Anžur.{{sfn|Črnič|2013|pp=188–189}} As of 2013, it had between ten and fifteen members.{{sfn|Črnič|2013|p=189}} The group organised an "All-Slavic Council" for August 2009, which was held at Struga Castle.{{sfn|Črnič|2013|p=189}} In 2011, the Circle of Svarog (''Svaroži krug'') was founded in Bosnia.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=60}} During the 1990s and 2000s, a number of groups were established in Bulgaria, namely the Dulo Alliance, the Warriors of Tangra, and the Bulgarian Horde 1938.{{sfn|Dulov|2013|pp=206–207}} These groups had strong political motivations, being extremely nationalistic, anti-Western, and anti-Semitic.{{sfn|Dulov|2013|p=206}} Rodnover figures and groups played a prominent role in the 2002 establishment of ''Ongal'', a Bulgarian far-right umbrella organisation.{{sfn|Dulov|2013|pp=207–208}}

The [[Internet]] helped to bring about the growing uniformisation of ritual practices across the Slavic Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=149}} The first Rodnover website on [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet]] (so-called ''Runet'')—was established by a Moscow-based believer in 1996.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=315}} Many Rodnovers made use of [[Russian Wikipedia]] to promote their religion, although many found the process difficult and switched focus to promulgating Slavic Native Faith through [[LiveJournal]] and [[mail.ru]], through which they could express their own views more directly.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|pp=321–322}} From the mid-2000s, Rodnovers made increasing use of social media to communicate with other members of their community.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=323}} Russian Rodnovery also attracted the attention of academics, many of whom focused on the political dimensions of the movement, thus neglecting other aspects of the community.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=191}} Aitamurto later criticised some of this Russian-language material for reflecting scholars' own religious biases against Rodnovery, over-reliance on the published texts of prominent figure, or for sensationalising the subject to shock or impress their audience.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=191}} This generated some mutual hostility between academics and practitioners, rendering subsequent scholarly fieldwork more difficult.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=191}}

Rodnover themes have also been employed in the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subculture, particularly in bands like ''Sokyra Peruna'' ("[[Axe of Perun|Perun's Axe]]"), Whites Load, and ''Komu Vnyz'' ("Who Will Go Down").{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} In Poland, Rodnovery has influenced various forms of folk and popular music.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=76}}

===2010s: Consolidations and War in Donbass===

[[File:Slavic priests.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Priests of the "Skhoron Ezh Slaven" Rodnover organisation.]]

The early 2010s saw a strengthening of relations between Rodnover groups. In 2012, in Russia, representatives of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities, the Circle of Pagan Tradition and the Circle of Veles, signed an "Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests" that defined the criteria for the ordination of those wishing to become Slavic priests. On the same occasion, they once again expressed disapproval for some authors and movements, including the large Skhoron Ezh Slaven, which is also present in Belarus and Ukraine. In 2014, the Russian government officially registered the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities as an interregional public organisation for the promotion of Slavic culture.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

On 17 March 2014—the day after the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|Crimean status referendum]]—, the Russian Rodnover leader Ilya Cherkasov (also known as ''[[volkhv]]'' [[Veleslav]]) published the following statement: "I welcome Crimeans with right choice. That day initiates the process of uniting Slavic peoples. And no one is going to be able to interrupt this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://veleslav13.livejournal.com/205637.html |title=Поздравляю крымчан с верным выбором! |trans-title=Congratulations to the Crimeans for the right choice |last=Cherkasov |first=Ilya |authorlink=Veleslav |date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He approved the result of the referendum despite the international controversies arisen around its legality and credibility.

Rodnovery has a significant role in the [[War in Donbass]], with many Rodnovers forming or joining armed forces. Some of them—for example those of the Svarozich Battalion—have been fighting in favour of Russia; other Rodnovers—such as those of the [[Azov Battalion]]—have taken the side of Ukraine.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} The war has stirred different reactions among Ukrainian Rodnovers; many adherents of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] viewed Russia as the aggressor, while adherents of other Rodnover organisations like the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith more commonly saw Russians and Ukrainians as brothers and believed that the conflict was caused by the machinations of the United States.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|pp=133–134, 140–141}}

In August 2015, during the III Polish Nationwide Rodnover Congress, the [[Rodnover Confederation]] (''Konfederacja Rodzimowiercza'') was formally established. Among the members are eleven organisations including Gontyna Association, Żertwa Association, Pomeranian Rodnovers (''Rodzimowiercy Pomorscy''), Drzewo Przodków Association, Circle of Radegast (''Krąg Radogost''), Kałdus Association, Swarga Group (''Gromada "Swarga"''), WiD Group, [[Rodzima Wiara|ZW Rodzima Wiara]] and the Watra Rodnover Community (''Wspólnota Rodzimowierców "Watra"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rodzimawiara.org.pl/aktualnosci/262-sprawozdanie-z-iii-ogolnopolskiego-zjazdu-rodzimowiercow.html |title=Sprawozdanie z III Ogólnopolskiego Zjazdu Rodzimowierców |last=Bartwicki |first=Arkadiusz |date=1 November 2015 |publisher=ZW Rodzima Wiara |website=rodzimawiara.org.pl |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, during the celebrations of the nationwide holiday called Stado, a new religious organisation was created: the Religious Organisation of Polish Rodnovers "Kin" (''Związek Wyznaniowy Rodzimowierców Polskich "Ród"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://duchtynia.pl/2017/06/powolanie-nowego-zwiazku-wyznaniowego/ |title=Powołanie nowego związku wyznaniowego |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=13 June 2017 |website=Duchtynia |access-date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches, interwoven movements and influences==

[[File:Kupala 2017 in Krasotinka, Kaluga (0).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a ritual with a fiery wheel.]]

{{Further|List of Slavic Native Faith's organisations}}
There are Rodnover groups who develop theories and practices which differ significantly from those of common Rodnovery, represented by the theology and cosmology contained in the ''Book of Veles'' and Slavic folklore. Some of them have developed into religions that may or may not be regarded as Rodnovery (this is the case of Ynglism, which is not recognised as true Slavic Native Faith by the major Rodnover organisations of Russia,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}} and of Yagnovery, Ladovery and Sylenkoism, which some Rodnovers opine not to be classifiable as branches of Slavic Native Faith{{sfn|Petrović|2013|p=8. Quote: «... they [some scholars] count as part of Slavic Rodnovery (or regional Slavic Rodnoveries) denominations that are not part of Slavic Rodnovery: RUNVira, Yagnovery, Ladovery, etc.).»}}). Other Rodnover movements represent distinct ethnic groups within the broader Slavic family or space (this is the case of Scythian Assians and Meryan Rodnovers). There are, otherwise, Rodnover groups that intertwine with forms of religion and spirituality that are not immediately related to the Slavic Native Faith (this is the case of Ivanovism, Rerikhism and the Ringing Cedars).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=29}}

Other documented movements include the devotees of [[Berehynia]] in Ukraine, the Pan-Slavic Khara-Khors Slavic Vedic movement, Koliada Viatichei, the Russian Religious Church of Viktor Kandyba, the Satya-Veda Aryan Gentile Community of Ilya Cherkasov (''[[volkhv]]'' [[Veleslav]]), the Tezaurus Spiritual Union, amongst others.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=23}}&lt;ref name=Ivakhiv2006&gt;Ivakhiv, Adrian (2006).

Continuum. {{ISBN|9780199754670}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1186–1187}} According to Irina Sadovina, more or less all of these movements share the assumption to represent expressions of a universal truth, or "Vedic wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Sadovina |first=Irina |year=2017 |title=The New Age paradox: Spiritual consumerism and traditional authority at the Child of Nature festival in Russia |journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion |volume=32 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/13537903.2016.1256653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic or doctrinal variations of Rodnovery===

====Scythian Assianism====

{{Main|Assianism}}
Assianism (Russian: Ассианство) is essentially [[Scythians|Scythian]] Rodnovery. It is present in Russia and Ukraine, especially, but not exclusively, among [[Cossacks]] who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=276}} An organised renewal of Scythian religion started in the 1980s building upon the folk religious beliefs of the [[Ossetians]], who are modern linguistic descendants of the Scythians. They endonymously call the religion ''[[Uatsdin]]'' ([[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] Cyrillic: Уацдин, literally "True Faith"), and have embraced it in large numbers.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202–207}} The "North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire" is a Scythian Rodnover organisation in the [[North Caucasus]] region of Russia and eastern Ukraine that operates under the aegis of the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=168}}

The major organisation among Ossetians is the Atsætæ Church (Ossetian: Ацæтæ; Russian: Асата, ''Asata'') led by Daurbek Makeyev, based in [[North Ossetia–Alania]]. Some Russians have embraced Assianism by virtue of the fact that most of the ancient Scythians were assimilated by the [[East Slavs]], and therefore modern Russians may reclaim Scythian culture. Such idea that Russians may derive, at least in part, from Scythians is popular in many Rodnover circles.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=57, note 6}} Makeyev himself, in a 2007 publication entitled "Assianism and world culture" (''Assianstvo i mirovaya kul'tura''), presented the religion as a worldwide spiritual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Makeyev |first=Daurbek |contribution=Ассианство и мировая культура [Assianism and world culture] |year=2007 |title=Traditional Religious Views of Ossetians and Modernity |institution=Ministry of National Affairs and the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania; Alano-Pamir Centre of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences |location=National Scientific Library of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania |contribution-url=http://osradio.ru/obshestvo/print:page,1,5358-tradicionnye-religioznye-vozzrenija-osetin-i.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163542/http://osradio.ru/obshestvo/print:page,1,5358-tradicionnye-religioznye-vozzrenija-osetin-i.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}} Also published as chapter #4 in {{cite book| last=Makeyev |first=D. |year=2007 |title=Религиозное мировоззрение в Нартском эпосе |trans-title=Religious Worldview in the Nart Epic |location=Vladikavkaz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pdS9PgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, on the occasion of a conference specifically dedicated to the subject held at the [[Moscow State University]], philosopher [[Alexander Dugin]] praised the renewal of Scythian culture among Ossetians as an inspiration that will be beneficial to all Indo-Europeans and to the whole world.&lt;ref name="Dugin-Assianism"&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Дугин: Осетинский народ сделал возможным возвращение России на имперскую орбиту |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meryan Rodnovery====

Meryan Rodnovery or Meryan Native Faith is an [[ethnoreligious group|ethnoreligious]] movement present in the regions of [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo]], [[Kostroma Oblast|Kostroma]], [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Tver Oblast|Tver]], and [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]]. It consists in the establishment of an ethnoreligious identity among those Russians who have Meryan ancestry; [[Merya]] are [[Volga Finns]] fully assimilated by [[East Slavs]] in the historical process of formation of the Russian ethnicity. It is primarily an urban phenomenon and its adherents are Russian-speakers.&lt;ref name=Skrylnikov2016a&gt;{{cite article |last=Skrylnikov |first=Pavel Andreyevich |year=2016 |title=Неоязычество сегодня: движение Merjamaa в региональном и общероссийском контексте |trans-title=Neopaganism today: Merjamaa movement in the regional and Russian context |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/neoyazychestvo-segodnya-dvizhenie-merjamaa-v-regionalnom-i-obscherossiyskom-kontekste |work=Региональная и локальная специфика культурных и языковых процессов (на материале полевых этнографических и этнолингвистических исследований в Костромском крае в XX - XXI вв.) |publisher=Института этнологии и антропологии им. Н.Н.Миклухо-Маклая РАН (г. Москва)}} УДК 304.444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various organisations have been established in the late 2000s and 2010s, including Merjamaa and Merya mir (Меря мир). In 2012 they presented their official flag. Skrylnikov notes that a salient feature of the movement is what he defines "ethnofuturism", that is to say, conscious adaptation of Merya heritage to the forms of modernity, in a process of distinction and interaction with Russian Native Faith. He says that Meryan Native Faith is mostly Slavic Native Faith whose concepts, names and iconoraphy are [[Finnicised]]. Meryan Rodnovers also rely upon the uninterrupted traditions of [[Mari Native Faith]]; on 27 September 2015, they organised a joint Mari-Merya prayer in the Moscow region. The cult of a Meryan [[mother goddess]] is being built upon the festival of the female saint [[Paraskevi of Iconium]], on November 10. Also, Saint Leontius of Rostov is appropriated as a native god.&lt;ref name=Skrylnikov2016a/&gt;

====Ukrainian Sylenkoism====

{{Main|Native Ukrainian National Faith}}
Sylenkoism is the branch of Rodnovery represented by the churches of the Native Ukrainian National Faith established by Lev Sylenko in the 1960s in the Ukrainian diaspora, and introduced in Ukraine only after the fall of the Soviet Union. There are at least four such churches: the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the fellowship established by Volodymyr Chornyi centred in [[Lviv]], and the more independent Union of the Native Ukrainian Faith.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|pp=17–18}} According to the definition of Sylenko himself, his doctrine is that of a solar "absolute monotheism", in which the single God is Dazhbog,{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} that is to say the sky, the Sun, and the self-giving of the world itself.

Sylenko proclaimed himself a prophet, bringing to the Slavs a new understanding of God that, according to him, corresponds to their own and original understanding of God. By his own words: "God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through "breath of his ancestors" being united with them "by divine holiness".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a "false prophet" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the "quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism", the "fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=22}}

====Yagnovery, Ladovery and Orantism====

Yagnovery (Ukrainian: Ягновіра), Ladovery (Ладовіра) and Orantism (Орантизм) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=238}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Kutuzova |first=N.

====Ynglism====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Slavo-Aryan Veda cover.png|thumb|upright=1.1|An edition of [[Ynglism|Ynglists']] ''Slavo-Aryan Vedas''.]] --&gt;

{{Main|Ynglism}}
Ynglism (Russian: Инглии́зм), institutionally known as the Ancient Russian Ynglist Church of the Orthodox Old Believers—Ynglings, was established in the early 1990s by the charismatic leader Aleksandr Khinevich from [[Omsk]], in [[Siberia]]. According to the movement, which presents itself as the true, Orthodox, olden religion of the Russians, Yngly is the fiery order of reality through which the supreme God—called by the name "Ramha" in Ynglist theology—ongoingly generates the universe. They believe that "[[Yngling]]", a name that identifies the earliest royal dynasties of [[Scandinavia]], means "offspring of Yngly", and that the historical Ynglings migrated to Scandinavia from the region of Omsk, which was a spiritual centre of the early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]. They hold that the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' of the [[Edda]] (itself composed by [[Snorri Sturluson]] on the basis of an older ''[[Ynglingatal]]''), proves their ideas about the origins of the Ynglings in Omsk and is ultimately a more recent version of texts contained in their own sacred books, the ''Slavo-Aryan Vedas''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=50–51}}

The spiritual academy of the Ynglist Church teaches their Vedas, "Aryan mathematics" and grammar, and health techniques. The church is known for its intensive [[proselytism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Gennadevich |first=Kuzmin Aleksandr |year=2014 |title=Неоязыческая печать в современной России: особенности идеологии и пропагандистской деятельности |trans-title=Neo-Pagan Press in Modern Russia: Specifics of Ideology and Propagandistic Activity |url=http://scjournal.ru/articles/issn_1997-292X_2014_12-1_29.pdf |journal=Грамота |number=50 |volume=12 |pages=121–124 |issn=1997-292X}} Abstract: «The article is devoted to the analysis of the publishing and propagandistic activity of the modern Russian neo-paganism in the structure of national patriotic movement. The paper assesses the level of the radicalism of the ideas propagated by the analyzed publications. Special attention is paid to the propagandistic and publishing activity of the ideologists of the so-called Ynglism.»&lt;/ref&gt; carried out through a "massive selling" of books, journals and other media. Ynglists organise yearly gatherings (''veche'') in summer.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}}

The Ynglist Church was prosecuted in the early 2000s for [[ethnic hatred]] according to Russian laws, and its headquarters in Omsk were liquidated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}} Despite this, it continues to operate as an unregistered religious phenomenon represented by a multiplicity of communities. Ynglism meets widespread disapproval within mainstream Rodnovery, and the international ''veche'' has declared it a false religion. Nevertheless, according to Aitamurto (2016), on the basis of the amount of literature that Ynglists publish and the presence of their representatives at various Rodnover conferences, is clear that Ynglism has a "substantial number of followers".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}}

===Movements belonging to the Vedic spectrum===

====Ivanovism, Rerikhism, Peterburgian Vedism====

{{Main|Russian cosmism|Ivanovism|Rerikhism|Peterburgian Vedism}}
Ivanovism (Russian: Ивановизм) and Rerikhism (Рерихиа́нство) are spiritual movements linked with [[Russian cosmism]], a [[holism|holistic]] philosophy emphasising the centrality of the human being within a living environment and the idea of "God-building". It originated in the early 20th century and experienced a revival after the collapse of the Soviet Union, relying upon the [[Russian philosophy|Russian philosophical]] tradition, especially that represented by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] and [[Pavel Florensky]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=29}}

Rerikhism originates from the teachings of [[Helena Roerich|Helena]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]], it inherits elements of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and revolves around the practice of [[Agni Yoga]], the union with [[Agni]], the fire enliving the universe. Ivakhiv (2005) classifies Rerikhians and others movements of Theosophical imprint, such as the Ukrainian Spiritual Republic, together with the broader "Vedic" movement.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=15}}

Ivanovism is a spiritual discipline based on the teachings of the [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Porfiry Ivanov]], based on the ''Detka'' healing system and religious hymns. The movement has its headquarters in eastern Ukraine,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=16}} the region of origin of Ivanov himself, and it is widespread in Russia. Ivanovite teachings are incorporated by Peterburgian Vedism, the Rodnover movement started by Viktor Bezverkhy and primarily represented by the Society of the Mages founded in 1986 and the Union of the Veneds founded in 1990, and their offshoots.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}

====Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism====

{{Main|Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism}}

The Ringing Cedars (Russian: Звенящие Кедры) or Anastasianism is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery. The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of [[Vladimir Megre]] (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an [[archetype|archetypal]] Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} These books teach what Rasa Pranskevičiūtė has defined as a "cosmological [[pantheism]]",{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=446}} in which nature is the manifested "thought of God" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|pp=450–451}}

Anastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, "kinship homesteads" (родовое поместье, ''rodovoye pomest'ye''), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name "Ringing Cedars" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as "Vedic", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52–53}}

[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Димон 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Group of Ringing Cedars' Rodnovers in Russia.]]

{{main|Slavic Native Faith in Russia}}

Writing in 2000, Shnirelman noted that Rodnovery was "growing rapidly" within the Russian Federation.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} In 2016, Aitamurto noted that there was "no reliable information" on the number of Rodnovers in Russia, but that it was "plausible" that there were "several tens of thousands" of practitioners active in the country.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=63}} This was partly because there were several Rodnover groups active on the social network [[VK (social networking)|VK]] which had over 10,000 members.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=63}} Estimates from some research institutes, often reported by Russian Orthodox Church organs, put the number of Native Faith practitioners in the few millions.&lt;ref name="Adversus paganos"/&gt;

Aitamurto observed that a "substantial number" of adherents—and in particular those who had been among the earliest—belonged to the "technical intelligentsia".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Similarly, Shnirelman noted that the founders of Russian Rodnovery were "well-educated urbanised intellectuals" who had become frustrated with "cosmopolitan urban culture".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=88}} [[Physics|Physicists]] were particularly well represented; in this Aitamurto drew comparisons to the high number of computer professionals who were present in the Pagan communities of Western countries.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} The movement also involved a significant number of people who had a background in the Soviet or Russian Army,{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1a2=Gaidukov|1y=2013|1p=147|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=73}} or in policing and security.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=73}} The "vast majority" of Russian Rodnovers were young and there were a greater proportion of men than women.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} A questionnaire distributed at the Kupala festival in Maloyaroslavets suggested that Rodnovers typically had above-average levels of education, with a substantial portion working as business owners or managers.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=121}} A high proportion were also involved in specialist professions such as engineering, academia, or information technology, and the majority lived in cities.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|pp=121–122}}

The historian [[Marlene Laruelle]] suggested that Rodnovery was likely to remain a marginalised religion in comparison to Russian Orthodoxy, but that its main significance for Russian society had been by diffusing "historical themes"—particularly regarding an ancient Aryan race—to a far wider audience, including many who were Orthodox or non-religious.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=298}} A number of youth subcultures have been identified as introducing people to Rodnovery, among them heavy metal, historical re-enactment, and the admirers of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|pp=158–159}} Rodnovery is also spread through a variety of newspapers and journals.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=68}} Also popular with Russian Rodnovers has been the martial arts movement known as ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba''.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=317}} A number of popular celebrities, including the singer [[Maria Arkhipova]] and the professional boxer [[Aleksandr Povetkin]],{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} have publicly embraced Rodnovery.

====Ukraine====

[[File:Ukraine RUNVira Sylenkoite temple worship (0).png|thumb|upright=1.1|People gathered for worship at a [[Native Ukrainian National Faith|Native Ukrainian National Faith's]] temple in Ukraine.]]

{{Main|Slavic Native Faith in Ukraine}}

Slavic Native Faith underwent dramatic growth in Ukraine during the early and mid 1990s.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} In 2005, Ivakhiv noted that there were likely between 5000 and 10,000 practitioners in Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=224}} The religion's "main base" consisted of ethnic Ukrainians who were "nationally oriented" and who displayed higher than average levels of education.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=224}} There is overlap between Slavic Native Faith followers and other sectors of Ukrainian society, such as the folk and traditional music revival groups, Cossack associations, traditional martial arts groups, and nationalist and ultra-nationalist organisations.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}}

Ivakhiv noted that Rodnovery remains "a relatively small niche in Ukrainian religious culture",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=231}} and that it faces a mixed reception in the country.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=233–234}} Established Ukrainian Orthodox and Roman Catholic groups have viewed it with alarm and hostility,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}} while the country's educated and intellectual classes tend to view it as a fringe part of the ultra-conservative movement which was tinged with anti-Semitism and xenophobia.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}}

In the global Ukrainian diaspora, there has been a "great decline" in the numbers practising the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] branch of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=136}} This has been due to branch's inability to attract sufficient numbers of youth in this community.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=148}} Alternately, the Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith has expanded in both Moldova and Germany.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=140}}

====Belarus and Baltic states' Slavic minorities====

[[File:Купальский костёр.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Fire ritual of Belarusian Rodnovers.]]

Slavic Native Faith groups are also active in Belarus,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|pp=326, 327}} the most numerous being the Commonwealth of Rodoviches (Rodnovers), who fully align with Slavic traditions, and the organisation Radzimas, aligning with [[Baltic neopaganism|Baltic traditions]] instead.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} Rodnovery in Belarus is popular among some intellectuals active in the pro-Russian political scene, for instance Rodnover leader Uladzimir Sacevič.&lt;ref name="Lastouski"&gt;{{cite article |last=Lastoŭski |first=Aliaksiej |year=2011 |title=Russo-centrism as an ideological project of Belarusian identity |url=http://palityka.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/01_article.pdf |journal=Belarusian Political Scene Review |volume=1 |publisher=Institute of Political Studies Political Sphere, Vytautas Magnus University}} p. 27: «[...] Another peculiar place where the ideas of russo-centrism are created and propagated is a series of international scientific and practical conferences held under the supervision of Uladzimir Sacevič. Sacevič himself leads social activities in several directions. He is the chairman of the "Human Ecology" Committee under the Belarusian Social and Ecological Union, a member of the Coordinating Council of the Union of Struggle for People's Sobriety, and at the same time acts as the organiser of the Rodnovery (Slavic neopagan) movement in Belarus. Following the conferences' results, digests under a characteristic name "The Slavic Veche" are published (in total, four such digests had been published by 2009). Selection of materials in these digests is very eclectic. There, one can find manifestos of Rodnovers/neopagans [...]».&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also practising Rodnovers among [[Russians in Lithuania|Lithuania's]]{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=319}} and [[Russians in Estonia|Estonia's]] ethnically Russian minorities. Russians in Estonia have established their own religious organisation, the Fellowship of the Russian People's Faith in Estonia registered in [[Tartu]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eestis registreeritud usulised ühendused |trans-title=Estonia Registered Religious Associations |url=https://www.siseministeerium.ee/sites/default/files/dokumendid/usuasjad/eestis_registreeritud_usulised_uhendused_.pdf |publisher=Estonia's Ministry of the Interior |date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Slavic nations===
{{See also|Slavic Native Faith in Poland}}
As of 2013, Rodnover groups in Bulgaria were described as having few members and little influence.{{sfn|Dulov|2013|p=204}} That same year, Simpson noted that Slavic Native Faith remains a "very small religion" in Poland, which is otherwise dominated by Roman Catholicism.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=120}} He suggested that there were under 900 regularly active members of the main four registered Polish Native Faith organisations,{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=115}} and around as many adherents belonging to smaller, unregistered groups.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} In 2017, he stated that between 2000 and 2500 "actively engaged and regular participants" were likely active in the country.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=82}} He observed that in the country, Slavic Native Faith's adherents were "still relatively young",{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=119}} and saw an overlap with the community of historical re-enactors.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} In Poland, Slavic Native Faith outnumbers other Pagan religions, although both are represented in the [[Pagan Federation|Pagan Federation International]]'s Polish branch.{{sfn|Witulski|2013|pp=298, 300}}

Anna-Marie Dostálová stated that the entire Pagan community in the Czech Republic—which includes Heathens, Wiccans, and Druids as well as Slavic Rodnovers—was of a "small size".{{sfn|Dostálová|2013|p=179}}

[[File:Miniaturk 009.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=color view of reconstructed model of Temple of Artemis, at Miniatürk Park, Istanbul, Turkey|This model of the Temple of Artemis, at [[Miniatürk]] Park, Istanbul, Turkey, attempts to recreate the probable appearance of the first temple.]]

The '''Temple of Artemis''' or '''Artemision''' ({{lang-gr|Ἀρτεμίσιον}}; {{lang-tr|Artemis Tapınağı}}), also known less precisely as the '''Temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]''', was a [[Greek temple]] dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess [[Artemis]]. It was located in [[Ephesus]] (near the modern town of [[Selçuk]] in present-day [[Turkey]]). It was completely rebuilt three times, and in its final form was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''The Western Shores of Turkey: Discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts'' 2004, p. 148; Clive Foss, ''Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city'', Cambridge University Press, 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=cz_UVafPvu&amp;dq=Artemis%20Ephesus%20John%20Chrysostom%20mob&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 86–89 &amp; footnote 83.]&lt;/ref&gt; Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.

The earliest version of the temple (a ''[[temenos]]'') antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed it to the [[Amazons]]. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form,  began around 550 BC, under the Cretan [[architect]] [[Chersiphron]] and his son [[Metagenes]]. The project was funded by [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by [[Herostratus]] in an act of [[arson]]. The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s list of the world's Seven Wonders:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have set eyes on the wall of lofty [[Babylon]] on which is a road for chariots, and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus by the Alpheus]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|hanging gardens]], and the [[Colossus of Rhodes|colossus of the Sun]], and the huge labour of the [[Egyptian pyramids|high pyramids]], and the vast [[Mausoleum of Mausolus|tomb of Mausolus]]; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, "Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand".&lt;ref&gt;Antipater, ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' IX.58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Location and history==
[[File:Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|alt=imaginary Temple of Artemis 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck|The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the [[Renaissance]], as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]]]]
The Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75&amp;nbsp;km south from the modern port city of [[İzmir]], in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of [[Selçuk]].

The sacred site (''[[temenos]]'') at Ephesus was far older than the ''Artemision'' itself. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at [[Didyma]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 7.7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were [[Leleges]] and [[Lydia]]ns.  [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'' attributed the earliest ''temenos'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (''bretas'') of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that [[Pindar]] believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. [[Tacitus]] also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern archaeology]] cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by [[David George Hogarth]] identified three successive temple buildings.&lt;ref&gt;D.G. Hogarth, editor, 1908. ''Excavations at Ephesus''.&lt;/ref&gt; Re-excavations in 1987–88&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|pp=137–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the [[Bronze Age]], with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to [[Geometric art|Middle Geometric times]], when a [[peripteral]] temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=142}} noted some still earlier placements of stones, [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] pottery and crude clay animal figurines, but warned "it is still to early to come to conclusions about a cult sequence."&lt;/ref&gt; The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere.

In the 7th century BC, a flood&lt;ref&gt;The flood is dated by fragmentary ceramics: {{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a [[griffin]] and the [[Tree of Life]], apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (''[[xoanon]]'') of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two metres between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4&amp;nbsp;m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use "indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|pp=144,153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heraclitus]] deposited his book "On Nature" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple.

==Second phase==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--2 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
The new temple was sponsored at least in part by [[Croesus]], who founded [[Lydia]]'s empire and was overlord of Ephesus,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus' statement to this effect is confirmed by the conjectural reading of a fragmentary dedicatory inscription, conserved in the British Museum (''A Guide to the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum'' 84).&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan [[architect]] [[Chersiphron]] and his son [[Metagenes]]. It was 115&amp;nbsp;m (377&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 46&amp;nbsp;m (151&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its [[peripteral]] columns stood some 13&amp;nbsp;m (40&amp;nbsp;ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the ''[[cella]]'' that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood [[Cult image|cult statue]] was sculpted by Endoios,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny's Natural History]], 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman [[Mucianus]], who thought that the cult image by an "Endoios" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late sixth-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.

A rich foundation deposit from this era yielded more than a thousand items, including what may be the earliest coins made from the silver-gold alloy [[electrum]]. Fragments of bas-relief on the lowest drums of the temple, preserved in the British Museum, show that the enriched columns of the later temple, of which a few survive (''illustration below'') were versions of this earlier feature. [[Pliny the Elder]], seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes.

The temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of [[jewelry]] and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess' protection from punishment, firstly by [[Dionysus]] and later, by [[Heracles]].

===Destruction===
In 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, [[Herostratus]], who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term ''[[Herostratus#In language|herostratic fame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, Memorable deeds and sayings, 8. 14. 5: "A man was found to plan the burning of the temple of Ephesian Diana so that through the destruction of this most beautiful building his name might be spread through the whole world."[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#14.ext.5 Valerius Maximus, VIII.14.ext.5]&lt;/ref&gt; For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and [[damnatio memoriae|forbade anyone from mentioning his name]]; but [[Theopompus]] later noted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|year=1849|pages=439|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1547.html|accessdate=July 21, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202193125/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1547.html|archivedate=February 2, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of [[Alexander the Great]] (around 20/21 July 356 BC). [[Plutarch]] remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third phase==

Alexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137&amp;nbsp;m (450&amp;nbsp;ft) long by 69&amp;nbsp;m (225&amp;nbsp;ft) wide and 18&amp;nbsp;m (60&amp;nbsp;ft) high, with more than 127 columns. [[Athenagoras of Athens]] names [[Endoeus]], a pupil of Daedalus, as sculptor of Artemis' main cult image.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.%2010.38.6&amp;lang=original 10.38.6], trans Jones and Ormerod, 1918, from perseus.org. For ''Artemis Protothronia'' as a separate aspect of Ephesian cult to Artemis, see Strelan, R., ''Paul, Artemis, and the Jews in Ephesus'', de Gruyter, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nw1xdz7fO18C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=Ephesus+Nyx&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B3Uyn7lL1v&amp;sig=wVIY0axqXi_82OMkpLwl3AA1M10&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nJJlTbyTCI-r8QOX__W9Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ephesus%20Nyx&amp;f=false p. 157.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Column drum Ephesus.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=A drum from the base of a column from the 4th-century rebuilding at Ephesus in the British Museum|A drum from the base of a column from the 4th-century rebuilding, now in the [[British Museum]].]]
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (c. 2nd century AD) reports another image and altar in the Temple, dedicated to Artemis ''Protothronia'' (Artemis "of the first seat") and a gallery of images above this altar, including an ancient figure of [[Nyx]] (the primordial goddess of Night) by the sculptor [[Rhoecus]] (6th century BC). Pliny describes images of Amazons, the legendary founders of Ephesus and Ephesian Artemis' original protégés, carved by [[Scopas]]. Literary sources describe the temple's adornment by paintings, columns gilded with gold and silver, and religious works of renowned Greek sculptors [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]], [[Pheidias]], [[Cresilas]], and [[Phradmon]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

This reconstruction survived for 600 years, and appears multiple times in early [[Christianity|Christian]] accounts of Ephesus. According to the [[New Testament]], the appearance of the [[Paul of Tarsus|first Christian missionary]] in Ephesus caused locals to fear for the temple's dishonor.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Acts|19:27|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century ''[[Acts of John]]'' includes an [[apocryphal]] tale of the temple's destruction: the apostle John prayed publicly in the Temple of Artemis, exorcising its demons and "of a sudden the altar of Artemis split in many pieces... and half the temple fell down," instantly converting the Ephesians, who wept, prayed or took flight.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay MacMullen, ''Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D. 100-400'' 1984, p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this, a Roman edict of 162 AD acknowledges the importance of ''Artemesion'', the annual Ephesian festival to Artemis, and officially extends it from a few holy days over March–April to a whole month, "one of the largest and most magnificent religious festivals in Ephesus' liturgical calendar".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strelan, ''Paul, Artemis, and the Jews in Ephesus'', 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;id=nw1xdz7fO18C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Ephesus+Artemisia&amp;ots=B3UyoelK5D&amp;sig=IbYDOyUDwn2DUD8Ahqv-Tfly-bs#v=onepage&amp;q=Ephesus%20Artemisia&amp;f=falsepp. 57–58 and footnote 83.] The edict was made as a form of official apology and compensation; a senior Roman official had unwittingly offended the goddess by conducting business during one or more of her holy days. The political, economic and religious importance of Ephesian Artemis was undiminished, more than one hundred years after Paul's visit.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the [[Goths]], an East Germanic tribe;&lt;ref&gt;''268'': Herwig Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., ''History of the Goths'' (1979) 1988 p.52f, correlating multiple sources, corrects the date of the Gothic advance into the Aegean against the ''[[Origo Gothica]]'', which scrambles the events of several years, giving 267 for this event.&lt;/ref&gt; in the time of emperor [[Gallienus]]: "Respa, Veduc and Thuruar,&lt;ref&gt;''Respa, Veduco, Thurar'': these names are otherwise unknown (Wolfram 1988, p.52 and note 84).&lt;/ref&gt; leaders of the Goths, took ship and sailed across the strait of the Hellespont to Asia. There they laid waste many populous cities and set fire to the renowned temple of Diana at Ephesus," reported [[Jordanes]] in ''Getica''.&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes, ''Getica'' xx.107.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, unknown to what extent the temple was damaged.

Whatever the extent of the injuries to the building, it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired, as the temple is noted to have been in use for worship during the rise of Christianity, and closed as a consequence of the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=Trombley&gt;{{cite book |last=Trombley |first=Frank R. |url=https://books.google.se/books?id=HZefAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145 |title=Hellenic Religion and Christianization c. 370-529 |volume=1 |publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]] |date=1 December 1995 |page=145 |isbn=9789004276772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, the history of the temple between 268 and its closure by the Christian persecutions is not well known, and it is unconfirmed how big the damage of 268 was, and exactly which year it was closed by the Christians.  [[Ammonius of Alexandria]] comments on the closure of the temple in his commentary of the Acts of the Apostles in the mid 5th-century, in which he gives the impression that the closure of the temple had occurred in his living memory.&lt;ref name=Trombley/&gt; The closure of the Temple of Artemis is assumed to have occurred sometime during the course of the early to mid 5th-century, with the year of 407 as an early date.&lt;ref name=Trombley/&gt; The closure of the temple was followed by the erasing of the name of Artemis from inscriptions around the city of Ephesus.&lt;ref name=Trombley/&gt;

===Final destruction===

It is unknown how long the building stood after the closure of the temple by the Christians.  At least some of the stones from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Foss, ''Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city'', Cambridge University Press, 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=cz_UVafPvu&amp;dq=Artemis%20Ephesus%20John%20Chrysostom%20mob&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 86–87 &amp; footnote 83.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the columns in [[Hagia Sophia]] originally belonged to the temple of Artemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreturkey.com/exptur.phtml?id=176|title=Explore Turkey :: St. Sophia :: Construction for the Third Time|work=exploreturkey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai]]'' records the re-use of several statues and other decorative elements from the temple, throughout [[Constantinople]].

The main primary sources for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus are [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/36*.html#95 XXXVI.xxi.95]&lt;/ref&gt; Pomponius Mela [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307230420/http://ourworld-top.cs.com/latintexts/m117.htm i:17], &lt;!-- "Ptolemy, 5": see Talk --&gt; and [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/3.html#3.5 III.5]&lt;/ref&gt; (referencing the burning of the ''Artemiseum'').

==Rediscovery of the temple==
[[File:Artemistempleplan.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructive plan of Temple of Artemis at [[Ephesus]] according to [[John Turtle Wood]] (1877).]]
[[File:Templo-Artemisa-Efeso-2017.jpg|thumb|left|alt=columns in field at the site of the temple today.|The site of the temple today.]]

After six years of searching, the site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by [[John Turtle Wood]] and sponsored by the [[British Museum]].

Today the site of the temple, which lies just outside [[Selçuk]], is marked by a single column constructed of dissociated fragments discovered on the site.

==Cult and influence==
The archaic ''temeton'' beneath the later temples clearly housed some form of "[[Great Goddess]]" but nothing is known of her cult. The literary accounts that describe it as "[[Amazons|Amazon]]ian" refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of ''Artemis Ephesia''. The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding – a gift and honor to the goddess – brought further prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Stevenson |title=Power and place: Temple and identity in the Book of Revelation |publisher=de Gruyter |year=2001 |page=77, citing Aelius Aristides, ''Concerning Concord'', 25 }} For an exposition of the mechanisms involved in these social, religious and economic advantages, see Stevenson, 2001, pp. 70–80 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and in the beginning of May to attend the main Artemis Procession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bohstrom |first=Philippe |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/1.736389|title=Archaeologists Unveil Blazing Mosaics From Apostle Paul-era Ephesus|work=''[[Haaretz]]|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Artemis' shrines, temples and festivals (''Artemisia'') could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord [[Croesus]], the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to [[Sardis]] and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LiDonnici|1992|p=401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.&lt;ref&gt;The intended offering might have included a divine statue of Alexander himself, or simply an inscription commemorating his subsidy as a gift to the Goddess, with himself as her particular protege. The Ephesians protested with great diplomacy, it being "inappropriate for a god to dedicate offerings to a god". See Strabo, Geography, 14.1.22, variously interpreted in Strelan, p. 80, and Gregory Stevenson, Power and place: Temple and identity in the Book of Revelation, de Gruyter, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4vRPx7Ujyn0C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=Strabo+14.1.22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y_LhP8byqz&amp;sig=qXZWte419JjyEXejmrAQXKvDcso&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eOlnTZ_cG9Cx8QOzsoCMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Strabo%2014.1.22&amp;f=false p. 79.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge.

Under Hellenic rule, and later, under Roman rule, the Ephesian ''Artemisia'' festival was increasingly promoted as a key element in the pan-Hellenic festival circuit. It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of [[Apelles]]' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 35–93.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], the emperor [[Commodus]] lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=18}}, citing Xenophon for marriage-broking at the Ephesian ''Artemesia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess [[Artemis]]. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of [[Apollo]], a virgin huntress who supplanted the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Selene]] as goddess of the [[Moon]]. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic [[cult image]]&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;The iconic images have been most thoroughly assembled by Robert Fleischer, ''Artemis von Ephesos und der erwandte Kultstatue von Anatolien und Syrien'' EPRO '''35''' (Leiden: Brill) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that was carved of wood (a ''[[xoanon]]'') and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like [[Term (architecture)|term]], from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a [[mural crown]] (like a city's walls), an attribute of [[Cybele]] as a protector of cities (see ''[[polos]]'').&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[File:Fontana di Diana Efesina-Tivoli, Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', at Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Lazio, Italy|Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', [[Villa d'Este]], [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], [[Italy]]]]
The traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as ''Diana Efesia Multimammia'' and other related descriptions.&lt;ref name=Nielsen/&gt; This interpretation was rooted in [[Minucius Felix]] and [[Jerome]]'s Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditionally interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called "breasts", were left unpainted or cast in different colors.&lt;ref name=Nielsen/&gt; Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seiterle |title=Artemis: die Grosse Göttin von Ephesos |journal=Antike Welt |volume=10 |year=1979 |pages=3–16 }} accepted in the 1980s by [[Walter Burkert]] and Brita Alroth, among others, criticised and rejected by Robert Fleischer, but widely popularized.&lt;/ref&gt;), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies.&lt;ref name=Nielsen/&gt; The "breasts" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on [[amber]] gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987–1988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th century flood. This form of jewelry, then, had already been developed by the [[Geometric Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fleischer |title=Neues zur kleinasiatischen Kultstatue |journal=Archäologischer Anzeiger |volume=98 |year=1983 |pages=81–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] or of a stack of ''[[Ouroboros|ouroboroi]]'', the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called "Megabyzoi"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the [[Galli]]. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls ([[kore (sculpture)|korai]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geographica'', 14.1.23; sometimes the existence of a college is disputed and rather, a succession of priests given the title of "Megabyzos" is preferred. They may have been few in number; their existence in any form is also disputed; see Roller, Lynn E., ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele,'' University of California Press, 1999, p. 253, note 52 {{ISBN|9780520210240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,006:5:3 [[Xenophon]], ''Anabasis'', 5.3.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

A votive inscription mentioned by Florence Mary Bennett,&lt;ref&gt;Florence Mary Bennett, ''Religious Cults Associated with the Amazons'' (1912): Chapter III: Ephesian Artemis ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca04.htm on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; which dates probably from about the 3rd century BC, associates Ephesian Artemis with Crete: "To the Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has set up in votive offering [a statue of] the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the Light-Bearer."

The Greek habits of [[syncretism]] assimilated all foreign gods under some form of the Olympian pantheon familiar to them—in ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''—and it is clear that at Ephesus, the identification with Artemis that the Ionian settlers made of the "Lady of Ephesus" was slender. Nevertheless, later Greeks and Romans identified her with both Artemis and Diana, and there was a tradition in ancient Rome that identified her with the goddess Isis as well.&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;Nielsen, M. (2009). Diana Efesia Multimammia: The metamorphosis of a pagan goddess from the Renaissance to the age of Neo-Classicism. In Tobias Fischer-Hansen &amp; Birte Poulsen, eds. ''From Artemis to Diana: The Goddess of Man and Beast''. Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian approach was at variance with the tolerant syncretistic approach of pagans to gods who were not theirs.  A Christian inscription at Ephesus&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianizing the Roman Empire AD 100–400'' 1984, ch. III "Christianity as presented" p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests why so little remains at the site:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Destroying the delusive image of the demon Artemis, Demeas has erected this symbol of Truth, the God that drives away idols, and the Cross of priests, deathless and victorious sign of Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The assertion that the Ephesians thought that their cult image had fallen from the sky, though it was a familiar origin-myth at other sites, is only known at Ephesus from Acts 19:35:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lynn LiDonnici observes that modern scholars are likely to be more concerned with origins of the Lady of Ephesus and her iconology than her adherents were at any point in time, and are prone to creating a synthetic account of the Lady of Ephesus by drawing together documentation that ranges over more than a millennium in its origins, creating a falsified, unitary picture, as of an unchanging icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LiDonnici|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple of the Five Immortals''', formerly translated as the '''Temple of the Five Genii''',{{sfnp|Laurie|1866|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBRXAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA29 29]}} is a [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Taoist temple|temple]] in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], in [[China]]. It lies beside the junction of West Huifu Road and Liurong Rd.{{sfnp|''Rough Guide''|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FjqJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT622 622]}} It is usually open to tourists daily from 9–12 in the morning and from 1:30–5 in the afternoon.{{sfnp|''Time Out''|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mU31AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292 292]}}{{sfnp|''Rough Guide''|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FjqJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT622 622]}}

==Legend== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
The five immortals honored by the temple are first attested in a passage of the 983 ''[[Taiping Imperial Readings]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|太平|御|覽}}}}) explaining [[Guangzhou]]'s [[Guangzhou#Names|nickname]] "City of the Rams".&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; One of the [[etiological myth]]s given is that
&lt;blockquote&gt;At one time, [[Sun Hao]] made [[Teng Xiu]] a governor but, before reaching his prefecture, there were five [[Taoist immortal|immortals]] riding five colored sheep and bearing the [[Five Grains|five grains]] who came upon him and, after he received them, they left. Now the prefectural hall's beams bear the five immortals riding five colored sheep for good luck.{{refn|group=n|{{zh|吴孫皓時以滕脩為剌史，未至州，有五仙人騎五色羊負五榖來，迎而去。今州廳事梁上畫五仙人騎五色羊為瑞。{{refn|The ''[[Taiping Imperial Readings]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''太平御覽 [''Taiping Imperial Readings'']'' |date=983 }}. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing an earlier but unnamed "account of prefectures and states".}}}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The other story, credited to the ''Records of Guangzhou'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|廣州|記}}}}) of [[Pei Yuan]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|裴|淵}}}}), includes the rams and grain but omits the immortals and places the story in [[state of Chu|Chu]] during the [[Chinese chancellor|ministry]] of [[Gao Gu]].&lt;ref name=tom/&gt;

Later accounts of the [[Taoist immortal|immortals]]' [[Chinese folk religion|local cult]] made them [[culture hero]]es who introduced [[rice farming]] to [[Guangzhou]] around the time of its founding,{{sfn|''ACC''|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=n8FRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}{{sfnp|Glancey|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_leHhzKlI7kC&amp;pg=PA177 177]}} which occurred historically by the [[Qin Empire|Qin]] army under [[Zhao Tuo]] in 214&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. The immortals' clothes and the sheep were now both said to be in difference colors,{{sfn|''ACC''|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=n8FRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 82]}} connecting them with the [[Five Chinese Elements]]. The immortals continued to be worshipped as protectors of the yearly harvest.{{sfnp|''Time Out''|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mU31AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292 292]}} The five goats they rode to the area were said to have turned to stone when they left, forming the statues which gave Guangzhou its nickname "Goat City"{{sfnp|Glancey|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_leHhzKlI7kC&amp;pg=PA177 177]}} or "City of the Five Rams".

==History==
An abbey and shrine to the five immortals is first attested during the early [[Song dynasty|Song]] ({{circa|lk=no|11th}} century), with rulers making sacrifices and locals offering prayer to them.&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{citation |contribution=Guangzhou: City of Five Rams |title=Tom Mazanec |date=27 January 2015 |last=Mazanec |first=Tom |accessdate=17 July 2016 |contribution-url=http://tommazanec.com/blog/2015/01/27/guangzhou-city-of-five-rams/ |url=http://tommazanec.com }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The present temple was erected under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] in the 10th [[Chinese calendar|year]] of the [[Hongwu Era]],&lt;ref name=ctrav&gt;{{citation |contribution=Guangzhou Attractions: Wu Xian Guan |title=China Travel |date=3 May 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; either {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;1377{{sfnp|''Time Out''|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mU31AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292 292]}} or 1378.{{sfnp|Glancey|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_leHhzKlI7kC&amp;pg=PA177 177]}}  Under the Qing, the site was also known as the '''{{nowrap|Grotto of the Five Immortals}}'''.

Shortly after the installation of the temple's {{convert|3|m|adj=on|0|sp=us}} high, 5-[[ton]] bell in 1378, there was an outbreak of [[black plague|plague]] in the city. Considered unlucky ever afterward, the "Forbidden Bell" has not been rung since.{{sfnp|''Rough Guide''|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FjqJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT622 622]}} In the 19th century, the [[Chinese guardian lions|guardian lions]] at the entrance to the temple were venerated by local women [[sexism|seeking male children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Etudes Chinoise |volume=Vol. 13 |date=1994 |p=129 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original temple on Great Market Street burnt down in 1878. It was rebuilt in 1889, with its main hall honoring [[Shangdi]] and side areas devoted to the five immortals.{{sfnp|Stevens|1997|p=155}} 

In 1923, the temple grounds covered {{convert|4600|sqm|sp=us|abbr=on}}; that year, the [[KMT]] lords of the town ordered it to be sold to raise revenue for their soldiers. It was purchased by a local club, who dismissed its Taoist priests, but its site was given special protection by the municipal government.&lt;ref name=ctrav/&gt; Following the [[opening up policy|opening up]] of China in the 1980s, the temple was renovated.{{sfnp|''Insider's Guide''|1994|p=70}}

[[Image:Theosophist.jpg|thumb|August 1931 edition depicting original cover from 1879|right]]
'''''The Theosophist''''' is the monthly journal of the international Theosophical Society based in Adyar, India. It was founded in [[India]] in 1879 by [[Helena Blavatsky]],&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theosophist archives|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=theosophist|work=UPenn Library|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also its editor. The journal is still being published till date. For the year 1930, the journal was published in Hollywood, California by Annie Besant and Marie Russak Hotchener, but it returned to Adyar in 1931.&lt;ref name=upenn/&gt; The journal features articles about [[philosophy]], [[art]], [[literature]] and [[occultism]].

== The Theosophical Society ==
The Theosophical Society was officially formed in [[New York City]], United States, on 17 November 1875 by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], [[Colonel Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]], and others. The society's initial objective was the "study and elucidation of [[Occultism]], the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Cabala]] etc."&lt;ref&gt;See photographic reproduction of the "Notes of meeting proposing the formation of the Theosophical Society, New York City, 8 September 1875" on this page. [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/St-1ata.jpg File:St-1ata.jpg.] Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/ref&gt;

It established its roots in India in 1879, winning its supporters by its portrayal of sympathy for the native population, by its enthusiasm for the Aryan philosophy, and by its strange dogmas and obscure beliefs. The main objectives of the society were to establish British India as a center of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, to study the Aryan culture and to explore the hidden mysteries and inherent powers in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of the Theosophical Society|last=Ransom|first=Josephine|publisher=Theosophical Pub House|year=1992|isbn=8170591228|location=|pages=150–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Australian-theosophist-leadbeater.jpg|thumb|The widespread influence of ''The Theosophist'' extended to many parts of the world.]]
The first centre was established in Bombay, but the society soon installed a network of branches throughout India, and its journal, ''The Theosophist'', was circulated extensively throughout the three Presidencies.

== History ==
Due to its widespread circulation, ''The Theosophist'' has been heavily linked with the politics of British India. Despite not explicitly stating any political agendas as of yet, it has been associated with the formation of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;''Theosophist'', IV, no.8 (44) (May 1883), 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the later account of Annie Besant, it was discovered that the decision to convene the first Congress in Madras was taken on the recommendation of the Theosophical Society after its convention of December 1884.&lt;ref&gt;A. Besant, ''How India Wrought for Freedom'' (Adyar, 1915), pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the periodical publications of the journal has been identified as an encouragement for many of the Indian leaders to experiment by forming an Indian political congress.

Until 1909, ''The Theosophist'' was printed by Messrs. Thompson &amp; Co., Printers, in Madras (now Chennai). The journey between headquarters in Adyar and the printer in Madras was troublesome as it involved a jolting carriage ride that could take an hour each way. Colonel Olcott wished to have a printing company at Adyar for the journal and other publications, but that did not occur until 1909, when the Vasanṭā Press was established under the presidency of Annie Besant. Hand-powered equipment was used for printing initially. In October 1911, a larger type was introduced for improved legibility. The number of copies printed grew from 400&lt;ref&gt;Mary K. Neff, "The Hidden Side of The Theosophist," ''The Theosophist'' 51:1 (October, 1929), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; in the first issue to 800 in 1909 and 4000 two years later.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Sitarama Shastri, "'The Theosophist' in the Vasanṭā Press," ''The Theosophist'' 51:1 (October, 1929), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, President George S. Arundale reshaped the journal into being more of a magazine for a general readership. He appointed an American Editorial Committee that was associated with the Editorial Board at Adyar. The three members were Fritz Kunz, Professor H. Douglas Wild, and Claude Bragdon. The announcement stated:

"Beginning with January, 1936, The Theosophist will be edited as far as possible in the interest of the general public, publishing articles which will relate religion, science, philosophy, psychology, politics, industry, etc., to the science of Theosophy in a manner calculated to arouse the interest of the public. The Theosophical World, an enlargement of Adyar News, will keep members in touch with the Society's special affairs and growth.

The American Editorial Committee has been requested to cooperate in the publication of The Theosophist through personal contributions, through gathering contributions from other qualified writers, and also, if possible, by making arrangements for advertisements."&lt;ref&gt;"American Editorial Committee," ''The American Theosophist'' 24.3 (March, 1936), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Three Pillars of Sikhism''' were formalised by [[Guru Nanak]] Dev Ji as: 

#The Guru led the Sikhs directly to practise [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]] and [[Naam Japo]]—meditation on God and reciting and chanting of God’s Name—[[Waheguru]]. The Sikh is to recite the [[Nitnem]] [[Gurbani|banis]] daily in remembrance of the grace and [[kirpa]] of the Almighty. 
#He asked the Sikhs to live as householders and practise [[Kirat Karo]]: to honestly earn, with hard work, by one's physical and mental effort, while accepting God's gifts and blessing. One is to speak the truth at all times and only fear God. Live a life of decency, high moral values and spirituality. 
#The Sikhs were asked to share their wealth within the community by practising [[Vaṇḍ Chakkō]]—“Share and Consume together”. The community or [[Sadh Sangat]] is an important part of [[Sikhism]]. One must be part of a community that is pursuing the values set out by the [[Sikh Gurus]] and every Sikh has to give in whatever way possible to the community. This spirit of '''Giving''' is an important message from [[Guru Nanak]].

The Sikh Emblem, or the Khanda, is made up of three items, each representing different things. The circle, of Chakkar, represents the infiniteness of the timeless absolute and also reminds Sikhs to stay within the rule of God. The double edged sword represents the only God and the supreme truth. The two swords, the two Kirpaans, crossing each other, one represents PEERI (spiritual authority) and the other of MEERI (political or temporal power).</text>

A '''''tunjo''''' (from [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]]: ''chunso'')&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/chunso ''chunso''] - Muysccubun Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is a small [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorh]] or [[zoomorphism|zoomorph]] figure elaborated by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] as part of their [[Muisca art|art]]. ''Tunjos'' were made of gold or ''[[tumbaga]]''; a [[gold]]-[[silver]]-[[copper]] [[alloy]]. The Muisca used their ''tunjos'' in various instances in their religion and the small [[votive offering]] figures have been found in various places on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], [[Colombia]]. ''Tunjos'' were used as offer pieces, to communicate with the gods and when the Muisca asked for favours from their deities.&lt;ref name=Arteenlared&gt;{{es}} [http://www.arteenlared.com/latinoamerica/colombia/historias-de-ofrendas-de-oro-muiscas.html ''Tunjos'' on Arte en la red]&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholar]] [[Pedro Simón]] wrote about the ''tunjos'' of the Muisca.&lt;ref name=Arteenlared/&gt;

== Background ==
The Muisca, organised in their loose [[Muisca Confederation]], exhibited one of the four advanced civilizations of the [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Aztec]], the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] were famous for their grand architecture with temples, pyramids and cities, the Muisca lived in simple wooden and reed ''bohíos''. The main skill of the Muisca was their [[Muisca economy#Goldworking|goldworking]]. The Muisca made pectoral pieces, nose rings (''narigueras''), earrings, plates, ''[[poporo]]s'' and other figures from the gold they traded with the surrounding [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous groups]], such as the [[Muzo people|Muzo]], [[Panche people|Panche]], [[Guane people|Guane]], [[Pijao people|Pijao]] and others. One of the most common finds of these gold or ''tumbaga'' figures are the ''tunjos''.&lt;ref name=Pueblos&gt;{{es}} [http://www.pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/arte.html ''Tunjos'' and other Muisca art] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Tunjos were small figures picturing people, the deities of the [[Muisca religion]] or animals. They were used for three purposes; as ornaments in the graves of the Muisca people, from various social classes, as decoration at the entrances of temples and shrines, which once filled were buried in secret places by the Muisca priests and as offer ritual figures in the sacred lakes and rivers of the Muisca.&lt;ref name=Museo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/meaneg/meaneg8.htm Description and metallurgy of ''tunjos''] - [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] - [[Bogotá]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tunjos'' have been uncovered in [[Lake Guatavita]], Bosa River; the part of the [[Bogotá River]] west of the [[Bogotá]] neighbourhood [[Bosa (Bogotá)|Bosa]], and in various other sacred sites of the Muisca. ''Tunjos'' have been found in caves too.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://artesanias-colombia.blogspot.com.co/2008/02/los-tunjos-muiscas.html ''Tunjos'' found in caves and other places]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a farmer found three ''tunjos'' in [[Carmen de Carupa]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].&lt;ref name=Arteenlared/&gt; Exactly the same figures have been found up to the [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]] in the south of Colombia.&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; The Pijao also made ''tunjos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.colombia.com/colombia-info/folclor-y-tradiciones/leyendas/el-tunjo/ ''Tunjo'' of the Pijao people]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fabrication ===
The Muisca used to make matrixes or moulds of rock types such as [[shale]]s and [[obsidian]] and poured their molten gold or ''tumbaga'' into the matrix. When the metals were cooled and solidified, they removed the stone moulds and the ''tunjos'' remained.&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; To create the 2D ''tunjos'', they used a [[lost-wax casting]] process using [[beeswax]] to make the figure, put the wax ''tunjo'' in clay, that was heated to evaporate the wax and the gold or ''tumbaga'' was poured into the empty space left.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the majority of tunjos appears to have gold wire soldered or brazed onto their surface. This, however, is not the case and analysis of the dendrites formed in the metal has shown that they have in fact been cast as one piece.

==== Alloys ====
Various ''tunjos'' have been analysed with [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF) giving the following results:&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poster at the Museo del Oro, Bogotá&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union of Italian Jewish Communities''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Unione delle comunità ebraiche italiane'', '''UCEI''') is a national association that represents over twenty Jewish community associations in [[Italy]]. It was founded in 1911 as the ''Comitato delle università israelitiche'', which became the ''Consorzio delle comunità israelitiche italiane'' in 1920 and the ''Unione delle comunità israelitiche italiane'' in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Fubini, ''La condizione giuridica dell’ebraismo italiano: dal periodo napoleonico alla Repubblica'' (Turin: Rosemberg &amp; Sellier, 1998); see also [http://www.cdec.it/home2_2.asp?idtesto1=903&amp;idtesto=941&amp;son=1&amp;level=2 CDEC].&lt;/ref&gt; The current name was adopted in 1987.&lt;ref name="Ministero Dell'Interno - Unione delle Comunità Ebraiche Italiane"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interno.gov.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/temi/religioni/Unione_delle_Comunitx_Ebraiche_Italiane_-_enti_dotati_di_personalitx_giuridica.html|title=Ministero Dell'Interno - Unione delle Comunità Ebraiche Italiane|work=[[Ministry of Interior (Italy)]]|language=Italian|publisher=[[Government of Italy]]|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vaishnava Padavali''' ({{lang-bn|বৈষ্ণব পদাবলী}}) movement refers to a period in
[[medieval Bengali literature]] from the 15th to 17th centuries, marked by an efflorescence of [[Vaishnava]] poetry often focusing on the [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]] legend.  The term ''padavali'' (also written '''padaabali''') has the literal meaning "gathering of songs" (''[[pada (foot)|pada]]''=short verse, lyric; ''+vali'' = plural; collection).

The padavali poetry reflects an earthy view of divine love which had its roots in the ''Agam''
poetry of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Sangam literature]] (600 BC–300 AD) and spread into early medieval [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ([[Nannaya]], [[Annamayya]]) and [[Kannada]] literatures ([[Dasa sahitya]]).  The poetic themes spread rapidly as part of the religious [[Bhakti movement]] that proposed an intensely personal form of devotion, following the philosophy of [[Ramanuja]] and opposing [[caste]] distinctions and other [[brahmin]]istic measures implicit in the theism of [[Adi Shankaracharya]].  The movement spread out and attained a pan-India status during the 13th–17th centuries.

The accompanying literary movements were marked by a shift from the classical language of [[Sanskrit]], to the local languages ([[apabhramsha]]) or derivatives, e.g. the literary language of [[brajabuli]] adopted by [[Vidyapati]] (14th century).

==History==
Vidyapati in Mithila (14th century) and [[Chandidas]] (late 14th century) in [[Birbhum]].  Chandidas was among the earliest poets in the nascent [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language, and many of his poems deal with the Radha-Krishna theme.

In 1474, [[Maladhar Basu]] translated the 10th and 11th cantos of the [[Sanskrit]] [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] (composed c. 9th century), into the Bengali poem ''SriKrsnaVijay''.  Maladhar focused on Krishna's divine life, with the 10th canto relating the legends of Krishna as a child, and his Leela with the Gopis in [[Vrindavana]].  He was honoured by [[Rukunuddin Barbak Shah]] with the title ''Gunaraj Khan''.

Although neither Chandidas nor Maladhar Basu were Vaishnavas,&lt;ref name=bp/&gt; they were to lay the foundation for much of the following Vaishnava poetry in Bengal.

===Vaishnavism in Bengal===

Vaishnavism in Bengal was given a tremendous boost by [[Sri Chaitanya]] (1486–1533), whose intense spiritualism infected many and started a movement across many regions of India.  Chaitanya emphasized the role of merely uttering God's name in obtaining emancipation, and songs, sung passionately and leading to a trance-like state, were central to the path of bhakti.  Chaitanya himself wrote many (source - ? gaudiya-vaishnavas say, that Chaitanya left only one song: Shikshashtaka) songs on the Radha-Krishna theme, and certainly encouraged the composition of new songs.

Major poets in the ensuing padavali tradition included [[Murari Gupta]] (''srikriShNachaitanyacharitrAmr^ta''), Narahari Sarkar, Basudev Ghosh, Lochandas, Jnanadas, [[Govindadas]], Balaram Das, [[Syed Sultan]] and [[Dwija Chandidas]] (16th century). The 17th century saw the work of [[Kaviranjan]] (''chhoto Vidyapati''), Kavishekhar, Radhaballabh Das, Ghanashyam Das and Ramgopal Das; and were followed in the 18th century by Vaisnavadas, Chandrashekhar, Radhamohan Thakur (''padAmr^tasamudra''), Narahari Chakravarty (''gItachandroday''), Yadunandan and others.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Wakil |year=2012 |chapter=Vaisnava Literature |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Vaisnava_Literature |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the original texts are lost (some may never have been composed, as the songs came down in the [[kirtan]] tradition).  The later anthology ''pAdakalpataru'' collects about 3000 Vaishnava lyrics by 150 poets.

==Poetry and theme==

The subject matter of the poetry is the love of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], on the banks of the [[Yamuna]] in Vrindavana; their secret trysts in the forests, Krishna's charms including his magic flute, the love of the [[gopi]]s for Krishna, Radha's [[viraha]] on being separated from Krishna and her anguish on seeing him sporting with the other gopis.  Much of the poetry, though written by men, focuses on the feelings of a woman in love. Here is a poem from [[Chandidas]], where Radha is talking to a friend:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
How can I describe his relentless flute,
which pulls virtuous women from their homes
and drags them by their hair to Shyam
as thirst and hunger pull the doe to the snare?
Chaste ladies forget their wisdom,
and clinging vines shakes loose from their trees,
hearing that music.
Then how shall a simple dairymaid withstands its call?

Chandidasa says, Kala the puppet master leads the dance.
– trans. Edward C Dimock and [[Denise Levertov]], ''In praise of Krishna'', p.&amp;nbsp;18 &lt;ref&gt;Dimock, Edward C. (trans.); Denise Levertov; In Praise of Krishna: Songs from the Bengali, 1967.  Read the whole poem (and other excerpts): [http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/~amit/books/dimock-1967-in-praise-of.html book excerptise]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Many of the poets were influenced by the [[Maithili language|Maithili]] poet Vidyapati, and some, such as Govindadas, also composed in the [[brajabuli]] language.

===Music===
Vaishnava music was extremely influential in the evolution of Indian musical tradition. In the 14th century, [[Amir Khusro]], who spent some time in the court at [[Bengal]], was exposed to the Vaishnavite tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[ITC Sangeet Research Academy]], [http://www.itcsra.org/sra_hcm/sra_hcm_chrono/sra_hcm_chrono_1200ad.html Hindustani Classical music: Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise of [[Vrindavana]] 14th century onwards, there was an admixture of the strains of devotional music from different regions of India.  Followers of [[Vallabhacharya]] of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and [[Nimbarkacharya]] of [[Maharashtra]] rubbed shoulders with Vaishnava composers from Bengal and Bihar.  Eminent musicians such as [[Swami Haridas]] (16th century), reputedly the teacher of [[Tansen]], lived here.

The songs are often set to a romantic [[raga]] such as [[Pilu]] or [[Desh (raga)|Desh]], and borrow freely from folk tunes and other traditions.

This musical tradition continues to be popular in [[Bengal]] with the [[Baul]]s and other [[kirtan]]iya groups, who include [[Sufi]] Muslims among their practitioners.

===Literary influence===

Vaishnava padavali left a lasting mark on [[Bengali literature]]. Among others, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was deeply impressed by this music, and wrote many Vaishnava and Baul pieces.  His opera ''Bhanusingher Padavali'' was composed in the Brajabuli language of Vidyapati.&lt;ref&gt;Tagore, Rabindranath; Tony K. Stewart, Chase Twichell (tr.);

'''Xuanwu''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|玄武}}}} "Dark Warrior" or "Mysterious Warrior") or '''Xuandi''' (玄帝 "Dark Deity"), also known as '''Zhenwu''' (真武) or '''Zhenwudadi''' (真武大帝 "True Warrior Great Deity"), is a [[deity]] in [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]], one of the higher-ranking deities in [[Taoism]]. He is revered as a powerful god, able to control the elements and capable of great magic. He is identified as the god of the north ''[[Heidi (god)|Heidi]]'' (黑帝 "Black Deity") and is particularly revered by [[martial arts|martial artists]]. He is the patron god of [[Hebei]], [[Henan]], [[Manchuria]] and [[Mongolia]]. As some [[Han Chinese]] (now the modern-day [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Speakers of Min Chinese|Fujianese]] peoples) migrated into the south from Hebei and Henan during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]-[[Song dynasty|Song]] era, Xuanwu is also widely revered in the [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]] and [[Fujian]] provinces, as well as among the [[Chinese emigration|overseas diaspora]].

Since the usurping [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] claimed the help of Xuanwu during his successful [[Jingnan Campaign]] against his nephew, he had Taoist monasteries constructed in the [[Wudang Mountains]] of [[Hubei]], where Xuanwu allegedly attained immortality.

==Stories==
[[File:Xuanwu, God of the North, Ming dynasty.jpg|thumb|A painting of Xuanwu, Ming dynasty, housed in the Freer Gallery of Art]]
===The original story===
One story says that Xuanwu was originally a prince of Jing Le State in northern Hebei during the time of the [[Yellow Emperor]].  As he grew up, he felt the sorrow and pain of the life of ordinary people and wanted to retire to a remote mountain for cultivation of the [[Tao]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Qing Dynasty version===
Another says that Xuanwu was originally a butcher who had killed many animals unremorsefully. As days passed, he felt remorse for his sins and repented immediately by giving up butchery and retired to a remote mountain for cultivation of the Tao.

One day while he was assisting a woman in labor, while cleaning the woman’s blood stained clothes along a river, the words "Dark (or Mysterious) Heavenly Highest Deity" (玄天上帝 ''Xuántiān Shàngdì'') appeared before him. The woman in labor turned out to be a manifestation of the goddess [[Guanyin]]. To redeem his sins, he dug out his own stomach and intestines and washed them in the river. The river then became dark and murky. After a while, the river flowed clear and pure once again.

Unfortunately, Xuanwu lost his stomach and intestines while he was washing them in the river. The [[Jade Emperor]] was moved by his sincerity and determination to clear his sins. The Jade Emperor made him an immortal with the title of ''Xuántiān Shàngdì''.
[[File:玄天上帝塑像.jpg|thumb|The Statue of Zhenwu or Xuantian, by Zheng, Yong Tai ([[Penghu]])]]
After he became an immortal, his stomach and intestines absorbed the essence of the earth. His viscera transformed into a demonic turtle, and a demonic snake, who started to hurt people. No one could subdue the demonic animals. Eventually, Xuanwu returned to earth to subdue them. After defeating them, he later used them as his means of transportation.

===Generals Wan Gong and Wan Ma===
[[File:Yangzhou - Zhenwu Hall - P1070194.JPG|thumb|Zhenwu (Xuanwu) with the two generals, and the Snake and Tortoise figures at his feet, at the Wudang Temple of [[Yangzhou]].]]
Xuanwu is sometimes portrayed with two generals standing besides him, General Wan Gong (萬公) and General Wan Ma (萬媽). The two generals are deities that handle many local issues from children's birth, medication, family matters as well as [[fengshui]] consultation.

==Cult==
[[File:武当山玄帝殿.JPG|thumb|Temple of the Dark Deity (玄帝殿) at the [[Wudang Mountains]].]]
===Depiction===
Xuanwu is portrayed as a warrior in dark-coloured imperial robes, his left hand holding the "three mountain seal", somewhat similar to [[Guan Yu]]'s hand seal, while his right hand is holding a sword, which is said to have belonged to [[Lü Dongbin]], one of the [[Eight Immortals]].

Another legend says that he borrowed the sword from Lü Dongbin to subdue a strong demon, and after being successful, he refused to bring it back after witnessing the sword's power. The sword itself would magically return to its owner if Xuanwu released it, so it is said that he always holds his sword tightly and is unable to release it. However, not only does he outrank Lü in terms of divinity, Xuanwu also dates back longer in history than Lü Dongbin, putting this claim in suspect.

He is usually seated on a throne with the right foot stepping on the snake and left leg extended stepping on the turtle. His face is usually red with bulging eyes. His birthday is celebrated on the third day of the third lunar month.

===Cult in Indonesia===
In Indonesia, almost every [[Taoism|Taoist]] temples provides an altar for Xuantian Shangdi. The story states that the first temple that worshiped him was a temple at Welahan Town, Jepara, [[Central Java]]. And the temples that was built in honor of him are the temple at Gerajen and Bugangan, Semarang City, [[Central Java]]. His festival is celebrated annually every the 25th day, 2nd month, of Chinese calendar. The worshipers of [[Chen Fu Zhen Ren]], especially at [[Tik Liong Tian Temple]], Rogojampi, [[Banyuwangi Regency]], [[East Java]], believe that Xuantian Shangdi is their patron deity. That's why they put his altar at the right side of Chen Fu Zhen Ren’s altar, in the middle room of the temple which is always reserved for the main deity.

==Popular culture==
* In the classic novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', Xuanwu was a king of the north who had two generals serving under him, [[Black Tortoise|a "Tortoise General" and a "Snake General"]]. This king had a temple at [[Wudang Mountains]] in [[Hubei]], thus there is a Tortoise Mountain and a Snake Mountain on the opposite sides of a river in [[Wuhan]], the capital of Hubei.
* In recent times, Xuanwu is a central character in the popular urban fantasy series' by [[Kylie Chan]]: The ''Dark Heavens'' Trilogy and the ''Journey to Wudang'' Trilogy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6230">{{nihongo|'''Yoshida Shintō'''|吉田神道||}} also frequently referred to as {{nihongo|'''Yuiitsu Shint&amp;#333;'''|唯一神道|"One-and-only Shintō"|}} was a prominent sect of [[Shintō]] that arose during the [[Sengoku period]] through the teachings and work of [[Yoshida Kanetomo]].  The sect was originally an effort to organize Shintō teachings into a coherent structure in order to assert its authority vis-a-vis Buddhism.  However, by the [[Edo period]], Yoshida Shintō continued to dominate the Shintō discourse, and influenced [[Neo-Confucian]] thinkers such as [[Hayashi Razan]] and [[Yamazaki Ansai]] in formulating a Neo-Confucian Shinto doctrine ({{nihongo|''shinju shūgō''|神儒習合|"Shintō・Confucian syncretism"|}}).  Yoshida Shinto's dominance rivaled that of [[Ise Shintō]].

== Doctrine ==

Yoshida Shintō reversed the ''[[honji suijaku]]'' teaching of Shin-Butsu Shuugo promulgated by Kukai in the Heian Period, asserting that the Buddhist deities were manifestations of the Shintō kami, not the other way around. Yoshida Shinto held that Shintō was the primal religion of the world, which in turn gave rise to [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]].  However, Shintō was seen not only as the source of creation, but also as the source of all principle in the world. In this sense, Shinto was seen as a divine essence or energy rather than a teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This essence was seen as present in all beings at birth, but obscured petty desires and needs, which prevented Man from aligning himself with the Way of the Gods.

Among the ethic "principles" in Yoshida Shintō {{nihongo|''shōjō''|清浄|"purity"}} and {{nihongo|''makoto''|誠|"sincerity"}} took on a great meaning within the sect. These key virtues were linked to well-known Shintō rites as [[harae]] or [[misogi]] purification ceremonies. Yoshida Shinto redefined and redesigned such traditional rites in a fashion borrowed from [[Esoteric Buddhism]]. Also, its doctrines are formulated in the elliptical discourse of Esoteric Buddhism, which makes sense only in combination with ritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid 2000, pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Rites took on significance not just as an outward form of purity, but as means to achieve inner purity as well and cultivating the necessary virtues towards makoto. These concepts may be related to Buddhist salvation but in contrast to Buddhism, Yoshida Shinto rejected celibacy and the idea that human life always leads to suffering. There is no clear conception of the afterlife, however.

Yoshida Shintō was an esoteric tradition also in terms of priestly organisation in that it consisted of several ranks achieved through secret initiations, with the highest rank accorded to only one man at a time, who would carry on the Yoshida family name. In cases where a suitable heir was lacking, one was adopted.

== History ==

In spite of their alleged antiquity, Yoshida doctrines were created by [[Yoshida Kanetomo]] (1435–1511) who served the Imperial Court in the Department of Shintō Affairs. Yoshida Shinto gained prominence during the [[Momoyama period]], when the family was involved in the [[Imperial cult|deification]] of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and enhanced its influence during the [[Edo period]] under [[Yoshikawa Koretaru]] (1616–94), a Yoshida scion (but not a family member) with excellent contacts to the ruling elites in [[Edo]]. Koretaru was probably the driving force behind the fact that the Yoshida were decreed the de facto supervisors of all lesser Shinto shrines in the official "Regulations for Shrine priests" (''Shosha negi kannushi hatto'' 諸社禰宜神主法度) of 1665. Later, however, Koretaru created his own version of Shintō (Yoshikawa Shintō) with an emphasis on self-reflection and the nature of the Kami to Man, as well as Man's role in society (with an emphasis on the lord-vassal relationship common during this period).&lt;ref&gt;Scheid 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Neo-Confucian scholars in Japan such as Hayashi Razan and Yamazaki Ansai likely encountered Yoshida Shintō during their time as Buddhist priests, when guest lectures by Yoshida Shintō priests were common.  However, later when Neo-Confucian teachings gained prominence, these thinkers formulated their own theories and doctrines on the relationship between Confucianism and Shintō and criticized Yoshida Shintō for being influenced by Buddhism. Nevertheless, Yoshida vocabulary and Yoshida ideas can still be found in their writings.  This trend persisted until the rise of [[kokugaku|National Learning]] which sought to separate Shintō from both Buddhism and Confucianism and thus developed a completely new discourse on the native ''kami''.&lt;ref&gt;Nosco 1996, pp. 170–173&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of institutional history, Yoshida Shintō was dominant until the late Edo period but decreased rapidly during the 19th century and has left hardly any trace in contemporary Japanese  shrine worship. The Yoshida family's collection of ancient texts, however, still forms one of the most important sources of Shinto. Large parts of it are now stored in the library of [[Tenri University]] in [[Nara Prefecture]].
