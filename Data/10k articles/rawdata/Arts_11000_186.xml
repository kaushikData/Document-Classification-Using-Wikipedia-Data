[[Image:Peones.gif|frame|An example of a rendered [[animation]]]]
'''Rendering''' in [[visual art]] and [[technical drawing]] means the process of formulating,  adding [[color]], [[shading]], and [[texture (visual arts)|texturing]] of an image. It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with [[illustrating]]. However, it may be used for mere [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] of existing [[data]] regardless of any preconceived message or idea to express. Rendering is also a technique that can be used while designing packaging and branding. 

The alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as [[photography]] or [[image scanning]]. Both rendered and captured images can be [[Mixed_media|mixed]], [[image editing|edited]], or both.

==Rendering style==
'''Artistic rendering''' is the application of [[style (visual arts)|visual art style]]s to rendering. For [[photorealistic]] rendering styles, the emphasis is on accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive rendering styles, visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen [[art medium]] and level of [[abstraction]] in [[abstract art]].  In [[computer graphics]], interpretive rendering  styles are known as [[non-photorealistic rendering]] styles, but may be used to simplify [[technical illustration]]s. Rendering styles that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealistic]] rendering styles.

The '''[[Battersea]] Shield''' is one of the most significant pieces of ancient [[Celtic art]] found in Britain. It is a sheet [[bronze]] covering of a (now vanished) wooden [[shield]] decorated in [[La Tène style]]. The shield is on display in the [[British Museum]], and a replica is housed in the [[Museum of London]].

==History==
The Battersea Shield is currently dated by the museum to  c.350–50 BC, though later dates up to the early 1st century AD have previously been suggested.  A date in the later part of this range is usually preferred; [[Miranda Aldhouse-Green]] is typical in using "2nd-1st century BC".&lt;ref&gt;Green, 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; It was dredged from the bed of the River [[Thames]] in [[London]] in 1857, during excavations for the predecessor of [[Chelsea Bridge]]; in the same area  workers found large quantities of [[Roman military personal equipment|Roman]] and [[Celtic warfare|Celtic]] weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians to conclude that the area was the site of [[Julius Caesar]]'s crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasion of Britain]], although it is now thought that the shield was a votive offering, which probably predates the invasion.

==Description==
[[File:London - British Museum - 2453.jpg|thumb|Battersea Shield closeup]]
The Battersea Shield is made of several different pieces, held together by rivets concealed under the decorative elements. It is decorated with [[repoussé]] decoration, engraving, and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].  The decoration is in the typically [[Celt]]ic [[La Tène]] style, consisting of circles and spirals. There are 27 small round compartments in raised bronze with red [[cloisonné]] enamel; the bronze within the compartment forms a sort of [[swastika]], thought to have been associated with good luck and also "solar energy".&lt;ref&gt;Green, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Enamel was a Celtic speciality, and reflects the use of red Mediterranean [[coral]] inlays in other British Celtic artefacts, such as the [[Witham Shield]], and here may perhaps be considered as an imitation of imported coral, though the use of enamel allows a more elaborate design.  Some scholars have read a reversible human face into the decoration at the points where the smaller circles link to the larger one.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronze sheet is said by archaeologists to be too thin to have offered effective protection in combat, and shows no signs of battle damage.  It is therefore believed that the shield was cast into the river as a [[votive offering]], and made either as a "parade piece" or status symbol or specifically for votive offering. The metal plate of the shield that remains would have been fixed onto a plain, wooden or leather shield behind it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Bike Arc LLC''', located in downtown [[Palo Alto, California]], is a Silicon Valley startup that designs secure [[bicycle parking rack]]s and systems. It was founded by Joseph Bellomo and Jeff Selzer in 2008. Jeff Selzer sits on the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition&lt;ref&gt;http://bikesiliconvalley.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the General Manager of Palo Alto Bicycles. Joseph Bellomo, a [[California]]-licensed [[architect]], is the founder and owner of [[Joseph Bellomo Architects]], Inc. in Palo Alto, which he founded in 1986. In addition to collaborating on Bike Arc, Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer also worked together on the Palo Alto Bikestation at the [[Caltrain]] depot.

[[File:Umbrella Arc by Bike Arc in downtown Palo Alto, California..jpg|thumb|Umbrella Arc bicycle parking system/bike racks/bicycle storage by Bike Arc.]]

In 2009, the American Institute of Architects, California Council, gave Bike Arc the Honor Award for Small Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Honor Award for Small Projects|url=http://www.aiacc.org/2011/08/02/bike-arc/|publisher=AIACC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer—both being bicycle enthusiasts—set out to design bicycle-parking systems that don't touch and potentially damage bicycles, a solution that prevents bicycles from contacting each other, which can cause wear-and-tear.

== Products ==

Bike Arc is [[patented]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD604207}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the United States and in Europe (Office for Harmonization In the Internal Market), and the company offers multiple iterations of the same fundamental concept: a [[modular]] [[structure]] of [[steel]] arcs. The Bike Arc family includes the Rack Arc, the Half Arc, the Umbrella Arc, the Tube Arc, the Car Arc, the Bus Arc, the House Arc, and the Ad Arc.

All Bike Arc products are manufactured in the United States.

== Installations ==

The City of Palo Alto has purchased and installed multiple Bike Arc products, including numerous Rack Arcs, Half Arcs and Umbrella Arcs, and Bike Arcs are also in public spaces in Boston, Las Vegas, Redwood City, California, and Norfolk, Virginia. They have also been installed at the University of Buffalo and the University of Nebraska, as well as—among others—at Juniper Networks, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Inc., and the Seattle Repertory Theater.

==Controversy==
In 2005, parents of some students filed cases in the [[Bombay High Court]] accusing the school of practising [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].&lt;ref name="middayblock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dna" /&gt; Investigations by the [[Mumbai Police]] found no evidence for such claims, and a local representative of [[Trinity College London]] confirmed that the examination certificates received by the students were authentic.&lt;ref name="outlooksc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="middayblock"&gt;{{cite news |title=Music school investigations hit roadblock|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2005/apr/107182.htm|newspaper=Mid-Day|date=10 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police halted investigation awaiting evidence and witnesses for the allegations.&lt;ref name="middayblock" /&gt; Due to attacks by local mobs and fearing their safety, the school staff and researchers subsequently left their Thane premises.&lt;ref name="toiflee" /&gt;

In 2008, several staff members of the school proceeded to the [[Supreme Court of India]] with cases against individuals, government officials and High Court judges for shutting down the institution, defamation and "[[witch-hunt]]ing", an act they termed "[[genocide]]".&lt;ref name="outlooksc"&gt;{{cite news|title=SC orders inquiry into affairs of Boss School of Music|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=628740|newspaper=Outlook India|date=4 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325102521/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=628740|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dna" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Controversial Boss School women members produced in SC|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/158922/content/219141/secret-my-longevity.html|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court dismissed their cases, reportedly because it contained allegations against high-ranking officials, judges and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SC dismisses petition by Mumbai music school teachers|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=574818|newspaper=Outlook India|date=26 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325102437/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=574818|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court also arrested 4 of the staff members on grounds of contempt, after a staff member hurled a slipper at a Supreme Court judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman hurls slipper at judge|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090321/jsp/frontpage/story_10702272.jsp|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Contempt of court: 3-month jail for Boss School members|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/contempt-of-court-3month-jail-for-boss-school-members/531636/|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boss Music School members face contempt music, SC sends 4 to jail|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-22/india/28088817_1_boss-school-justice-kabir-criminal-contempt|newspaper=The Times of India|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court cases regarding the allegations were dismissed by the Supreme Court.

'''Licensing''' means renting or leasing of an [[intangible asset]]. It is a process of creating and managing [[contracts]] between the owner of a [[brand]] and a company or individual who wants to  use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a [[trademark]] or character onto products of a completely different nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Integrated Intellectual Asset Management|first= Steve|last= Manton|year=2005|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-566-08721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of intangible assets include a song ("Somewhere Over The Rainbow"), a character ([[Donald Duck]]), a name ([[Michael Jordan]]), or a brand (The [[Ritz-Carlton]]). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor).&lt;ref name="Brand Licensing Expert"&gt;[http://www.brandlicensingexpert.com BrandLicensingExpert.com Peter Canalichio, Licensing Brands, Inc. CEO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Brand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of [[patent]]s and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. [[Mickey Mouse]]'s popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.

This process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. [[McDonald's]] play food, [[Burger King]] T-shirts and even ghastly [[Good Humor]] Halloween costumes became commonplace. [[Brand extension]]s later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to ''rent'' the product of an established brand name. [[Armor All]] auto vacuums, [[Breyers]] yogurt, [[TGI Friday's]] frozen appetizers, and [[Lucite]] nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.

== Reasons for licensing ==
A company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for [[brand extensions]] or products. For example, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a [[licensee]] make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded "Earbud Headphones", "iPod docking stations" and "iPod socks." Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licensees.

Apart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their [[merchandise]], but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee’s products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps:

* Licensor chooses the product categories to be licensed   
* Licensor finds and negotiates a license with the best licensees   
* Licensees develop concepts, prototypes and final production samples and submit for approval   
* Licensor approves licensed products for sale   
* Licensees sell licensed products to authorized retailers&lt;ref name="Marketing Professors"&gt;[http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/971/pete-canalichio MarketingProfessors.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. [[Royalties]] are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.&lt;ref name="Atlanta Business Radio"&gt;[http://atlantabusinessradio.businessradiox.com/atlanta-business-radio-interviews-swine-flu-expert-dr-elaina-george-brand-licensing-expert-pete-canalichio-and-batteries-plus-owner-john-cyphers/ Atlanta Business Radio Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global brand licensing industry ==

The main international [[professional association]] for brand licensing is the [[Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association]], which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo.

The Society of Product Licensors Committed to Excellence  (SPLiCE) is a Licensors Community of Practice with the vision to continuously improve brand licensing. The mission of SPLiCE is to act as a community of licensors who share best practices for protecting, promoting and enhancing brand integrity. The SPLiCE Licensors Workshop acts as its annual board of directors and members' meeting. During SPLiCE Licensors Workshop, benchmark findings and industry trends are highlighted in feature panel presentations that are relevant to the community at large. They engage a creativity philosophy of divergence and convergence to sustain unique idea implementation on best practices. The vision for SPLiCE Licensors Workshop is to provide best in practice licensing education through sharing educational best practices through benchmarking initiatives, task force collaborations, committee reports, and guest industry speakers

Each May, ''License! Global'' magazine publishes an annual list of "The Top 150 Global Licensors". For 2017, the leader was [[Disney Consumer Products]] with $53 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise, followed by [[Meredith Corp.]] with $23.2 Billion and [[PVH (company)|PVH]] with $18 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Top 150 Global Licensors|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association (LIMA), global licensed merchandise sales was $272.2 billion in 2016, versus $262.2 billion in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Michael |last2=Ames |first2=Allison |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-viewpoint/licensing-expo-2017-8-trends-263-billion-industry/309209/ |title=8 Trends Ahead for the $263 Billion Licensing Industry |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=2017-06-01 |accessdate=2017-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brand licensing in India ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1992 brought a slew of international brands to India. Many of these brands have been licensed to Indian companies. [[Arvind_(company)| Arvind]] represent Arrow, Cherokee, ELLE, Nautica, USPA, AEROPOSTALE, CHILDRENS PLACE, Ed Hardy, GAP and Kipling. The [[Murjani Group]] is the licensee for Calvin Klein Jeans, FCUK and Tommy Hilfiger. Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) is licensed to Spencers Retail. 

Character Licensing is another big licensing segment of brand licensing in India. The big players in the character licensing industry in India are [[Disney India]], [[Viacom 18]] and [[Cartoon Network Enterprises]]. Characters licensed out by Disney India include [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. Viacom has brought in popular characters from [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] like [[Dora The Explorer]] and [[SpongeBob SquarePants]]. Cartoon Network boasts of a portfolio including characters such as [[Ben 10]], [[Powerpuff Girls]], [[Mr. Bean]], [[Roll no. 21]], [[We Bare Bears]].

== Brand licensing in Italy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
Brand Licensing in [[Italy]] started in the seventies with very few Licensing Agencies. Apart from Disney which had its own dedicated office in the market, all the other big Entertainment majors were represented by independent agencies. One of these companies named DIC 2 (Distribution International Characters), founded in 1973 by Gianfranco Mari contributed to create the licensing business in Italy and set big phenomena as [[He-Man]] and the Masters of the Universe, [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Hanna &amp; Barbera]] characters, [[Zorro]], [[Asterix]] and so on. DIC 2 is still one of the biggest independent agencies in Italy, representing different cartoon characters and famous brands.

==Plot==
Brothers Terry ([[Colin Farrell]]) and Ian ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who live in [[South London]], were raised by a weak father Brian ([[John Benfield]]) who runs a restaurant, and a strong mother Dorothy ([[Clare Higgins]]) who taught her sons to look up to their uncle Howard ([[Tom Wilkinson]]), a successful plastic surgeon and businessman.

The brothers buy a sailboat at an oddly low price, despite its near pristine condition. They name it ''Cassandra's Dream'', after a greyhound that won Terry the money to buy the boat. Knowing nothing of [[Greek mythology]], they are unaware of the ominous antecedents of this name—the ancient prophetess [[Cassandra]], whose prophecies of doom went unheeded by those around her.

While driving home from a day's sailing in a borrowed car, Ian crosses paths with beautiful actress Angela Stark ([[Hayley Atwell]]), with whom he becomes infatuated.

Terry has a [[gambling addiction]] that sinks him deeper in debt. Ian wishes to invest in hotels in [[California]] to finance a new life with Angela.  To overcome their financial issues, they ask Howard for help. He agrees to help them, but asks for a favor in return: they must murder someone for him. Howard faces imprisonment for unspecified crimes and his future is threatened by Martin Burns ([[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]]), a former business partner who plans to testify against him. Howard asks his nephews to get rid of Burns, and in return he will reward them financially. After initial reluctance, the brothers agree.

They make two [[Improvised firearm|zip guns]], untraceable and easily destroyed. Lying in wait in Burns' home, their plan is foiled when Burns arrives with a woman. Their resolve shaken, they leave and agree to commit the murder the next day.

The next day, they succeed in carrying out the murder and later destroy the guns. Ian is content to move on as if nothing happened, but Terry is consumed by guilt and begins abusing alcohol and other drugs. His behavior frightens his fiancée ([[Sally Hawkins]]), who tells Ian about the situation and that Terry believes he has killed someone. After Terry confides that he wants to turn himself in to the police, Ian goes to Howard for advice. They agree there is no alternative but to get rid of Terry. Ian plans to poison Terry during an outing on the boat. Ian can't bring himself to kill his own brother, and attacks him in a fit of rage. In the chaos, Terry knocks Ian down the steps into the cabin, killing him.

The boat is later discovered adrift by the police, and the audience learns that Terry snapped and drowned himself after killing his brother. The last shot is of ''Cassandra's Dream'', still in beautiful condition despite the tragedies it set in motion.

{{Main|Cassandra's Dream (album)}}
This is the first Woody Allen film since ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' to have an original score commissioned for it. The score was composed by [[Philip Glass]].

It was also his first film released with a stereo soundtrack. Allen previously eschewed stereo although often employing [[Dolby Stereo]] and [[Dolby Digital]] technologies to convey a higher quality [[Monophonic sound|mono]] soundtrack.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The film is stereo for its music only.

==Critical response==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score 46% based on reviews from 116 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cassandras_dream/|title=''Cassandra's Dream''|accessdate=January 21, 2008|publisher=Flixster|work=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[review aggregator|aggregator]] [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average rating score of 49 out of 100, based on 31 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/cassandrasdream|title=''Cassandra's Dream'' (2007): Reviews|accessdate=January 21, 2008|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manohla Dargis]] commended the film in her review for ''[[The New York Times]]''. Although offering criticism such as the film feeling "too lightly polished and often rushed, as if he had directed it with a stopwatch," she suggests that Allen's film "is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn't just stop making comedies once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Manohla |last=Dargis|authorlink=Manohla Dargis|title=Movie Review - Cassandra's Dream (2007)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/movies/18cass.html |date=January 18, 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] compared the film negatively to [[Sidney Lumet]]'s similarly themed ''[[Before the Devil Knows You're Dead]],'' adding: "The Lumet film uses actors who don't look like brothers but feel like brothers. Allen's actors look like brothers but don't really feel related." He rated the film two out of four stars, and noted that Allen's previous film ''[[Match Point]]'' presented the material more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Cassandra's Dream Movie Review (2008)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cassandras-dream-2008|date=January 17, 2008|work=The Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon Wise of [[Empire magazine|''Empire'' magazine]] concluded that ''Cassandra's Dream'' was "[a] clumsy, clichéd [[morality play]] that may actually represent the lowest point of Allen's recently chequered career." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?DVDID=117905|title=Reviews:Cassandra's Dream}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jordan (artist)|Paul Jordan]] also compared the film to a [[morality play]]—but considered that praise: "Allen gets past the guard of a modern audience which would not have taken seriously the appearance of a [[Mephistopheles]] or an [[Old Scratch]]. Uncle Howard is a chilling 21st Century [[Tempter]], fulfilling the heart's desire in return for murder and leading his nephews to terrible [[Hell in Christian beliefs|perdition]]."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jordan, "Persistent Myths," p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In his "Best of the Decade" article, ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' critic Richard Brody called ''Cassandra's Dream'' one of the best films of the 2000s: "Few aging directors so cogently and relentlessly depict the grimly destructive machinery of life, and every time the word 'family' is uttered, the screws tighten just a little more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=November 30, 2009|title=Best of the Decade|first=Richard|last=Brody|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2009/11/best-films-of-the-decade.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 film critics [[Robbie Collin]] and Tim Robey ranked it as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All 47 Woody Allen movies - ranked from worst to best|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/woody-allens-best-and-worst-movies/|accessdate=February 12, 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chantal Anne Akerman''' ({{IPA-fr|akɛʁman|lang}}; 6 June 1950{{spaced ndash}}5 October 2015) was a Belgian [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], [[artist]], and [[Film studies|film professor]] at the [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/arts/chantal-akerman-belgian-filmmaker-dies-65.html|title=Chantal Akerman, Whose Films Examined Women's Inner Lives, Dies at 65|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for her three hour [[magnum opus|''magnum opus'']] ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975), which was dubbed a "masterpiece" by ''[[The New York Times]]''. According to film scholar [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]], Akerman's influence on [[Feminism|feminist]] filmmaking and [[avant-garde]] cinema has been substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Foster |editor1-first=Gwendolyn Audrey |editor1-link=Gwendolyn Audrey Foster |date=2003 |title=Identity and Memory: The Films of Chantal Akerman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lULjtguX9HkC&amp;pg=PA204 |publisher=SIU Press |page=204 |isbn=978-0809325139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Akerman was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; She was the older sister of Sylviane Akerman, her only sibling. Her mother Natalia (Nelly) had survived years at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where her own parents had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Chantal Akerman obituary|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/chantal-akerman|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-10|first = Jonathan|last = Romney}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, Akerman and her mother were exceptionally close, and she encouraged her daughter to pursue a career rather than marry young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.thejc.com/arts/film/chantal-akerman-my-family-and-other-dark-materials| title = Chantal Akerman: My family and other dark materials| website = www.thejc.com| access-date = 2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At age 18, Akerman entered the [[INSAS (film school)|Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion]], a Belgian [[film school]].  Akerman dropped out during her first term to make the [[short film]] ''Saute ma ville''; she funded the film's costs by trading diamond shares on the [[Antwerp]] [[stock exchange]].&lt;ref name=criterion&gt;{{cite web |last1=Margulies |first1=Ivone |title=A Matter of Time: Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1215-a-matter-of-time-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles |website=The Criterion Collection |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Akerman had an extremely close relationship with her mother, captured in some of her films. In 1976 ''[[News From Home]]'', Akerman's mother's letters outlining mundane family activities serve as a soundtrack throughout the film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lebow|first1=Alisa|title=Identity Slips: The Autobiographical Register In The Work Of Chantal Akerman|journal=Film Quarterly|date=2016|volume=1|issue=70|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 ''[[No Home Movie]]'' centers on mother-daughter relationships, largely situated in the kitchen, and is a response to her mother's death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Jon|title=Every Home A Heartache: Chantal Akerman|journal=C: International Contemporary Art|date=2016|issue=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film explores issues of [[metempsychosis]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; the last shot of the film acting as a memento mori of the mother's apartment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Akerman acknowledged that her mother was at the center of her work and admitted to feeling directionless after her death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The maternal imagery can be found throughout all of Akerman's films, as an homage and an attempt to reconstitute the image and voice of the mother.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In ''Family In Brussels'', Akerman narrates the story, interchanging her own voice with her mother's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Work==

===Early work and influences===
Akerman claimed that, at the age of 15, after viewing [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' (1965), she decided, that same night, to become a filmmaker.  In 1971, Akerman's first short film, ''Saute ma ville'', premiered at the [[International Short Film Festival Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulies |first=Ivone |date=1996 |title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's hyperrealist everyday |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |page=2 |isbn=0-8223-1723-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, she moved to [[New York City]], where she remained until 1972.

At [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York, Akerman was impressed with the work of [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Michael Snow]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], and [[Andy Warhol]].

===Critical recognition===
Her first feature film, [[Hotel Monterey (film)|''Hotel Monterey'']] (1972), and subsequent short films, ''La Chambre 1'' and ''La Chambre 2'', reveal the influence of structural filmmaking through these films' usage of long takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman's films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with [[cinematographer]] [[Babette Mangolte]]. 

In 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and, in 1974, she received critical recognition for her feature ''[[Je Tu Il Elle|Je, Tu, Il, Elle]] (I, You, He, She)''. Feminist and queer film scholar [[B. Ruby Rich]] noted that ''Je Tu Il Elle'' can be seen as a "cinematic Rosetta Stone of [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]".

Akerman's most significant film, ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'', was released in 1975. Often considered one of the greatest examples of [[feminist]] filmmaking, the film makes a hypnotic, real-time study of a middle-aged widow's stifling routine of domestic chores and prostitution. Upon the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''Jeanne Dielman'' the "first masterpiece of the feminine in the history of the cinema". Chantal Akerman scholar Ivone Margulies says the picture is a filmic paradigm for uniting feminism and anti-illusionism.&lt;ref name="criterion"/&gt; The film was named the 19th greatest film of the 20th century by [[J. Hoberman]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, J. (2001) [4 January 2000]. "100 Best Films of the 20th Century: Village Voice Critics' Poll". The Village Voice (reprint ed.). Reprinted by AMC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===

Akerman has acknowledged that her cinematic approach can be explained, in part, through the writings of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Felix Guattari]].&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marguilles|first1=Ivonne|title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's Hyperrealist Everyday|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822317265|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] write about the concept of minor literature as being characterized by the following things:
*1. Minor literature is the literature that a [[minority group|minority]] makes in a major language; the language is effected by a strong co-efficient of [[deterritorialization]].
*2. Every individual matter is immediately plugged into political because minor literature exists in a narrow space.
*3. Everything has a collective value: what the solitary writer says already has collective value.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deleuze|first1=Gilles|last2=Guattari|first2=Félix|last3=Brinkley|first3=Robert|title=What Is A Minor Literature?|journal=Mississippi Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] claim that these characteristics describe the revolutionary conditions within the canon of literature.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"/&gt; Akerman has referenced [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] on how, in minor literature, the characters assume an immediate, nonhierarchical relation between small individual matters and economic, commercial, juridical, and political ones.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; While the filmmaker has an interest in multiple [[deterritorialization]]s, she also considers the feminist demand for the exercise of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], where a borderline status may be an undesirable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marguilles|first1=Ivonne|title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's Hyperrealist Everyday|date=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822317265|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===

Akerman has used the setting of a kitchen to explore the intersection between femininity and domesticity.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|title=The Director's Director: Chantal Akerman|publisher=New York Times|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kitchens in Akerman's work provide intimate spaces for connection and conversation and serve the function of a backdrop to the dramas of daily life.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; The kitchens, alongside other domestic spaces, act as self-confining prisons under patriarchal conditions.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; In Akerman's work, the kitchen acts as a domestic theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=Sultan|first2=Terrie|title=Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space|date=2008|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers|location=Bluffer Gallery, Art Museum of the University of Houston|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Akerman is often grouped within feminist and queer thinking, the filmmaker has articulated her distance from an essentialist feminism.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; Akerman resists labels relating to her identity like "female", "Jewish" and "lesbian", choosing instead to immerse herself in the identity of being a daughter; Akerman has stated that she sees film as a "generative field of freedom from the boundaries of identity".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The filmmaker has advocated for multiplicity of expression, explaining that "when people say there is a feminist film language, it is like saying there is only one way for women to express themselves".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; The filmmaker asserted that there are as many cinematic languages as there are individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

Writer and scholar Ivone Marguiles notes that Akerman's resistance to be categorized is in response to the rigidity of cinema's earlier essentialist realism and "indicates an awareness of the project of a transhistorical and transcultural feminist aesthetics of the cinema".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt;

Akerman works with the feminist motto of the personal being political, complicating it by an investigation of representational links between private and public.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; In Jeanne Dielman, Akerman's most well-known film, the main protagonist does not supply a transparent, accurate representation of a fixed social reality.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; Throughout the film, the housewife and prostitute Jeanne is revealed to be a construct, with multiple historical, social, and cinematic resonances.&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt; 

Akerman engages with realist representations, a form which is historically grounded to act as a feminist gesture and simultaneously as an "irritant" to fixed categories of "woman".&lt;ref name="Duke University Press"/&gt;

===Later career===
In 1991, Akerman was a member of the jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |work=berlinale.de |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, she joined the full-time faculty of the MFA Program in Media Arts Production at the [[City College of New York]] as a distinguished lecturer and the first Michael &amp; Irene Ross Visiting Professor of Film/Video &amp; Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chantal Akerman feature is tapped for New York Film Festival {{!}} The City College of New York |url=https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/chantal-akerman-ny_film-fesrtival |website=www.ccny.cuny.edu |date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Important solo exhibitions of Akerman's work have been held at the Museum for Contemporary Art, Antwerp, Belgium (2012), MIT, Cambridge Massachusetts (2008), the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel (2006); [[Princeton University Art Museum]], Princeton, NJ (2006); and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris (2003). Akerman has participated in [[Documenta]] XI (2002) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (2001). 

In 2011, a film retrospective of Akerman's work was shown at the Austrian Film Museum.&lt;ref name=gallery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/chantal-akerman/ |title=Chantal Akerman |website=Marian Goodman Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2015 Venice Biennale included an installation of interspersed parallel screens displaying the landscape-in-motion footage that would appear in "No Home Movie". 

In 2018, the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] presented her final video installation ''NOW'' (2015) in the exhibition ''Scenes from the Collection'', and acquired her work for the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/scenes-from-the-collection|title=Scenes from the Collection|website=The Jewish Museum|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematography==

Akerman's cinematography is characterized by the dryness of language, the lack of metaphorical associations, the composition in a series of discontinuous blocks, the interest in putting a poor, withered syntax and reduced vocabulary at the service of a new intensity.&lt;ref name="What Is A Minor Literature"/&gt; Many directors have cited Akerman's films as an influence on their work.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; [[Kelly Reichardt]], [[Gus Van Sant]], and [[Sofia Coppola]] have noted their exploration of filming in real time as a tribute to Akerman.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Terrie Sultan, art historian, claims that Akerman's "narrative is marked by an almost Proustian attention to detail and visual grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=Sultan|first2=Terrie|title=Chantal Akerman: Moving Through Time and Space|date=2008|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers|location=Bluffer Gallery, Art Museum of the University of Houston|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Akerman's visual language resists easy categorization and summarization: the filmmaker creates narrative through filmic syntax instead of plot development.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=David|first2=Catherine|last3=Michael|first3=Tarantino|title=Bordering On Fiction: Chantal Akerman's D'Est|date=1995|publisher=New York: Distribured Art Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Walker Art Center|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akerman was influenced by European art cinema, as well as structuralist film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Structuralist film used formalist experimentation to propose a reciprocal relationship between image and viewer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Akerman cites [[Michael Snow]] as a structuralist inspiration, especially his film Wavelength, which is composed of a single shot of a photograph of a sea on a loft wall, with the camera slowly zooming in.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Akerman was drawn to the perceived dullness of structuralism because it rejected the dominant cinema's concern for plot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; As a teenager in Brussels, Akerman skipped school in order to see movies, including films from the experimental festival in Knokke-le-Zoute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman addresses the voyeurism that is always present within cinematic discourse by often playing a character within her films, thus placing herself on both sides of the camera simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The filmmaker used the boredom of structuralism in order to generate a bodily feeling in the viewer, accentuating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman's filming style relies on capturing ordinary life. By encouraging viewers to have patience for a slower pace, her films emphasize the humanity of the everyday.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Kathy Halbreich states that the filmmaker "creates a cinema of waiting, of passages, of resolutions deferred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akerman|first1=Chantal|last2=David|first2=Catherine|last3=Michael|first3=Tarantino|title=Bordering On Fiction: Chantal Akerman's D'Est|date=1995|publisher=New York: Distribured Art Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Walker Art Center|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of Akerman's films portray the movement of people across distances or their absorption with claustrophobic spaces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Curator Jon Davies states that Akerman's domestic interiors "conceal gendered labour and violence, secrecy and shame, where traumas both large and small unfold with few, if any witnesses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Akerman died on 5 October 2015 in Paris; ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that she committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=monde&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2015/10/06/la-cineaste-chantal-akerman-est-morte_4783566_3476.html|author=Isabelle Regnier|title=La cinéaste Chantal Akerman est morte|publisher=''Le Monde''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 65.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|last2=Buckley|first2=Clara|title=Chantal Akerman, Pioneering Belgian Filmmaker, Dies at 65|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/arts/chantal-akerman-belgian-filmmaker-dies-65.html?_r=0|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=liberation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://next.liberation.fr/culture-next/2015/10/06/mort-de-la-cineaste-chantal-akerman_1398190|author=Julien Gester|title=Mort de la cinéaste Chantal Akerman|publisher=''Libération''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/06/chantal-akerman-pioneering-belgium-film-director-and-theorist-dies-aged-65|author=Catherine Shoard|title=Chantal Akerman, pioneering Belgian film director and theorist, dies aged 65|publisher=''Guardian''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last film was the documentary ''[[No Home Movie]]'', a series of conversations with her mother shortly before her mother's death; of the film, she said, "I think if I knew I was going to do this, I wouldn't have dared to do it."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Citation | last =Rapold | first =Nicolas | title =Chantal Akerman Takes Emotional Path in Film About 'Maman' | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =5 August 2015 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/arts/international/chantal-akerman-takes-emotional-path-in-film-about-maman.html | accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church of St. Nicholas''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva svetog Nikole}}) is a [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] style Roman Catholic church located in the field of Prehulje, one mile from [[Zadar]], between [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] and [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]]. It was built on the earthen pyramid mound on top of the [[Liburnians|Liburnian]] prehistoric tomb. The church is the only surviving example of early Romanesque architecture in all of [[Dalmatia]]. It was built at the beginning of the 12th century and is dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]].

==Description==
Church of St. Nicholas was built in form of a fortress. It has a [[Trefoil|trefoil plan]] with four branches arranged around a central circular core, three of which form the apse, and the fourth the input branch. Its dome-shaped vault is reinforced with circular-ribbed arches above which 8 small towers with battlement as a lookout were built in the 16th or 17th century during [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War]]. Flanges that are resting on pilasters that are abutting onto the pylons between the apses are placed under the dome. Input branch is rectangular and roofed with a [[mezzanine]] leaning on squinch, while three other branches of semicircular conch are translated with semi calotte. The church was built of small stones and has a smooth outer surface. It has very small dimensions; ''length'': 5.90m, ''width'': 5.70m, ''height''= 6m.&lt;ref&gt;Crkveno graditeljstvo u sjeverozapadnom dijelu zadarskog zaleđa, Građevinar 61 (2009) 7, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visit of Priul in 1603==
In 1603, Church of St. Nicholas was visited by Priul who found neatly kept [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] registers of baptisms and marriages, as well as two Glagolitic [[missal]]s. At the time of his visit, ''Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit'' with 28 members was active in the parish. Priul ordered brotherhood to write its rules that had to be approved by the local bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Amos R. Filipi, Radovi JAZU Zadar,13-14/1968. p. 231-235.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Usage==
Since the Church was constructed, Mass was celebrated in it on the feast of St. Nicholas on December 6. In recent times, Mass is celebrated on the day of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] on April 25.

'''Croquis''' drawing is quick and [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]y [[drawing]] of a live [[Model (art)|model]]. Croquis drawings are usually made in a few minutes, after which the model changes pose or leaves and another croquis is drawn.

The short duration of the pose benefits models because they do not need to keep still for a long time; this also benefits the artists because it helps them concentrate on the essential elements of the pose, or the most important parts of the drawing. An artist does not have time to draw all the details, so they learn to concentrate on the important elements. Croquis is also a good method of drawing subjects that generally do not stand still and pose, such as insects, [[animal]]s, and [[child]]ren.

After the initial sketch, croquis drawing can be used as a foundation for another work of art such as a [[painting]] or may be used as a work of art itself.

The word ''croquis'' comes from [[French language|French]] and means simply "sketch".

In [[fashion]], the term refers to a quick sketch of a figure (typically nine heads tall as this is the accepted proportions for [[fashion illustration]]) with a loose drawing of the clothes that are being designed. Often a large number of croquis drawings will be created for one finished look, which is fully drawn and finished.

The '''Danish Design Award''' is an annual international design prize awarded by the member organization Design denmark and [[Danish Design Centre]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Danish Design Award demonstrates the value and impact of design in Denmark today and inspires and stimulates the use of design and design thinking in companies and society. 

The new partnership behind the Danish Design Award brings together the design industry and the entire country around an annual design event celebrating the difference design can make.

Fifty years ago, in 1965, the first Danish design award, the ID Prize was launched. This was followed by the IG Prize in 1980, which merged, into the Danish Design Award in 2000.

Now, the Danish Design Award is presented in a new version as a joint creation from the Danish Design Centre and the alliance of design professionals, Design denmark.

Danish Design Award encompasses all disciplines within the realm of design and adopts a three-dimensional focus on form, function and value creation.

The fifteen award categories range from design that has created jobs or cut costs over health solutions and resource sharing to visionary concepts demonstrating the wide range and diversity of the capability of design to bring added value.

At that time the award was called the {{Interlanguage link multi|ID Prize|da|3=ID Prisen}}.&lt;ref name="en.ddc.dk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ddc.dk/article/more-40-years-design-awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122184254/http://en.ddc.dk/article/more-40-years-design-awards |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 January 2010 |first=Pia Dandanell |last=Parrot |title=More than 40 Years of Design Awards |publisher=Danish Design Center |date=30 September 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish design had become an important concept, not just in Scandinavia but worldwide. Danish design represented - and continues to represent - simple, pure and aesthetic design with a clear user focus.&lt;ref name="en.ddc.dk"/&gt;

;1980 – Industrial Graphic Design Prize
In 1980 the ID Prize had a sister award, the {{Interlanguage link multi|IG Prize|da|3=IG Prisen}}, which celebrated the best industrial graphic design.

;2000 – The Danish Design Prize
In 2000, the ID Prize and the IG Prize merged to become the Danish Design Prize. With the brief pause in 2005 and 2006, the Danish Design Prize 2007 marked an anniversary for Danish design: the design prizes were awarded for the fortieth time.

;2007 – The Designmatters Award
A new introduction in 2007 was the Designmatters Award. This award goes to a small or medium-sized company that has made a serious effort to incorporate design and achieved a positive effect on the bottom line. The first recipient of the Designmatters Award was the lighting company Lightyears.&lt;ref name="en.ddc.dk"/&gt;

'''Delores E. Churchill''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[artist]] of [[Haida people|Haida]] descent. She is a [[Weaver (occupation)|weaver]] of baskets, hats, robes, and other regalia, as well as leading revitalization efforts for [[Haida language|Haida]], her native language.

==Background==
Churchill was born in [[Masset]], [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], Canada in 1929.&lt;ref name="kenai"&gt;[http://www.artskenai.com/gallery_detail.asp?ID=208 Delores Churchill.] ''Kenai River Council on The Arts.'' 2003 (retrieved 5 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kfsk.org/2015/10/15/haida-master-weaver-delores-churchill-shares-her-story/|title=Haida master weaver Delores Churchill shares her story|last=15|first=Angela Denning {{!}} Oct|last2=2015|date=2015-10-15|website=KFSK|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a girl, she attended schools that forced her to speak English in place of her native tongue, a typical practice of that time period. She first studied traditional Haida weaving with her mother, [[Selina Peratrovich]], who is also a nationally recognized master weaver. She went on to study traditional [[Tsimshian]] weaving from masters [[Flora Matthew]] and [[Brenda White]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.wa.gov/folk-arts/master-artists/churchill-delores.shtml Folk Arts | Master Artist | Delores Churchill&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill further studied at the British Museum and relearned the six-strand weave.&lt;ref name="krbd.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.krbd.org/2017/05/05/delores-churchill-receives-lifetime-achievement-award/|title=Delores Churchill honored with Lifetime Achievement Award|last=5|first=Maria Dudzak {{!}} May|last2=2017|date=2017-05-05|website=KRBD|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from a bookkeeping career and raising her family, Churchill turned her attention back to basketry at a time when Haida basket weaving was in serious decline as an art form among younger members of the tribe.&lt;ref name=kenai/&gt; She taught her niece, [[Lisa Telford]], traditional Haida basket weaving.

==Artwork==
Churchill is known for her utilitarian and ceremonial objects that often use spruce root, cedar bark, wool, and [[natural dye]]s. Some of her artwork is displayed at the [[Totem Heritage Center]] in [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], [[Alaska]], where she has also taught courses in basketry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.ketchikan.ak.us/departments/museums/documents/InstructorBiosforweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Haida language revitalization ==
As one of the few remaining native speakers of [[Haida language|Haida]], Churchill has fought to share her linguistic heritage. Canada and the United States both suppressed use of the Haida language, especially through forcing Native children to speak English in [[Indian residential schools|boarding schools]]. Churchill was forced by her teachers in the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canadian residential school]] she attended as a child to speak English and was punished for speaking her own language. Despite these challenges, Churchill has remained adamant in her desire to preserve her native language and frequently works with Haida children and assisted her daughter April Churchill's language revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Northern Northwest Coast Weavers |url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/static/baskets/artists/nnwc.html |publisher=Burke Museum |accessdate=11 July 2018 |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors and awards ==
Churchill is the recipient of numerous awards, including:
* National Heritage Fellowship Award, ''[[National Endowment for the Arts]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.gov/about/NEARTS/15-2007vol1/15p5churchill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8613">There is a large [[body of knowledge]] that [[designer]]s call upon and use during the [[design process]] to match the ever-increasing complexity of design problems.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, H. Du, Knowledge intensive collaborative design modeling and support, part I: Review, distributed models and framework, Computers in Industry 57 (2006) 39–55&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design knowledge''' can be classified into two categories:&lt;ref&gt;M. Stokes, Managing Engineering Knowledge: MOKA Methodology for Knowledge Based Engineering Applications, MOKA Consortium, London,2001.&lt;/ref&gt; '''product knowledge''' and '''design process knowledge'''.

==Product Knowledge==
'''Product knowledge''' has been fairly studied and a number of modeling techniques have been developed. Most of them are tailored to specific products or specific aspects of the design activities. For example, [[geometric modeling]] is used mainly for supporting detailed design, while [[knowledge modeling]] is working for supporting conceptual designs. Based on these techniques, a design repository project at [[NIST]] attempts to model three fundamental facets of an artifact representation:&lt;ref&gt;S. Szykman, R.D. Sriram, W. Regli, The role of knowledge in next generation product development systems, ASME Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering 1 (1) (2001) 3–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Szykman, Architecture and implementation of a design repository system, in: Proceedings of ASME DETC2002, 2002, Paper No. DETC2002/CIE-34463.&lt;/ref&gt; the physical layout of the artifact (form), an indication of the overall effect that the artifact creates (function), and a causal account of the operation of the artifact (behavior). The recent NIST research effort towards the development of the basic foundations of the next generation of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems suggested a core representation for design information called the '''NIST core product model''' (CPM) &lt;ref&gt;S.J. Fenves, A core product model for representing design information, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]&lt;span title="Interagency Report"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; 6736, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of derived models defined as extensions of the CPM (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, R.D. Sriram, Feature-based component model for design of embedded system, in: B. Gopalakrishnan (Ed.), Intelligent Systems in Design and Manufacturing, Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 5605, SPIE, Bellingham, WA, vol. V, 2004, pp. 226–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sudarsan, Y.H. Han, S.C. Feng, U. Roy, F. Wang, R.D. Sriram, K. Lyons, Object-oriented representation of electro-mechanical assemblies using UML, NISTIR 7057, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;). The NIST core product model has been developed to unify and integrate product or assembly information. The CPM
provides a base-level product model that is: not tied to any vendor software; open; non-proprietary; expandable; independent of any one product development process; capable of capturing the engineering context that is most commonly shared in product development activities. The core model focuses on artifact representation including function, form, behavior, material, physical and functional decompositions, and relationships among these concepts. The [[entity-relationship]] data model influences the model heavily; accordingly, it consists of two sets of classes, called object and relationship, equivalent to the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] class and association class, respectively.

==Design Process Knowledge==
'''Design process knowledge''' can be described in two levels: design activities and design rationale.&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zha, R. D. Sriram, et al., Knowledge-intensive collaborative decision support for design process: hybrid decision support model and agent, Computers in Industry 59 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of representation for design rationale has been recognized but it is a more complex issue that extends beyond artifact function. The [[design structure matrix]] (DSM) has been used for modeling design process (activities) and some related research efforts have been conducted. For example, a web-based prototype system for modeling the product development process using a multi-tiered DSM is developed at MIT. However, few research endeavors have been found on design rationale.&lt;ref&gt;F. Pena-Mora, R.D. Sriram, R. Logcher, SHARED DRIMS: SHARED design recommendation and intent management system, in: Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises, IEEE Press,1993, pp. 213–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Pena-Mora, R.D. Sriram, R. Logcher, Conflict mitigation system for collaborative engineering, AI EDAM—Special Issue of Concurrent Engineering 9 (2) (1995) 101–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation Scenarios==
In terms of representation scenarios, '''design knowledge''' can also be categorized into off-line and on-line knowledge. Design process knowledge can be categorized into ontologies.

===Off-line Knowledge===
'''Offline Knowledge''' refers to existing [[knowledge representation]], including design knowledge in handbook and design ‘‘[[know-how]]’’, etc.; the latter refers to the new design knowledge created in the course of design activities by designers themselves. For the off-line knowledge, there are two representation approaches. One is to highly abstract and categorize existing knowledge including experiences into a series of design principles, rationales and constraints. [[TRIZ]] is a good instance of this approach. The other is to represent a collection of design knowledge into a certain case for description. '''[[Case-based reasoning|Case-based]] design''' is an example of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;W.H.Wood III, A.M. Agogino, Case based conceptual design information server for concurrent engineering, Computer-Aided Design 8 (5) (1996) 361–369.&lt;/ref&gt; The key issue is on the computerization of the
design knowledge representation. For instance, researchers at the Engineering Design Centre at Lancaster University, UK established a unique knowledge representation methodology and knowledge base vocabulary based on the theory of domains, design principles and [[computer modeling]]. They developed a software tool for engineering knowledge management. The tool provides an engineering system designer with the capability to search a knowledge base of past solutions, and other known technologies to explored viable alternatives for product design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===On-line Knowledge===
'''On-line knowledge representation''' is capturing the dynamic design knowledge in a certain format for design re-use and archive. A few research efforts have been found in this area. Blessing &lt;ref&gt;L.T.M. Blessing, A process-based approach to computer supported engineering design, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Twente, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes the process-based support system (PROSUS) based on a model of the design process rather than the product. It uses a [[design matrix]] to represent the design process as a structured set of issues and activities. Together with the common product data model (CPDM), PROSUS supports the capture of all outputs of the design activity.

===Ontologies===
[[Ontology (information science)|Ontologies]] are being used for product representation (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;L. Patil, D. Dutta, R.D. Sriram, Ontology-based exchange of product data semantics, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering 2 (3) (2005) 213–225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bock, X.F. Zha, Ontological product modeling for collaborative design, NIST IR, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.C. Liang, C. Bock, X.F. Zha, Ontological modeling platform, NIST IR, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). Research suggests that there is a need to provide computer support that will supply clear and complete design knowledge and also facilitate designer intervention and customization during the decision-making activities in the design process.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Madni, The role of human factors in expert systems design and acceptance, Human Factors 30 (4) (1988) 395–414.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, WebCADET &lt;ref&gt;P.A. Rodgers, A.P. Huxor, N.H.M. Caldwell, Design support using distributed web-based AI tools, Research in Engineering Design 11 (1999) 31–44.&lt;/ref&gt; is a design support system that uses distributed Web-based [[AI]] tools. It uses the AI as text approach, where [[knowledge-based systems]] (KBSs) can be seen as a medium to facilitate the communication of design knowledge between designers. The system can provide support for designers when searching for design knowledge.

A '''digital camera''' or '''digicam''' is a [[camera]] that captures [[photograph]]s in [[digital memory]]. Most cameras produced today are digital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/11/AR2006011102323.html |title=Nikon Says It's Leaving Film-Camera Business| accessdate=2007-02-23 | date=2006-01-12 | publisher=Washington Post | first=Mike | last=Musgrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while there are still dedicated digital cameras, many more are now incorporated into devices ranging from [[mobile device]]s to vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;https://fstoppers.com/news/nikon-closes-china-camera-factory-cites-smartphones-cause-201773 Nikon Closes China Camera Factory, Cites Smartphones as Cause&lt;/ref&gt; However, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals.

Digital and [[movie camera]]s share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] to focus light onto an image pickup device.&lt;ref&gt;MakeUseOf: [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-does-a-digital-camera-work/ How does a Digital Camera Work]; retrieved 2013-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; The diaphragm and [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] admit the correct amount of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from [[Flash memory|memory]]. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound]]. Some digital cameras can [[Cropping (image)|crop]] and [[Image stitching|stitch]] pictures and perform other elementary [[image editing]].

==History==
{{See|History of the camera#Digital cameras|Digital single-lens reflex camera|Camera phone}}

The history of the digital camera began with [[Eugene F. Lally]] of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], who was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His 1961 idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts' position. As with [[Texas Instruments]] employee Willis Adcock's filmless camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972, the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.

The [[Cromemco Cyclops]] was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' magazine, and it used a 32&amp;times;32 [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor]] sensor.

[[Steven Sasson]], an engineer at [[Eastman Kodak]], invented and built the first self-contained electronic camera that used a [[charge-coupled device]] image sensor in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Prakel|title=The Visual Dictionary of Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7X5vYbUd0sC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=24 July 2013|date=10 December 2009|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-04-7|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dobbin&gt;Dobbin, Ben. (September 8, 2005) "[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Kodak-engineer-had-revolutionary-idea-the-first-1182624.php Kodak engineer had revolutionary idea: the first digital camera]." ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. Retrieved on 2018-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Estrin |first=James |date=August 12, 2015 |title=Kodak's First Digital Moment |url=http://nyti.ms/1IK1u5a |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses were mainly military and scientific; followed by medical and news applications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1986, Japanese company [[Nikon]] introduced the first [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital single-lens reflex]] (DSLR) camera, the Nikon SVC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apphotnum.free.fr/N2BE2.html Nikon SLR-type digital cameras], Pierre Jarleton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busch"&gt;David D. Busch (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jOVSzasqzQ4C&amp;pg=PT11 ''Nikon D70 Digital Field Guide'', page 11], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-to-late 1990s, DSLR cameras became common among consumers. By the mid-2000s, DSLR cameras had largely replaced film cameras.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2000, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the world's first digital [[camera phone]], the [[J-SH04]] [[J-Phone]], in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoista.net/post/18437919296/evolution-of-the-cameraphone-from-sharp-j-sh04-to |title=Evolution of the Camera phone: From Sharp J-SH04 to Nokia 808 Pureview |publisher=Hoista.net |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-2000s, higher-end [[cell phones]] had an integrated digital camera. By the beginning of the 2010s, almost all [[smartphone]]s had an integrated digital camera.

== Image sensors ==
{{Further|Image sensor}}
The two major types of digital image sensor are [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and [[CMOS]]. A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS [[active-pixel sensor]] has its own amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebay.de/gds/What-Is-the-Difference-Between-a-CCD-and-CMOS-Video-Camera-/10000000177630865/g.html |title=What Is the Difference Between a CCD and CMOS Video Camera |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt; Cameras with a small sensor use a [[back-illuminated sensor|back-side-illuminated]] CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. Overall final image quality is more dependent on the [[image processing]] capability of the camera, than on sensor type.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avocebehindthelens.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/technology-bsi-cmos-cmos-ccd-whats-the-deal/ |title=Technology: BSI-CMOS, CMOS, CCD… What’s the deal |date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/why-the-iphone-4-takes-good-low-light-photos-bsi-cmos-sensors-explained/ |title=Why the iPhone 4 takes good low-light photos: BSI CMOS sensors explained! |author=Joshua Goldman |accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensor resolution ===

The [[Image resolution|resolution]] of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor&lt;ref&gt;QuinStreet Inc: [http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/digital_camera.html What is digital camera?]; retrieved 2013-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; that turns light into discrete signals. The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor, the larger the value that is read for that [[pixel]].
Depending on the physical structure of the sensor, a [[color filter array]] may be used, which requires [[demosaicing]] to recreate a full-color image.
The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera's "[[pixel count]]".
In a typical sensor, the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. For example, a 1,000 by 1,000 pixel sensor would have 1,000,000 pixels, or 1 [[megapixel]].

===Image sharpness===
Final quality of an image depends on all optical transformations in the chain of producing the image. Carl Zeiss points out that the weakest link in an optical chain determines the final image quality. In case of a digital camera, a simplistic way of expressing it is that the lens determines the maximum sharpness of the image while the image sensor determines the maximum resolution. The illustration on the right can be said to compare a lens with very poor sharpness on a camera with high resolution, to a lens with good sharpness on a camera with lower resolution.

===Methods of image capture===

[[Image:Ccd-sensor.jpg|At the heart of a digital camera is a CCD or a [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]] image sensor.|thumb|upright]]
[[Image:Partly disassembled Lumix digital camera.jpg|thumb|Digital camera, partly disassembled. The lens assembly (bottom right) is partially removed, but the sensor (top right) still captures an image, as seen on the LCD screen (bottom left).]]

Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.

''Single-shot'' capture systems use either one sensor chip with a [[Bayer filter]] mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the [[primary additive colors]] red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter (see [[Three-CCD camera]]).

''Multi-shot'' exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens [[aperture]]. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called [[Microscanning]]. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.

The third method is called ''scanning'' because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an [[image scanner]]. The ''linear'' or ''tri-linear'' sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using [[color co-site sampling]]) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital [[rotating line camera]] offers images of very high total resolution.

The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.{{original research inline|date=August 2013}}

Improvements in single-shot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the 21st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant, even in high-end commercial photography.

=== Filter mosaics, interpolation, and aliasing ===

[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|The Bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor.]]
Most current consumer digital cameras use a [[Bayer filter|Bayer filter mosaic]] in combination with an optical [[anti-aliasing filter]] to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primary-color images.
A demosaicing algorithm is used to [[interpolation|interpolate]] color information to create a full array of RGB image data.

Cameras that use a beam-splitter single-shot [[3CCD]] approach, three-filter multi-shot approach, color co-site sampling or [[Foveon X3 sensor]] do not use anti-aliasing filters, nor demosaicing.

[[Firmware]] in the camera, or a software in a raw converter program such as [[Adobe DNG Converter|Adobe Camera Raw]], interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full color image, because the [[RGB color model]] requires three intensity values for each pixel: one each for the red, green, and blue (other color models, when used, also require three or more values per pixel).
A single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities, and so a [[color filter array]] (CFA) must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel.

The Bayer filter pattern is a repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern of light filters, with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions. The high proportion of green takes advantage of properties of the human visual system, which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation. Sometimes a 4-color filter pattern is used, often involving two different hues of green. This provides potentially more accurate color, but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process.

The color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be [[interpolate]]d from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated.

=== Sensor size and angle of view ===

Cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical 35mm film size have a smaller field or [[angle of view]] when used with a lens of the same [[focal length]]. This is because angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used.

[[Image:kids 50mm 100mm.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;!-- comment welcome --&gt;]]

The [[crop factor]] is relative to the [[135 film|35mm film format]]. If a smaller sensor is used, as in most digicams, the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35mm full-frame format's field of view. This narrowing of the field of view may be described as [[crop factor]], a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35mm film camera. [[Full-frame digital SLR]]s utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35mm film.

Common values for field of view crop in DSLRs using [[active pixel sensor]]s include 1.3x for some [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] (APS-H) sensors, 1.5x for [[Sony]] APS-C sensors used by [[Nikon]], [[Pentax]] and [[Konica Minolta]] and for [[Fujifilm]] sensors, 1.6 (APS-C) for most Canon sensors, ~1.7x for [[Sigma Corporation|Sigma]]'s [[Foveon]] sensors and 2x for [[Kodak]] and [[Panasonic]] 4/3-inch sensors currently used by [[Olympus company|Olympus]] and Panasonic. Crop factors for non-SLR consumer compact and [[bridge digital camera|bridge]] cameras are larger, frequently 4x or more.

==Types of digital cameras==
Digital cameras come in a wide range of sizes, prices and capabilities. In addition to general purpose digital cameras, specialized cameras including [[multispectral imaging]] equipment and [[astrograph]]s are used for scientific, military, medical and other special purposes.

===Compacts===
[[File:Sony DSC-W170.jpg|thumb|left|Subcompact with lens assembly retracted]]
[[File:Disassembled digital camera.jpg|thumb|left|Disassembled compact digital camera]]
Compact cameras are intended to be portable (pocketable) and are particularly suitable for casual "[[snapshot (photography)|snapshots]]".

Many incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom. In most models, an auto actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements. Most ruggedized or [[Waterproof digital camera|water-resistant]] models do not retract, and most with [[superzoom]] capability do not retract fully.

Compact cameras are usually designed to be [[Usability|easy to use]].  Almost all include an automatic mode, or "auto mode", which automatically makes all camera settings for the user.  Some also have manual controls. Compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor which trades-off picture quality for compactness and simplicity; images can usually only be stored using [[lossy compression]] ([[JPEG]]). Most have a built-in [[flash (photography)|flash]] usually of low power, sufficient for nearby subjects.  A few high end compact digital cameras have a [[hotshoe]] for connecting to an external flash. [[Live preview]] is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated LCD. In addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record [[motion picture|video]].

Compacts often have [[Macro photography|macro]] capability and [[zoom lens]]es, but the zoom range (up to 30x) is generally enough for [[candid photography]] but less than is available on [[bridge camera]]s (more than 60x), or the interchangeable lenses of DSLR cameras available at a much higher cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/18-300mm.htm |title=Nikon 18-300mm VR DX AF-S G ED NIKKOR, $1,000 |author=Ken Rockwell |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autofocus]] systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrast-detection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager. Some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on DSLRs. 

Typically, compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent [[leaf shutter]] into the lens but play a simulated camera sound &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/digital-camera-operation/digital-cameras-turn-shutter-sound-on-or-off.html#b Turn shutter sound on or off] Steve's Digicams&lt;/ref&gt; for [[skeuomorph]]ic purposes.

For low cost and small size, these cameras typically use [[Image sensor format#Table of sensor formats and sizes|image sensor format]]s with a diagonal between 6 and 11&amp;nbsp;mm, corresponding to a crop factor between 7 and 4. This gives them weaker low-light performance, greater [[depth of field]], generally closer focusing ability, and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors. Some cameras use a larger sensor including, at the high end, a pricey full-frame sensor compact camera, such as [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1]], but have capability near that of a DSLR.

A variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera. Such features include [[Geotagging|GPS]], compass, [[barometer]]s and [[altimeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cameras.co.uk/specs/panasonic-dmc-ft3.cfm Panasonic DMC FT3 Specification]. Cameras.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in 2011, some compact digital cameras can take 3D still photos. These 3D compact [[stereo camera]]s can capture 3D panoramic photos with dual lens or even single lens for play back on a [[3D TV]].

In 2013, Sony released two add-on camera models without display, to be used with a smartphone or tablet, controlled by a [[mobile application]] via WiFi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/sony-qx100-qx10-lens-cameras/ |title=Sony DSC-QX100 and QX10 lens cameras bring top-notch optics to any smartphone or tablet, we go hands-on (video) |date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rugged compacts ===
Rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion, hot and cold conditions, shock and pressure. Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof, freezeproof, heatproof, shockproof and crushproof, respectively. Nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category. Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 82 feet (27 m);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manmakesfire.com/3-best-waterproof-cameras-2014-rugged-compact-ready-action/ |title=3 Best Waterproof Cameras for 2015: Rugged, Compact, and Ready for Action |author=Chris Maxcer |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others only 10 feet (3m), but only a few will float. Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera, but they have video capability and the majority can record sound. Most have image stabilization and built-in flash. Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work under water.

=== Action cameras ===
{{details|Action camera}}
[[GoPro]] and other brands offer action cameras which are rugged, small and can be easily attached to [[helmet cam|helmet]], arm, bicycle, etc.  Most have wide angle and fixed focus, and can take still pictures and video, typically with sound.

The rising popularity of action cameras is in line with many people desiring to share photos or videos in [[social media]].  Many competitive manufacturers of action cameras results in many options and lowered, competitive prices, and nowadays, cameras are sold bundled with waterproof housings, accessories, and mountings compatible with the popular GoPro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/action-camera-market.html |title=Action Camera Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024 |author= |accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===360-degree cameras===
The 360-degree camera can take picture or video 360 degrees using two lenses back-to-back and shooting at the same time. Some of the cameras are Ricoh Theta S, Nikon Keymission 360 and Samsung Gear 360. Nico360 was launched in 2016 and claimed as the world's smallest 360-degree camera with size 46 x 46 x 28&amp;nbsp;mm (1.8 x 1.8 x 1.1 in) and price less than $200. With [[virtual reality]] mode built-in stitching, Wifi, and Bluetooth, live streaming can be done. Due to it also being water resistant, the Nico360 can be used as action camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/nico360-camera-smallest/44421/ |title=Big plans for "world’s smallest" 360-degree camera |author=Simon Crisp |date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are tend that action cameras have capabilities to shoot 360 degrees with at least 4K resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/9/10742974/nikon-gopro-action-cameras-360-video-ces-2016 |title=Nikon’s new action camera could change the market in a big way This is the year action cameras and 360-degree videos collide |author=Sean O'Kane |date=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge cameras===
[[File:Sony DSC-H2 01.jpg|thumb|Sony DSC-H2]]
{{Main|Bridge camera}}

Bridge cameras physically resemble DSLRs, and are sometimes called DSLR-shape or DSLR-like. They provide some similar features but, like compacts, they use a fixed lens and a small sensor. Some compact cameras have also PSAM mode. Most use [[live preview]] to frame the image. Their usual autofocus is by the same contrast-detect mechanism as compacts, but many bridge cameras have a [[manual focus]] mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control.

Big physical size and small sensor allow [[superzoom]] and wide [[aperture]]. Bridge cameras generally include an [[image stabilization]] system to enable longer handheld exposures, sometimes better than DSLR for low light condition.

As of 2014, bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size, firstly the more traditional 1/2.3" sensor (as measured by [[image sensor format]]) which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from 20 to 24mm (35mm equivalent) wide angle all the way up to over 1000&amp;nbsp;mm supertele, and secondly a 1" sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light (higher ISO) but puts greater constraints on lens design, resulting in zoom lenses that stop at 200mm (constant aperture, e.g. Sony RX10) or 400mm (variable aperture, e.g. Panasonic Lumix FZ1000) equivalent, corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly 10 to 15.

Some bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wide-angle or [[Teleconverter|telephoto converters]] as well as filters such as UV or [[Polarizing filter (photography)|Circular Polarizing]] filter and lens hoods. The scene is composed by viewing the display or the [[electronic viewfinder]] (EVF). Most have a slightly longer [[shutter lag]] than a DSLR. Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG.&lt;ref&gt;JPEG is a lossy compression format with less colour depth than typical of raw formats; however, most raw formats require demosaicing ("raw converter") software to be viewed properly.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority have a built-in flash, but only a few have a [[hotshoe]].

In bright sun, the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital SLR is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable, cost less and have a greater zoom ability. Thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities, except when seeking professional-quality photos.&lt;ref&gt;Digital SLR vs Compact SuperZoom Camera

=== Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras ===
[[File:Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II D81 8378-2.jpg|thumb|Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II introduced 2016]]
[[File:Nikon Z7 D81 2448 (44253991734).jpg|thumb|Nikon Z7 introduced 2018]]
{{Main|Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera}}

In late 2008, a new type of camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC), which uses various sensors and offers lens interchangeability. These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system. MILC camera models are available with various sensor sizes including: a small 1/2.3&amp;nbsp;inch sensor, as is commonly used in [[bridge camera]]s such as the original [[Pentax Q]] (more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger 1/1.7&amp;nbsp;inch sensor); a 1-inch sensor; a [[Micro Four Thirds system|Micro Four Thirds]] sensor; an APS-C sensor such as the Sony NEX series, [[Fujifilm X series]], [[Pentax K-01]], and [[Canon EOS M]]; and some, such as the [[Sony α7]], use a full frame (35&amp;nbsp;mm) sensor and even [[Hasselblad]] X1D is the first medium format MILC. Some MILC cameras have a separate electronic viewfinder. In other cameras the back display is used as a viewfinder in same way as in compact cameras. A disadvantage of MILC compared to DSLR is battery life due to the energy consumption of the [[electronic viewfinder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/opinion/rise-mirrorless-compact-system-cameras-94896 |title=The rise of mirrorless compact system cameras |author=Andy Westlake |date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses which are fully compatible each other without any adapter, while the others have proprietary mounts. In 2014, Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/previews/kodak-pixpro-s-1/ |title=Kodak Pixpro S-1 First Impressions Review |author=Andy Westlake |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014|3}}, MILC cameras are available which appeal to both amateurs and professionals.&lt;ref name="Engadget-930976"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/03/13/nikon-1-v3/ |title=Nikon 1 V3 camera unveiled: $1,200, 120fps slow motion, 20fps continuous shooting |work=[[Engadget]] |date=March 13, 2014 |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |first=Richard |last=Lawler |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320035108/http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/13/nikon-1-v3/ |archivedate=March 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modular cameras{{anchor|SmartShot}} ===
While most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lens-mount of some kind, there are also a number of modular cameras, where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module.

The first such modular camera was the [[Minolta Dimâge V]] in 1996, followed by the [[Minolta Dimâge EX 1500]] in 1998 and the [[Minolta MetaFlash 3D 1500]] in 1999. In 2009, Ricoh released the [[Ricoh GXR]] modular camera.

At CES 2013, [[Sakar International]] announced the [[Polaroid iM1836]], an 18 MP camera with 1"-sensor with interchangeable sensor-lens. An adapter for [[Micro Four Thirds]], Nikon and K-mount lenses was planned to ship with the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.dpreview.com/post/3952862814/polaroid-announces-android-camera-with-interchangeable-lenses |title=Polaroid offers first Android camera with interchangeable lenses |date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of add-on camera modules for [[smartphone]]s called lens-style cameras (lens camera). They contain all components of a digital camera in a module, but lack a viewfinder, display and most of the controls.  Instead they can be mounted to a [[smartphone]] and use its display and controls. Lens-style cameras include:

=== Digital single-lens reflex cameras ===
[[File:E-30-Cutmodel.jpg|thumb|Cutaway of an [[Olympus E-30]] DSLR]]
{{Main|Digital single-lens reflex camera}}

Digital [[single-lens reflex camera]]s (DSLR) use a reflex mirror that can reflect the light and also can swivel from one position to another position and back to initial position.  By default, the reflex mirror is set 45 degree from horizontal, blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to penta-mirror/prism at the DSLR camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder. The reflex mirror is pulled out horizontally below the penta-mirror/prism when shutter release is fully pressed, so the viewfinder will be dark and the light/image can directly strike the sensor at the time of exposure (speed setting).

Autofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box. Some DSLRs have a "[[Live preview|live view]]" mode that allows framing using the screen with image from the sensor.

These cameras have much larger sensors than the other types, typically 18&amp;nbsp;mm to 36&amp;nbsp;mm on the diagonal (crop factor 2, 1.6, or 1). The larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel; this, combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior low-light performance. For the same field of view and the same aperture, a larger sensor gives shallower focus.
They use [[interchangeable lens]]es for versatility. Usually some lenses are made for digital SLR use only, but recent trend the lenses can also be used in detachable lens video camera with or without adapter.

===Digital Single Lens Translucent (DSLT) cameras===
{{main|Sony SLT camera}}
A DSLT uses a '''fixed''' [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] mirror instead of a '''moving''' reflex mirror as in DSLR. A translucent mirror or transmissive mirror or semi-transparent mirror is a mirror which reflects the light to two things at the same time. It reflects it along the path to a pentaprism/pentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder (OVF) as is done with a reflex mirror in DSLR cameras. The translucent mirror also sends light along a second path to the sensor. The total amount of light is not changed, just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other. The consequences are that DSLT cameras should shoot a half stop differently from DSL. One advantage of using a DSLT camera is the blind moments a DSLR user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for DSLT cameras. Because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths, DSLT cameras get the benefit of continuous auto-focus tracking. This is especially beneficial for burst mode shooting in low-light conditions and also for tracking when taking video.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Until early 2014, only Sony had released DSLT cameras. By March 2013, Sony had released more DSLTs than DSLRs with a relatively complete lenses line-up.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Digital rangefinders===

{{Main|Rangefinder camera#Digital rangefinder}}

A rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance, with the intent to adjust the focus of a camera's objective lens accordingly ([[open-loop controller]]). The rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled. In common parlance, the term "rangefinder camera" is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual-focus cameras with a visually-read out optical rangefinder based on [[parallax]]. Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation, if it is provided at all, is only a byproduct of the focusing process ([[closed-loop controller]]).

===Line-scan camera systems===
[[File:Strip_photo_of_San_Francisco_Cable_Car_10.jpg|thumb|A San Francisco cable car, imaged using an Alkeria Necta N4K2-7C line scan camera with a shutter speed of 250 microseconds, or 4000 frames per second.]]
A line-scan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors, instead of a matrix of them. The lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image. This is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a [[frame grabber]] which resides in a [[PCI slot]] of an industrial computer. The frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing.

Multiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images, or to increase sensitivity by TDI ([[Time delay and integration]]).
 
Many industrial applications require a wide field of view. Traditionally maintaining consistent light over large 2D areas is quite difficult. With a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the “line” currently being viewed by the camera. This makes possible sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed.

Such cameras are also commonly used to make [[photo finish]]es, to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time. They can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes.

Linescan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites (see [[push broom scanner]]). In this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion. Linescan cameras are widely used in [[Image scanner|scanner]]s. In this case, the camera moves horizontally.

=== Stand alone camera ===
Stand alone cameras can be used as [[remote camera]]. One kind weighs 2.31 ounces (65.5&amp;nbsp;g), with a periscope shape, IPx7 water-resistance and dust-resistance rating and can be enhanced to IPx8 by using a cap. They have no viewfinder or LCD. Lens is a 146 degree wide angle or standard lens, with fixed focus. It can have a microphone and speaker, And it can take photos and video. As a remote camera, a phone app using Android or iOS is needed to send live video, change settings, take photos, or use time lapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/08/htc-re-camera/ |title=HTC's RE camera is a GoPro for NoPros |author=Brad Molen |date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration into other devices ==
Many devices have a built-in digital camera, including, for example, [[camera phone|smartphones]], mobile phones, PDAs and laptop computers. Built-in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format.

Mobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 [[camera phone]]s outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the [[installed base]] of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html Kevin J. O'Brien, New York Times, 2010 Nov 15] Smartphone Sales Taking Toll on G.P.S. Devices&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market trends ==
[[File:Sale of smartphones and cameras.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Chart of sale of smartphones (with built-in cameras) compared to digital cameras 2009-2013 showing smartphone sale soaring while camera sale is stagnating|Sale of smartphones compared to digital cameras 2009-2013]]

Sales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of [[smartphone]]s for casual photography, which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of [[Mobile app|apps]] and web-based services. "Bridge cameras", in contrast, have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack, such as optical zoom and other advanced features.&lt;ref name=nyt-androidcamera&gt;{{cite web|title=Smile, and Say ‘Android’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/technology/personaltech/androidcameras-from-nikon-and-samsung-go-beyond-cellphones-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/bridge-cameras-a-growing-market-says-canon-and-nikon-1064839 |title=Bridge cameras a growing market says Canon and Nikon |date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSLRs have also lost ground to [[Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC)s offering the same sensor size in a smaller camera. A few expensive ones use a full-frame sensor as DSLR professional cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photographylife.com/future-digital-cameras |title=The Future of Digital Cameras |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras, some manufacturers produced "smart" digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone. In 2012, Nikon and Samsung released the [[Nikon Coolpix S800c|Coolpix S800c]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Camera|Galaxy Camera]], the first two digital cameras to run the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. Since this [[software platform]] is used in many smartphones, they can integrate with services (such as [[e-mail attachment]]s, [[social networking service|social networks]] and [[photo sharing]] sites) as smartphones do, and use other Android-compatible software as well.&lt;ref name=nyt-androidcamera/&gt;

In an inversion, some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras. Nokia released the [[Nokia 808 PureView|808 PureView]] and [[Nokia Lumia 1020|Lumia 1020]] in 2012 and 2013; the two devices respectively run the [[Symbian]] and [[Windows Phone]] operating systems, and both include a 41-megapixel camera (along with a camera grip attachment for the latter).&lt;ref name=gsmarena-lumia1020&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Lumia 1020 preview: Take two|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_1020-review-952.php|work=GSMArena|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 Zoom, having a 16-megapixel camera and 10x optical zoom, combining traits from the [[Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini|Galaxy S4 Mini]] with the Galaxy Camera.&lt;ref name=laptop-phonecameras&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Lumia 1020 vs. Galaxy S4 Zoom: The Best Camera Phone Is…|url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/nokia-lumia-1020-vs-galaxy-s4-zoom|work=Laptop|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 is an Android KitKat 4.4 smartphone with 20MP, 1" sensor, the largest sensor for a smartphone ever, with Leica fixed lens equivalent of 28mm at F2.8, can take RAW image and 4K video, has 21mm thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.dpreview.com/post/7107523787/panasonic-announces-lumix-dmc-cm1-smartphone-with-1-inch-sensor |title=Panasonic announces Lumix DMC-CM1 smartphone with 1-inch sensor |author=Lars Rehm |date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2018 [[Huawei P20]] Pro is an android Oreo 8.1 has triple Leica lenses in the back of the smartphone with 40MP 1/1.7" [[RGB]] sensor as first lens, 20MP 1/2.7" [[monochrome]] sensor as second lens and 8MP 1/4" RGB sensor with 3x optical zoom as third lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_p20_pro-9106.php |title=Huawei P20 Pro |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combination of first lens and second lens will produce [[bokeh]] image with larger [[high dynamic range]], whereas combination of [[mega pixel]] first lens and optical zoom will produce maximum 5x [[digital zoom]] without loss of quality by reducing the image size to 8MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/#/2/1 |title=Huawei P20 Pro review |author=Andy Boxall |date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light-field camera]]s were introduced in 2013 with one consumer product and several professional ones.

After a big dip of sales in 2012, consumer digital camera sales declined again in 2013 by 36 percent. In 2011, compact digital cameras sold 10 million per month. In 2013, sales fell to about 4 million per month. DSLR and MILC sales also declined in 2013 by 10–15% after almost ten years of double digit growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoshd.com/content/11409/consumer-dslrs-dead-5-years 
|title=Consumer DSLRs "dead in 5 years" 
|author= Andrew Reid
|date= 26 October 2013 
|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from 148 million in 2011 to 58 million in 2015 and tends to decrease more in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269927/sales-of-analog-and-digital-cameras-worldwide-since-2002/ |title=Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras from 2011 to 2016 (in millions) |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film camera sold got the peak at 36.671 million units in 1997 and digital camera sold began in 1999. In 2008, film camera market was dead and digital camera sold got the peak by 121.463 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phone with camera has been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with camera sold 80 million units per year. In 2011 the cell phone with camera sold hundreds of millions per year, when digital camera sold initialized to decline. In 2015, digital camera sold is 35.395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sold number in a peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number in a peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomstirrphotography.com/digital-camera-sales-continued-decline |title=DIGITAL CAMERA SALES CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2015 |author=Thomas Stirr |date=April 2, 2016 |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity==

=== Transferring photos ===
Many digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:-
* Early cameras used the [[Personal computer|PC]] [[serial port]]. [[USB]] is now the most widely used method (most cameras are viewable as [[USB mass-storage device class|USB mass storage]]), though some have a [[IEEE 1394 interface|FireWire]] port. Some cameras use [[Picture Transfer Protocol|USB PTP]] mode for connection instead of USB MSC; some offer both modes.
{{anchor|Wireless media transfer}}
* Other cameras use [[wireless connection]]s, via [[Bluetooth]] or [[IEEE 802.11]] [[Wi-Fi]], such as the [[Kodak EasyShare One]]. [[Secure Digital#Integrated Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi integrated Memory cards]] (SDHC, SDXC) can transmit stored images, video and other files to computers or [[smartphone]]s.  Mobile operating systems such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] allow automatic upload and backup or sharing of images over Wi-Fi to [[photo sharing]] and [[cloud computing|cloud services]].
{{anchor|Tethering}}
* Cameras with integrated Wi-Fi or specific Wi-Fi adapters mostly allow camera control, especially [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] release, [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] control and more ([[tethering]]) from computer or smartphone apps additionally to the transfer of media data.
* Cameraphones and some high-end stand-alone digital cameras also use [[cellular network]]s to connect for sharing images. The most common standard on cellular networks is the MMS [[Multimedia Messaging Service]], commonly called "picture messaging". The second method with [[smartphone]]s is to send a picture as an [[email attachment]]. Many old cameraphones, however, do not support email.

A common alternative is the use of a [[card reader]] which may be capable of reading several types of storage media, as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer. Use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process. An external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media. But if only one storage card is in use, moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient. Many computers have a card reader built in, at least for SD cards.

===Printing photos===

Many modern cameras support the [[PictBridge]] standard, which allows them to send data directly to a PictBridge-capable [[computer printer]] without the need for a computer.

Wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection.

{{Anchor|Instant-print}}
An ''instant-print camera'', is a digital camera with a built-in [[printer (computing)|printer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpmag.com/how-to/tip-of-the-week/options-for-instant-print-cameras/|title=Options For Instant-Print Cameras|date=2016-03-28|author=William Sawalich|website=Digital Photo Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confers a similar functionality as an [[instant camera]] which uses [[instant film]] to quickly generate a physical photograph. Such non-digital cameras were popularized by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reinventing Instant Photography for the Digital Age |publisher=Polaroid |url=http://thenewinstant.com/news-updates/Polaroid%20Introduces%20the%20Polaroid%20PoGo%E2%84%A2%20Instant%20Digital%20Camera/ |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-15|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090121175859/http://thenewinstant.com/news-updates/Polaroid%20Introduces%20the%20Polaroid%20PoGo%E2%84%A2%20Instant%20Digital%20Camera/ |archivedate=2009-01-21|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displaying photos===

Many digital cameras include a video output port.  Usually [[sVideo]], it sends a standard-definition video signal to a television, allowing the user to show one picture at a time.  Buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo, advance from one to another, or automatically send a "slide show" to the TV.

[[HDMI]] has been adopted by many high-end digital camera makers, to show photos in their high-resolution quality on an [[HDTV]].

In January 2008, [[Silicon Image]] announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form. [[Mobile High-definition Link|MHL]] sends pictures as a video stream, up to 1080p resolution, and is compatible with HDMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mobile High-Definition Link Technology Gives Consumers the Ability to Link Mobile Devices to HDTVs with Support for Audio and Video |publisher=Silicon Image |url=http://www.siliconimage.com/news/releasedetails.aspx?id=480 |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[DVD recorder]]s and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras; alternatively several types of flash card readers have TV output capability.

==Weather-sealing and waterproofing==
Cameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water, moisture (humidity and fog), dust and sand, or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration. The latter is one of the approaches to allow [[underwater photography]], the other approach being the use of waterproof housings. Many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures.

Some waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range. The Olympus 'Tough' range of compact cameras is an example.

==Modes==

Many digital cameras have preset [[mode dial|modes]] for different applications. Within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed, including [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]], aperture, [[focus (optics)|focus]]ing, [[light meter]]ing, [[white balance]], and equivalent sensitivity. For example, a [[portrait]] might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content.

== Image data storage ==

[[Image:Cf-card.jpg|right|thumb|A [[CompactFlash]] (CF) card, one of many media types used to store digital photographs]]

Many camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash [[memory card]]s or other [[removable media]]. Most stand-alone cameras use [[Secure Digital card|SD]] format, while a few use [[CompactFlash]] or other types. In January 2012, a faster [[XQD card]] format was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/06/sony-xqd-memory-cards/ |title=Sony Announces World’s First XQD Memory Cards |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, some high end cameras have two hot-swapable memory slots. Photographers can swap one of the memory card with camera-on. Each memory slot can accept either Compact Flash or SD Card. All new Sony cameras also have two memory slots, one for its [[Memory Stick]] and one for SD Card, but not hot-swapable.

A few cameras used other removable storage such as [[Microdrive]]s (very small [[hard disk drive]]s), [[CD single]] (185&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]), and [[3.5" floppy disk]]s.  Other unusual formats include:
* Onboard flash memory &amp;mdash; Cheap cameras and cameras secondary to the device's main use (such as a camera phone)
* [[PC Card]] hard drives &amp;mdash; early professional cameras (discontinued)
* [[Thermal printer]] &amp;mdash; known only in one model of camera that printed images immediately rather than storing
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Floppy disk 90mm.JPG|[[3.5" floppy disk]]s
Image:Memory_Stick_Front_and_Back.jpg|Sony's [[Memory Stick]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Most manufacturers of digital cameras do not provide drivers and software to allow their cameras to work with [[Linux]] or other [[free software]]. Still, many cameras use the standard [[USB storage]] protocol, and are thus easily usable. Other cameras are supported by the [[gPhoto]] project.

===File formats===

{{Main|Image file formats}}

The Joint Photography Experts Group standard (JPEG) is the most common file format for storing image data.  Other file types include Tagged Image File Format ([[TIFF]]) and various [[Raw image format]]s.

Many cameras, especially high-end ones, support a [[raw image format]]. A raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the camera's sensor, often saved in a [[proprietary format]]. [[Adobe Systems]] has released the [[Digital Negative|DNG]] format, a royalty-free raw image format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers.

Raw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs, but over time many mainstream editing programs, such as Google's [[Picasa]], have added support for raw images. Rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture.

Formats for movies are [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[DV]], [[MPEG]], [[QuickTime#File formats|MOV]] (often containing motion JPEG), [[WMV]], and ASF (basically the same as WMV). Recent formats include [[MP4]], which is based on the QuickTime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space.

Other formats that are used in cameras (but not for pictures) are the Design Rule for Camera Format ([[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]]), an [[International Organization for Standardisation|ISO]] specification, used in almost all camera since 1998, which defines an internal file structure and naming. Also used is the Digital Print Order Format ([[DPOF]]), which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies. The DCF 1998 defines a logical file system with [[8.3 filename]]s and makes the usage of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.&lt;ref name="DC-009-2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-009-2010_E.pdf |title=Standard of the Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association, CIPA DC-009-Translation-2010, Design rule for Camera File system: DCF Version 2.0 (Edition 2010) |author=JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930190707/http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-009-2010_E.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cameras include [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] data that provides [[metadata]] about the picture. Exif data may include aperture, [[exposure time]], focal length, date and time taken, and [[Geotagged photograph|location]].

==Batteries==
Digital cameras have become smaller over time, resulting in an ongoing need to develop a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Digital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries. {{as of|March 2014}}, most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available.

===Proprietary=== 

The most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats. These are built to a manufacturer's custom specifications. Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion. In addition to being available from the [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]], aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models.

===Standard consumer batteries===
{{main|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Digital cameras that utilize off-the-shelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both single-use [[primary cell|disposable]] and [[rechargeable batteries]], but not with both types in use at the same time. The most common off-the-shelf battery size used is [[AA battery|AA]]. CR2, [[CR-V3]] batteries, and [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]] are also used in some cameras. The CR2 and CR-V3 batteries are [[lithium battery|lithium based]], intended for a single use. Rechargeable [[RCR-V3]] lithium-ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries.

Some [[battery grip]]s for DSLRs come with a separate holder to accommodate AA cells as an external power source.

== Conversion of film cameras to digital ==

[[File:Reflex camera numeric.svg|thumb|[[Digital single-lens reflex camera]]]]

When digital cameras became common, many photographers asked whether their [[film camera]]s could be converted to digital.  The answer was yes and no.  For the majority of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras the answer is no, the reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.

Many early professional SLR cameras, such as the [[Kodak DCS]] series, were developed from 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras. The technology of the time, however, meant that rather than being digital "backs" the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large, bulky digital units, often bigger than the camera portion itself. These were factory built cameras, however, not [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] conversions.

A notable exception is the [[Nikon E2]] and [[Nikon E3]], using additional optics to convert the 35mm format to a 2/3 CCD-sensor.

A few 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras have had [[digital camera back]]s made by their manufacturer, Leica being a notable example. [[Medium format (film)|Medium format]] and [[large format]] cameras (those using film stock greater than 35&amp;nbsp;mm), have a low unit production, and typical digital backs for them cost over $10,000. These cameras also tend to be highly modular, with handgrips, film backs, winders, and lenses available separately to fit various needs.

The very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes. For example, Phase One's P45 39&amp;nbsp;MP image back creates a single TIFF image of size up to 224.6&amp;nbsp;MB, and even greater pixel counts are available. Medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and [[portrait photography]] than their smaller DSLR counterparts; the [[ISO speed]] in particular tends to have a maximum of 400, versus 6400 for some DSLR cameras. (Canon EOS-1D Mark IV and [[Nikon D3S]] have ISO 12800 plus Hi-3 ISO 102400 with the Canon EOS-1Dx's ISO of 204800)

=== Digital camera backs ===
{{Main|digital camera back}}

In the industrial and high-end professional photography market, some camera systems use modular (removable) image sensors. For example, some medium format SLR cameras, such as the Mamiya 645D series, allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back.

* Area array
** CCD
** CMOS
* Linear array
** CCD (monochrome)
** 3-strip CCD with color filters

Linear array cameras are also called scan backs.

* Single-shot
* Multi-shot (three-shot, usually)

Most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors, moving vertically to [[digitize]] the image.  Many of them only capture [[grayscale]] images. The relatively long exposure times, in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications, where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographer's control.

Some other camera backs use CCD arrays similar to typical cameras. These are called single-shot backs.

Since it is much easier to manufacture a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, you could buy an (albeit expensive) camera back with over 7,000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid-1990s. However, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its sensor line, are able, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.

Most modern digital camera backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors. The matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once, instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure. For example, [[Phase One (company)|Phase One]] produces a 39 million pixel digital camera back with a 49.1 x 36.8&amp;nbsp;mm CCD in 2008. This CCD array is a little smaller than a frame of [[120 film]] and much larger than a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] frame (36 x 24&amp;nbsp;mm). In comparison, consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from 36 x 24&amp;nbsp;mm (full frame on high end consumer DSLRs) to 1.28 x 0.96&amp;nbsp;mm (on [[camera phone]]s) CMOS sensor.

'''Elena Anatolievna Gremina''' (20 November 1956{{snd}}16 May 2018) was a Russian writer and playwright who was one of the founders of the factual theatre {{ill|Teatr.doc|ru|Театр.doc}}. 

==Early life==
Elena Grebnav was born on 20 November 1956 in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], to Georgian translator [[Galina Mindadze]] and [[playwright]] {{ill|Anatoly Grebnev|ru|Гребнев, Анатолий Борисович}}. At an early age, Elena would write protests in verse, such as an early piece about children being prevented from seeing a film. She later adopted the surname Gremina, a combination of her parent's surnames so as to be able to write without being compared to her them. Gremina studied at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] to become a playwright.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt;

==Career==
Grebnav's first production took place in 1983, but only came to prominence in the 1990s after her plays were performed at the [[Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre]] and she won awards from [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]. A favoured subject matter of Grebnav in this period was conflicted women of history. Grebnav married {{ill|Mikhail Ugarov|ru|Угаров, Михаил Юрьевич}} in 1993. Together with her husband and father, she created the television series, ''{{ill|St. Petersburg Secrets|ru|Петербургские тайны}}''.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt;

After being influenced by [[Elyse Dodgson]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, Gremina and her husband founded {{ill|Teatr.doc|ru|Театр.doc}}. When they heard Dodgson talk about the use of verbatim techniques in theatre to present factual stories on the stage, they decided that it was a way to reconnect Russian theatre with the public in their home country.&lt;ref name="guardobit"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dugdale |first1=Sasha |title=Elena Gremina obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/24/elena-gremina-obituary |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo started Teatr.doc in 2002, and soon began to present performances based on current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Senelick |first1=Lawrence |title=Historical Dictionary of Russian Theatre |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-1-44224-927-1 |page=464 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mx5lCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA485&amp;lpg=PA485&amp;dq=%22Elena+Gremina%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x-mSztUWr4&amp;sig=JUNRZhH5XOXKSlzN-i2CHnUiPWw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJmdaEz7fbAhWnJcAKHRhEDqE4FBDoAQhRMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elena%20Gremina%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performances became more political in nature, which resulted in Gremina and her husband being visited by the police and having equipment confiscated.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt; One such piece written by Gremina was on the death of [[Sergei Magnitsky]], an anticorruption [[lawyer]].&lt;ref name="npost"/&gt; After a police raid of Teatr.doc in 2015 that saw three members of the production temporarily arrested and sets destroyed, Gremina was summoned to the [[Ministry of Culture (Russia)|Ministry of Culture]] where she was threatened with further raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruble |first1=Blair A. |title=Putin's Punitive Theatre of the Absurd |url=http://www.newsweek.com/putins-punitive-theater-absurd-298179 |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=Newsweek |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ugarov died following a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in April 2018.&lt;ref name="npost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian playwright found dead after making play about anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky |url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/russian-playwright-found-dead-after-making-play-about-anti-corruption-lawyer-sergei-magnitsky |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=National Post |date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gremina died six weeks later, also from a heart attack.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt;

[[File:Pompeji Penis Sign.jpg|thumb|150px|Phallus inscribed on a paving stone at [[Pompeii]]]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Magic in the Graeco-Roman world|magic]], the '''''fascinus''''' or '''''fascinum''''' was the embodiment of the divine [[phallus]]. The word can refer to the deity himself ('''Fascinus'''), to phallus [[effigy|effigies]] and [[amulet]]s, and to the spells used to invoke his divine protection.&lt;ref&gt;The [[grammatical gender|neuter]] form ''fascinum'' is used most often for objects or magic charms, masculine ''fascinus'' for the god.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] calls it a ''medicus invidiae'', a "doctor" or remedy for envy (''[[invidia]]'', a "looking upon") or the [[evil eye]].

==Etymology==
The English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]" ultimately derives from Latin ''[[wikt:fascinum|fascinum]]'' and the related verb ''fascinare'', "to use the power of the ''fascinus''", that is, "to practice magic" and hence "to enchant, bewitch"  [[Catullus]] uses the verb at the end of ''Carmen 7'', a [[hendecasyllable|hendecasyllabic]] poem addressing his lover Lesbia; he expresses his infinite desire for kisses that cannot be counted by voyeurs nor "fascinated" (put under a spell) by a malicious tongue; such bliss, as also in ''Carmen'' 5, potentially attracts ''invidia''.&lt;ref&gt;David Wray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Qg3kYF-WS4C&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false ''Catullus and the Poetics of Roman Manhood''] (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fescennine Verses]], the satiric and often lewd songs or chants performed on various social occasions, may have been so-named from the ''fascinum''; ancient sources propose this etymology along with an alternative origin from [[Fescennia]], a small town in [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Gian Biagio Conte, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=fascinum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=172#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinum&amp;f=false ''Latin Literature: A History''] (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987, 1994), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public religion==
[[File:Tintinnabulum Pompeii MAN Napoli Inv27839.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Fascinus from Pompeii showing a phallus]]
The [[Vestal Virgin]]s tended the cult of the ''fascinus [[SPQR|populi Romani]]'', the sacred image of the phallus that was one of the tokens of the safety of the state ''(sacra Romana)''. It was thus associated with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Joy Littlewood, ''A [[Commentary (philology)|Commentary]] on [[Ovid]]:'' Fasti ''Book 6'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 73; [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=68#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], such as the begetting of [[Servius Tullius]], suggest that this phallus was an embodiment of a masculine generative power located within the hearth, regarded as sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy, and the Ancient World'' (MIT Press, 1988), pp. 101 and 159 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq78Ff2TYHAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; When a general celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], the Vestals hung an effigy of the ''fascinus'' on the underside of his [[chariot]] to protect him from ''invidia''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 28.4.7 (28.39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], whose primary source on Roman religion was the lost theological works of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], notes that a phallic image was carried in procession annually at the festival of [[Liber|Father Liber]], the Roman god [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] [[Dionysus|Dionysus or Bacchus]], for the purpose of protecting the fields from ''fascinatio'', magic compulsion:&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' 7.21; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Varro says that certain rites of Liber were celebrated in Italy which were of such unrestrained wickedness that the shameful parts of the male were worshipped at crossroads in his honour. … For, during the days of the [[Liberalia|festival of Liber]], this obscene member, placed on a little trolley, was first exhibited with great honour at the crossroads in the countryside, and then conveyed into the city itself. … In this way, it seems, the god Liber was to be propitiated, in order to secure the growth of seeds and to repel enchantment ''(fascinatio)'' from the fields.&lt;ref&gt;English translation by R.W. Dyson, ''Augustine: The City of God against the Pagans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2002), p. 292 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%2221+Of+the+wickedness+of+the+rites+celebrated+in+honour+of+Liber%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%2221%20Of%20the%20wickedness%20of%20the%20rites%20celebrated%20in%20honour%20of%20Liber%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a divinized phallus, Fascinus shared attributes with [[Mutunus Tutunus]], whose shrine was supposed to date from the [[Founding of Rome|founding of the city]], and the imported Greek god [[Priapus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 4.7, explicitly connects Tutunus to the ''fascinus''; see [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography," in ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a magic symbol==
Phallic charms, often winged, were ubiquitous in Roman culture, appearing as objects of jewellery such as pendants and finger rings, relief carvings, lamps, and wind chimes (''[[Tintinnabulum|tintinnabula]]'').&lt;ref name='CAW'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, C.

The protective function of the phallus is usually related to the virile and regenerative powers of an erected phallus, though in most cases the emotion, shame, or laughter created by obscenity is the power that diverts the evil eye.&lt;ref name='Dasen'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dasen, V. |date=2015 |chapter=Pobaskania: Amulets and Magic in Antiquity |editor1=Boschung, D. |editor2=Bremmer, J.

There are very few Roman images of people wearing a phallic charm.&lt;ref name='Dasen' /&gt; Varro notes the custom of hanging a phallic charm on a baby's neck,{{efn|Varro, ''On the Latin language'', VII.97}} and examples have been found of phallus-bearing rings too small to be worn except by children.&lt;ref name='Henig'&gt;Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'' (London: BT Batsford LTD, 1984), pp. 185–186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOhxSp8nlPsC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22A+child's+gold+ring+with+phallus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tOTTIXKG4TfnAenpYCRCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20child's%20gold%20ring%20with%20phallus%22&amp;f=false online], with image of example.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 [[experimental archaeology]] project suggested that some types of phallic pendant were designed to remain pointing outwards, in the direction of travel of the wearer, in order to face towards any potential danger or bad luck and nullify it before it could affect the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes?

The victory of the phallus over the power of the evil eye may be represented by the phallus ejaculating towards a disembodied eye. This motif is shown in several examples of Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 225 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3QRxWQQtcC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the motif is known from multiple [[relief|relief sculptures]] from [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day [[Libya]],&lt;ref name='SorS' /&gt; as well as several instances on [[Hadrian's Wall]].&lt;ref name='BAR'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parker, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Protecting the Troops?

The "fist and phallus" amulet was prevalent amongst soldiers. These are phallic pendants with a representation of a (usually) clenched fist at the bottom of the shaft, facing away from the [[glans]]. Several examples show the fist making the ''manus fica'' or "[[fig sign]]", a symbol of good luck.&lt;ref name='Henig' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/q/LIN-2BE126 |publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme |title=PAS Record: LIN-2BE126 |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest known collection comes from [[Camulodunum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Crummy, N. |title=Colchester Archaeological Report 2: The Roman Small finds from excavations in Colchester 1971-9 |place=Colchester |publisher=Colchester Archaeological Trust |date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of the fist-and-phallus amulets incorporate [[vulva]]te imagery as well as an extra [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Parker, A. |date=2015 |title=The Fist-and-Phallus Pendants from Roman Catterick |journal=Britannia |volume=46 |pages=135–149 |doi=10.1017/S0068113X15000161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Femmes aux yeux ouverts''''' (Women with eyes open) is a Togolese documentary film directed by [[Anne-Laure Folly]].  It covers the lives of contemporary African women in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Benin]].{{sfn|Femmes aux yeux ouverts - California Newsreel}}

==Production==

The film was released in 1994 and runs for 52 minutes in French with English subtitles.{{sfn|Femmes aux yeux ouverts - California Newsreel}}
Folly said of it:
{{blockquote|I simply wanted to show African women's ability to reach the end of the twentieth century and to enter the twenty-first century positively, that is, by articulating a set of problems, questions, and answers that contribute to world development. I wanted to show that they participate fully in the questions that concern all women.{{sfn|Thackway|2003|p=191}}}}

==Description==

This film records women from [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], and [[Senegal]] discussing their lives.{{sfn|Anne Laure Folly - WMM}}
The opening sequence of this film, Folly's second, has a young woman staring into the camera and reciting the poem:
{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;A good woman should obey her husband at all times,
A good woman should not know how to read,
A good woman's eyes should not be open.{{sfn|Thackway|2003|p=156}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}
The poem is recited by [[Monique Ilboudo]] of [[Burkina Faso]], one of the women portrayed in the documentary.{{sfn|Curry|2004|p=86}}
The film lets different women from [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], Burkina Faso and [[Benin]] talk about how they deal with the issues they are facing. Seven sections cover the subjects of [[clitoridectomy]], forced marriage, [[HIV/AIDS]], struggle, survival, economics and politics. It shows the paradox in which women have great responsibility for the survival and welfare of their families, but are given little voice in major decisions.{{sfn|Thackway|2003|p=157}}

==Reception==

The film won the Silver Medal at the 1994 Monte Carlo Television Festival.{{sfn|Anne Laure Folly - WMM}} 
According to Kenneth W. Harrow, the film has a "rational substratum and structuring".{{sfn|Harrow|1999|p=235}}
The film tries to communicate a universally valid value system for women.{{sfn|Harrow|1999|p=2385}}
[[Alice Walker]] said of the film:
{{blockquote|It takes courage to see the true condition of women in the world and to speak out about it. Courage and a strong stomach. The women in this film possess the necessary radical vision that neither romanticizes nor renders remote the obvious consequences of female enslavement.{{sfn|Femmes aux yeux ouverts - California Newsreel}}}}

== Plot ==
The main character in the film is a teenager named Lyoscha - enthusiastic computer games player, spending all his time in special clubs. Following his passion, he almost did not pay attention to others: neither to his mother, who was distressed by the fact that her son had dropped out of studies, nor to his girlfriend Katya, who was in love with him, nor to any of his friends. In an environment of professional gamers Lyoscha becomes one of the best, followed by victories in multiple competitions. In an effort to become the best he embarks on an international gaming tournament in [[Los Angeles]], but he takes only the second place. After returning home, Lyoscha gets rid of his gaming devices, and for the first time during the entire film, a smile appears on his face.&lt;ref name="Абдуллаева"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Венжер"/&gt;

== Reception ==

"'''Happiness Is a Warm Gun'''" is a song by [[the Beatles]], featured on the double album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as The White Album), which was released on 22 November 1968. Although credited to [[Lennon–McCartney]], it was written by [[John Lennon]].{{sfn|Spizer|2003|pp=107-108}}

==Writing and inspiration==
According to Lennon, the title came from a magazine cover that producer [[George Martin]] showed him: "I think he showed me a cover of a magazine that said 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun.' It was a gun magazine. I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something."{{sfn|Wenner|2000|pp=114–115}}  The gun magazine derived the phrase from the bestselling book by ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoonist [[Charles M. Schulz]], ''Happiness is a Warm Puppy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=September 19, 2011 | title=100 Greatest Beatle Songs | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/happiness-is-a-warm-gun-19691231 | access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Lennon said he "put together three sections of different songs&amp;nbsp;... it seemed to run through all the different kinds of rock music..."{{sfn|Wenner|2000|pp=114–115}} and described it as a miniature "history of rock and roll."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Everything Fab Four |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2016 |isbn=1440844275 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a three-part [[through-composed]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.11.17.3/mto.11.17.3.osborn.html|title = Understanding Through-Composition in Post-Rock, Math-Metal, and other Post-Millennial Rock Genres|last = Osborn|first = Brad|date = 2011|journal = Music Theory Online|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 17| issue =  3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song begins with surreal imagery allegedly taken from an [[LSD|acid]] trip that Lennon and [[Derek Taylor]] experienced, with Taylor contributing the opening lines.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=257}} The three sections of the song were described by Lennon as "the dirty old man...the junkie...and the gunman."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Everything Fab Four |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2016 |isbn=1440844275 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the studio==
"Happiness Is a Warm Gun" reportedly is [[Paul McCartney]]'s and was [[George Harrison]]'s favourite song on the White Album.{{sfn|Spizer|2003|p=108}} Although tensions were high among the band during the album's recording sessions, they reportedly collaborated as a close unit to work out the song's challenging rhythmic and metre issues.{{sfn|Inglis|2000}} Recording of the song began at 7 pm in Studio Two at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London on 23 September 1968, continued over the following two nights, with daytime breaks, and was completed at 5 am on 26 September.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1995|p=300}} [[Piano]], [[electronic organ]] and [[tuba]] parts in this recording are unattributed; the tuba was all but removed through mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewisohn|1995|p=300}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|Spignesi|2004|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; George Martin was on holiday while this song was recorded, and had left a note asking [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] to take over as producer.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1995|pp=298–301}}

==Personnel==
According to [[Ian MacDonald]]:{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=279}}

*[[John Lennon]] &amp;ndash; [[doubletracking|double-tracked]] lead vocal, electric guitar, backing vocal
*[[Paul McCartney]] &amp;ndash; bass guitar, backing vocal
*[[George Harrison]] &amp;ndash; lead guitar, backing vocal
*[[Ringo Starr]] &amp;ndash; drums, tambourine

==Interpretations==
Many different interpretations of the song have been offered. Some writers have suggested that the "warm gun" could refer to Lennon's sexual desire for [[Yoko Ono]].{{sfn|Marck|2009}} In his 1980 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview Lennon admitted to the double meaning of guns and sexuality but denied that the song had anything to do with drugs: "that was the beginning of my relationship with Yoko and I was very sexually oriented then."{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=188}} American and British censors were unhappy with the song, and it was banned by the [[BBC]].{{sfn|Dowlding|1989|p=230}}

"'''Hellfire'''" is a song from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] [[1996 in film|1996]] [[animated feature]] ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. The song is sung by the film's main [[antagonist]], [[Judge Claude Frollo]], who is voiced by [[Tony Jay]].

When sinful thoughts regarding the beautiful [[Romani people|Romani]] woman [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]] enter Frollo's mind, he "panics and seeks to rid himself of [its] source". This internal struggle prompts "Hellfire", which has been described as "one of the best Disney villain songs of all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/movie-review-the-hunchback-of-notre/ | title=Movie Review: The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frollo "confronts his [[lust]]ing for Esmeralda, blaming her for turning towards darkness, and pleading to be saved". He sings "destroy Esmeralda, and let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone" while the image of Esmeralda "provocatively dances in front of him".&lt;ref name="denofgeek"&gt;{{cite web |  first=Simon|last=Brew|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/17457/looking-back-at-disney%E2%80%99s-the-hunchback-of-notre-dame | title=Looking back at Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre Dame | website=[[Den of Geek]]| publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]| location=New York City| date=May 16, 2011 | accessdate=January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "scene of lust and longing" that the song is centered on received much press coverage at the time of the film's release, along with the alterations made to give the film a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|"G" rating]].

=="Heaven's Light" and "Hellfire"==
The song was intended to contrast with the song "[[Heaven's Light]]", which was sung by [[Quasimodo]] moments earlier, expressing his desire for love and hope that Esmeralda may love him, while "Hellfire" focuses on Frollo's [[internal conflict]] between his feelings of lust for her and his piety and hatred of the Gypsies.

Both songs, which are sometimes referred to collectively as "Heaven's Light"/"Hellfire" (for example on [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]], in which it is track 7), describe two opposing views towards the same woman. Quasimodo sees love as "Heaven's Light" and expresses a pure hope for Esmeralda, while Frollo feels only lust for her and therefore views her as a "Hellfire".&lt;ref name="Griffin, Sean 217–8"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sean| last=Griffin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=id1MiOWqirgC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22the+hunchback+of+notre+dame%22+hellfire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9uvrUPnWJeWtiQfd2oCoBw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20hunchback%20of%20notre%20dame%22%20hellfire&amp;f=false | title=Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out | date=February 1, 2000 | accessdate=January 8, 2013 |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] | location=New York City| pages=217–8 | isbn= 0814731236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Brew of ''[[Den of Geek!]]'' argues that throughout the song Frollo goes through a similar kind of torture that Quasimodo puts himself through in "Heaven's Light".&lt;ref name="denofgeek" /&gt;

=== Other languages ===
Underlining the strong link between the two songs, the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] version enclosed them in one track, giving only one title: "Himmel og Helvete" meaning "Heaven and Hell".

==Composition==
{{Listen|type=music|pos=right|filename=Hellfire from Hunchback of Notre Dame.ogg|title=Hellfire|description=This 30 second excerpt of "Hellfire" illustrates Frollo's internal struggle. The clip includes the final part of verse 1 and the beginning of chorus 1.}}

It begins in [[Bb major|B flat major]], before turning to its [[relative minor]] [[G minor|G]]. It soon modulates briefly into [[C minor]], then [[F major]], has a spoken intersection where the bass lies on A, [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] of [[D minor]], the key in which the song finally ends.

"Hellfire" contains parts of the [[Confiteor]], a [[Latin language|Latin]] prayer of confession used by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. This prayer begins directly after "Heaven's Light" and serves as the introduction to "Hellfire". It also provides counterpoint material throughout the song, whose ending also contains the "[[Kyrie|Kyrie Eleison]]".

The instrumental accompaniment to the song serves as a musical motif that alters in tone depending on the action. As well as some variations heard early on (such as in "[[The Bells of Notre Dame]]"), this motif "informs much of the score that chronologically follows in the film." Reviewer Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com]] adds that "both 'Paris Burning' and 'Sanctuary!' explicitly continue the instrumental backdrop and Latin chanting of 'Hellfire', a sound that becomes more general in 'And He Shall Smite the Wicked'."&lt;ref name="filmtracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/hunchback.html |title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Alan Menken) |publisher=Filmtracks |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "the opening fanfare is also reintroduced at the end of 'Heaven's Light', makes up the melody during the chorus of 'Hellfire', and plays in the instrumental 'Sanctuary!'"

==Visual sequence==
[[Image:Frollohellfire.PNG|Frollo's lustful vision of Esmeralda from his fireplace.|thumb]]
The beginning of the song starts with the Archdeacon swinging the incense-filled [[thurible]], as he and his altar servers walk through [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], chanting the beginning of the [[Confiteor]]. The camera pans upwards to the famous [[rose window]], and flies through it and over Paris, revealing that all the lights in the city are going out as people are turning in for the night. The only light that remains is the light in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]] where Frollo looks out at Notre Dame from his window, singing to the [[Virgin Mary]] (whom he addresses as "Beata Maria", in [[Latin language|Latin]]) about how she knows he is "a righteous man" and purer than "the common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd". Frollo walks to the fireplace and fearfully asks Mary to tell him why he lusts for Esmeralda if he is pure. During this, a fire apparition of Esmeralda dances provocatively in the flames.

During the second verse, Frollo steps back from the fireplace, revealing a piece of silk that Esmeralda had used to tease him earlier in the film. Frollo sings about how he lusts for her and resents her for it. He accuses her of turning him to [[sin]] and denies his own culpability as red-hooded figures rise from the floor, chanting "''[[mea culpa]]''" ("my fault"). Frollo runs through the chamber, with the cloaked figures standing on either side of him. He desperately pleads with them for forgiveness, claiming that Esmeralda had cast a spell on him and tempted him. He asks if it is in a part of God's plan that God made [[the Devil]] stronger than "a man," though in reality this refers to (Frollo) himself. The hooded figures turn into flames, wrapping Frollo as they return to the fireplace as if he was being dragged down into [[Hell]], thereby foreshadowing his fate.

Frollo continues singing, pleading to Mary to rescue him from Esmeralda's voluptuous temptations that would lead to his eternal [[damnation]]. He holds out the scarf and clenches it angrily, stating that Esmeralda must choose him or burn. The fire apparition of Esmeralda reappears, but her provocative dancing is replaced by her shriek-filled writhing as she is about to burn. A smoke apparition of Esmeralda emerges from the fireplace (pictured above), and as it and Frollo embrace passionately, there is a knock at the door. The apparition disappears as a guard enters, informing Frollo that Esmeralda escaped from the Cathedral of Notre Dame where Frollo had "imprisoned" her. Frollo vows to find her, even if it involves burning down all of Paris. The guard then leaves, and Frollo continues singing, claiming that he will give Esmeralda an ultimatum: she must choose to be his lover or she will burn. Frollo then throws Esmeralda's scarf into the fireplace, symbolically burning her as well.

In the final verse, Frollo backs up against a wall, and asks God to have mercy on both him and Esmeralda, implying that he ultimately knows that his actions are against God's will. As he sings, shadowy figures holding crucifixes emerge from the light of the fireplace and fly past Frollo, who then drops to his knees, saying that Esmeralda will be his lover or she will burn. Finishing the song, Frollo passes out and falls face down on the floor in the shape of a crucifix as the fire fades.

==Production==
The producers of Disney's adaptation of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' stated that they felt that the "Hellfire" scene was important in portraying Frollo as he was in [[Victor Hugo]]'s [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame|original novel]]. They hoped that this sequence would be one of the greatest animated sequences ever produced.  Frollo was animated by Kathy Zielinski and the sequence was [[storyboard]]ed by French animators [[Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi]], who were the heads of the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] satellite studio in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="ParisStudio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swarden|first=Anne|date=1997-01-01 |title=Parisian Moviegoers Flock To See Hunchback |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19970101&amp;id=tFhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wugMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5979,121705 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2014-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of fire, smoke, and shadows in the sequence required significant support from the Feature Animation visual effects department.&lt;ref name=audiocommentary /&gt; According to one of the film's directors, [[Kirk Wise]], Frollo's song "Hellfire" needed a visual sequence more meaningful and powerful than past Disney animated features, akin to the ''Night on Bald Mountain'' sequence in Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), which depicted the devil [[Chernabog]] rallying his demons for a single night.

In the audio commentary on ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' DVD, Wise described his fear that he would have to plead with Feature Animation chairman [[Roy E. Disney]] and Walt Disney Company CEO [[Michael Eisner]] to let them do the sequence. The two executives ended up enjoying the idea, and no plea was needed.&lt;ref name=audiocommentary&gt;Trousdale, Gary; Wise, Kirk; and Hahn, Don (2006). DVD audio commentary for ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''. Walt Disney Home Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise also indicated that he and visual effects artistic supervisor [[Chris Jenkins (film producer)|Chris Jenkins]] wanted to make sure the "fire-spirit" shots of Esmeralda in the sequence would not endanger the film's possibilities of earning a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|"G" rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].  Thus, they went through every frame to ensure that Esmeralda's figure was fully clothed at all times,&lt;ref name=audiocommentary/&gt; despite her provocative dancing.

==Themes==
The Latin Chant in the background is the Confiteor, which is a Catholic penitential prayer recited during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as an "admission of guilt and wrongdoing". There is a sense of dramatic irony throughout the song as Frollo sings "It's not my fault / I'm not to blame / It is the gypsy girl / The witch who sent this flame / It's not my fault / If in God's plan / He made the devil so much / Stronger than a man", to which the priests (at this point of the song represented by ominous red-hooded figures) reply in a counterpoint melody with "''Mea culpa''", Latin for "My fault", or "''Mea maxima culpa''", meaning "My most grievous fault"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpx.de/fp/Disney/Lyrics/Hunchback.html|title=Song Lyrics: Hunchback of Notre Dame|website=Fpx.de|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An analysis at "Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins" suggests that the Confiteor chant "manifest[s] as his conscience", and reveals to Frollo "the truth of his actions in regard to lust," which is "a craving for sexual intimacy," leading him to self-indulgence. This "desire for the flesh of another" is a sin, which Frollo struggles over until the very end of his life. Even "when Frollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake in front of the cathedral he offers Esmeralda a chance to live if she agrees to be his lover." The article "''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'': The House of the Lord" in ''The Gospel According to Disney'' suggests that "Frollo is tortured by his lust for Esmeralda, an unrequited passion that curdles into obsessive hatred", and argues that Frollo "prays to be delivered from his sin, prostrating himself before a roaring fire, with a cross above it," and while being presented with two paths, he ultimately chooses lust which leads to his downfall. This sin of the villain is compared to [[Jafar (Aladdin)|Jafar]]'s greed for power at the end of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. When Frollo is about to kill Quasimodo and Esmeralda, he quotes a biblical verse (supporting the notion that he justifies his wrongdoings as God's will): "And [[God|He]] shall smite the [[Witch|wicked]] and plunge them into the [[Hell|fiery pit]]!" ''The Gospel According to Disney'' describes what happens next as follows, "Just then, the judge falls to his own death [a pit of fire], in an act of divine intervention."&lt;ref name="disneyandsin.weebly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://disneyandsin.weebly.com/lust.html | title=Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins|website=Sisneyandsin.weebly.com | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Miles of Laughingplace.com analyses "Hellfire" by saying that the song marks the turning point when "Frollo's hate for the gypsies has taken on a new dimension", and is "no longer about ending vice and sin [but] about fulfilling his own desires". The scarf he takes from Esmeralda "symboli[zes] the physical manifestation of his desire for [her]", and the resulting internal struggle is illustrated in the song. His life's work involves making the city of Paris "pure and righteous", and no matter how much he wants to be too, he sees a "flame...burning within him" and so turns to God (represented by Mary in the song, notable that in his lust he prays to the Holy Virgin) to "help him overcome those feelings". However throughout his pleading, he holds onto the scarf, thereby holding onto the sin. He tries to rationalize the sin before the "judges of his heart", and seems to be returned to purity, but after the judges disappear the temptation returns. Though he sings "Protect me, Maria" with "repentant agony on his face", he stares into the fireplace and holds onto the scarf, giving into temptation. After being "interrupted by the soldier, he makes a decision within his heart to hold on to the sin". Because the "desire [is now] firmly rooted [within him], he is able to throw away the scarf - the external representation of his inner feelings - into the fire as he has fully accepted this persona. After doing this, he "realizes his mistake, and visually, we see the spiritual battle for his soul--crosses rising above shadowy spiritual figures--but even then, he reconfirms his resolution and proclaims that "she will be mine or she will burn."&lt;ref name="laughingplace"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.laughingplace.com/news-id180330.asp | title=101 Reasons: The Hunchback of Notre Dame | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sean Griffin in his work ''Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out'' says that Frollo's hate for Esmeralda seems to stem from his hatred of his own feelings. His shame of "turning to sin" overwhelms him, and he turns to blaming and punishing others. He says that although Frollo's lust for Esmeralda is strictly heterosexual, his behaviour "mirrors conclusions from studies about homophobia...unconscious conflicts about one's own sexuality or gender identity." He argues that "Frollo's grim determinations to punish Esmeralda [throughout 'Hellfire']" are sparked from his own denial that he has "'urges' that fall outside the rigid parameters of social acceptance."&lt;ref name="Griffin, Sean 217–8"/&gt;

Miles argues that the "Archdeacon acts as a foil for Frollo" because through his "caring for Quasimodo's dead mother, he exhibits the kindness and love that God calls all Christians to, which is what Frollo fails to understand". He shows Esmeralda compassion while Frollo only feels contempt towards her. He also "does what Frollo should have done" by "direct[ing] her attention to God." The climax of this is when "he leads a prayer in Latin that calls upon God, Mary, the archangel Michael, the apostles, the saints, and...the Father, for forgiveness of sin in thought, word, and deed." This leads straight into "Hellfire". Miles says that "while the Archdeacon turns from sin, Frollo chooses to toy with sin."&lt;ref name="laughingplace" /&gt;

There is a juxtaposition of imagery between [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] between the two parts of "Heaven's Lights"/"Hellfire".

==Home media release==
The [[LaserDisc]] provided the [[song demo]] for "Hellfire", as well as for "The Bells of Notre Dame" and "[[Out There (song)|Out There]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/hunchback.htm | title=Review | website=DVDizzy.com | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The song was universally acclaimed, and it is considered to be one of the highlights of the [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (soundtrack)|soundtrack to ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'']] which in turn received mixed reviews. The general consensus is that if the direction taken with "Hellfire" had been taken for the other songs, the film as a whole would have been substantially better.

In a review of the film's soundtrack, Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com]] stated that "the darkest depths of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' exist in 'Hellfire', one of the most stunning visual and aural combinations in animation history." Though the film was aimed at children as well as adults, Clemmensen comments that the "constantly frightening Latin chants and a heavy string, timpani, and choral bass" scared the younger demographic (despite attempts at lighthearted music and humour to dilute the film). He argues that if Disney had fully embraced the dark nature of the source material by building the soundtrack upon numbers like "Hellfire" and "Sanctuary!", "the film could have been a brilliant adult feature." He says the "spattering of comedy pieces", which include three "silly songs", are "a significant detriment to the gains of the aforementioned themes and performances", and ultimately cause both the film and soundtrack to be a "mixed bag." Pieces such as "Hellfire" are "serious, dramatically brilliant [and among] some of Menken's very best work."&lt;ref name="filmtracks" /&gt; Later on in his review, Clemmensen notes the Latin mass which leads into "[Tony] Jay's hauntingly deep performance of Frollo's torment," and adds that it "produc[es] a song so overwhelmingly compelling in an evil sense that it alone was worth the cost of admission (and the album)."&lt;ref name="filmtracks" /&gt;

Jim Miles of Laughingplace.com says that "Frollo's passionate pleading" is "visually astounding, masterfully conceived and animated," and the "standout" of the film. He adds that "accompanied by intense music of agony and complex lyrics of psychological revelation, 'Hellfire' is everything a musical scene aspires to be."&lt;ref name="laughingplace" /&gt; Reviewer Kenneth E. Rathburn said the song's "grandeur... contributes and fulfills" more than other songs, such as "[[A Guy Like You]]", making it one of the better tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sputnikmusic.com/review/52185/Disney-Soundtracks-The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame/ | title=Disney Soundtracks The Hunchback of Notre Dame | date=September 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | author=Rathburn, Kenneth E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Smith of the [[BBC]] describes the tone (set by the opening number) as "an unholy marriage of the Tridentine Mass and Les Mis." He says the score, "driven by hysterical choirs and crashing percussion" is most effective in "Hellfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fd54 | title=Alan Menken The Hunchback of Notre Dame Review | date=2004-08-10 | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | author=Smith, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' described it as ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''{{'}}s "true show-stopping tune."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB03D7CAECF7FF2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title='Hunchback' entertains, yet keeps its message | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | first=Larry | last=Ratliff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Brew of ''Den of Geek!'' says the suffering Frollo goes through in this song makes him a "far more rounded villain." He describes "Hellfire" as "a stunning piece of work, with the visuals and music working in complete tandem."&lt;ref name="denofgeek" /&gt;

Internet comedian [[Doug Walker (actor)|Doug Walker]], a fan of the movie, named it the No. 1 villain song on his list of the top 11 villain songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://channelawesome.com/nostalgia-critic-top-11-villain-songs/|title=Top 11 Villain Songs|website=Channelawesome.com|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The song is considered to be one of the darkest in any Disney film, depicting [[Hell]], [[sin]], [[damnation]], and [[lust]]; examples of subject matter that would generally be considered [[inappropriate for children]]. This song and visual sequence prompted the ratings board to consider a PG rating for the film. In its defense, Disney claimed that its adaptation of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' was intended to play as much to adult audiences as it would to children. The studio attempted to produce an animated film with an audience broader than only children: the main target audience of Disney animated features.

In ''Film Genre 2000: New Critical Essays'', film critic Marc Miller said that "Hellfire" "was too much for many adults," which prompted reviewers such as Mark Silver of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' to say things like: "[''Hunchback'' is] a beautiful powerful film that I would not recommend to children under eight or nine years old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marc|last=Miller|editor-first=Wheeler W.|editor-last=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgzACTHIAcsC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22the+hunchback+of+notre+dame%22+hellfire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J_brUJ6PKIznkgX394A4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20hunchback%20of%20notre%20dame%22%20hellfire&amp;f=false | title=Film Genre 2000: New Critical Essays | chapter=Of Tunes and Toons|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|date=2000| page=54| ISBN=978-0791445143|accessdate=January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animator Floyd Norman recalled the pitching session for the musical, in which Menken and Schwartz were "on hand to perform the songs that would grace the production." He recalls "Hellfire" "clearly ha[ving] the executives squirming nervously," wondering if this material could be in a Disney film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Floyd|last=Norman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMK9MQLnRCEC&amp;pg=PT109&amp;dq=%22the+hunchback+of+notre+dame%22+hellfire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J_brUJ6PKIznkgX394A4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAjgK | title=Animated Life: A Lifetime of tips, tricks, techniques and stories from a Disney Legend | chapter=Monster in the Bell Tower|page=109|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=Abingdon, England|date=2013|accessdate=January 8, 2013|ISBN=978-1136126376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hellfire" subplot, "involving the villain’s need to desire to screw and/or murder the heroine because of his guilt-ridden lustings for her," which was described as "a cross between ''[[Schindler’s List]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]''" by Scott Mendelson of HollywoodNews.com, was also referred to by him as one of the Disney events such as [[Mufasa]] being killed onscreen in ''The Lion King'', that surprisingly were given "G-ratings from the [[MPAA]] back in the 1990s," which Mendelson uses as context when discussing ''[[Tangled]]''{{'}}s PG rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott|last=Mendelson|url=http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/10/18/cartoon-movies-are-having-a-hard-time-getting-g-ratings-these-days/ | title=Cartoon movies are having a hard time getting "G" ratings these days | website=HollywoodNews.com|date=October 18, 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious conservatives boycotted ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' due to this song, which they said was "a suggestive rejection of purity amplified by imagery of a half-naked Esmeralda dancing in a fire."&lt;ref name="filmtracks" /&gt;

'''John Cyril Cranko''' (15 August 1927 – 26 June 1973) was a South African born ballet dancer and [[choreographer]] with the [[Royal Ballet]] and the [[Stuttgart Ballet]].

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Cranko was born in [[Rustenburg]] in the former province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], [[South Africa]].  As a child, he would put on puppet shows as a creative outlet.  Cranko received his early ballet training in Cape Town under the leading South African ballet teacher and director, [[Dulcie Howes]], of the [[University of Cape Town]] Ballet School. In 1945 he choreographed his first work (using Stravinsky's Suite from ''The Soldier's Tale'') for the Cape Town Ballet Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuttgart-ballet.de/company/john-cranko/ "John Cranko"], Stuttgart Ballet, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to London, studying with the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in 1946 &lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Dromgoole, Nicholas. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30978 "John Cranko"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', retrieved 19 March 2015, {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dancing his first role with the Sadler's Wells Ballet in November 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohcollections.org.uk/SearchResults.aspx?searchtype=performance&amp;page=0&amp;person=Cranko "John Cranko"], Royal Opera House Performance Database, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===London===
Cranko collaborated with the designer [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] on ''Sea Change'', performed at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin]] in July 1949. They collaborated again for Sadler's Wells Ballet on ''The Shadow'', which opened on 3 March 1953.&lt;ref name=RCM2008_94&gt;Reed, Cooke &amp; Mitchell, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; This period marked a transition in Cranko's career from dancer to full-time choreographer, with his last performance for the Sadler's Wells Ballet taking place in April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohcollections.org.uk/SearchResults.aspx?searchtype=performance&amp;page=2&amp;person=Cranko "John Cranko"], Royal Opera House Performance Database, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At 23 years old, he was appointed as resident choreographer for Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet's 1950–51 season.&lt;ref&gt;"John Cranko", Programme booklet for ''[[Onegin (Cranko)|Onegin]]'', Royal Opera House, Covent Garden 2014–2015 season, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

For the company's [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951 Cranko choreographed the comic [[ballet]] ''[[Pineapple Poll]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = John Cranko - Pineapple Poll - YouTube| accessdate = 2018-08-31| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SJG89TSSw8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the music of [[Arthur Sullivan]] (newly out of copyright) arranged by the conductor [[Charles Mackerras]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another collaboration with Mackerras followed in 1954 with ''[[The Lady and the Fool]]'', to music by [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In January 1954 Sadler's Wells Ballet announced that Cranko was collaborating with [[Benjamin Britten]] to create a ballet. Cranko devised a draft scenario for a work he originally called ''The Green Serpent'', fusing elements drawn from ''[[King Lear]]'', ''Beauty and the Beast'' (a story he had choreographed for Sadler's Wells in 1948) and the oriental tale published by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] as ''Serpentin Vert''. Creating a list of dances, simply describing the action and giving a total timing for each, he passed this to Britten and left him to compose what eventually became ''[[The Prince of the Pagodas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Cooke &amp; Mitchell, pp. 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranko wrote and developed a musical revue ''Cranks'', which opened in London in December 1955, moved to a West End theatre the following March, and ran for 223 performances. With music by [[John Addison]], its cast of four featured the singers [[Anthony Newley]], [[Annie Ross]], Hugh Bryant and the dancer Gilbert Vernon; it transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Bijou Theatre (Manhattan)|Bijou Theatre]]. An original cast CD has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Cranks | publisher =The Guide to Musical Theatre | date =2014 | url =http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_c/cranks.htm | accessdate = 26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranko followed the format of ''Cranks'' with a new revue ''New Cranks'' opening at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith on 26 April 1960 with music by David Lee and a cast including [[Gillian Lynne]], [[Carole Shelley]] and [[Bernard Cribbins]], but it failed to have the same impact.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1960, Cranko directed the first production of Benjamin Britten's opera ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', at the [[Aldeburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;"A New Midsummer Night's Dream", ''The Times'', 11 June 1960, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When the work had its London premiere the following year at Covent Garden, Cranko was not invited to direct, and [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]] was brought in.&lt;ref&gt;"London Triumph for Britten's Dream", ''The Times'',  3 February 1961, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuttgart===
Prosecuted for homosexual activity, Cranko left the UK for Stuttgart, and in 1961 was appointed director of the Stuttgart Ballet,&lt;ref name=RCM2008_94/&gt; where he assembled a group of talented performers such as [[Marcia Haydée]], [[Egon Madsen]], [[Richard Cragun]], [[Birgit Keil]] and [[Suzanne Hanke]]. Among his following choreographies were ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Cranko)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] in 1962, set to music by [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], ''[[Onegin (Cranko)|Onegin]]'' in 1965, an adaptation of the verse novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' by [[Alexander Pushkin]], set to music by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] (mainly ''[[The Seasons (Tchaikovsky)|The Seasons]]''), orchestrated by [[Kurt-Heinz Stolze]], ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (ballet)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' by Shakespeare in 1969, ''Brouillards'' in 1970, ''Carmen'' in 1971 (music by [[Wolfgang Fortner]] and [[Wilfried Steinbrenner]]) and ''Spuren (Traces)'' in 1973.

Cranko's work was a major contribution to the international success of German ballet beginning with a guest performance at the New York [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1969. At Stuttgart, Cranko invited [[Kenneth MacMillan]] to work with the company, for whom MacMillan created four ballets in Cranko's lifetime and a fifth, ''[[Requiem (MacMillan)|Requiem]]'', as a tribute after Cranko's death.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, pp. 711–716&lt;/ref&gt; At Cranko's instigation the company established its own ballet school in 1971; it was renamed the John Cranko Schule in his honour in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.john-cranko-schule.de/history/ "History"] John Cranko Schule, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His assistant and choreologist [[Georgette Tsinguirides]] preserved his works in [[Benesh Movement Notation]].

Cranko choked to death after suffering an allergic reaction to a sleeping pill he took during a transatlantic charter flight from Philadelphia to Stuttgart two days after the company completed a successful tour of the United States at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in Philadelphia. The flight made an emergency landing in Dublin where Cranko was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="John Cranko Dies at 45; Stuttgart Ballet Director"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/27/archives/john-cranko-dies-at-45-stuttgart-ballet-director-hurok-pays-tribute.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York ''Times''|date=June 27, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother, Grace, who was divorced from Herbert and lived in what was then [[Rhodesia]], heard about his death from a radio broadcast. Cranko was buried at a small cemetery near [[Castle Solitude]] in Stuttgart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Legacy===
In 2007, the Stuttgart Ballet celebrated what would have been Cranko's 80th birthday with the Cranko Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/de/das-stuttgarter-ballettwunder/1634898,CmC=1634922.html "Das Stuttgarter Ballettwunder"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112217/http://www.arte.tv/de/das-stuttgarter-ballettwunder/1634898%2CCmC%3D1634922.html |date= 2 April 2015 }}, Arte,  retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet ''Voluntaries'' by [[Glen Tetley]] was created in his memory. The John Cranko Society in Stuttgart, founded in 1975, promotes knowledge of ballet and Cranko's work, supports performances and talented dancers, and every year presents the John Cranko Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.john-cranko-gesellschaft.de/web/aktuelles.html "Aktuelles"], John-Cranko-Gesellschaft, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julia B. Cameron''' (born March 4, 1948&lt;ref name="Floor Sample"&gt;Floor Sample, by Julia Cameron, (Tarcher, 2006; {{ISBN|1-58542-494-3}}), a memoir&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American teacher, author, artist, poet, playwright, novelist, filmmaker, composer, and journalist. She is best known for her book ''[[The Artist's Way]]'' (1992). She also has written many other non-fiction works, short stories, and essays, as well as novels, plays, musicals, and screenplays.

==Biography==
Julia Cameron was born and raised in a Chicago suburb, and grew up [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]. She started college at [[Georgetown University]] before transferring to [[Fordham University]]. She wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and then ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref name=taw.com-bio&gt;{{cite web

She met [[Martin Scorsese]] when interviewing him for ''Rolling Stone''. They married in 1976 and divorced a year later in 1977; Cameron was Scorsese's second wife. They have one daughter, [[Domenica Cameron-Scorsese]], born in 1976. Cameron and Scorsese collaborated on three films.

Cameron's memoir ''Floor Sample'' details her descent into alcoholism and drug addiction, which induced blackouts, paranoia and psychosis.&lt;ref name=amazon-review-floor-sample&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron stopped abusing drugs and alcohol, and began teaching creative unblocking, eventually publishing the book based on her work: ''The Artist's Way''.&lt;ref name=amazon-review-floor-sample /&gt; She contends that creativity is an authentic spiritual path.&lt;ref name=taw.com-bio /&gt;

Cameron has taught filmmaking, creative unblocking, and writing. She has taught at The [[Smithsonian]], [[Esalen]], the [[Omega Institute for Holistic Studies]], and the New York Open Center.&lt;ref name=taw.com-bio /&gt; At [[Northwestern University]], she was writer in residence for film.&lt;ref name=taw.com-bio /&gt; In 2008 she taught a class at the New York Open Center, ''The Right to Write,'' named and modeled after one of her bestselling books, which reveals the importance of writing. She continues to teach regularly around the world.

Cameron has lived in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name="PW Floor Sample review"&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 20, 2006 |title=Floor Sample: A Creative Memoir.

The '''''Libro de Alexandre''''' is a [[Old Spanish|medieval Spanish]] [[epic poem]] about [[Alexander the Great]] written between 1178 and c. 1250 in the ''[[mester de clerecía]]''.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh&gt;Colbert Nepaulsingh, "''Libro de Alexandre''", in Germán Bleiberg, Maureen Ihrie, and Janet Pérez, edd., ''Dictionary of the Literature of the Iberian Peninsula'', pp. 40&amp;ndash;42 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely based on the ''[[Alexandreis]]'' of [[Walter of Châtillon]], but also contains many fantastical elements common to the [[Alexander romance]]. It consists of 2,675 stanzas of ''[[cuaderna vía]]'' and 10,700 lines. 

[[File:F 45v del Libro de Alexandre (ms O).jpg|thumb|Alexander as portrayed in MS ''O'']]
The ''Libro'' is preserved in two manuscripts, called ''P'' and ''O'', neither of which appears to be an original.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; There are as well three fragments preserved in separate manuscripts. Manuscript ''O'' is the earlier, copied around 1300, and includes 2,510 stanzas of ''cuaderna vía'' and two epistles. It was once owned by the [[Duke of Osuna]] (whence ''O'') and was known to the [[Marqués de Santillana]].&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; ''P'', from [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Paris]], was copied in the fifteenth century and contains 2,639 stanzas. It is generally more reliable and together the two manuscripts make a coherent whole. R. S. Willis, Jr., produced an edition of both manuscripts where a page from ''O'' faces the corresponding page from ''P'', with fragments noted at the bottom, so that one reading can readily be corrected by the other text.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; ''O'' is generally considered to be from eastern [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], while ''P'' was copied in western Castile. The fragment ''G′'' is named after [[Gutierre Díez de Gamés]], who included stanzas from the first part of the ''Libro'' in his early fifteenth-century ''[[El Victorial|Victorial]]''.&lt;ref name=pountain&gt;Christopher J. Pountain, ''A History of the Spanish Language Through Texts'' (Routledge, 2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The date of composition is uncertain. However, it must postdate 1178, the earliest year when Walter completed the ''Alexandreis'', and predate 1250, the approximate date of the ''[[Poema de Fernán González]]'', which it influences. Some scholars have fixed the date as between 1202 and 1207.&lt;ref&gt;Such a date excludes Berceo as a possible author, as he would only have been a child at the time of composition.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the ''Alexandreis'', the author of the ''Libro'' claimed many sources. In his own words: ''el uno que leyemos, el otro que oyemos / de las mayores cosas Recabdo vos daremos'' ("the one that we read, the other that we hear / of the greatest things collected we give you").&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; These sources include the ''[[Historia de proeliis]]'' of [[Leo of Naples]] and several ancient authorities, including Leo's source, [[Quintus Curtius]], [[Flavius Josephus]], and the ''[[Pindarus Thebanus]]''.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; The work of [[Isidore of Seville]] and the [[Old French]] ''[[Roman d'Alexandre]]'' were also consulted. 

Structurally the ''Libro'' is a chronological story of Alexander's life set between an introduction in six stanzas and a conclusion in seven. There are digressions and authorial displays of erudition, but the narrative, from birth to death, is logical and smooth.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; The problem of authorship is unresolved. It has been variously attributed to [[Juan Lorenzo de Astorga]] (sometimes thought to be merely a scribe), [[Alfonso X of Castile]], and [[Gonzalo de Berceo]].&lt;ref name=pountain/&gt;

Following is a sample text from the ''Libro'', with translations in Modern Spanish and English. This fragment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marín|first1=Francisco Marcos|title=Libro de Alexandre|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/libro-de-alexandre--0/html/ff1d1018-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_16.html|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sums up the fall of Alexander because of his pride.

'''''Lunar Park''''' is a mock [[memoir]] by American writer  [[Bret Easton Ellis]]. It was released by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in 2005. It was the first book written by Ellis to use [[past tense]] [[narrative]].&lt;ref name=bookclub/&gt; The title bears no relation to the public amusement locations known as Luna Park.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins with an inflated and parodic but reasonably accurate portrayal of Ellis's early fame. It details incidents of his rampant drug use and his publicly humiliating book tours to promote ''[[Glamorama]]''. The novel dissolves into fiction as Ellis describes a liaison with an actress named Jayne Dennis, whom he later marries, and with whom he conceives a child. From this point, the fictional Ellis' life reflects the real writer's only in some descriptions of the past and possibly in his general sentiments.

Ellis and Jayne move to fictional Midland, an affluent suburban town outside New York City, which they no longer consider safe due to pervasive terrorist acts in a post-9/11 America.  Fictional incidents include suicide bombings in [[Wal-Mart]]s and a [[dirty bomb]] detonated in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/050816-lunarpark/|first=Jeff|last=Gomez|title=Dark Side of the Moon|date=16 August 2005|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Ellis-writes-himself-into-suburbs-2647761.php|first=Christine|last=Thomas|title=Ellis writes himself into suburbs|date=14 August 2005|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strange incidents start happening on a Halloween night, some involving a Terby doll belonging to Ellis's fictional stepdaughter Sarah.

As the novel progresses, the haunting of Ellis's house and questions over the death of his father become increasingly prominent. With his history of drug use and alcoholism, his wife, children and housekeeper are understandably skeptical of his claims that the house is haunted. Unfolding events only very gradually reveal a much more complicated situation than a simple haunting. There is a dynamic interplay between the author's dead father, the house itself and specific negative associations buried within the author's own subconscious mind. Added to all of this is the very late-breaking and almost gratuitous insinuation that Robby, the narrator's young son, may somehow be at the epicenter of all these events.

== Characters ==
Several of the characters are fictionalized portrayals of real people. Most notable among these is Ellis himself, but others include friend and fellow author [[Jay McInerney]] and Ellis's late father.

* Bret Easton Ellis - Novelist who rose to fame while still at college with his debut novel ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]''; now lives in the suburbs with old flame Jayne Dennis. There are considerable differences between this Ellis and the author himself, although there are also crucial similarities. The fictional Bret attended [[Camden College (fictional college)|Camden College]], the fictional [[liberal arts college]] which recurs in his novels.
* Jayne Dennis - Fictional film star, married to Bret Easton Ellis. Said to have dated many men, including [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] amongst others. As part of the marketing campaign a website was created, www.jaynedennis.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jayne Dennis|url=http://www.jaynedennis.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625011422/http://www.jaynedennis.com/|archivedate=25 June 2010|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of doctored images and a fictional filmography. Some of the pictures of Dennis on the stills page are of actress [[Cynthia Gibb]]. It is noted in a disclaimer on the stills page that the site is a work of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is Jayne Dennis?|url=http://www.jaynedennis.com/credit.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525083422/http://www.jaynedennis.com/credit.html|archivedate=25 May 2010|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robby - Bret and Jayne's eleven-year-old son.
* Sarah - Jayne's six-year-old daughter and Bret's stepdaughter.
* Robert Ellis - Bret's father, deceased.
* [[Patrick Bateman]] - Serial killer from ''[[American Psycho]]''. Rumored to be responsible for murders in the local suburbia.
* Donald Kimball - Detective from ''American Psycho''. Questions Ellis about the aforementioned Bateman-inspired murders. Kimball appears to be an example of Bret's fictional world crossing over with his "real" world, one which Bret does not pick up on. Later, Bret discovers the name to be an alias.
* Mitchell Allen - Mitchell Allen is Bret's neighbour, and is a minor character from ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. Bret remembers going to college with him at Camden, and even remembers details of Mitchell's alleged affair with fictional character Paul Denton. The narrator doesn't seem aware of this crossover between fiction and reality. The author has commented that he is "not quite sure how [Mitchell] ended up on Elsinore Lane or why I put him there" but also adds that "maybe I found Mitchell Allen pretty amusing in ''The Rules of Attraction'' and as a private joke that would only mean something to me decided to place him next door to the narrator of ''Lunar Park.''"&lt;ref name=RandomQ&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375412912&amp;view=qa|title=A Conversation with Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing the character allowed Ellis to "riff on Camden College... and men of a certain age."&lt;ref name=bookclub&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/jul/26/bret-easton-ellis-guardian-book-club|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Guardian book club: John Mullan meets Bret Easton Ellis|accessdate=2010-08-14|date=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clayton - College student who Bret notices strikingly resembles Patrick Bateman, a young Bret, and in name resembles Clay from ''Less Than Zero''.
* Aimee Light - A graduate student writing her thesis on Bret.
* [[Jay McInerney]] - Easton's contemporary and friend; author of ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]''

==Development==
Ellis finished writing the novel in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{cite news |title = Lunar Exorcises Ellis' Ghosts |first = John Joseph |last = Adams |authorlink=John Joseph Adams |url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37989 |work = [[Syfy|SCI FI Wire]] |date = 14 September 2006 |accessdate = 2013-08-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207023448/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37989 |archivedate = 7 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis said the book was an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Stephen King]] and the comic books he loved as a child.&lt;ref name="scifi" /&gt;

Ellis told the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' that the Terby "is based on a [[Furby]] but also there was this bird-like doll that my older sister had and I wrote a short story about it when I was 7 or 8. She used to scare me with it, I'd go to my bedroom and get into bed and it'd be there, she'd hide it there just to scare me. Or I'd be walking up the stairs and she'd chase me with it. And I think that's what I was channelling and it fitted in to all the other things that I was haunted by.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/arts/literature/s/177/177300_behind_brets_mask.html|title=Behind Bret's mask|date=10 October 2005|publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation that 'Terby' is in fact 'Y Bret' (Why, Bret?) spelt backwards is an homage to the "redrum" (murder spelt backwards) plot device in King's ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabotagetimes.com/people/patrick-bateman-was-me/ |title=The great Bret Easton Ellis on sex, drugs, being gay, clothes, skin disease, the casting couch, American Psycho and his new book Imperial Bedrooms. |accessdate=January 31, 2011 |date=January 31, 2011 |work=Sabotage Times |last=Brown |first=James |authorlink=James Brown (editor) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414191008/http://www.sabotagetimes.com/people/patrick-bateman-was-me/ |archivedate=April 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Kracht|Kracht, C.]], &amp; [[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], [http://www.wehrhahn-verlag.de/index.php?section=abisz&amp;subsection=details&amp;id=577 ''Five Years, Vol. 1''] ([[Hannover]]: [[:de:Wehrhahn Verlag|Wehrhahn Verlag]], 2011), pp. 140, 188, 192, 196, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book carries an epigraph from [[Hamlet]] 1.v.98. This connects with the theme of haunting by a father as well as the names in the book (e.g. Elsinore, Osric, Fortinbras).

==Reception==
The novel was nominated for a [[World Fantasy Award]] in the [[World Fantasy Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] category in 2004.&lt;ref name="scifi" /&gt;

'''Mary Murillo''' (born 22 January 1888, [[Bradford, England]] – died 4 February 1944 [[Ickenham, England]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebioscope.net/2009/11/05/searching-for-mary-murillo/ The Bioscope, Reporting on the world of early and silent cinema: ''Searching for Mary Murillo'' 5 November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; was an actress, screenwriter and businesswoman.

[[File:Marymurillo.JPG|thumbnail|Mary Murillo (1918)]]

==Early life==
Mary Murillo was the illegitimate daughter of Sarah Mary Peacock (née Sunter). In 1894 her mother married Edward O'Connor, a Roman Catholic Irish commercial traveller, and she was raised as '''Mary O'Connor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaston, Maurice and Mary|url=http://lukemckernan.com/2015/05/16/gaston-maurice-and-mary/|website=Luke McKernan}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the eldest of four sisters (she also had an elder step-sister, Isabel Peacock, who later appeared in American films as [[Isabel Daintry]]). She was educated at St Monica's, Skipton, Yorkshire, and at the Convent of the Sacred Heart School in Roehampton. She adopted the professional name Mary Murillo after being compared in looks to a Murillo painting of the Madonna. 

==Career==
In 1908 she traveled to America with her step-sister to start a stage career and in February 1909 made her debut in the chorus of the Broadway musical comedy ''Havana''. She toured the United States, finding only small parts until 1913, when she started sending scenarios to film companies. Her first script to be accepted was bought by the husband-and-wife team of Phillips Smalley and Lois Weber. Other commissions followed, and the first film known to be credited to her is ''A Strand of Blond Hair'' (1914), a [[Vitagraph]] comedy short starring [[John Bunny]] and [[Flora Finch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenandsilentbritishcinema.wordpress.com/the-women/mary-murillo/mary-murillo-career-overview Profile of Mary Murillo at womenandsilentbritishcinema.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote five melodramas for [[Theda Bara]] during the 1910s popularity of [[Vamp (woman)|vamp]] films. She also wrote for Bara's Fox rival [[Valeska Suratt]]. Murillo served as screenwriter for [[Fox Film]] from 1916–1917, then joining [[Norma Talmadge]] Productions in 1919. She returned to the UK in 1923 to work for [[Stoll Film Studios]]. She wrote the script for the hit French sound film ''Accusée, levez-vous!'' (1930).&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenandsilentbritishcinema.wordpress.com/the-women/mary-murillo/mary-murillo-career-overview Profile of Mary Murillo at womenandsilentbritishcinema.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 she formed the company Opticolor to market in Britain a French motion picture colour system, Francita, developed by her husband Maurice Velle, son of French film pioneer [[Gaston Velle]], but the business failed after a disastrous demonstration of the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/timeline-entry/1269/#/&lt;/ref&gt; She later worked for [[J. Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank]]'s Religious Films Ltd.

A selection of films made by Mary Murillo, Maurice Velle and Gaston Velle was featured at Il Cinema Ritrovato film festival in [[Bologna]] in June/July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Velle Connection 1900-1930: Gaston, Maurice and Mary Murillo|url=http://festival.ilcinemaritrovato.it/en/sezione/i-velle-un-affare-di-famiglia-1900-1930-gaston-maurice-e-mary-murillo|website=Il Cinema Ritrovato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''miniature''', which is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''miniare'' ("to colour with ''minium''," a [[red lead]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=80|year=1855|issue=6|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a small illustration used to decorate an [[ancient history|ancient]] or [[medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]]; the simple illustrations of the early [[codex|codices]] having been miniated or delineated with that [[pigment]]. The generally small scale of the medieval pictures has led secondly to an [[etymological]] confusion of the term with minuteness and to its application to small paintings, especially [[portrait miniature]]s,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Miniature |volume=18 |pages=523–528 |first=George Charles |last=Williamson |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did however grow from the same tradition and at least initially used similar techniques.

Apart from the Western and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] traditions, there is another group of [[Asia]]n traditions, which is generally more illustrative in nature, and from origins in manuscript book decoration also developed into single-sheet small paintings to be kept in albums, which are also called miniatures, as the Western equivalents in [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] and other mediums are not. These include [[Persian miniature]]s, and their [[Mughal painting|Mughal]], [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman]] and other [[Indian miniature painting|Indian offshoots]].

==Italy and Byzantium, 3rd&amp;ndash;6th centuries==
[[File:CottonGenesisFragment26vAbrahamAndAngels.JPG|thumb|200px|Miniature of [[Abraham]] meeting [[angel]]s, from the [[Cotton Genesis]], 5th&amp;ndash;6th century.]]
The earliest extant miniatures are a series of colored drawings or miniatures cut from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Iliad]]'' from the 3rd century. They are similar in style and treatment with the pictorial art of the later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]. In these pictures there is a considerable variety in the quality of the drawing, but there are many notable instances of fine figure-drawing, quite classical in sentiment, showing that the earlier art still exercised its influence. Such indications, too, of landscape as are to be found are of the classical type, not conventional in the sense of medieval conventionalism, but still attempting to follow nature, even if in an imperfect fashion; just as in the Pompeian and other [[fresco]]es of the Roman age.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Of even greater value from an artistic point of view are the miniatures of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript of [[Virgil]], known as the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]], of the early 5th century. They are in a more perfect condition and on a larger scale than the Ambrosian fragments, and they therefore offer better opportunity for examining method and technique. The drawing is quite classical in style, and the idea is conveyed that the miniatures are direct copies from an older series. The colors are opaque: indeed, in all the miniatures of early manuscripts the employment of body color was universal. The method followed in placing the different scenes on the page is highly instructive of the practice followed, as we may presume, by the artists of the early centuries. It seems that the background of the scene was first painted in full, covering the whole surface of the page; then, over this background were painted the larger figures and objects; and over these again the smaller details in front of them were superimposed. (The [[painter's algorithm]].) Again, for the purpose of securing something like [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], an arrangement of horizontal zones was adopted, the upper ones containing figures on a smaller scale than those below.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:ViennaDioscoridesFolio3v7Physicians.jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature of seven physicians from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], early 6th century.]]

It was reserved for the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] school to break away more decidedly from the natural presentment of things and to develop artistic conventions. Yet in the best early examples of this school the classical sentiment still lingers, as the relics of the miniatures of the [[Cotton Genesis]], and the best of the miniatures of the [[Vienna Dioscurides]] testify; and in the miniatures of the later Byzantine manuscripts, which were copied from earlier examples, the reproduction of the models is faithful. But on comparing the miniatures of the Byzantine school generally with their classical predecessors, one has a sense of having passed from the open air into the [[cloister]]. Under the restraint of ecclesiastical domination Byzantine art became more and more stereotyped and conventional. The tendency grows to paint the flesh-tints in swarthy hues, to elongate and emaciate the limbs, and to stiffen the gait. Browns, blue-greys and neutral tints are in favor. Here we first find the technical treatment of flesh-painting which afterwards became the special practice of Italian miniaturists, namely the laying on of the actual flesh-tints over a ground of olive, green or other dark hue. Landscape, such as it was, soon became quite conventional, setting the example for that remarkable absence of the true representation of nature which is such a striking attribute of the miniatures of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

And yet, while the ascetic treatment of the miniatures obtained so strongly in Byzantine art, at the same time the Oriental sense of splendour shows itself in the brilliancy of much of the coloring and in the lavish employment of gold. In the miniatures of Byzantine manuscripts are first seen those backgrounds of bright gold which afterwards appear in such profusion in the productions of every western school of painting.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The influence of [[Byzantine art]] on that of medieval [[Italy]] is obvious. The early [[mosaic]]s in the churches of Italy, such as those at [[Ravenna]] and [[Venice]], also afford examples of the dominating Byzantine influence. But the early Middle Ages provide but few landmarks to guide the student; and it is only when he emerges into the 12th century, with its frescoes and miniatures still bearing the impress of the Byzantine tradition, that he can be satisfied that the connection has always existed during the intervening centuries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Northwest Europe, 8th&amp;ndash;12th centuries==
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|200px|This lavishly decorated text that opens the [[Gospel of John]] in the [[Book of Kells]], early 9th century, shows the [[Insular art|Insular]] style of illumination: decorative and not illustrative.]]

In the native schools of illumination of Western Europe, decoration only was the leading motive. In the manuscripts of the [[Merovingian]] period, in the school which connected [[Francia|Frankland]] and northern Italy, and which is known as [[Lombards|Lombardic]] or Franco-Lombardic, in the manuscripts of [[Spain]], in the productions of the [[Insular art]] of the [[British Isles]], figure-drawing was scarcely known, serving rather as a feature of decoration than as a representation of the human form.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] school, developed especially at [[Canterbury]] and [[Winchester]], which probably derived its characteristic free-hand drawing from classical Roman models, scarcely influenced by the Byzantine element. The highest qualities of the miniatures of the 10th and 11th century of this school lie in fine outline drawing, which had a lasting influence on the English miniature of the later centuries. But the southern Anglo-Saxon school rather stands apart from the general line of development of the western medieval miniature.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Under the [[Carolingian]] monarchs there developed a school of painting derived from classical models, chiefly of the Byzantine type. In this school, which owed its origin to the encouragement of [[Charlemagne]], it is seen that the miniature appears in two forms. First, there is the truly conventional miniature following the Byzantine model, the subjects being generally the portraits of the [[Four Evangelists]], or portraits of the emperors themselves: the figures formal; the pages brilliantly colored and gilded, generally set in architectural surroundings of a fixed type, and devoid of landscape in the real sense of the word. Accompanied as it was with profuse decoration in border and initial, it set the pattern for the later Continental schools of the West. On the other hand, there is also the miniature in which there is an attempt at illustration, as, for example, the depicting of scenes from the [[Bible]]. Here there is more freedom; and we trace the classical style which copies Roman, as distinguished from Byzantine, models.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:BendictionalStEthewoldlBaptismChristFol25.jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature of the [[baptism]] of [[Christ]] from the [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold]], 10th century, is an example of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] school.]]

The influence which the Carolingian school exercised on the miniatures of the southern Anglo-Saxon artists shows itself in the extended use of body-color and in the more elaborate employment of gold in the decoration. Such a manuscript as the [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold]], [[bishop of Winchester]], 963 to 984, with its series of miniatures drawn in the native style but painted in opaque pigments, exhibits the influence of the foreign art. But the actual drawing remained essentially national, marked by its own treatment of the human figure and by the disposition of the drapery with fluttering folds. The style was refined, tending to exaggeration and disproportion of the limbs. With the [[Norman Conquest]] this remarkable native school died.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

With the awakening of art in the 12th century the decoration of manuscripts received a powerful impulse. The artists of the time excelled in the border and the initial, but in the miniature also there was vigorous drawing, with bold sweeping lines and careful study of the draperies. The artists grew more practiced in figure-drawing, and while there was still the tendency to repeat the same subjects in the same conventional manner, individual effort produced in this century many miniatures of a very noble character.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Norman Conquest had brought England directly within the fold of Continental art; and now began that grouping of the French and the English and the [[Flanders|Flemish]] schools, which, fostered by growing intercourse and moved by common impulses, resulted in the magnificent productions of the illuminators of north-western Europe from the latter part of the 12th century onwards.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

But of natural landscape there is nothing, unless rocks and trees of a stereotyped character can be so regarded. Hence the background of the miniature of the 12th and immediately succeeding centuries became the field for decoration to throw into stronger relief the figures in the scene. And thus arose the practice of filling in the entire space with a sheet of gold, often burnished: a brilliant method of ornament which we have already seen practiced in the Byzantine school. We have also to notice the conventional treatment of the sacred figures, which continue henceforward, from a sense of veneration, to be clad in the traditional robes of the early centuries, while the other figures of the scene wear the ordinary dress of the period.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Pala Indian miniatures, 8th - 12th centuries ==
[[File:MET DP238217.jpg|thumb|400px|Bengal Folio Painting, early 12th century.]]
Under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala Dynasty]] miniature painting was introduced in India by painting on buddhist [[Palm-leaf manuscript|palm leaf manuscripts]]. One of the  earliest surviving examples of Buddhist illustrated palm leaf manuscripts is [[Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā]] dated to 985 AD preserved in the University of Cambridge library&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01464/5|title=Sanskrit Manuscripts : Prajñāpāramitāstotra, Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā|website=Cambridge Digital Library|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The art of Pala illuminated manuscripts developed in Buddhist centers of [[Nalanda|Bihar]] and [[Somapura Mahavihara|Bengal]]. The Pala miniature paintings not only inspired Nepalese and Tibetan miniature paintings but also inspired hinduism and jainism to develop their own miniature painting traditions in the later period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=FTVD4FtUHp0C&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=pala+illuminated+manuscripts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sKOip2-I5Q&amp;sig=e7AxjnuL8HJnpXSPXbq-8JQ8MrE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjakJTa87PbAhVOU30KHTxLDcQQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=pala%20illuminated%20manuscripts&amp;f=false|title=Art of Tibet: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection|last=Art|first=Los Angeles County Museum of|last2=Pal|first2=Pratapaditya|last3=Richardson|first3=Hugh|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780875871127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northwest Europe, 13th&amp;ndash;15th centuries==
[[File:Melusinediscovered.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Miniature ''Roman de Mélusine'' [[Guillebert de Mets]], 1410.]]
Entering the 13th century, we reach the period when the miniature may be said to justify the modern false etymology which has connected the title with minuteness. The broad, bold style of the 12th century gives place to the precise and minute. Books in general exchanged their form from the large [[Book size|folio]] to the [[octavo]] and smaller sizes. There was a greater demand for books; and [[vellum]] was limited in quantity and had to go further. Handwriting grew smaller and lost the roundness of the 12th century. Contractions and abbreviations in the texts largely increased in number. Everywhere there is an effort to save space. And so with the miniature. Figures were small, with delicate strokes in the features and with neat slim bodies and limbs. The backgrounds blaze with color and burnished gold; and delicate diaper patterns of alternate gold and color abound. Frequently, and especially in English manuscripts, the drawings are merely tinted or washed with transparent colors. In this century, too, the miniature invades the initial. Whereas in the earlier periods bold flowering scrolls are the fashion, now a little scene is introduced into the blank spaces of the letter.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

To compare the work of the three schools, the drawing of the English miniature, at its best, is perhaps the most graceful; the French is the neatest and the most accurate; the Flemish, including that of western Germany, is less refined and in harder and stronger lines. As to colors, the English artist affects rather lighter tints than those of the other schools: a partiality is to be observed for light green, for grey-blue, and for lake. The French artist loved deeper shades, especially ultramarine. The Fleming and the German painted, as a rule, in less pure colors and inclined to heaviness. A noticeable feature in French manuscripts is the red or copper-hued gold used in their illuminations, in strong contrast to the paler metal of England and the Low Countries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Breviary of Chertsey Abbey (folio 6r).jpg|thumb|200px|A capital S contains a miniature of [[Moses]] being found by the [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter. From the Breviary of Chertsey Abbey, 14th century.]]

It is remarkable how the art of the miniature throughout the 13th century maintains its high quality both in drawing and color without any very striking change. Throughout the century the [[Bible]] and the [[Psalter]] were in favor; and naturally the same subjects and the same scenes ran through the period and were repeated by artist after artist; and the very character of those sacred books would tend to restrain innovation. But towards the close of the period such secular works as the romances were growing in popularity, and afforded a wider field for the invention of the illustrating artist. Therefore, with the opening of the 14th century a palpable change of style supervenes. We pass to more flowing lines; not to the bold sweeping strokes and curves of the 12th century, but to a graceful, delicate, yielding style which produced the beautiful swaying figures of the period. In fact the miniature now begins to free itself from the role of an integral member of the decorative scheme of illumination and to develop into the picture, depending on its own artistic merit for the position it is to hold in the future. This is shown by the more prominent place that the miniature now assumes, and by its growing independence of the decorative border and initial.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

But, at the same time, while the miniature of the 14th century thus strives to dissociate itself from the rest of the illuminated details of the manuscript, within itself it flourishes in decoration. Besides the greater elasticity of the figuredrawing, there is a parallel development in the designs of the backgrounds. The diapers become more elaborate and more brilliant; the beauty of the burnished gold is enhanced by the stippled patterns which are frequently worked upon it; the gothic canopies and other architectural features which it became the practice to introduce naturally followed the development of the architecture of the period. In a word, the great expansion of artistic sentiment in decoration of the best type, which is so prominent in the higher work of the 14th century, is equally conspicuous in the illuminated miniature.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the early part of the century, English drawing is very graceful, the figures bending with a waving movement which, if they were not so simple, would be an affectation. Both in the outline specimens, washed with transparent color, and in the fully. painted examples, the best English work of this time is unsurpassed. French art still maintains its neat precision, the colors more vivid than those of England and the faces delicately indicated without much modelling. The productions of the Low Countries, still keeping to the heavier style of drawing, appear coarse beside the works of the other schools. Nor does German miniature art of this period hold a high position, being generally mechanical and of a rustic character. As time advances the French miniature almost monopolizes the field, excelling in brilliancy of coloring, but losing much of its purity of drawing although the general standard still remains high. The English school gradually retrogrades and, owing no doubt to political causes and to the wars with France, appears to have produced no work of much value. It is only towards the end of the 14th century that there is a revival.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

This revival has been attributed to a connection with the flourishing school of [[Prague]], a school which in the scheme of coloring suggests a southern influencefollowing on the marriage of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] with [[Anne of Bohemia]] in 1382. The new style of English miniature painting is distinguished by richness of color, and by the careful modelling of the faces, which compares favorably with the slighter treatment by the contemporary French artists. Similar attention to the features also marks the northern Flemish or Dutch school at this period and in the early 15th century; and it may therefore be regarded as an attribute of Germanic art as distinguished from the French style.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
[[File:Angers Book of Hours (folio 13r).jpg|thumb|200px|The prayer ''obsecro te'' illustrated by a miniature of the [[pietà]], from the [[Book of Hours]] of [[Angers]], c. 1470s.]]
The promise of the new development in English miniature painting, however, was not to be fulfilled. In the first quarter of the 15th century, examples of great merit were produced, but at a standstill in drawing and fettered by medieval convention. The native art practically came to a close about the middle of the century, just when the better appreciation of nature was breaking down the old conventional representation of landscape in European art, and was transforming the miniature into the modern picture. Whatever miniature painting was to be produced in England after that time was to be the work of foreign artists or of artists imitating a foreign style. The condition of the country during the [[Wars of the Roses]] sufficiently accounts for the abandonment of art. Thus the history of the miniature in the 15th century must be sought in the manuscripts of the Continental schools.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

First we have to consider northern France and the Low Countries. As it passes out of the 14th and enters the 15th century, the miniature of both schools begins to exhibit greater freedom in composition; and there is a further tendency to aim rather at general effect by the coloring than neatness in drawing. This was encouraged by the wider field opened to the miniaturist. Books of all kinds were illustrated, and sacred books, [[Bible]]s and [[Psalter]]s and [[liturgical book]]s, were no longer the chief, if not the only, manuscripts which were illuminated. And yet there was one class of manuscript which came into the greatest prominence and which was at the same time liturgical. This was the ''Horae'', or [[Book of Hours]], devotional books for individual use, which were multiplied in vast numbers and contained some of the finest work of the miniaturists. The decoration of these little volumes escaped in great measure from the conventional restraints which their religious character might have imposed. Furthermore, the demand for illuminated manuscripts had by this time established a regular trade; and their production was not confined, as formerly, to the cloister.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Notable secular illuminated manuscript artists include [[Master Honoré]] of the Parisian school.

[[File:Enkhuisen Book of Hours (folio 39v).jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] discovering [[Jesus]] among the doctors. From the [[Enkhuizen]] [[Book of Hours]], late 15th century.]]

Early in the century the old conventional treatment of landscape still held its own; nor did the diapered and gilded background pass out of use. Indeed, in some of the finest French specimens of the time the diapered patterns are more brilliant than ever. But natural scenery in the second quarter of the century asserts itself more decidedly, although with faults in perspective. It was not until another generation had arisen that there was a true appreciation of the horizon and of atmospheric effect.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The miniatures of the French and Flemish schools run fairly parallel for a time, but after the middle of the century national characteristics become more marked and divergent. The French miniature began to deteriorate, though some very fine examples were produced by the more gifted artists of the school. The figure-drawing was more careless, and the painting tended to hardness without depth, which the artist endeavoured to relieve by an excess of gilt shading.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Flemish school in the latter part of the 15th century attained to its highest excellence. The Flemish miniature affected extreme softness and depth of color; also an ever-increasing carefulness in the treatment of details, of the draperies, of the expression of the features: the Flemish type of the Virgin's face, for example, with its full, high forehead, can never be mistaken. In the best Flemish miniatures of the period the artist succeeds in presenting a wonderful softness and glow of color; nor did the high standard cease with the 15th century, for many excellent specimens still remain to attest the favor in which it was held for a few decades longer.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the foregoing remarks what has been said in regard to the careful treatment of details applies still more to the miniatures executed in [[grisaille]], in which the absence of color invited an even stronger accentuation of that treatment. This is perhaps most observable in the grisaille miniatures of northern [[Flanders]], which often suggest, particularly in the strong angular lines of the draperies, a connection with the art of the wood engraver.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Italy, 13th&amp;ndash;15th centuries==
[[File:Milan Book of Hours (Annunciation to the Shepherds).jpg|thumb|200px|Miniature of the Annuciation to the Shepherds, from a [[Book of Hours (Milan, Biblioteca Trivulziana, Cod. 470)]].]]

The Flemish miniature did not, however, hold the favor of western Europe without a rival. That rival had arisen in the south, and had come to perfection concurrently with the miniature of the Low Countries in the 15th century. This was the Italian miniature, which passed through the same stages as the miniatures of England and France and the Low Countries. Intercommunication between the countries of Europe was too well established for the case to be otherwise. In Italian manuscripts of the normal type the influence of Byzantine art is very manifest during the 13th and 14th centuries. The old system of painting the flesh tints upon olive green or some similar pigment, which is left exposed on the lines of the features, thus obtaining a swarthy complexion, continued to be practiced in a more or less modified form into the 15th century. As a rule, the pigments used are more opaque than those employed in the northern schools; and the artist trusted more to color alone to obtain the desired effect than to the mixture of color and gold which gave such brilliant results in the diapered patterns of France. The vivid scarlet of the Italian miniaturists is peculiarly their own. The figure-drawing is less realistic than the contemporary art of English and French manuscripts, the human form being often thick-set. In general, the Italian miniature, before its great expansion in the 14th century, is far behind the miniatures of the north. But with the 15th century, under the influence of the [[Renaissance]], it advanced into the front rank and rivalled the best work of the Flemish school. The use of thicker pigments enabled the miniaturist to obtain the hard and polished surface so characteristic of his work, and to maintain sharpness of outline, without losing the depth and richness of color which compare with the same qualities in the Flemish school.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Italian style was followed in the manuscripts of [[Provence]] in the 14th and 15th centuries. It had its effect, too, on the school of northern France, by which it was also influenced in turn. In the manuscripts of southern Germany it is also in evidence. But the principles which have been reviewed as guiding the development of the miniature in the more important schools apply equally to all. Like the miniature of the Flemish school, the Italian miniature was still worked to some extent with success, under special patronage, even in the 16th century; but with the rapid displacement of the manuscript by the [[printing|printed book]] the miniaturist's occupation was brought to a close.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{{main|Persian miniature}}

[[Persian art]] has a long tradition of the use of miniatures.

[[Reza Abbasi]] (1565–1635), considered one of the most renowned Persian painters of all time, specialized in the Persian miniature, with a preference for naturalistic subjects. Today his surviving works can be found in many of the major museums of the [[Western world]], such as the [[Smithsonian]], the [[Louvre]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

==Mughal miniatures==

Mughal painting developed during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] (16th - 18th centuries) and was  generally confined to miniatures either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums. It emerged from the Persian miniature painting tradition introduced to India by [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] and [[Abd al-Samad]] in the mid 16th century.  It soon moved away from its [[Safavid art|Safavid origins]]; with the influence of Hindu artists, colors became brighter and compositions more naturalistic. The subject matter was predominantly secular, mainly consisting of illustrations to works of literature or history, portraits of court members and studies of nature. At its height the Mughal painting style represented an elegant marriage of Persian, European, and Hindi art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mugh/hd_mugh.htm|title=The Art of the Mughals before 1600 {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Islamic|date=|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motion graphic design''' is a subset of [[graphic design]] in that it uses graphic design principles in a [[filmmaking]] or [[video production]] context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of [[animation]] or [[Film techniques|filmic techniques]]. Examples include the [[kinetic typography]] and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, three-dimensional [[station identification]] logos of some [[television channel]]s. The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.

A motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from [[film]]making or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. 

Popular use of motion graphic design is used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction more entertaining. The graphics used in television show introductions will usually represent the tone of the program. For example, high action television shows will contain fast-paced and bold graphics in the openings.

==Technology==
Technological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as [[computer program]]s for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period. Modern motion graphic design typically involves any of several computerized tools and processes.

One of the leading computer programs used by modern motion graphic designers has been [[Adobe After Effects]], which allows the user to create and modify graphics over time. Another relatively recent product used in the market is [[Apple Inc.]] [[Motion (software)|Motion]], now a part of [[Final Cut Studio]]. Software such as Maxon Cinema4D has integrated tools to create motion graphics, such as the native MoGraph plugin, or ICE of Softimage, which can also be used for similar purposes.

[[Adobe Flash]] has also been widely used to create motion graphic design, particularly for the web, where it is sometimes used in [[web design]], but also in some animation products, such as animated [[web television]] productions like [[Homestar Runner]].

The '''Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg''' (Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra) is a French orchestra based in [[Strasbourg]].  It is one of the two permanent orchestras of the [[Opéra national du Rhin]] (the other being the [[Orchestre symphonique de Mulhouse]]). The orchestra's current principal venue is the [[Palais de la musique et des congrès]] 'Pierre Pflimlin ' (PMC Pierre-Pflimlin, or PMC).

The orchestra was founded in 1855.  Between 1871 and 1918, and 1940 and 1944, the orchestra had been a [[Germany|German]] one, resulting from conflicts between France and Germany over the [[Alsace]] region.  In 1994, the orchestra acquired the official title of ''Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg – orchestre national''.  The orchestra currently holds 110 permanent musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg - orchestre national|url=http://www.philharmonique-strasbourg.com/biographies/ops_vGB.pdf|publisher=philharmonique-strasbourg.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Composers-in-residence included the French composers [[Jean-Louis Agobet]] and [[Philippe Manoury]], the Finnish composer [[Kaija Saariaho]] and the American composer [[John Corigliano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les compositeurs en résidence|url=http://www.philharmonique-strasbourg.com/compositeurs-residence.php|website=philharmonique-strasbourg.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past music directors and chief conductors have included [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Ernest Bour]], [[Jan Latham-Koenig]], [[Charles Bruck]] and [[Alain Lombard]].  [[Marc Albrecht]] became artistic advisor of the orchestra in 2005, and music director in 2008.  Albrecht and the orchestra have recorded commercially for [[PentaTone Classics|PENTATONE]], including orchestral lieder of [[Alban Berg]], and piano concertos by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/04/schumann-dvorak-piano-concerto | title=Schumann: Piano Concerto; Dvorák: Piano Concerto: Helmchen/Strasbourg PO/Albrecht | work=The Guardian | date=2009-12-04 | accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Albrecht concluded his tenure in 2011.

[[File:Konstakademien skulpturmagasin.JPG|thumb|The Royal Academy's sculpture hall in 2010]]
The '''Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts''' ({{lang-sv|Kungliga Akademien för de fria konsterna}}), commonly called the '''Royal Academy''', is located in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. An  independent organization that promotes the development of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other fine arts, it is one of several [[Swedish Royal Academies]]. The [[Royal Institute of Art]], an art school that was once an integral part of the Academy, was broken out in 1978 as an independent entity directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.

==History==
In 1735, [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]] set up a drawing school at Stockholm Castle, naming it the '''Royal Drawing Academy'''. It was modeled after French academies of the day as a gathering place for established artists and art connoisseurs. The painters [[Guillaume Taraval]], [[Johan Henrik Scheffel]], and [[Olof Arenius]] and the architect [[Carl Hårleman]] taught there, and the first group of students included [[Johan Pasch]].  

In 1766, the academy expanded its activities following a parliamentary decree. In 1768, its name was changed to the '''Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture'''. In 1773, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] wrote the first statutes for the academy's organization. At the time, the curriculum spanned architecture, graphics, anatomy, theory of perspective, and cultural history. The late 18th century is considered the first golden age of the Royal Academy, when great artists of the time such as [[Johan Tobias Sergel]] were elected as members and also taught there. In 1810, it was renamed again to Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (Swedish: ''Kungliga Akademien för de fria konsterna''), the name it still bears today. 

By the 1830s, there was beginning to be opposition to the Royal Academy's commitment to traditional [[Academic art|academic art]]. In addition, while both men and women could be elected as members of the academy, at the time women could only study art by special permission before 1864, when women students where accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtsson, Eva-Lena ”Konstakademien och Mejan”, i Kungl. Konsthögskolan Vårutställning 2005 (Utställningskatalog), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm Art Association was formed to offer exhibition alternatives, and an Impressionist artist's group known as "The Opponents" arose as well.

==Location==
In 1780, the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture moved from Stockholm Castle into a 17th  palace designed by the architect [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]] on Fredsgatan street in the city center. In the years 1842–46 it was redesigned by the architect [[Fredrik Blom]] and an extension was added in 1893–96.

The '''Sandbach Crosses''' are two 9th-century stone [[Anglo-Saxon cross]]es now erected in the market place in the town of [[Sandbach]], [[Cheshire]], England.&lt;ref name="ccc"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/sandbach-crosses/history/ | title = History of Sandbach Crosses| accessdate =15 May 2017 | publisher = [[English Heritage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unusually large and elaborate examples of the type and are recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]],&lt;ref name="images"&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1159937|desc= Sandbach crosses|accessdate= 16 August 2012|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1011144|desc= Sandbach Anglo-Saxon crosses|accessdate= 16 August 2012|mode=cs2|ps=none|fewer-links=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The most recent and authoritative dating places the larger cross from the early part of the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, and the smaller from about the middle of that century.&lt;ref name="sandb"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sandbach.gov.uk/Guide/Crosses.htm |title=Saxon Crosses |accessdate=12 October 2007 |publisher=Sandbach Town Council |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Older theories, now outdated, included the view that they were erected to commemorate the conversion to Christianity of [[Peada of Mercia]] about 653.&lt;ref name="richards"&gt;{{citation  | last =Richards | first =Raymond | title =Old Cheshire Churches | publisher =Batsford | year =1947 | location =London | page =290 | oclc =719918 | postscript =&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |url=http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/htmlfiles/sandbach1.html |title=A Scrapbook of Cheshire Antiquities: Sandbach: The Saxon Crosses|accessdate=12 October 2007 |last=Thornber |first=Craig  |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2005 |month= |work= |publisher= |pages=  |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources date them to the 9th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="ccc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="images"/&gt;   The original site of the crosses is unknown and it is believed that they were brought to Sandbach in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="images"/&gt;  The earliest documentary evidence is by William Smith, the [[Rouge-Dragon Pursuivant at Arms]] of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]], who was from [[Nantwich]].

In the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century they were collected together and in 1816 were reassembled and erected under the direction of [[George Ormerod]], the Cheshire historian.&lt;ref name="sandb"/&gt;

The crosses now consist of two upright columns set in sockets on a base of three stepped stones.  The northern cross is the taller and has a mutilated head.  The southern cross is truncated and has a mutilated head from a different cross.&lt;ref name="images"/&gt; The crosses have always been a pair and were carved by the same hand.  They depict religious scenes, doll-like heads and beasts in panels, together with vine-scrolls, course [[Celtic knot|interlace]] patterns and some dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| pages = 574–576| isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
One of the Crosses (before restoration in 1816) appears in a watercolour by [[William Alexander (painter)|William Alexander]], from which they were engraved by [[John Byrne (artist, died 1847)|John Byrne]] and published in ''[[Britannia Depicta]], Part III, Buckinghamshire and Cheshire'' (1810). Examples were sold at [[Sotheby's]] on 22 February 1977, and now appear in the UK's Government Art Collection.&lt;ref&gt;UK, London, Government Art Collection, [http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk/work.aspx?obj=11910 GAC number 13086], retrieved 20 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Prints and engravings are also found at the Cheshire Records Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://archive.cheshire.gov.uk/calmview/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=P+13%2f9%2f14| title = Record| accessdate = 14 September 2013| publisher = Cheshire Record Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Section_break_01_by_Pengo.jpg|thumb|Open pages of the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', showing an ornate section break on the lower left page created from [[asterisk]]s. It is used to signal a pause for the reader and a [[transition (fiction)|transition]] in the narrative.]]
In [[book]]s and [[document]]s, a '''section''' is a subdivision, especially of a [[Chapter (books)|chapter]]. 

Sections are visually separated from each other with a '''section break''', typically consisting of extra space between the sections, and sometimes also by a '''section heading''' for the latter section. They are a concern in the process of [[typography]] and [[pagination]], where it may be desirable to have a [[page break]] follow a section break for the sake of aesthetics or readability.

In [[fiction]], sections often represent [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and accordingly the space separating them is sometimes also called a  '''scene break'''.

==Section form and numbering==

In written narrative such as fiction, sections are not usually numbered or named. Section breaks are used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, [[Point of view (fiction)|point-of-view character]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[tone (literature)|tone]], [[emotion]], and [[pace (speed)|pace]]. As a [[fiction-writing mode]], the section break can be considered a [[transition (fiction)|transition]], similar to a chapter break.

Some documents, especially legal documents, may have numbered sections, such as ''[[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' or ''[[Internal Revenue Code section 183]]''. The [[section sign]] (§) may be used to reference sections and subsections. Subsections are often written in lowercase [[Roman numerals]], e.g. [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution]].

A document may also be considered to be divided into sections by its headings and subheadings, which may be used for a [[table of contents]]. For example, the hierarchical sections used in [[Wikipedia]] can be compiled into a table of contents for an article. Many books, however, only have chapter headings in the table of contents.

While a chapter may be divided by section breaks, a group of chapters is conventionally called a "part", often identified with a Roman numeral, e.g. "Part II".

Reference material may be divided into sections. The [[section headers of a Chinese dictionary]] are one example.

== Flourished section breaks ==

Space between paragraphs in a section break is sometimes accompanied by an [[Asterism (typography)|asterism]] (either proper ⁂ or manual * * *), a horizontal rule, [[fleuron (typography)|fleuron]]s, or other ornamental symbols. An ornamental symbol used as section break does not have a generally accepted name. Such a typographic device can be specifically referred to as ''dinkus'', ''space break symbol'', ''paragraph separator'', ''paragraph divider'', ''horizontal divider'', ''thought break'', or as an instance of ''filigree'' or ''flourish''. Ornamental section breaks can be created using [[glyph]]s, rows of [[lozenge]]s, [[dingbat]]s, or other [[miscellaneous symbols]]. Fonts such as [[Webdings]] and [[Wingdings]] include many such glyphs.

In [[HTML]], horizontal rules can be generated using the &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt; tag, which generates a paragraph-level thematic break. For more ornate presentation, [[CSS]] can be used to replace the line with an image.

The '''Shilpgram Museum''' is a craft village, situated near Ramsinghpura village, 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sawai Madhopur]] in [[India]]. It is a living ethnographic museum depicting the tremendous diversity in crafts, art and culture of various Indian states, especially the western part.

[[File:Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur.jpg|right|Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur]]

==Description==
The foundation stone-laying ceremony of Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, was done by [[Bina Kak]], former Hon'ble Tourism, Art, Culture, Forest and Environment Minister of [[Rajasthan]] on 26 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sawai Madhopur Shilpgram to be Inaugurated Tomorrow|url=http://rajasthantourismbuzz.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/sawai-madhopur-shilpgram-to-be-inaugurated-tomorrow/|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Shilpgram got renovated in 2017 and is being an attractive destination for tourists where the local crafts lure the tourist to spend some time in the tranquility of Ranthambhore. Spreading over 22 acres in land, Shilpgram is a platform where regional handicraft and hand-loom products is developed. Like other Shilpgrams, for example, [[Shilpgram, Udaipur|Udaipur Shilpgram]], tourist interest as well as public utility exhibitions and craft bazaars of handicrafts and handlooms are organized by Shilpgram. Sometimes to showcase their regional cultural heritage, they also organize cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourism Minister Inaugurating Shilpgram Today at Sawai Madhopur|url=http://dainikbhor.com/cities/jaipur/tourism-minister-inaugurating-shilpgram-today-at-sawai-madhopur/|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sphinx''' ({{lang-grc|Σφίγξ}} {{IPA-el|spʰíŋks|}}, [[Aeolic Greek|Boeotian]]: {{lang|grc|Φίξ}} {{IPA-grc|pʰíːks|}}, plural '''sphinxes''' or '''sphinges''') is a [[mythical creature]] with the head of a [[human]] and the body of a [[lion]].

In [[Culture of Greece|Greek tradition]], it has the head of a human, the [[haunches]] of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a [[bird]]. It is mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its [[riddle]] suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hsc.edu/drjclassics/texts/Oedipus/sphinx.shtm |title=Dr. J's Lecture on Oedipus and the Sphinx |publisher=People.hsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallich, Martin.

In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Desmond.

In European decorative art, the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the [[Renaissance]]. Later, the sphinx image, something very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit often interpreted quite differently, due to translations of descriptions of the originals and the evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.

Sphinxes depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal [[tomb]]s or religious temples.

The largest and most famous sphinx is the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], situated on the [[Giza]] Plateau adjacent to the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] on the west bank of the [[Nile River]] and facing east ({{coord|29|58|31|N|31|08|15|E|}}). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. Although the date of its construction is uncertain, the head of the Great Sphinx now is believed to bear the likeness of the pharaoh [[Khafra]].

What names their builders gave to these [[statue]]s is not known. At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 B.C. inscription on a [[stele]] belonging to the [[18th dynasty]] pharaoh [[Thutmose IV]] lists the names of three aspects of the local sun [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of that period, ''[[Khepera]]–[[Rê]]–[[Atum]]''. Many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity [[Sekhmet]], a lioness. Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], with her likeness carved in [[granite]], which is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[alabaster]] [[sphinx of Memphis]], [[Memphis, Egypt]], currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred sphinxes with ram heads, representing [[Amun|Amon]], were built in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], where his cult was strongest.

The Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Regier, Willis Goth. ''Book of the Sphinx'' (Lincoln:  University of Nebraska Press, 2004), 54, 59, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bronze Age]], the Hellenes had trade and cultural contacts with Egypt. Before the time that [[Alexander the Great]] occupied Egypt, the Greek name, ''sphinx'', was already applied to these statues. The historians and geographers of Greece wrote extensively about Egyptian culture. [[Herodotus]] called the [[Sheep|ram]]-headed sphinxes '''Criosphinxes''' and called the [[hawk]]-headed ones '''[[Hieracosphinx]]es'''.

In [[Greek mythology]], a sphinx is represented as a monster with a head of a woman, the body of a [[lion]]ess, the wings of an [[eagle]], and a [[snake|serpent]]-headed tail.

The word ''sphinx'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Σφίγξ, apparently from the verb σφίγγω (''sphíngō''), meaning "to squeeze", "to tighten up".&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfi%2Fggw σφίγγω] at [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that the γ takes on a 'ng' sound in front of both γ and ξ.&lt;/ref&gt; This name may be derived from the fact that, in a pride of lions, the hunters are the lionesses, and kill their prey by strangulation, biting the throat of prey and holding them down until they die.&lt;!--: the following is garbled:the Sphinx has no "given name" and "proper name":This may be her [[proper name]], but ''The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' states that her given name was '''Φιξ&amp;mdash;Phix'''.)--&gt; However, the historian Susan Wise Bauer suggests that the word "sphinx" was instead a Greek corruption of the Egyptian name "shesepankh", which meant "living image", and referred rather to the ''statue'' of the sphinx, which was carved out of "living rock" (rock that was present at the construction site, not harvested and brought from another location), than to the beast itself.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=S.

There was a single ''sphinx'' in Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck. According to [[Hesiod]], she was a daughter of [[Orthrus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+327&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 327]&lt;/ref&gt; and either [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] or the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], or perhaps even [[Ceto]];&lt;ref&gt;Who is meant as the mother is unclear, the problem arising from the ambiguous referent of the pronoun "she" in line 326 of the ''Theogony'', see Clay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2etBN0w0NGUC&amp;pg=PA159 p.159, note 34]&lt;/ref&gt; according to others, she was a daughter of Echidna and [[Typhon]]. All of these are [[chthonic]] figures from the earliest of Greek myths, before the Olympians ruled the Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The Sphinx is called Phix (Φίξ) by [[Hesiod]] in line 326 of the [[Theogony]], the [[proper name]] for the Sphinx noted by [[Pierre Grimal]]'s ''The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology''.

The sphinx was the emblem of the ancient city-state of [[Chios]], and appeared on seals and the obverse side of coins from the 6th century B.C. until the 3rd century CE.

The Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to&lt;!--any other area needs to be made specific--&gt; the Greek city of Thebes, asking a [[riddle]] to travellers to allow them passage. The exact riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the myth, and was not standardized as the one given below until late in Greek history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edmunds|first= Lowell|title=The Sphinx in the Oedipus Legend|year=1981|publisher=Hain|location=Königstein im Taunus|isbn=3-445-02184-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naxos Sphinx with humans for size.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Sphinx of Naxos]], on its 12.5 meters [[Ionic column]], [[Delphi]], 560 B.C. (reconstitution).]]
It was said in late lore that [[Hera]] or [[Ares]] sent the Sphinx from her [[Aethiopia]]n homeland (the Greeks always remembered the foreign origin of the Sphinx) to [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] in Greece where she asked all passersby the most famous riddle in history: "Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?" She strangled and devoured anyone who could not answer. [[Oedipus]] solved the riddle by answering: "Man&amp;mdash;who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], Library [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D8 Apollod. 3.5.8]&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimal| first=Pierre|others=trans. A. R. Maxwell-Hyslop|title=The Dictionary of Classical Mythology|isbn=0-631-20102-5|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996}} (entry "Oedipus", p. 324)&lt;/ref&gt; (but much more rarely), there was a second riddle: "There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?" The answer is "day and night" (both words—''[[wiktionary:ἡμέρα|ἡμέρα]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:νύξ|νύξ]]'', respectively—are feminine in Ancient Greek). This second riddle is also found in a Gascon version of the myth and could be very ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Julien d'Huy (2012). [https://ehess.academia.edu/JuliendHuy/Papers/1949877/LAquitaine_sur_la_route_dOedipe_La_Sphinge_comme_motif_prehistorique._-_Bulletin_de_la_SERPE_61_2012_15-21 L'Aquitaine sur la route d'Oedipe? La Sphinge comme motif préhistorique.] ''Bulletin de la SERPE'', 61: 15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a "[[Liminality|liminal]]" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.

In [[Jean Cocteau]]'s retelling of the Oedipus legend, ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|The Infernal Machine]]'', the Sphinx tells Oedipus the answer to the riddle in order to kill herself so that she did not have to kill anymore, and also to make him love her. He leaves without ever thanking her for giving him the answer to the riddle. The scene ends when the Sphinx and [[Anubis]] ascend back to the heavens.

There are mythic, anthropological, psychoanalytic and parodic interpretations of the Riddle of the Sphinx, and of Oedipus's answer to it. Sigmund Freud describes "the question of where babies come from" as a riddle of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;'An Autobiographical Study', Sigmund Freud, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1963, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xkU5eiigOZoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=freud%20Autobiographical%20Study&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous riddle books use the Sphinx in their title or illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Regier, ''Book of the Sphinx'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Maier]], in his book the ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' (1617)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maier|first=Michael|others=trans. Peter Branwin|title=Atalanta Fugiens|publisher=Johann Theodor de Bry|year=1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes the following remark about the Sphinx's riddle, in which he states that its solution is the [[Philosopher's Stone]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sphinx is indeed reported to have had many Riddles, but this offered to Oedipus was the chief, "What is that which in the morning goeth upon four feet; upon two feet in the afternoon; and in the Evening upon three?" What was answered by Oedipus is not known. But they who interpret concerning the Ages of Man are deceived. For a Quadrangle of Four Elements are of all things first to be considered, from thence we come to the Hemisphere having two lines, a Right and a Curve, that is, to the White Luna; from thence to the Triangle which consists of Body, Soul and Spirit, or Sol, Luna and Mercury. Hence [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rhasis]] in his Epistles, "The Stone," says he, "is a Triangle in its essence, a Quadrangle in its quality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A composite mythological being with the body of a lion and the head of a human being is present in the traditions, mythology and art of South and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Deekshitar, Raja. "Discovering the Anthropomorphic Lion in Indian Art." in ''Marg. A Magazine of the Arts''. 55/4, 2004, p.34-41; [http://www.sphinxofindia.rajadeekshithar.com Sphinx of India].&lt;/ref&gt; Variously known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit, "man-beast"), ''purushamirugam'' (Tamil, "man-beast"), ''naravirala'' (Sanskrit, "man-cat") in India, or as ''nara-simha'' (Sanskrit, "man-lion") in Sri Lanka, ''manusiha'' or ''manuthiha'' (Pali, "man-lion") in Myanmar, and ''norasingh'' (from Pali, "man-lion", a variation of the Sanskrit "nara-simha") or ''thep norasingh'' ("man-lion deity"), or ''nora nair'' in Thailand.

In contrast to the sphinxes in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece, of which the traditions largely have been lost due to the discontinuity of the civilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditions related to the "Asian sphinxes" are very much alive today. The earliest artistic depictions of "sphinxes" from the South Asian subcontinent are to some extent influenced by [[Hellenistic art]] and writings. These hail from the period when Buddhist art underwent [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|a phase of Hellenistic influence]]. Numerous sphinxes can be seen on the gateways of [[Bharhut]] stupa, dating to the 1st Century B.C.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;"Sphinxes of all sorts occur on the Bharhut gateways" {{cite book |last1=Kosambi |first1=Damodar Dharmanand |title=Combined Methods in Indology and Other Writings |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195642391 |page=459 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OhtAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South India, the "sphinx" is known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit) or ''purushamirugam '' (Tamil), meaning "human-beast". It is found depicted in sculptural art in temples and palaces where it serves an [[apotropaic]] purpose, just as the "sphinxes" in other parts of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart.|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. It is therefore often found in a strategic position on the [[gopuram]] or temple gateway, or near the entrance of the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]].

[[File:Purushamrigachidambaram01.JPG|thumb|left|Male purushamriga or Indian sphinx guarding the entrance of the Shri Shiva Nataraja temple in [[Chidambaram]]]]
The ''purushamriga'' plays a significant role in daily as well as yearly ritual of South Indian [[Shaiva]] temples. In the [[shodhasha-upakaara]] (or sixteen honors) ritual, performed between one and six times at significant sacred moments through the day, it decorates one of the lamps of the [[diparadhana]] or lamp ceremony. And in several temples the ''purushamriga'' is also one of the ''[[vahana]]'' or vehicles of the deity during the processions of the [[Brahmotsava]] or festival.
[[File:Manokthiha (Manussiha).png|thumb|Burmese depiction of the Manussiha]]
In [[Kanyakumari district|Kanya Kumari]] district, in the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, during the night of [[Shiva Ratri]], devotees run 75 kilometres while visiting and worshiping at twelve Shiva temples. This [[Shiva Ottam]] (or Run for Shiva) is performed in commemoration of the story of the race between the Sphinx and [[Bhima]], one of the heroes of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

The Indian conception of a sphinx that comes closest to the classic Greek idea is in the concept of the ''[[Sharabha]]'', a mythical creature, part lion, part man and part bird, and the form of Sharabha that god [[Shiva]] took on to counter [[Narasimha]]'s violence.

In [[Sri Lanka]] {{citation needed span|and [[India]],|date=February 2018}} the sphinx is known as ''narasimha'' or man-lion. As a sphinx, it has the body of a lion and the head of a human being, and is not to be confused with [[Narasimha]], the fourth reincarnation of the deity [[Vishnu]]; this [[avatar]] or incarnation is depicted with a human body and the head of a lion. The "sphinx" narasimha is part of the Buddhist tradition and functions as a guardian of the northern direction and also was depicted on banners.

In [[Burma]], the sphinx is known as ''[[Chinthe#Manussiha|manussiha]]'' (''manuthiha''). It is depicted on the corners of Buddhist [[stupas]], and its legends tell how it was created by Buddhist monks to protect a new-born royal baby from being devoured by [[ogre]]sses.

Nora Nair, Norasingh and Thep Norasingh are three of the names under which the "sphinx" is known in [[Thailand]]. They are depicted as upright walking beings with the lower body of a lion or deer, and the upper body of a human. Often they are found as female-male pairs. Here, too, the sphinx serves a protective function. It also is enumerated among the mythological creatures that inhabit the ranges of the sacred mountain [[Himapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himmapan.com/himmapan_lion_thepnorasri.html |title=Thep Norasri |publisher=Himmapan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Europe ==
[[File:La Granja de San Ildefonso Sfinx01.jpg|thumb|[[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], Spain, mid-18th century]]

The revived [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sphinx of the late 15th century is sometimes thought of as the "French sphinx". Her coiffed head is erect and she has the breasts of a young woman. Often she wears ear drops and [[pearl]]s as ornaments. Her body is naturalistically rendered as a recumbent lioness. Such sphinxes were revived when the ''[[Grotesque|grottesche]]'' or "grotesque" decorations of the unearthed  ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' of [[Nero]] were brought to light in late 15th-century Rome, and she was incorporated into the classical vocabulary of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] designs that spread throughout Europe in engravings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sphinxes were included in the decoration of the ''[[loggia]]'' of the [[Vatican Palace]] by the workshop of [[Raphael]] (1515–20), which updated the vocabulary of the Roman ''grottesche''.

The first appearances of sphinxes in French art are in the [[School of Fontainebleau]] in the 1520s and 1530s and she continues into the [[Baroque|Late Baroque]] style of the French [[Regence|Régence]] (1715&amp;ndash;1723). From France, she spread throughout Europe, becoming a regular feature of the outdoors decorative sculpture of 18th-century palace gardens, as in the [[Belvedere (palace)|Upper Belvedere Palace]] in [[Vienna]], [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] in Spain, [[Branicki Palace, Białystok|Branicki Palace]] in [[Białystok]], or the late [[Rococo]] examples in the grounds of the Portuguese [[Queluz National Palace]] (of perhaps the 1760s), with [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]]s and clothed chests ending with a little cape.

[[File:Fernand Khnopff 002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|''Caresses'' (1896) by [[Fernand Khnopff]], a [[Symbolist]] depiction of [[Oedipus]] and the Sphinx&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/-/_AGlYSd0kETwGw |title=Caresses |author= Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |author-link=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |year=2017 |publisher=Google Arts and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sphinxes are a feature of the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior decorations of [[Robert Adam]] and his followers, returning closer to the undressed style of the ''grottesche''. They had an equal appeal to artists and designers of the [[Romanticism]] and subsequent [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] movements in the 19th century. Most of these sphinxes alluded to the Greek sphinx and the myth of [[Oedipus]], rather than the Egyptian, although they may not have wings.

== Freemasonry ==
[[File:Sphinx at Salt Lake Masonic Temple, Utah.JPG|thumb|Sphinx adopted as an emblem in [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture]]

The sphinx image also has been adopted into [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture. Among the Egyptians, sphinxes were placed at the entrance of the temples to guard their mysteries, by warning those who penetrated within that they should conceal a knowledge of them from the uninitiated. [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]] said that the sphinx became successively the symbol of each of the gods. The placement of the sphinxes expressed the idea that all the gods were hidden from the people, and that the knowledge of them, guarded in the sanctuaries, was revealed to initiates only. As a Masonic emblem, the sphinx has been adopted in its Egyptian character as a symbol of mystery, and as such often is found as a decoration sculptured in front of Masonic temples, or engraved at the head of Masonic documents. It cannot, however, be properly called an ancient, recognized symbol of the order. Its introduction has been of comparatively recent date, and rather as a symbolic decoration than as a symbol of any particular dogma. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3557">The '''Teatro Regio Ducal''' (Italian, "Royal Ducal Theatre") was the opera house in [[Milan]] from 26 December 1717 until 25 February 1776, when it was burned down following a [[carnival]] gala. Many famous composers and their operas are associated with it, including the premieres of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Mitridate, re di Ponto]]'', ''[[Ascanio in Alba]]'', and ''[[Lucio Silla]]''. The opera house also saw the premiere of [[Maria Teresa Agnesi Pinottini]]'s ''[[Ciro in Armenia]]'' in  1753; one of the earliest successfully received operas by a female composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Loewenberg|title=Annals of opera, 1597-1940|page=114|publisher= W. Heffer &amp; Son|year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urEfAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Ciro+in+Armenia%22+%22Pinottini%22&amp;dq=%22Ciro+in+Armenia%22+%22Pinottini%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjepdLXkMXKAhWMuIMKHVpaDekQ6AEIPzAF|title=A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-century Woman Mathematician: With Translations of Some of Her Work from Italian Into English|author=Antonella Cupillari|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|year=2007|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variant forms such as ''Regio-Ducal Teatro'' and ''Teatro Regio Ducale'' are also seen. 

The atmosphere in opera houses at the time was very sociable and congenial, and the Teatro Regio Ducal was no exception. The English traveller and music writer [[Charles Burney]] describes its [[Faro (card game)|faro]] tables for gambling, and gives this description:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The theatre here is very large and splendid; it has five rows of boxes on each side, one hundred in each row; and parallel to these runs a broad gallery&amp;nbsp;... as an avenue to every row of boxes: each box will contain six persons, who sit at the sides, facing each other. Across the gallery of communications is a complete room to every box, with a fireplace in it, and all conveniences for refreshments and cards. In the fourth row is a ''pharo'' table, on each side of the house, which is used during the performance of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;Sadie and Zaslaw, pp.&amp;nbsp;214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the destruction of the Teatro Regio Ducal, which had been a wing of the [[Royal Palace of Milan|Palazzo Reale (Royal Palace)]], two new theatres were commissioned to be built near the site, both designed by [[Giuseppe Piermarini]]. The '''Nuovo Regio Ducal Teatro alla Scala''' (with variant forms of its name), the present-day [[La Scala]], was inaugurated on 3 August 1778. The [[Teatro Lirico (Milan)|Teatro alla Canobbiana]], now called the Teatro Lirico, was inaugurated on 21 August 1779.

'''''The Battle of San Romano''''' is a set of three paintings by the [[Florence|Florentine]] painter [[Paolo Uccello]] depicting events that took place at the [[Battle of San Romano]] between Florentine and Sienese forces in 1432. They are significant as revealing the development of [[linear perspective]] in early [[Italian Renaissance painting]], and are unusual as a major secular commission. The paintings are in [[egg tempera]] on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the [[National Gallery]], London,&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-uccello-the-battle-of-san-romano Paolo Uccello ''The Battle of San Romano'' NG583]&lt;/ref&gt; the panels were commissioned by a member of the [[Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni|Bartolini Salimbeni family]] in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the [[Palazzo Medici]]. They are now divided between three collections, the National Gallery, the [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence, and the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.

The three paintings are:

File:Paolo Uccello 016.jpg|'''''The Counterattack of [[Micheletto Attendolo|Michelotto da Cotignola]] at the Battle of San Romano''''' ({{circa|1455}}), wood panel, 182 × 317&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Uffizi panel was probably designed to be the central painting of the [[triptych]] and is the only one signed by the artist.  The sequence most widely agreed among art historians is: London, Uffizi, Louvre, although others have been proposed.  They may represent different times of day: dawn (London), mid-day (Florence) and dusk (Paris) – the battle lasted eight hours. 

In the London painting, Niccolò da Tolentino, with his large gold and red patterned hat, is seen leading the Florentine cavalry. He had a reputation for recklessness, and doesn't even wear a helmet, though he sent two messengers (the departure of the two messengers, depicted centre, top) to tell his allied army of Attendolo to hurry to his aid as he is facing a superior force.&lt;ref&gt;Private Life of a Masterpiece, BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground, broken lances and a dead soldier are carefully aligned into orthogonals, so as to create an impression of perspective. Similar to that of a tapestry, the landscape rises up in a picture plane as opposed to receding deeply into space. This illusion of a backdrop and a perspective theme resembling a stage, depicts the war as a theatrical ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Janson's History of Art" The Western Tradition Eighth Edition|last=Davis, Denny, Hofrichter, Jacobs, Roberts, Simon|first=|publisher=Laurence King Publishing LTD|year=2011|isbn=9780205685172|location=London|pages=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three paintings were designed to be hung high on three different walls of a room, and the perspective designed with that height in mind, which accounts for many apparent anomalies in the perspective when seen in photos or at normal gallery height.

Many areas of the paintings were covered with gold and silver leaf. While the gold leaf, such as that found on the decorations of the bridles, has remained bright, the silver leaf, found particularly on the armour of the soldiers, has oxidized to a dull grey or black.  The original impression of the burnished silver would have been dazzling.  All of the paintings, especially that in the Louvre, have suffered from time and early restoration, and many areas have lost their modelling.&lt;ref name="DG"/&gt;

The panels were a subject in the BBC series ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', 2005.

The dark horse in the Louvre panel, mounted by Micheletto Attendolo, can be seen painted in a tapestry, in the first segment ("Metzengerstein") of the 1968 omnibus film ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]''.
In the 4th Episode (Lucrezia's Wedding) of the 2011 TV Series ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'', the London and Louvre panel is shown adorning the dining hall walls of the Florentine Prince when cardinal Della Rovere visits him in Florence.

Published in 1995 by [[Faber and Faber]], the novel was adapted for the stage in 2009 and explores Muslim [[fundamentalism]], youth culture, sex, drugs, and alienation in a young British-Pakistani man’s world that is being pulled in different directions by a modern lifestyle of London and traditional [[Muslim]] culture.

Kureishi, a British-Pakistani novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and filmmaker, premiered the adaptation at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in July 2009 and was awarded the second [[Asia House]] Literature Award on the closing night of [[Asia House Festival of Asian Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Anita M.|title=Power and Civil Society In Pakistan|date=September 20, 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character List ==

* '''Shahid''' (''Protagonist)'': The son of Pakistani immigrants, a British-Pakistani student from Kent, UK, whose father has recently died. Shahid moves to London for college, seeking to find a sense of independence in identity.
* '''Chili''' : Shahid’s older brother
* '''Deedee''' : Shahid's lecturer professor/lover/mentor
* '''Riaz''' : Shahid's friend, and means of introduction into radical [[Islam]]

== Critical reception ==
Although only having been staged recently, the reception to ''The Black Album'' has been neutral when compared to the Kureishi's novel. Many felt that the stage adaptation left out many of the details that made the novel memorable and powerful, instead feeling that the adaptation lost many of the details that readers felt were so elegantly explained in the novel.

"But the stage version does scant justice to the book's panoramic portrait of late-1980s London with its pubs, clubs and ecstasy-filled raves. In a nutshell, one misses the heady exuberance of Kureishi's descriptive writing." -''The Guardian''{{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The reception to the timing of the adaptation of the novel was positive as it came in the post-9/11 era of the world view. Kureishi had thought, back in the Nineties, of turning his novel into a film but it never happened. But a decade and a half on, in the wake of 9/11, 7/7 and the "war on terror", the relevance of the story became even greater. In an interview with production team, it was asked: "Was it easy ... transforming the tale from page to stage? "The novel had a kaleidoscopic view of London," he says, "moving quickly from episode to episode. The play maintains that episodic sense. Hanif has retained a lot of the language of the original. The novel is full of deft wit. The play is too. It moves between the real and the absurd. Hanif calls it 'hyper-real'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Album: A Work In Progress|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/the-black-album-a-work-in-progress-1754288.html|website=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Forest Unseen: A Year's Watch in Nature''''' is a 2012 book written by [[David G. Haskell]].

==Summary==
The book is divided in 43 short chapters ordered by date and roughly covering a whole year. In each of them the author, which visits almost every day a single square meter randomly chosen of an old-growth forest of [[Cumberland Plateau]] ([[Tennessee]]), describes what happens to plants, animals and insects living there. These observations give him the opportunity to write not only about the small-scale forest ecology but also on worldwide natural processes. He often calls his small observation field ''[[mandala]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/science/david-haskell-finds-biology-zen-in-a-patch-of-nature.html   | title = Finding Zen in a Patch of Nature | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 2012-10-23 | first = James | last = Gorman | access-date = 2018-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the paintings of sand created by [[Tibet]]an as a support for [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The forest unseen | first = Ruth Ann | last = Grissom | publisher = The University of North Carolina at Charlotte | url = https://ui.uncc.edu/story/forest-unseen | access-date = 2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
