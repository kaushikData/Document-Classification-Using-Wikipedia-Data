In [[Greek mythology]], '''Acaste''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|æ|s|t|iː}}; Ancient Greek: Ακαστη ''Akas''tê "unstable" or "irregular "'';'' feminine form of [[Acastus]]) was one of the [[Oceanids]], sea [[nymph]] daughters of the sea deities, [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Hesiod]]. ''[[Theogony]]'', ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0130:card=337&amp;highlight=acaste 346]'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Hesiod mentioned Acaste as one of the Oceanids:

: ''"Cerceis lovely of form, and soft eyed [[Plouto (Oceanid)|Pluto]], [[Perse (mythology)|Perseis]], [[Ianeira]], '''Acaste''', Xanthe, Petraea the fair, Menestho, and [[Europa (Greek myth)|Europa]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], and [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]], and [[Telesto (mythology)|Telesto]] saffron-clad, [[Chryseis (mythology)|Chryseis]] and [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]] and charming [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], Eudora, and [[Tyche]], Amphirho, and [[Ocyrhoe|Ocyrrhoe]], and [[Styx]] who is the chiefest of them all. These are the eldest daughters that sprang from Ocean and Tethys; but there are many besides."''

== Mythology ==
Acaste only appeared in one myth, along with her sisters, she was one of the companions of [[Persephone]] when the maiden she was abducted by [[Hades]], the god of the [[Underworld]]. Persephone recounted her kidnapping to her mother [[Demeter]] in the following passage:

: ''"All we were (i.e. Persephone and her companions) playing in a lovely meadow, [[Leucippe]] and Phaeno and [[Electra (Greek myth)|Electra]] and Ianthe, [[Melite (mythology)|Melita]] also and Iache with [[Rhodos|Rhodea]] and [[Callirhoe (mythology)|Callirhoe]] and Melobosis and [[Tyche]] and [[Ocyrhoe]], fair as a flower, Chryseis, Ianeira, '''Acaste''' and [[Admete]] and [[Rhodope (mythology)|Rhodope]] and Pluto and charming Calypso; Styx too was there and [[Urania]] and lovely Galaxaura with [[Athena|Pallas]] who rouses battles and [[Artemis]] delighting in arrows: we were playing and gathering sweet flowers in our hands, soft crocuses mingled with irises and hyacinths, and rose-blooms and lilies, marvellous to see, and the narcissus which the wide earth caused to grow yellow as a crocus."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Homeric Hymns]]''.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11445">{{short description|The transport of a substance by bulk motion}}
In the field of [[physics]], [[engineering]], and [[earth science]]s, '''advection''' is the [[transport]] of a substance by bulk motion. The properties of that substance are carried with it. Generally the majority of the advected substance is a fluid. The properties that are carried with the advected substance are [[Conservation of energy|conserved]] properties such as [[energy]]. An example of advection is the transport of [[pollutant]]s or [[silt]] in a [[river]] by bulk water flow downstream. Another commonly advected quantity is energy or [[enthalpy]]. Here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy, such as  [[water]] or [[air]]. In general, any substance or conserved, [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] quantity can be advected by a [[fluid]] that can hold or contain the quantity or substance.

During advection, a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk motion. The fluid's motion is described [[Mathematics|mathematically]] as a [[vector field]], and the transported material is described by a [[scalar field]] showing its distribution over space. Advection requires currents in the fluid, and so cannot happen in rigid solids.  It does not include transport of substances by [[molecular diffusion]].

Advection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of [[convection]] which is the combination of advective transport and diffusive transport.

In [[meteorology]] and [[physical oceanography]], advection often refers to the transport of some property of the atmosphere or [[ocean]], such as [[heat]], humidity (see [[water vapor|moisture]]) or [[salinity]].  
&lt;!-- This is sentence is patently false, e.g. cloud formation is vertical advection of water vapor driven by density gradients! See, for example, the following sentence:
Meteorological or oceanographic advective transport is perpendicular to isobaric surfaces and is therefore predominantly [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]].  
--&gt;
Advection is important for the formation of [[orographic]] clouds and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the [[hydrological cycle]].

==Distinction between advection and convection==
The term ''advection'' often serves as a synonym for ''[[convection]]'', and this correspondence of terms is used in the literature.  More technically, convection applies to the movement of a fluid (often due to density gradients created by thermal gradients), whereas advection is the movement of some material by the velocity of the fluid.  Thus, somewhat confusingly, it is technically correct to think of momentum being advected by the velocity field in the Navier-Stokes equations, although the resulting motion would be considered to be convection.  Because of the specific use of the term convection to indicate transport in association with thermal gradients, it is probably safer to use the term advection if one is uncertain about which terminology best describes their particular system.
&lt;!--
An example of convection is flow over a hot plate or below a chilled water surface in a lake. In the ocean and atmospheric sciences, advection is understood as horizontal movement resulting in transport "from place to place", while convection is vertical "mixing". &lt;ref&gt;David A. Randall, "General circulation model development", Academic Press, 2000. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pRibtFBDNDAC&amp;pg=PA648&amp;dq=advection+and+convection#v=onepage&amp;q=advection%20and%20convection&amp;f=false (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ryan, "Earth Science (CliffsQuickReview)", Wiley Publishing Inc., 2006. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PV_BabxTTkcC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=advection+convection&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=advection%20convection&amp;f=false (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that advection occurs with fluid transport of a point, while convection may be considered as fluid transport of a vector.
--&gt;

==Meteorology==
In [[meteorology]] and [[physical oceanography]], advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or [[ocean]], such as [[heat]], humidity or salinity, and convection generally refers to vertical transport (vertical advection). Advection is important for the formation of [[orographic cloud]]s (terrain-forced convection) and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the [[hydrological cycle]].

== Other quantities ==
The advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a [[probability density function]] at each point, although accounting for diffusion is more difficult.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Mathematics of advection==
The '''advection equation''' is the [[partial differential equation]] that governs the motion of a conserved [[scalar field]] as it is advected by a known [[velocity field|velocity vector field]].  It is derived using the scalar field's [[conservation law]], together with [[Gauss's theorem]], and taking the [[infinitesimal]] limit.

One easily  visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river. As the river flows, ink will move downstream in a "pulse" via advection, as the water's movement itself transports the ink. If added to a lake without significant bulk water flow, the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a [[Diffusion|diffusive]] manner, which is not advection.  Note that as it moves downstream, the "pulse" of ink will also spread via diffusion.  The sum of these processes is called [[convection]].

===The advection equation===

In Cartesian coordinates the advection [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla = u_x \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + u_z \frac{\partial}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}= (u_x, u_y, u_z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity field]], and &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[del]] operator (note that [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] are used here).

The advection equation for a conserved quantity described by a [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is expressed mathematically by a [[continuity equation]]:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} +\nabla\cdot\left( \psi{\mathbf u}\right) =0 &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where  &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence]] operator and again &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity field|velocity vector field]]. Frequently, it is assumed that the flow is [[incompressible flow|incompressible]], that is, the [[velocity field]] satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot{\mathbf u}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[solenoidal]]. If this is so, the above equation can be rewritten as

:{{Equation box 1
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} +{\mathbf u}\cdot\nabla\psi=0. &lt;/math&gt;
|indent=:
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

In particular, if the flow is steady, then

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf u}\cdot\nabla\psi=0&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is constant along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. 
Hence, &lt;math&gt; \partial\psi/\partial t=0,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; doesn't vary in time.

If a vector quantity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; (such as a [[magnetic field]]) is being advected by the [[solenoidal]] [[velocity field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, the advection equation above becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial{\mathbf a}}{\partial t} + \left( {\mathbf u} \cdot \nabla \right) {\mathbf a} =0. &lt;/math&gt;

Here,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector field]] instead of the [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Solving the equation===
[[File:GaussianUpwind2D.gif|thumb|A simulation of the advection equation where '''u''' = (sin ''t'', cos ''t'') is solenoidal.]]
The advection equation is not simple to solve [[numerical analysis|numerically]]: the system is a [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]], and interest typically centers on [[Continuous function|discontinuous]] "shock" solutions (which are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle).

Even with one space dimension and a constant [[velocity field]], the system remains difficult to simulate.  The equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}+u_x \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi = \psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar field]] being advected 
and &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; component of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (u_x, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Treatment of the advection operator in the incompressible Navier Stokes equations===

According to Zang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Zang 
 | first = Thomas 
 | year = 1991
 | title = On the rotation and skew-symmetric forms for incompressible flow simulations
 | journal = Applied Numerical Mathematics
 | volume = 7
 | pages = 27–40
 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9274(91)90102-6
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; numerical simulation can be aided by considering the [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric]] form for the advection operator.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} {\mathbf u} \cdot \nabla {\mathbf u} + \frac{1}{2} \nabla ({\mathbf u} {\mathbf u}) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla ({\mathbf u} {\mathbf u}) = [\nabla ({\mathbf u} u_x),\nabla ({\mathbf u} u_y),\nabla ({\mathbf u} u_z)]&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as above.

Since skew symmetry implies only [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] [[eigenvalues]], this form reduces the "blow up" and "spectral blocking" often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities (see Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd 
 |first=John P.  |title= Chebyshev and Fourier Spectral Methods 2nd edition  |url= http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~jpboyd/BOOK_Spectral2000.html  |year=2000 |publisher=Dover |location= |isbn= |pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Using [[vector calculus identities#Vector dot product|vector calculus identities]], these operators can also be expressed in other ways, available in more software packages for more coordinate systems.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}{2} \right)  + \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \right) \times \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{2} \nabla (\mathbf{u} \mathbf{u}) = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2}{2} \right)  + \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} \right) \times \mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{u} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) &lt;/math&gt;

This form also makes visible that the [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric]] operator introduces error when the velocity field diverges. Solving the advection equation by numerical methods is very challenging and there is a large scientific literature about this.

The '''andesite line''' is the most significant regional [[geologic]] distinction in the [[Pacific Ocean]] basin. It separates the [[mafic]] [[basalt]]ic [[volcanic]] rocks of the Central Pacific Basin from the partially submerged continental areas of more [[felsic]] [[andesite|andesitic]] volcanic rock on its margins. The andesite line parallels the [[subduction zone]]s and deep [[oceanic trench]]es around the Pacific basin. It is the surface expression of melting within and above the plunging subducting [[Slab (geology)|slab]]. It follows the western edge of the islands off [[California]] and passes south of the [[Aleutian Arc]], along the eastern edge of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], the [[Kuril Islands]], Japan, the [[Mariana Islands]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]]. The dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the [[Andes]] mountains of South America to Mexico, returning then to the islands off California. Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, New Guinea, and New Zealand lie outside the andesite line.

Within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs, submerged volcanic mountains, and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the [[Pacific basin]]. It is here that basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs, chains, and clusters. Outside the andesite line, volcanism is of the explosive type. The [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] runs parallel to the line and is the world's foremost belt of explosive volcanism.

The term ''andesite line'' predates the geologic understanding of [[plate tectonics]]. The term was first used in 1912 by [[New Zealand]] geologist [[Patrick Marshall]] to describe the distinct structural and volcanologic boundary extending from east of New Zealand to Fiji and north of the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands.

'''Animal source foods''' (ASF) include many [[food]] item that comes from an animal source such as meat, milk, eggs, cheese and yogurt. Many individuals do not consume ASF or consume little ASF by either personal choice or necessity as ASF may not be accessible or available to these people.&lt;ref name="Murphy SP 2003"&gt;Murphy SP, Allen LH. (2003) Nutritional Importance of Animal Source Foods. J. Nutr. 133: 3932S-3935S.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition of animal source foods ==
[[Image:Ayrshire's Dunlop Cheese.JPG|left|thumb|200px|&lt;Center&gt;[[Dunlop cheese]] from Ayrshire, Scotland.]]
Aside from performed vitamin A, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and vitamin D, all vitamins found in animal source foods may also be found in plant-derived foods. Examples are [[tofu]] to replace meat (both contain [[protein]] in sufficient amounts), and certain [[seaweed]]s and vegetables as respectively [[kombu]] and [[kale]] to replace dairy foods as [[milk]] (both contain calcium in sufficient amounts). There are some nutrients which are rare to find in sufficient density in plant based foods. One example would be zinc, the exception would be pumpkin seeds that have been soaked for improved digestion. The increased fiber in these foods can also make absorption difficult. Deficiencies are very possible in these nutrients if vegetarians are not very careful and willing to eat sufficient quantities of these exceptional plant based foods. A good way to find these foods would be to search for them on one of the online, nutrient analyzing databases. An example would be nutritiondata.com.

Most humans eat an omnivorous diet (comprising animal source foods and plant source foods) though some civilisations have eaten only animal foods. Although a healthy diet containing all essential macro and micronutrients may be possible by only consuming a plant based diet (with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; obtained from supplements if no animal sourced foods are consumed), some populations are unable to consume an adequate quantity or variety of these plant based items to obtain appropriate amounts of nutrients, particularly those that are found in high concentrations in ASF.&lt;ref name="Murphy SP 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer JT. (1994) Vegetarian eating patterns: science, values, and food choices- where do we go from here? Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 59:1255S-1262S.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently, the most vulnerable populations to these micronutrient deficiencies are pregnant women, infants, and children in developing countries. In the 1980s the Nutrition Collaborative Research Support Program (NCRSP) found that six micronutrients were low in the mostly vegetarian diets of children in malnourished areas of Egypt, Mexico, and Kenya.&lt;ref name="Murphy SP 2003"/&gt; These six micronutrients are [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[riboflavin]], [[calcium]], [[iron]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="Murphy SP 2003"/&gt; ASF are the only food source of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stabler SP, Allen RH. (2004) Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; Deficiency as a Worldwide Problem. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 24: 299-326.&lt;/ref&gt; ASF also provide high biological value protein, energy, fat compared with plant food sources.

== Health impacts of micronutrient deficiency ==
All six micronutrients richly found in ASF, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[riboflavin]], [[calcium]], [[iron]] and [[zinc]] play a critical role in the growth and development of children.&lt;ref name="Murphy SP 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black, MM. (2003) Micronutrient Deficiencies and Cognitive Functioning. J. Nutr. 133: 3927S-3931S.&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate stores of these micronutrients, either resulting from inadequate intake or poor absorption, is associated with poor growth, anemias (iron deficiency anemia and macrocytic anemia), rickets, night blindness, impaired cognitive functioning, neuromuscular deficits, diminished work capacity, psychiatric disorders and death.&lt;ref name="Murphy SP 2003"/&gt; Some of these effects, such as impaired cognitive development from an [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]], are irreversible. However, ASF foods have been shown to raise the risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity and other preventable diseases due to the high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol.

== Animal source food supplementation ==
Micronutrient deficiency is associated in poor early cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;Black MM. (2003) Micronutrients and Cognitive Functioning. J Nutr.133: 3927S-3931S.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs designed to address these micronutrient deficiencies should be targeted to infants, children, and pregnant women. To address these significant mirconutrient deficiencies, some global health researchers and practitioners developed and piloted a snack program in Kenya school children.&lt;ref&gt;Siekmann JH, Allen LH, Bwibo NO, Demment MW, Murphy SP, Neumann CG (2003). Kenyan School Children Have Multiple Micronutrient Deficiencies, but Increased plasma vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the only detectable micronutrient response to meat or milk supplementation. J. Nutr. 133. 3972S-3980S.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some communities are vegetarians for religious or cultural reasons. Efforts must be made to develop culturally appropriate interventions to address the micronutrient deficiencies in these populations, such as through [[food fortification]].

{{Further|Environmental effects of meat production}}
According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.htm LEAD digital library: Livestock’s long shadow - Environmental issues and options&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806144540/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.htm |date=2014-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, using plant-derived foods is typically considered better for the interests of the environment. Despite this, the raising of certain animals can be more environmentally sound than others. According to the Farralones Institute's report from 1976, raising [[rabbit]]s, and [[chicken]]s (on a well-considered approach) for food can still be quite sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/1976-11-01/The-Integral-Urban-House.aspx?page=4 Farralones Institute favoring rabbits and chicken], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the production of meat and other produce, such as eggs, may still be considered environmentally friendly (if this is done in an industrial, high-efficiency manner). In addition, raising goats (for goat milk and meat) can also be environmentally quite friendly and has been favored by certain environmental activists, such as Mohandas [[Brahmacharya#Diet_and_ahimsa|Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifepositive.com/spirit/masters/mahatma-gandhi/diet.asp Gandhi, who favored the environmentally friendly goat and its produce] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628204209/http://www.lifepositive.com/spirit/masters/mahatma-gandhi/diet.asp |date=June 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ayacara Formation''' is a [[Geological formation|sedimentary formation]] made up of [[interbedding|interbedded]] [[sandstone|sand]] and [[siltstone]] cropping out around [[Hornopirén]] and [[Ayacara Peninsula]] in western [[Los Lagos Region]], Chile. Less common rocks are [[tuff]] and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]. The formation dates to the [[Miocene|Early and Middle Miocene]] (no earlier than 21.8–17.6 [[million years ago]]) when it deposited during a [[transgression (geology)|marine transgression]].&lt;ref name=long&gt;{{cite book |last1=Encinas|first1=Alfonso |last2=Folguera|first2=Andrés|last3=Bechis|first3=Florencia|last4=Finger|first4=Kenneth L.|last5=Zambrano|first5=Patricio|last6=Pérez|first6=Felipe|last7=Benarbé|first7=Pablo|last8=Tapia|first8=Francisca|last9=Riffo|first9=Ricardo|last10=Buatois|first10=Luis|last11=Orts|first11=Darío|last12=Nielsen|first12=Sven N. |last13=Valencia|first13=Victor V.|last14=Cituño|first14=José |last15=Oliveros|first15=Verónica |last16=De Girolamo Del Mauro|first16=Lizet|last17=Ramos|first17=Víctor A.|date=2018 |chapter=The Late Oligocene–Early Miocene Marine Transgression of Patagonia|title=The Evolution of the Chilean-Argentinean Andes|editors=Folguera, A., Contreras Reyes, E., Heredia, N., Encinas, A., B.

[[Image:Giotto - Scrovegni - -23- - Baptism of Christ.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Christ'' [[fresco]] by [[Giotto di Bondone]], c. 1305 ([[Cappella Scrovegni]], [[Padua]], [[Italy]]).]]
The '''Baptism of the Christ''' (or the '''Baptism of Christ''') is the [[feast day]] commemorating the [[baptism of Jesus]] in the [[Jordan River]] by [[John the Baptist]]. Originally the baptism of Christ was celebrated on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], which commemorates the coming of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], the baptism of Christ, and the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding at Cana]]. Over time in the West, however, the celebration of the baptism of the Lord came to be commemorated as a distinct feast from Epiphany.  It is celebrated in the [[Catholic Church]] as well as the [[Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] Churches on the first Sunday following The Epiphany of Our Lord ( January 6).

==Eastern celebration==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches, the Baptism of the Lord is celebrated as an integral part of the celebration on January 6, the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]]. For those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], January 6 falls on January 19 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]] (see [[Epiphany (holiday)]] and [[Theophany]] for details).

==Western celebration==

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Baptism of the Lord is observed as a distinct feast in the [[Roman rite]], although it was originally one of three Gospel events marked by the feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. Long after the visit of the Magi had in the West overshadowed the other elements commemorated in the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[Pope Pius XII]] instituted in 1955 a separate liturgical commemoration of the Baptism.

In fact, the [[Tridentine Calendar]] has no feast of the Baptism of the Lord. It was almost four centuries later that the feast was instituted, under the denomination "Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord", for celebration on 13 January as a [[ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|major double]], using for the Office and the Mass those previously said on the Octave of the Epiphany, which Pius XII abolished; but if the Commemoration of the Baptism of Our Lord occurred on Sunday, the Office and Mass were to be those of the Feast of the Holy Family without any commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;Decree ''"Cum nostra hac aetate"'' (De rubricis ad simpliciorem formam redigendis) of 22 March 1955, in [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] 47(1955), pages 218-224, Title II: Changes in the calendar, 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In his revision of the calendar five years later, [[Pope John XXIII]] kept on 13 January the "Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord Jesus Christ", with the rank of a second-class feast.

A mere 14 years after the institution of the feast, [[Pope Paul VI]] set its date as the first Sunday after January 6 (as early as January 9 or as late as January 13) or, if in a particular country the Epiphany is celebrated on January 7 or 8, on the following Monday.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), pp. 61 and 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] initiated a custom whereby on this feast the Pope baptizes babies in the [[Sistine Chapel]].

===Anglican Communion===
In the [[Church of England]], Epiphany may be observed on January 6 proper, or on the Sunday between January 2 and 8. If Epiphany is observed on a Sunday on January 6 or before, the Baptism of Christ is observed on the following Sunday. If the Epiphany is observed on January 7 or 8, the Baptism of Christ is observed on the following Monday. In the Church of England, [[Ordinary Time]] does not begin until the day after the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation of Christ in the Temple]].

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] [USA], Epiphany is always celebrated on January 6, and the Baptism of the Lord is always celebrated on the following Sunday.  It is not clear as to whether or not the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Common Prayer, 312&lt;/ref&gt; is the end of Christmastide for the Episcopal Church.  On one hand, the Prayer Book refers to the "Twelve Days of Christmas,"&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Common Prayer, 43, 80&lt;/ref&gt; and clearly distinguishes the Christmas and Epiphany seasons, the latter extending until Ash Wednesday.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Common Prayer, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the Prayer Book allows for the continued use of Christmas prayers and readings on the weekdays following the Epiphany and leading up to the Baptism of our Lord.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Common Prayer, 162, 214&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the Epiphany and the Baptism of Christ are viewed as specially connected,&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Common Prayer, 43, 81&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the interpretation that Christmastide does extend through and end with the Feast of our Lord's Baptism on the Sunday following the Epiphany.

In [[Norse mythology]], '''Bergelmir''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɛər|ˈ|g|ɛ|l|m|ɪər}} {{respell|bair|GHEL|meer}}; [[Old Norse]] "Mountain Yeller" or "Bear Yeller")&lt;ref&gt;Lindow, 2001. Lindow also gives "Bare Yeller" as a third possible interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[Jötunn|frost giant]], the son of giant [[Þrúðgelmir]] and the grandson of [[Ymir]] (who was called Aurgelmir among giants), the first frost giant, according to stanza 29 of the poem ''[[Vafthrudnismal]]'' from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'':

:"Uncountable winters before the earth was made,
:then Bergelmir was born,
:[[Þrúðgelmir|Thrudgelmir]] was his father,
:and [[ymir|Aurgelmir]] his grandfather."
:
::— Larrington trans.

According to the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' section of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]], Bergelmir and his wife alone among the giants were the only survivors of the enormous [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] of blood which flowed from Ymir's wounds when he was killed by [[Odin]] and his brothers [[Vili and Vé]]. They escaped the sanguinary flood by climbing onto an object and subsequently became the progenitors of a new race of frost giants.

==Theories==
R. D. Fulk notes that Snorri's ''Prose Edda'' account "conflicts with the poetic version, as the [''Prose Edda''] presents a Noah-like figure, while the latter has Bergelmir laid (''lagiðr'') in the ''lúðr'', implying he is an infant, as in the [[Scyld]] story. But Snorri does add the crucial element not made in the explicit verses, that the ''lúðr'' is to serve as a floating vessel."{{sfn|Fulk|1989|p=316}}

Fulk continues that "the key word here is ''lúðr'', which ought to refer to a flour-bin. To be precise, the object is a box or wooden trough, perhaps on legs, in which the stones of a hand-mill sit [...]. It is true that most glossators assume some meaning other than 'flour-bin' in ''Vafþrúðnismál'' and ''Snorra edda'' [an alternate name for the ''Prose Edda''], suggesting instead something in the range of 'coffin (or cradle), chest, ark (i.e. boat)'." Fulk details that "the interpretation of 'ark' derives solely from the passage in ''Snorra Edda'', because of Bergelmir's resemblance to [[Noah]], and the fact that [Old Icelandic] ''ǫrk'' [...] can refer to both Noah's ark and a chest or a sarcophagus."{{sfn|Fulk|1989|p=316}}

Scholars [[John Lindow]] and [[Carolyne Larrington]] agree that the ''Prose Edda'' account of the flood borrowed from [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition of [[Noah's Ark]].

[[File:Little Minch.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Whirlpool|The Little Minch, home to the blue men]]
The '''blue men of the Minch''', also known as '''storm kelpies''' ({{lang-gd|na fir ghorma}} {{IPA-gd|nə fiɾʲ ˈɣɔɾɔmə}}), are [[mythological creature]]s inhabiting the stretch of water between the northern [[Outer Hebrides]] and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink. They appear to be localised to [[the Minch]] and surrounding areas, unknown in other parts of Scotland and without counterparts in the rest of the world.

Apart from their blue colour, the mythical creatures look much like humans, and are about the same size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float sleeping on or just below the surface of the water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as [[porpoise]]s do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.

Suggestions to explain the mythical blue men include that they may be a personification of the sea, or originate with the [[Picts]], whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled [[kayak]]s. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the [[Viking]]s took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the [[Shiant Isles]] in the Minch.

==Etymology==
[[The Minch]], a [[strait]] that separates the northwest [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of Scotland and the northern [[Inner Hebrides]] from the northern [[Outer Hebrides]], is home to the blue men.{{r|Dictionary}} According to  [[lexicographer]] [[Edward Dwelly]], in the [[Scottish Gaelic]] terms for the blue men&amp;nbsp;– ''na fir ghorma'', ''fear gorm'' and ''sruth nam fear gorm''&amp;nbsp;– the word ''gorm'' refers to any shade of blue and ''fear'' can be translated as "man", ''na fir'' representing the plural "the men".{{sfnp|Dwelly|1902|pp=422–423|ps=}}

The blue men are also styled as storm kelpies.{{sfnp|Bane|2013|p=62|ps=}}{{sfnp|MacGregor|1937|p=119|ps=}} The most common water spirits in Scottish folklore,{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=364|ps=}} [[kelpies]] are usually described as powerful horses,{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=24|ps=}} but the name is attributed to several different forms and fables throughout the country.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=364|ps=}} The name ''kelpie'' may be derived from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''calpa'' or ''cailpeach'', meaning "heifer" or "colt".{{r|OEDKelpie}}

==Folk beliefs==

===Description and common attributes===
The mythical blue men may have been part of a tribe of "fallen angels" that split into three; the first became the ground dwelling fairies, the second evolved to become the sea inhabiting blue men, and the remainder the "Merry Dancers" of the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]] in the sky.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2013|loc=loc. 1345|ps=}} The legendary creatures are the same size as humans but, as the name implies, blue in colour.{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1900|p=200|ps=}} Writer and journalist [[Lewis Spence]] thought they were the "personifications of the sea itself" as they took their blue colouration from the hue of the sea.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=485|ps=}} Their faces are grey and long in shape{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1900|p=200|ps=}} and some have long arms, which are also grey, and they favour blue headgear;{{sfnp|Bane|2013|p=62|ps=}} at least one account claims that they also have wings.{{sfnp|Kynes|2008|p=130|ps=}} The tempestuous water around the [[Shiant Isles]] {{convert|19|km}} to the north of [[Skye]], an area subject to rapid tides in all weathers,{{sfnp|Sullivan|Pickering|Emmot|2010|pp=63–64|ps=}} flows beside the caves inhabited by the blue men,{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=80|ps=}} a stretch of water known as the Current of Destruction owing to the number of ships wrecked there.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=80|ps=}}

Although other storm kelpies are reported as inhabiting the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan|Gulf of Corrievreckan]],{{sfnp|MacGregor|1937|p=117|ps=}} described by poet, writer and folklorist [[Alasdair Alpin MacGregor]] as "the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies",{{sfnp|MacGregor|1937|p=117|ps=}} the blue men are confined to a very restricted area. According to [[Donald Alexander Mackenzie|Donald A. Mackenzie]] they have no counterparts elsewhere in the world or even in other areas of Scotland; such limited range is rare for beliefs in spirits and demons.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2013|loc=loc. 1348|ps=}} Folklorist and [[Tiree]] minister [[John Gregorson Campbell]] states that they were unknown in [[Argyll]] on the nearby coast of the mainland for instance,{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1900|p=200|ps=}} although [[Church of Scotland]] minister [[John Brand (minister)|John Brand]], who visited [[Quarff]] in Shetland in mid-1700, recounts a tale of what may have been a blue man{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=400|ps=}} in the waters around the island.{{sfnp|Brand|1883|p=171|ps=}} In the form of a bearded old man it rose out of the water, terrifying the passengers and crew of a boat it was following.{{sfnp|Brand|1883|p=171|ps=}}

In traditional tales the blue men have the power to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water.{{sfnp|Bane|2013|p=62|ps=}} They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a [[porpoise]].{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=79|ps=}} To amuse themselves the creatures play [[shinty]] when the skies are clear and bright at night.{{r|Maclennan}} They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2013|loc=loc. 1332|ps=}}

When the blue men gather to attack passing vessels their chief, sometimes named as [[Seonaidh|Shony]],{{sfnp|Kynes|2008|p=130|ps=}} rises up out of the water and shouts two lines of poetry to the skipper, and if he cannot add two lines to complete the verse the blue men seize his boat.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=81|ps=}} Mackenzie highlights the following exchange between the skipper of a boat and the chief of the blue men:{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=82|ps=}}
{{bq|text=&lt;poem&gt;Blue Chief: Man of the black cap what do you say
As your proud ship cleaves the brine?
Skipper: My speedy ship takes the shortest way
And I'll follow you line by line
Blue Chief: My men are eager, my men are ready
To drag you below the waves
Skipper: My ship is speedy, my ship is steady
If it sank, it would wreck your caves.&lt;/poem&gt;}}
The quick responses took the blue chief by surprise; defeated and unable to do any damage to the vessel, the blue men returned to their underwater caves, allowing the vessel free passage through the strait.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|loc=loc. 1315|ps=}} The blue men may alternatively board a passing vessel and demand tribute from its crew, threatening that if it is not forthcoming they will raise up a storm.{{sfnp|Kynes|2008|p=130|ps=}}

===Capture and killing===
No surviving tales mention attempts to kill the demons, but a Gregorson Campbell story tells of the capture of a blue man. Sailors seize a blue man and tie him up on board their ship after he is discovered "sleeping on the waters".{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1900|p=200|ps=}} Two fellow blue men give chase, calling out to each other as they swim towards the ship:
{{bq|text=&lt;poem&gt;Duncan will be one, Donald will be two
Will you need another ere you reach the shore?{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=83|ps=}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}
On hearing his companions' voices the captured spirit breaks free of his bonds and jumps overboard as he answers:
{{bq|text=&lt;poem&gt;Duncan's voice I hear, Donald too is near
But no need of helpers has strong Ian More.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=83|ps=}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}
Sailors thus believed that all blue men have names by which they address each other.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|1917|p=83|ps=}}

==Origins==
[[File:Touaregs at the Festival au Desert near Timbuktu, Mali 2012.jpg|thumb|upright0.1|alt=Group of Tuareg people in desert|The mythical blue men may have originated with the [[Tuareg people]] of the [[Sahara]].]]
Mackenzie's explanation of the legend of the blue men was based partly on research into the Annals of Ireland and goes back to the times of [[Harald Fairhair]], the first Norse king, and his battles against the [[Vikings]]. The Scottish Gaelic term ''fear gorm'', meaning "blue men",{{r|Edwards}}{{r|"MacKillop Fear"}} is the descriptor for a black man according to Dwelly.{{sfnp|Dwelly|1902|p=517|ps=}} Thus ''sruth nam fear gorm'', one of the blue men's Gaelic names, literally translates as "stream of the blue men",{{r|MacKillop Blue}} or "river, tide or stream of the black man".{{sfnp|Dwelly|1902a|p=895|ps=}} Around the 9th century the Vikings took [[Moor (people)|Moors]] they had captured and were using as slaves to Ireland. The Vikings spent winter months near the Shiant Isles, and Mackenzie attributes the story of the blue men to "marooned foreign slaves".{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2013|loc=loc. 1391|ps=}} He quotes an excerpt from historian [[Alan Orr Anderson]]'s ''Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286'':{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2013|loc=loc. 1379|ps=}}{{sfnp|Anderson|1922|p=294|ps=}}
{{bq|text=These were the blue men [''fir gorma''], because Moors are the same as negroes; Mauritania is the same as negro-land [literally, the same as blackness].}}
More recent newspaper reports have repeated Mackenzie's hypothesis.{{r|Scotsman}} Historian Malcolm Archibald agrees the legend originates from the days Norsemen had North African slaves, but speculates that the myth may have originated with the [[Tuareg people]] of [[Sahara]]n Africa, who were known as the "blue men of the desert".{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=485|ps=}}

The origin of the blue men of the Minch may alternatively lie with "tattooing people"{{r|AnthropologicalNote}} specifically the Picts, whose [[Latin]] name ''picti'' means "painted people". If they were seen crossing the water in boats resembling the [[kayak]]s of the [[Finn-men]] they may have given simple islanders and mariners the impression of the upper part of the body rising out of the water.{{sfnp|Kingshill|Westwood|2012|loc=loc. 7068|ps=}}

{{Democracy}}Criticism of [[democracy]] is grounded in democracy's contested definition—its purpose, process, and outcomes. Since [[Classical antiquity]] and through the modern era, democracy has been associated with "rule of the people," "rule of the majority," and free selection or election either through direct participation or elected representation respectively, but has not been linked to a particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Democracy – Definition of Democracy by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political thinkers approach their critique of democracy from different perspectives. Many do not necessarily oppose democracy—"rule of the people"—but, rather, seek to expand or question its popular definition. In their work, they distinguish between democratic principles that are effectively implemented through undemocratic procedures; undemocratic principles that are implemented through democratic procedures; and variations of the same kind.

For instance, some critics of democracy would agree with [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous remark, "No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206|title=Parliament Bill|last=|first=|date=11 November 1947|website=api.parliament.uk|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While others, may be more prepared to describe existing democratic regimes as anything but "rule of the people."

Critics of democracy have tried to highlight democracy's inconsistencies, paradoxes, and limits by contrasting it with other forms of governments. They have characterized most modern democracies as democratic [[Polyarchy|polyarchies]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1972|isbn=0300015658|location=New Haven|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and democratic [[Aristocracy|aristocracies]];&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Principles of Representative Government|last=Manin|first=Bernard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521458919|location=Cambridge|pages=2, 67–93, 132–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have identified [[Fascism|fascist]] moments in modern democracies; they have termed the societies produced by modern democracies as [[Neo-feudalism|neo-feudal]];&lt;ref&gt;Thom Hartmann, "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/2002/11/06/time-remove-bananas-and-return-our-republic-democracy Time to Remove the Bananas...and Return Our Republic to Democracy]", ''CommonDreams.org'', 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while, yet others, have contrasted democracy with [[Nazism]], [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[theocracy]], and [[absolute monarchy]].

The most widely known critics of democracy include [[Plato]] and [[The Federalist Papers|the authors of the Federalist Papers]], who were interested in establishing a [[representative democracy]] in America instead of a [[direct democracy]].

Additional historical figures associated with the critique of democracy thought include [[Aristotle]], [[Montesquieu]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hubert Lagardelle]], [[Charles Maurras]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], and [[Elazar Menachem Shach]].

Leading contemporary thinkers in critical democratic theory include [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Robert A. Dahl]], [[Robert E. Goodin]], [[Bernard Manin]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[James S. Fishkin]], [[Ian Shapiro]], [[Jason Brennan]], [[Hélène Landemore]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]].

==Criticism of democracy's purpose==

===Benefits of a specialized society===
One such argument is that the benefits of a specialized society may be compromised by democracy. As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised, especially if a policy is very technically sophisticated and/or the general public inadequately informed. For example, there is no guarantee that those who campaign about the government's economic policies are themselves professional economists or academically competent in this particular discipline, regardless of whether they were well-educated. Essentially this means that a democratic government may not be providing the most good for the largest number of people. However, some have argued that this should not even be the goal of democracies because the minority could be seriously mistreated under that purported goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kenneth J. |last1=Arrow |first2=Robert C. |last2=Lind |date=June 1970  |title=Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Public Investment Decisions|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=364–378 |id= |jstor=1817987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule of the aristocratic ===

====Nietzsche====

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as an opponent of [[Christianity]], saw western democracy as connected to it, claiming that "the ''democratic'' movement is Christianity's heir" and denounced the democratic man for being inherently unable to "feel any shame for being unable to rise above" his desire "to satisfy a host of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/nietzsche-friedrich_inevitability-of-democracy-1886.htm|title=Friedrich Nietzsche / The Inevitabilty of Democracy -- 1886|website=www.cooperative-individualism.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Nietzsche claimed that in a democracy "[w]hen the individual's highest and strongest instincts break forth with a passion, driving him far and above the average, beyond the lowlands of the herd conscience", "the moral perspective now considers how harmful or harmless an opinion, an emotional state, a will, a talent is to the community, to equality".

==== Manin ====
&lt;blockquote href="The Republic (Plato)"&gt;The real difference between ancient democracies and modern republics lies, according to Madison, in "''the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity'' from any share in the ''latter'', and not in the ''total exclusion of the representatives of the people'' from the administration of the ''former''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— [[Bernard Manin]], p. 2 (See: Madison, "Federalist 63," in ''[[The Federalist Papers]],'' p. 387; Madison's emphasis.)&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Bernard Manin]] is interested in distinguishing modern representative [[republic]]s, such as the United States, from ancient direct [[Democracy|democracies]], such as Athens.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin believes that both aspire to "rule of the people," but that the nature of modern representative republics lends them to "rule of the aristocratic." Manin explains that in ancient democracies, virtually every citizen had the chance to be selected to populate the government but in modern republics, only elites have the chance of being elected. He does not defend this phenomenon but rather seeks to describe it.

Manin draws from [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to suggest that the dominant form of government, representative as opposed to direct, is effectively aristocratic.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; He proposes that modern representative governments exercise political power through aristocratic elections which, in turn, brings into question democracy's "rule of the people" principle. As far as Montesquieu is concerned, elections favor the "best" citizens who Manin notes tend to be wealthy and upper-class. As far as Rousseau is concerned, elections favor the incumbent government officials or the citizens with the strongest personalities, which results in hereditary aristocracy. Manin further evinces the aristocratic nature of representative governments by contrasting them with the ancient style of selection by lot. Manin notes that [[Montesquieu]] believed that lotteries prevent jealousy and distribute offices equally (among citizens from different ranks), while [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] believed that lotteries choose indifferently, preventing self-interest and partiality from polluting the citizen's choice (and thus prevent hereditary aristocracy).

However, Manin also provides criticism of direct democracy, or selection by lot.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin reflects on Montesquieu's interrogation of the extent to which [[Athenian democracy|Athenian direct democracy]] was truly direct. Montesquieu finds that citizens who had reason to believe they would be accused as "unworthy of selection" commonly withheld their names from the lottery, thereby making selection by lot vulnerable to self-selection bias and, thus, aristocratic in nature. Manin does not dwell on direct democracy's potentially aristocratic elements, perhaps because he share's Montesquieu's belief that there is nothing alarming about the exclusion of citizens who may be incompetent; this exclusion may be inevitable in any method of selection.

Additionally, Manin is interested in explaining the discrepancy between 18th century American and French revolutionaries' ''declaration'' of the "equality of all citizens" and their ''enactment'' of (aristocratic) elections in their respective democratic experiments.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin suggests that the discrepancy is explained by the revolutionaries' contemporary preoccupation with one form of equality over another. The revolutionaries prioritized gaining the equal right to consent to their choice of government (even a potentially aristocratic democracy), at the expense of seeking the equal right to be face of that democracy. And it is elections, not lots, that provide citizens with more opportunities to consent. In elections, citizens consent both to the procedure of elections and to the product of the elections (even if they produce the election of elites). In lotteries, citizens consent only to the procedure of lots, but not to the product of the lots (even if they produce election of the average person). That is, if the revolutionaries prioritized consent to be governed over equal opportunity to serve as the government, then their choice of elections over lotteries makes sense.

====Michels====
A major scholarly attack on the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist [[Robert Michels]] who developed the mainstream political science theory of the [[iron law of oligarchy]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="hyland"&gt;James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press ND, 1995. Pp. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Michels argued that [[oligarchy]] is inevitable as an "[[iron law of oligarchy|iron law]]" within any organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" and went on to state "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, [[Eduoard Berth]], [[Arturo Labriola]], and [[Enrico Leone (economist)|Enrico Leone]] and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of [[social democracy]] and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=418–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maurras====
[[Charles Maurras]], an FRS member of the ''[[Action française]]'' movement, stated in a famous dictum "Democracy is evil, democracy is death." Maurras' concept of ''politique naturelle'' declared recognition of inescapable biological inequality and thereby natural hierarchies, and claimed that the individual is naturally subordinated to social collectivities such as the family, the society, and the state, which he claims are doomed to fail if based upon the "myth of equality" or "abstract liberty". Maurras criticized democracy as being a "government by numbers" in which quantity matters more over quality and prefers the worst over the best. Maurras denounced the principles of [[liberalism]] as described in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and in ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as based upon the false assumption of liberty and the false assumption of equality. He claimed that the [[parliamentary system]] subordinates the national interest, or common good, to private interests of a parliament's representatives where only short-sighted interests of individuals prevail.

====Lagardelle====
French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Hubert Lagardelle]] claimed that French revolutionary syndicalism came to being as the result of "the reaction of the [[proletariat]] against democracy," which he claimed was "the ''popular form'' of [[bourgeois]] dominance." Lagardelle opposed democracy for its universalism, and believed in the necessity of class separation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, as democracy did not recognize the social differences between them.

====Shach====
Israeli politician Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] promoted [[Halakha|Judaic law]] to be the natural governance for [[Jews]] and condemned democracy, he claimed that "Democracy as a machinery of lies, false notions, pursuit of narrow interests and deceit - as opposed to the [[Torah]] regime, which is based on seeking the ultimate truth." Shach criticized democracy for having no real goals, saying "The whole point of democracy is money. The one does what the other asks him to do in pursuit of his own interest, so as to be given what he himself asks for, and the whole purpose of the transaction is that each would get what they want."

== Criticism of democracy's process ==

===Political instability===
More recently, democracy is criticized for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tend to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the mass media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priority.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7646295.stm|title=Head to head: African democracy|last=Richburg|first=Keith|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anthony Downs argued that the political market works much the same way as the economic market, and that there could potentially be an equilibrium in the system because of democratic process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he eventually argued that imperfect knowledge in politicians and voters prevented the reaching of that equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Anthony|last2=|first2=|date=April 1957|title=An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=65|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1086/257897|jstor=1827369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short-termism====
Democracy is also criticised for frequent elections due to the instability of coalition governments. Coalitions are frequently formed ''after'' the elections in many countries (for example [[India]]) and the basis of alliance is predominantly to enable a viable majority, not an ideological concurrence.

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Democratic institutions work on consensus to decide an issue, which usually takes longer than a unilateral decision.

[[M. S. Golwalkar]] in his book [[Bunch of Thoughts]] describes democracy as, "is to a very large extent only a myth in practice...The high-sounding concept of "individual freedom" only meant the freedom of those talented few to exploit the rest."

====Corruption====
This is a simple form of appealing to the short term interests of the voters.

Another form is commonly called [[Pork barrel]], where local areas or political sectors are given special benefits but whose costs are spread among all [[taxpayers]].

Mere elections are just one aspect of the democratic process. Other tenets of democracy, like relative equality and freedom, are frequently absent in ostensibly democratic countries.

Moreover, in many countries, democratic participation is less than 50% at times, and it can be argued that election of individual(s) instead of ideas disrupts democracy.

==== Potential incompatibility with former politics ====
The new establishment of democratic institutions, in countries where the associated practices have as yet been uncommon or deemed culturally unacceptable, can result in institutions that are not sustainable in the long term. One circumstance supporting this outcome may be when it is part of the common perception among the populace that the institutions were established as a direct result of foreign pressure.

Sustained regular inspection from democratic countries, however effortful and well-meaning, are normally not sufficient in preventing the erosion of democratic practices. In the cases of several African countries, corruption still is rife in spite of democratically elected governments, as one of the most severe examples, Zimbabwe, is often perceived to have backfired into outright militarism.

===Efficiency of the system===
Economist Donald Wittman has written numerous works attempting to counter criticisms of democracy common among his colleagues. He argues democracy is efficient based on the premise of rational voters, competitive elections, and relatively low political transactions costs. Economist Bryan Caplan argues that, while Wittman makes strong arguments for the latter two points, the first is vitiated by the insurmountable evidence for voter irrationality. The problem is not merely the voters' lack of information, but their poor judgement. For many voters, the difficulty of learning about a particular issue is too high compared to the likely costs of ignorance, but this ignorance does not lessen their enthusiasm for voting.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan. [http://econjwatch.org/articles/from-friedman-to-wittman-the-transformation-of-chicago-political-economy ''"From Friedman to Wittman: The Transformation of Chicago Political Economy"''], Econ Journal Watch, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists, such as Meltzer and Richard, have added that as industrial activity in a democracy increases, so too do the people's demands for subsidies and support from the government. By the [[median voter theorem]], only a few people actually hold the balance of power in the country, and many may be unhappy with their decisions. In this way, they argue, democracies are inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Allan H.|last2=Richard|first2=Scott F.|date=October 1981|title=A Rational Theory of the Size of Government|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|volume=89|issue=5|pages=914–927|doi=10.1086/261013|jstor=1830813|accessdate=April 28, 2014|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1749&amp;context=tepper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a system could result in a wealth disparity or racial discrimination. Fierlbeck (1998) points out that such a result is not necessarily due to a failing in the democratic process, but rather, "because democracy is responsive to the desires of a large middle class increasingly willing to disregard the muted voices of economically marginalized groups within its own borders."&lt;ref&gt;Shrag, P. (1956), "india elected anarchy." ''nehru'', 289(1734), 50-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The will of the democratic majority may not always be in the best interest of all citizens.

=== Susceptibility to propaganda ===

====Lack of political education====
{{See also|Low information voter|Low-information rationality|Deliberative democracy|Meritocracy}}
Voters may not be educated enough to exercise their democratic rights prudently. Politicians may take advantage of voters' irrationality, and compete more in the field of [[public relations]] and tactics, than in ideology. While arguments against democracy are often taken by advocates of democracy as an attempt to maintain or revive traditional hierarchy and autocratic rule, many extensions have been made to develop the argument further.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In Lipset's 1959 essay about the requirements for forming democracy, he found that almost all emerging democracies provided good education. However, education alone cannot sustain a democracy, though Caplan did note in 2005 that as people become educated, they think more like economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|last2=Lipset|first2=Seymour M.|date=June 1957|title=Political Sociology|url=http://csi.sagepub.com/content/6/2/79.extract|journal=Current Sociology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=79–99|doi=10.1177/001139215700600201|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians and special interests have attempted to manipulate [[public opinion]] for as long as recorded history − this has put into question the feasibility of democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Lawrence R.|date=1 December 2001|title=Commentary: Manipulators and Manipulation: Public Opinion in a Representative Democracy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/15635|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1361–1374|issn=1527-1927|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=cnps20|title=Manipulating Citizens: How Political Campaigns’ Use of Behavioral Social Science Harms Democracy|last1=Gorton|first1=William A.|date=2 January 2016|website=New Political Science|pages=61–80|doi=10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that mass media actually shapes public opinion, and can therefore be used to "control" democracy.

In 2016 [[Andrés Sepúlveda]] disclosed that he manipulated public opinion to rig elections in Latin America. According to him with a budget of $600,000 he led a team of hackers that stole campaign strategies, manipulated [[social media]] to create false waves of enthusiasm and derision, and installed [[spyware]] in opposition offices to help [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], a right-of-center candidate, win the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/|title=How to Hack an Election|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/political-cyberhacker-andres-sepulveda-reveals-how-he-digitally-rigged-elections-across-latin-a6965161.html|title=Man claims he rigged elections in most Latin American countries over 8 years|date=2 April 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] over 110,000 people have been purged and nearly 40,000 have been imprisoned in Turkey, which is or was considered to be a democratic nation, during the [[2016 Turkish purges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/269f0b22-8a27-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|title=Turkey’s crackdown on dissent has gone too far|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2016/11/02/turkeys-ruthless-slow-motion-coup-110000-purged-as-western-ally-cracks-down-on-dissent-journalism/|title=Turkey’s ruthless, slow-motion coup: 110,000 purged as Western ally cracks down on dissent, journalism|last1=Norton|first1=Ben|publisher=Salon|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limited responsiveness and representation ===
Robert A. Dahl defines democracies as systems of government that respond nearly fully to each and every one of their citizens. He then poses that no such, fully responsive system exists today.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, this does not mean that ''partially'' democratic regimes do not exist—they do. Thus, Dahl rejects a democracy dichotomy in favor of a democratization spectrum. To Dahl, the question is not whether a country is a democracy or not. The question is to what extent a country is experiencing democratization at a national level. Dahl measures this democratization in terms of the country's endorsement and reception of public contestation. And polyarchy, or "rule of the many people," is the only existing form of democratizeable government; that is, it is within polyarchies that democratization can flourish. Countries do not immediately transform from hegemonies and competitive oligarchies into democracies. Instead, a country that adopts democracy as its form of government can only claim to have switched to polyarchy, which is conducive to, but does not guarantee, democratization. Dahl's polyarchy spectrum ends at the point in which a country becomes a full polyarchy at the national level and begins to democratize at the subnational level, among its social and private affairs. Dahl is not deeply concerned about the limits of his polyarchy spectrum because he believes that most countries today still have a long way before they reach full polyarchy status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Revolution? Authority in a Good Society|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Dahl, whatever lies beyond full polyarchy is only possible, and thus only a concern, for advanced countries like the Western Europe.

== Criticism of democracy's outcome ==

===Mob rule===
{{Main|Ochlocracy}}
[[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: "Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists 5 forms of government from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only [[Utopia|Kallipolis]], an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a [[justice|just]] form of government.

Plato rejected [[Athenian democracy]] on the basis that such democracies were anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that democracies are unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such democracies were typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such democracies were a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.

According to Plato, other forms of government place too much focus on lesser virtues and degenerate into other forms from best to worst, starting with [[timocracy]], which overvalues honour, then [[oligarchy]], which overvalues wealth, which is followed by democracy. In democracy, the oligarchs, or merchant, are unable to wield their power effectively and the people take over, electing someone who plays on their wishes (for example, by throwing lavish festivals). However, the government grants the people too much freedom, and the state degenerates into the fourth form, [[tyranny]], or [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Michels, Robert. [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/MicPoli.html ''Political Parties – A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy,''] Jarrold &amp; Sons. London, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oppression by the majority====
{{Further|Tyranny of the majority}}
The [[constitutions]] of many countries have parts of them that restrict the nature of the types of laws that [[legislatures]]
can pass.  A fundamental idea behind some of these restrictions, is that the majority of a population and its elected legislature can often be the source of minority persecutions, such as with [[racial discrimination]]. For example, during the mid-1930s and mid-1970s in the democratic country of Sweden, the government forcibly sterilized thousands of innocent women. They were sterilized due to "'mental defects', or simply because they were of mixed race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/democracy.html|title=Why democracy is wrong|website=web.inter.nl.net|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second example is when, in 2014 in Pakistan, "a Christian couple were burnt alive in a brick kiln by a mob for their alleged burning of the pages of Quran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/capitalism-and-democracy-have-failed-to-protect-the-rights-of-minorities/|title=The Khilafah|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by little police retaliation and a statement from the President of Pakistan stating that his government would protect the rights and interests of the Christian community. Some countries throughout the world have judiciaries where judges can serve for long periods of time, and often serve under appointed posts. This is often balanced, however, by the fact that some trials are decided by [[juries]]. While many, like Wittman, have argued that democracies work much the same way as the free market and that there is competition among parties to prevent oppression by the majority, others have argued that there is actually very little competition among political parties in democracies due to the high cost associated with campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jlecono1&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Competition and Democracy|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|year=1958|publisher=HeinOnline|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John T. Wenders, a professor of Economics at the [[University of Idaho]], writes:

{{quote|"Freedom and democracy are different. In words attributed to Scottish historian Alexander Tytler: 'A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury.' Democracy evolves into kleptocracy. A majority bullying a minority is just as bad as a dictator, communist or otherwise, doing so. Democracy is two coyotes and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Democracy Would Doom Hong Kong|first=John T.|last=Wenders|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|date=January 1, 1998|accessdate=April 27, 2014|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/democracy-would-doom-hong-kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, some political scientists question the notion that majority rule is an "uncontested good."&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, K. (1998) ''Globalizing Democracy: Power, Legitimacy and the Interpretation of democratic ideas.'' (p. 13) Manchester University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; If we base our critique on the definition of democracy as governance based on the will of the majority, there can be some foreseeable consequences to this form of rule. For example, Fierlbeck (1998: 12) points out that the middle class majority in a country may decide to redistribute wealth and resources into the hands of those that they feel are most capable of investing or increasing them. Of course this is only a critique of a subset of types of democracy that primarily use majority rule.

US President [[James Madison]] devoted the whole of [[Federalist No. 10]] to a scathing critique of democracy and offered that republics are a far better solution, saying: "...democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against tyranny of the majority, stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: "the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic".

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] intended to address this criticism by combining democracy with [[republicanism]]. A [[constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysongovernm01lowegoog#page/n70/mode/2up ''"Democracy and the Constitution,"''] Essays on Government, Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co. New York, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; would limit the powers of what a simple majority can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Madison]], [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm Federalist No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclical theory of government====
[[Machiavelli]] put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZzHJlvXD-YC|title=Alexis de Tocqueville and the Art of Democratic Statesmanship|last1=Danoff|first1=Brian|last2=Hebert|first2=Louie Joseph|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7391-4529-6|page=88|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is too late. He put forth a cyclical theory of government where monarchies tend to decay into aristocracies, which then decay into democracies, which subsequently decay into anarchy, then tyranny, then return to monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJtAAAAQBAJ|title=The Foundations of Evolutionary Institutional Economics: Generic Institutionalism|last=Wäckerle|first=Manuel|date=August 15, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-81076-0|page=302|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVZ3TjL0-UC|title=Models of Democracy|last=Held|first=David|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754729|page=40|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the timeline of France before, during, and after the Revolution until the last Bourbon Monarch.

However Machiavelli's definition of democracy was narrower than the current one. He hypothesized that a hybrid system of government incorporating facets of all three major types (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) could break this cycle. Many modern democracies that have [[separation of powers]] are claimed to represent these kinds of hybrid governments. However, in modern democracies there is usually no direct correlation with Machiavelli's idea, because of weakening of the separation of powers, or erosion of the original function of the various branches. For example, the modern United States executive branch has slowly accumulated more power from the legislative branch, and the Senate no longer functions as a quasi-aristocratic body as was originally intended, since senators are now democratically elected.

===Political Coase theorem===
Some have tried to argue that the [[Coase theorem]] applies to political markets as well. [[Daron Acemoglu]], however, provides evidence to the contrary, claiming that the Coase Theorem is only valid while there are "rules of the game," so to speak, that are being enforced by the government. But when there is nobody there to enforce the rules for the government itself, there is no way to guarantee that low transaction costs will lead to an efficient outcome in democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|authorlink=Daron Acemoglu|date=2003|title=Why Not A Political Coase Theorem? Social Conflict, Commitment, And Politics|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=31|issue=4|pages=620–652|doi=10.1016/j.jce.2003.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]:  ''[[:uk:Дрогобицький коледж нафти і газу]]'') is one of technical colleges in [[Drohobych]], [[Ukraine]]. It was first established as Drohobych Petroleum Technical College in 1945, transforming into ''Petroleum and Gas College'' in 2012. It is the [[alma mater]] of many [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scientists, businessmen and politicians.

===Ukrainian SSR===

[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College was founded as [[Drohobych]] Petroleum Technical College on January 20, 1945 (Decree №58 of the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian Government]]). Since its establishment the school trained over 20 thousand specialists in oil, gas and their refining industry.

The first graduation ceremony was held in 1948.

Given the increasing demand for industry specialists by [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region companies, college opened a branch department in [[Boryslav]] in, 1953.  Evening courses were dedicated to specialists training in the fields of "Exploitation of oil and gas wells" and "The technology of oil and gas".

In 1957 Drohobych Petroleum Technical College was merged with [[Lviv]] College of Petroleum Refining.

In 1958 college established distance-learning department, conducting training of specialists in the fields of "Drilling oil and gas wells", "Exploitation of oil and gas wells", "Equipment of oil and gas industries" and "Chemical technology of oil and gas".

In 1959 a new branch (evening school) was opened in [[Dolyna]] with following desiplines offered: "Exploitation of oil and gas wells", "Equipment oil and gas industry" and "Oil and gas industry enterprises planning".

Due to the decrease in the number of applicants for evening departments, [[Boryslav]] and [[Dolyna]] branches ceased operations in 1973 and 1975 respectively.

===Post-Declaration===

In 1997 Petroleum Technical College received a license qualifying it for training junior specialists in the field of "Banking" and "Gas and oil exploitation and storage management".

Currently, the college prepares specialists in nearly all specialties related to oil and gas extraction and processing.

In December 2006, the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]] (Decree №64) accredited Petroleum Technical College as a higher educational institution of the first level and issued its first certificate of accreditation (license serial no. AB482982) granting college the right to provide educational services related to obtaining higher education level qualification "junior specialist".

In August 2012 college was renamed to "State Higher Educational Institution "[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College" (Decree №870 of the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine|Ministry of Education of Ukraine]]).

==College today==

College training is based on primary and secondary education on a full-time, part-time and distance learning basis. Total student population: 1600. Annual college intake ranges from 330 to 400 students. 46 of 99 teaching staff are lecturers of the first category, 7 - teaching Methodists, 3 PhDs, 4 Candidates of Science.

The College operates in conjunction with the [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] [[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|National Technical University of Oil and Gas]], [[Kiev]] [[Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] and [[Dnipro]] State Chemical Technology University. College is also represented as educational consulting office of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] [[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|National Technical University of Oil and Gas]] where alumni may continue their education at university of IV-th accreditation level. The best college graduates can enroll in partner universities for shorter term programmes (3 years instead of 4).

Full-time / part-time teaching is based on personal financing contracts and government scholarship schemes.

==Overview==
The space segment consists of a [[spacecraft bus]] and an [[electro-optical]] [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]. The electro-optical payload is a [[Push broom scanner|push-broom camera]] with [[Time delay and integration|Time Delay Integration (TDI)]] sensors (1 [[panchromatic]] and 4 [[multi-spectral image|multi-spectral]] bands). DubaiSat-2 is designed for a [[sun-synchronous orbit]] of 600&amp;nbsp;km, with a [[spatial resolution]] of 1m PAN and 4m Multispectral (MS), and a [[Swath width|Swath]] of 12.2&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="EIAST 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/technology/dubaisat-2-imaging-satellite-ready-for-blast-off | title=DubaiSat-2 imaging satellite ready for blast off | publisher=''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' | date=February 17, 2011 | accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modules in the satellite use two [[CAN bus|CAN Bus]] networks to communicate with each other and it has the capacity to store approximately 17,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of image data. It also includes an experimental [[propulsion system]] for orbit correction and maintenance. The satellite’s expected lifetime is at least five years.&lt;ref name="Spider"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.un-spider.org/about-us/news/2011-05-26t155900/dubaisat-2-be-improvement-predecessor | title=DubaiSat-2 to Be an Improvement on Predecessor | publisher=''[[UN-SPIDER|United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response]]'' | work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] | date=May 26, 2011 | accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubaisat-2-to-be-an-improvement-on-predecessor | title=DubaiSat-2 to be an improvement on predecessor | publisher=''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' | date=May 26, 2011 | accessdate=November 18, 2012 | author=Conroy, Erin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E24 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emirates247.com/business/technology/dubaisat-2-project-ready-after-passing-key-tests-2012-08-16-1.471800 | title=DubaiSat-2 project ready after passing key tests | publisher=''[[Emirates 24/7]]'' | date=August 12, 2012 | accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space segment===
DubaiSat-2 has a [[hexagonal]] shape. The mechanical bus consists of 2 decks and an upper sun shield to protect the cold propellants from [[solar radiation|solar]] and [[Earth radiation]]. The electronics are distributed on the decks and on the side panels. Four solar panels are attached to the sides of the satellite. [[Longerons]] and rails make up the bus structure frame. On the top, [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)]] [[strut]]s hold the Sun shield at the baffle of the ''High Resolution Advanced Imaging System'' (HiRAIS). The High-Resolution Imaging System is attached to the bus at the internal deck. The mechanical configuration of the satellite is less than 2000&amp;nbsp;mm in height and less than 1500&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. The total mass of the satellite is less than 300&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="EO Portal 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/dubaisat-2 | title=DubaiSat-2 | publisher=''eoPortal Directory'' | accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power system supplies and controls the required voltage levels and current essential for satellite operation during its mission. The power system uses a rechargeable [[Li-ion battery]] to provide power for the satellite’s payload and other subsystems. The system is divided into two stages, first is the charging stage and the second is the discharging stage.
The charging stage is made of a [[Solar power|solar power generator]] and [[Voltage regulator|power regulator]]. DubaiSat-2 generates more than 450[[Watt|W]] of power using four solar panels. Each solar panel contains 6 arrays and each array consists of 26 [[solar cells|cells]]. The solar panels charge the batteries. The battery charging process is handled and regulated by the ''[[Battery management system|Battery Charging Regulators]]'' modules. DubaiSat-2 has three battery charging regulators with hot redundancy configuration which seamlessly take over if the primary battery charging regulator fails. The spacecraft can function normally with only two battery charging regulators.&lt;ref name="EO Portal 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAST 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eiast.ae/default.aspx?options={a93e7034-0baa-4e2b-be21-721a4b6feb8e}&amp;view=Article&amp;layout=Article&amp;itemId=161&amp;id=258 | title=DubaiSat-2 Space Segment | publisher=''[[Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology]]'' | accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AME 3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ameinfo.com/eiast-launches-logo-competition-dubaisat-2-project-319107 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117074426/http://www.ameinfo.com/eiast-launches-logo-competition-dubaisat-2-project-319107 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 17, 2013 | title=EIAST launches logo competition for DubaiSat-2 project | publisher=''[[AMEinfo.com|AME Info]]'' | date=November 17, 2012 | accessdate=December 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mission payload====
The ''High-Resolution Advanced Imaging System (HiRAIS)'' is the primary payload of Dubaisat-2. It is an advanced Earth observation Camera which captures high resolution images and is capable of other functions such as [[Data transmission|high-speed data transmission]]. The HiRAIS is a compact and light weight instrument; and is built from a composite material to obtain high strength while keeping its weight down. The camera is based on a [[Korsch telescope|Korsch optical design]] which uses a three-mirror configuration to reduce optical irregularities and provides a wide field of view.&lt;ref name="EIAST 3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eiast.ae/default.aspx?options={6c9456d6-36c1-4fa2-8f09-916d30089868}&amp;view=Eiast&amp;layout=Eiast&amp;itemId=61&amp;Id=354 | title=DubaiSat-2 mission payload – HiRAIS | publisher=''[[Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology]]'' | date=November 26, 2012 | accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ameinfo.com/eiast-international-astronautical-congress-platform-highlight-316521 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121003450/http://www.ameinfo.com/eiast-international-astronautical-congress-platform-highlight-316521 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 21, 2013 | title=EIAST uses International Astronautical Congress platform to highlight achievements | publisher=''[[AMEinfo.com|AME Info]]'' | date=October 23, 2012 | accessdate=December 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HiRAIS consists of three main units: the Electro-Optical Subsystem, the Solid-State Recorder Unit, and the Image Transmission Unit. The Electro-Optical Subsystem is composed of the telescope, an auxiliary camera module, and a Focal Plane Assembly which are all integrated into one system. It is a pushbroom type camera with a 1-meter Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) for panchromatic imagery and 4 meter GSD in four multispectral bands.&lt;ref name="EO Portal 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAST 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/technology/latest-uae-satellite-set-to-be-launched-in-next-few-months | title=Latest UAE satellite set to be launched in next few months | publisher=''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' | date=August 11, 2012 | accessdate=December 8, 2012 | author=Croucher, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solid-State Recorder Unit handles the processing, storage and maintenance of image data and is capable of storing image data received from the Focal Plane Assembly during the imaging mode. It is also responsible for image data [[Data compression|compressing]], [[encrypting]] and [[encoding]] before sending it to the Image Transmission Unit during downloading mode. The unit has a storage capacity of 256 Gbit arranged in 4 identical storage boards.&lt;ref name="EO Portal 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAST 2"/&gt;

The Image Transmission Unit provides transmission of X-band data at a rate of 160 Mbit/s. It is divided into two main components: X-band Transmitter Unit and a high gain X-band Antenna.&lt;ref name="EO Portal 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAST 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interact 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&amp;cid=1289993679928&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWAM_E_Layout | title=EIAST engineers reveal design details and specifications of DubaiSat-2 | publisher=''[[Emirates News Agency]]'' | date=May 25, 2011 | accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamics Explorer''' was a [[NASA]] mission, launched on August 3, 1981 and terminated on February 28, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/D/DE.html DE (Dynamics Explorer)]&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of two unmanned satellites, DE-1 and DE-2, whose purpose was to investigate the interractions between plasmas in the [[magnetosphere]] and those in the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1981-070A NSSDC Master Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; The two satellites were launched together into [[Geographical pole|polar]] [[coplanar]] orbits, which allowed them to simultaneously observe the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere.

==Design==
Both spacecraft had a polygonal shape, and were approximately 137&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 115&amp;nbsp;cm high. Each also had a 200-cm radio antenna and two 6-meter booms which were needed to distance some of the equipment from the main body of the spacecraft. They were stacked on top of each other and launched aboard a Delta 3000 booster rocket. Upon reaching orbit, the two spacecraft departed from the booster and entered separate orbits. Dynamics Explorer 1 was placed into a high altitude elliptical orbit, while DE-2 was put into a lower orbit that was also more circular.

===Dynamics Explorer 1 Instrumentation===
The main instrument aboard Dynamics Explorer 1 was the Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI). This instrument, designed and built by the Plasma Wave Group, measured auroral kilometric radiation, auroral hiss, Z-mode radiation, and narrow band electromagnetic emissions. Additional Instruments aboard the spacecraft included:
*The Spin-scan Auroral Imager (SAI)
*The Retarding Ion Mass Spectrometer (RIMS)
*The Energetic Ion Mass Spectrometer (EIMS)

===Dynamics Explorer 2 Instrumentation===
The Dynamics Explorer 2 carried the following instruments for data collection:
*A [[Retarding Potential Analyzer]], which measured the ion flux along the velocity vector of the spacecraft. This data was then used to determine the ion temperature and drift velocity in the spacecraft's area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://utd500.utdallas.edu/~coley/de2_data.html Dynamics Explorer 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315074624/http://utd500.utdallas.edu/~coley/de2_data.html |date=2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An [[Ion drift meter]], which measured the ambient ion drift.
*A [[Magnetometer]]
*A [[Vector Electric Field Instrument]]    [[Image:Auroral oval.gif|thumb|right|An aurora as seen by one of the Dynamics Explorers]]
*A [[Neutral Atmosphere Composition Spectrometer]]
*A [[Wind and Temperature Spectrometer]] (WATS), which measured the zonal and vertical components of the neutral winds, as well as the kinetic temperature.&lt;ref name=Spencer1982&gt;Spencer, N. W., Wharton, L. E., Carignan, G. R. and Maurer, J. C. (1982), Thermosphere zonal winds, vertical motions and temperature as measured from Dynamics Explorer. Geophys. Res. Lett., 9: 953–956. doi:10.1029/GL009i009p00953.&lt;/ref&gt;  (The zonal wind component is the component in the direction of lines of latitude - i.e., east-west.)  The WATS instrument on DE-2 is one of the few satellite instruments which has measured thermosphere vertical wind speeds, with the Neutral Atmosphere Temperature Instrument (NATE)&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, N.

Lett., 3: 313–316. doi:10.1029/GL003i006p00313.&lt;/ref&gt; on Atmospheric Explorer C (AE-C) being one other.
*A [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]] (FPI), which measured the meridional component of the neutral winds.&lt;ref name=Spencer1982 /&gt;  (The meridional wind component is the component in the direction of lines of longitude - i.e., north-south.)
*A [[Low-Altitude Plasma Instrument]]
*A [[Langmuir probe]]

==Mission Results==
As a result of a malfunction in the Delta 3000 booster rocket in which its main engine shut off slightly early, DE-2 was placed into a slightly lower orbit than was anticipated. This was not a serious problem, however, and the spacecraft had lasted its expected lifespan when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on February 19, 1983. DE-1, being in a higher orbit, continued to collect data until 1991, when the mission was officially terminated.

'''Electrohydrodynamics''' ('''EHD'''), also known as '''electro-fluid-dynamics''' ('''EFD''') or '''electrokinetics''', is the study of the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of [[electrically charged]] fluids.&lt;ref name=Castellanos&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Antonio Castellanos Mata|Castellanos, A.]] | title=Electrohydrodynamics | year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study of the motions of [[ion]]ized particles or molecules and their interactions with [[electric field]]s and the surrounding fluid. The term may be considered to be synonymous with the rather elaborate '''electrostrictive hydrodynamics'''. ESHD covers the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms: [[electrophoresis]], electrokinesis, [[dielectrophoresis]], [[electro-osmosis]], and [[electrorotation]]. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of [[electrical energy]] into [[kinetic energy]], and ''vice versa''.

In the first instance, shaped [[electrostatic field]]s (ESF's) create [[hydrostatic pressure]] (HSP, or motion) in [[dielectric media]]. When such media are [[fluid]]s, a [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] is produced. If the dielectric is a [[vacuum]] or a [[solid]], no flow is produced. Such flow can be directed against the [[electrode]]s, generally to move the electrodes. In such case, the moving structure acts as an [[electric motor]]. Practical fields of interest of EHD are the common [[air ioniser]], [[electrohydrodynamic thruster]]s and EHD cooling systems.

In the second instance, the converse takes place. A powered flow of medium within a shaped electrostatic field adds energy to the system which is picked up as a [[potential difference]] by electrodes. In such case, the structure acts as an [[electrical generator]].

== Electrokinesis ==

'''Electrokinesis''' is the particle or [[fluid]] transport produced by an electric field acting on a fluid having a net mobile charge. (See [[-kinesis]] for explanation and further uses of the -kinesis suffix.)  ''Electrokinesis'' was first observed by Ferdinand Frederic Reuss during 1808, in the [[electrophoresis]] of clay particles &lt;ref&gt;Wall, Staffan. "The history of electrokinetic phenomena." Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science 15.3 (2010): 119-124.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was also noticed and publicized in the 1920s by [[Thomas Townsend Brown]] which he called the [[Biefeld–Brown effect]], although he seems to have miss-identified it as an electric field acting on gravity.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite news

Electrokinesis is of considerable practical importance in [[microfluidics]],&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chang, H.C. |author2=Yeo, L. | title=Electrokinetically Driven Microfluidics and Nanofluidics | year=2009 | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirby, B.J. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices.| url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook| year=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-11903-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruus&gt;{{cite book | author=Bruus, H. | title=Theoretical Microfluidics | year=2007 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it offers a way to manipulate and convey fluids in microsystems using only electric fields, with no moving parts.

The force acting on the fluid, is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{I d}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt; is the resulting force, measured in [[newton (unit)|newtons]], &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt; is the current, measured in [[ampere]]s, &lt;math&gt;d &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between electrodes, measured in metres, and &lt;math&gt;k &lt;/math&gt;'' ''is the ion mobility coefficient of the dielectric fluid, measured in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s).

If the electrodes are free to move within the fluid, while keeping their distance fixed from each other, then such a force will actually propel the electrodes with respect to the fluid.

''Electrokinesis'' has also been observed in biology, where it was found to cause physical damage to neurons by inciting movement in their membranes.&lt;ref name=patkesn1&gt;{{cite book

== Water electrokinetics ==

In October 2003, Dr. Daniel Kwok, Dr. Larry Kostiuk and two graduate students from the [[University of Alberta]] discussed a method of hydrodynamic to electrical [[energy conversion]] by exploiting the natural electrokinetic properties of a liquid such as ordinary [[tap water]], by pumping fluids through tiny micro-channels with a pressure difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Jun|last2=Lu|first2=Fuzhi|last3=Kostiuk|first3=Larry W.|last4=Kwok|first4=Daniel Y.|title=Electrokinetic microchannel battery by means of electrokinetic and microfluidic phenomena|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0960-1317/13/6/320/meta|website=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering|pages=963|language=en|doi=10.1088/0960-1317/13/6/320|date=1 January 2003|bibcode=2003JMiMi..13..963Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology could some day provide a practical and clean energy storage device, replacing today's batteries, for devices such as mobile phones or calculators which would be charged up by simply pumping water to high [[pressure]]. Pressure would then be released on demand, for fluid flow to take place over the micro-channels. When water travels, or streams over a surface, the ions of which water is made "rub" against the solid, leaving the surface slightly charged. Kinetic energy from the moving ions would thus be converted to electrical energy. Although the power generated from a single channel is extremely small, millions of parallel micro-channels can be used to increase the power output.
This [[streaming potential]], water-flow phenomenon was discovered in 1859 by German physicist [[Georg Hermann Quincke]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref name=Kirby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levich&gt;{{cite book | author=Levich, V.I. | title=Physicochemical Hydrodynamics | year=1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electrokinetic instabilities ==

The fluid flows in [[microfluidic]] and nanofluidic devices are often stable and strongly damped by viscous forces (with [[Reynolds number]]s of order unity or smaller). However, heterogeneous ionic conductivity fields in the presence of applied [[electric field]]s can, under certain conditions, generate an unstable flow field owing to '''electrokinetic instabilities (EKI)'''. Conductivity gradients are prevalent in on-chip electrokinetic processes such as preconcentration methods (e.g. field amplified sample stacking and [[isoelectric focusing]]), multidimensional assays, and systems with poorly specified sample chemistry.  The dynamics and periodic morphology of ''electrokinetic instabilities'' are similar to other systems with [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor]] instabilities. The particular case of a plat plane geometry with homogeneous ions injection in the bottom side leads to a mathematical frame identical to the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]].

EKI's can be leveraged for rapid [[Mixing (physics)|mixing]] or can cause undesirable dispersion in sample injection, separation and stacking. These instabilities are caused by a coupling of electric fields and ionic conductivity gradients that results in an electric body force. This coupling results in an electric body force in the bulk liquid, outside the [[double layer (interfacial)#Electrical double layers|electric double layer]], that can generate temporal, convective, and absolute flow instabilities. Electrokinetic flows with conductivity gradients become unstable when the [[electroviscous effects|electroviscous]] stretching and folding of conductivity interfaces grows faster than the dissipative effect of molecular diffusion.

Since these flows are characterized by low velocities and small length scales, the Reynolds number is below 0.01 and the flow is ''laminar''. The onset of instability in these flows is best described as an electric "Rayleigh number".

[[File:Shell haven flare.jpg|thumb|Flare stack at the [[Shell Haven]] refinery in England.]]
A '''gas flare''', alternatively known as a '''flare stack''', is a gas [[combustion]] device used in industrial plants such as [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, [[natural gas processing]] plants as well as at oil or gas production sites having [[oil well]]s, [[gas well]]s, [[Drilling rig|offshore oil and gas rigs]] and [[landfill]]s. 
[[File:North Dakota Flaring of Gas.JPG|thumb|North Dakota Flaring of Gas]]
In industrial plants, flare stacks are primarily used for burning off [[Flammability|flammable]] gas released by [[pressure relief valve]]s during unplanned over-pressuring of plant equipment.&lt;ref name=EPA-VOC&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/cs3-2ch1.pdf EPA/452/B-02-001], Section 3.0: VOC Controls, Section 3.2: VOC Destruction Controls, Chapter 1: Flares.

Gas flaring at many oil and gas production sites protects against the dangers of over-pressuring industrial plant equipment. When [[Crude oil|petroleum crude oil]] is extracted and produced from onshore or offshore [[oil well]]s, [[Natural gas|raw natural gas]] associated with the oil is brought to the surface as well. Especially in areas of the world lacking [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and other gas transportation infrastructure, vast amounts of such [[Associated petroleum gas|associated gas]] are commonly flared as waste or unusable gas. The flaring of associated gas may occur at the top of a vertical flare stack (as in the adjacent photo) or it may occur in a ground-level flare in an earthen pit. Preferably, associated gas is reinjected into the reservoir, which saves it for future use while maintaining higher well pressure and crude oil producibility.&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, William (2008). Petroleum Refining in Nontechnical Language. Tulsa, OK: PennWell. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Overall flare system in industrial plants ==
[[Image:FlareStack System.png|right|thumbnail|400px|Schematic flow diagram of an overall vertical, elevated flare stack system in an industrial plant.]]
When industrial plant equipment items are over-pressured, the [[pressure relief valve]] is an essential safety device that automatically release gases and sometimes liquids. Those pressure relief valves are required by industrial design codes and standards as well as by law.

The released gases and liquids are routed through large [[piping]] systems called ''flare headers'' to a vertical elevated flare. The released gases are [[Combustion|burned]] as they exit the flare stacks. The size and brightness of the resulting flame depends upon the flammable material's flow rate in [[joule]]s per hour (or [[U.S. customary units|btu]] per hour).&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt;

Most industrial plant flares have a [[vapor-liquid separator]] (also known as a knockout drum) upstream of the flare to remove any large amounts of liquid that may accompany the relieved gases.

[[Steam]] is very often injected into the flame to reduce the formation of black smoke. When too much steam is added, a condition known as "over steaming" can occur resulting in reduced combustion efficiency and higher emissions. To keep the flare system functional, a small amount of gas is continuously burned, like a pilot light, so that the system is always ready for its primary purpose as an over-pressure safety system.

The adjacent flow diagram depicts the typical components of an overall industrial flare stack system:&lt;ref name=EPA-VOC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mannan/&gt;

*A knockout drum to remove any oil or water from the relieved gases.
*A water seal drum to prevent any flashback of the [[flame]] from the top of the flare stack.
*An alternative gas recovery system for use during partial plant startups and shutdowns as well as other times when required. The recovered gas is routed into the fuel gas system of the overall industrial plant.
*A steam injection system to provide an external [[momentum]] force used for efficient mixing of [[air]] with the relieved gas, which promotes smokeless burning.
*A [[Pilot light|pilot flame]] (with its [[ignition system]]) that burns all the time so that it is available to ignite relieved gases when needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durag.com/userfiles/file/bro_smitsvonk_products_en.pdf Product Overview Ignition Systems]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Smitsvonk, November 2001.

==Impacts of waste flaring associated gas from oil drilling sites and other facilities==
[[File:Niger Delta Gas-Flares.jpg|right|thumbnail|185px|Flaring of associated gas from an oil well site in Nigeria.]]
[[File:First gas from the Oselvar module on the Ula platform on April 14th, 2012.jpg|right|thumbnail|185px|Flaring gases from an oil platform in the North Sea.]]

Improperly operated flares may emit [[methane]] and other [[volatile organic compounds]] as well as [[sulfur dioxide]] and other [[sulfur]] compounds, which are known to exacerbate asthma and other respiratory  problems. Other emissions from improperly operated flares may include, [[aromatic hydrocarbons]] ([[benzene]], [[toluene]],  [[xylenes]]) and [[benzapyrene]], which are known to be carcinogenic.

Flaring can affect wildlife by attracting birds and insects to the flame. Approximately 7,500 migrating songbirds were attracted to and killed by the flare at the liquefied natural gas terminal in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on September 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/7-500-songbirds-killed-at-canaport-gas-plant-in-saint-john-1.1857615 7,500 songbirds killed at Canaport gas plant in Saint John] (online CBC News, September 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar incidents have occurred at flares on offshore oil and gas installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://play.psych.mun.ca/~mont/pubs/seabirds.pdf Seabirds at Risk around Offshore Oil Platforms in the North-west Atlantic], Marine Pollution Bulletin, Vol. 42, No. 12, pp. 1,285-1,290, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Moths are known to be attracted to lights. A brochure published by the Secretariat of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] describing the Global Taxonomy Initiative describes a situation where "''a taxonomist working in a tropical forest noticed that a gas flare at an oil refinery was attracting and killing hundreds of these [hawk or sphinx] moths. Over the course of the months and years that the refinery was running a vast number of moths must have been killed, suggesting that plants could not be pollinated over a large area of forest''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/doc/publications/gti-brochure-en.pdf The Global Taxonomy Initiative - The Response to a Problem] (scroll down to the section entitled "Pollinating moths")&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of 2011, 150 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cubic meters (5.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; cubic feet) of associated gas are flared annually. That is equivalent to about 25 per cent of the annual natural gas consumption in the United States or about 30 per cent of the annual gas consumption in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=GGFR&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGGFR/Resources/GGFR_NewBrochure%28Oct2011%29.pdf Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), World Bank], October 2011 Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; If it were to reach market, this quantity of gas (at a nominal value of $5.62 per 1000 cubic feet) would be worth $29.8 billion USD.&lt;ref name=PRICES&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0607 Annual Energy Review, Table&amp;nbsp;6.7 Natural&amp;nbsp;Gas&amp;nbsp;Wellhead,&amp;nbsp;Citygate,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Imports&amp;nbsp;Prices,&amp;nbsp;1949-2011 (Dollars&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;Thousand&amp;nbsp;Cubic&amp;nbsp;Feet), United States Energy Information Administration], September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as of the end of 2011, 10 countries accounted for 72 per cent of the flaring, and twenty for 86 per cent. The top ten leading contributors to world gas flaring at the end of 2011, were (in declining order): Russia (27%), [[Nigeria]] (11%), [[Iran]] (8%), [[Iraq]] (7%), United States (5%), [[Algeria]] (4%), [[Kazakhstan]] (3%), [[Angola]] (3%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (3%) and [[Venezuela]] (3%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/D03ET1BVD0 Estimated Flared Volumes from Satellite Data, 2007-2011].

{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}

A '''gravity train''' is a theoretical means of [[transport]]ation intended to go between two points on the surface of a [[sphere]], following a straight [[tunnel]] that goes directly from one point to the other through the interior of the sphere.

In a large body such as a [[planet]], this train could be left to [[acceleration|accelerate]] using just the force of [[gravity]], since during the first half of the trip (from the point of departure until the middle), the downward pull towards the center of gravity would pull it towards the destination. During the second half of the trip, the acceleration would be in the opposite direction relative to the trajectory, but (ignoring the effects of [[friction]]) the speed acquired before would be enough to cancel this deceleration exactly (so that the train would reach its destination with speed equal to zero).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac|last=Newton|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
In reality, there are two reasons gravity trains do not exist. First, a lengthy transit distance would pierce the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and traverse a region where rock is more fluid than solid. No materials are known that would withstand the tremendous heat and pressure in the [[inner core]]. Temperature is estimated as 5,700 K (5,430&amp;nbsp;°C; 9,800&amp;nbsp;°F), and pressure as high as about 330 to 360 gigapascals (3,300,000 to 3,600,000 atm). Secondly, frictional losses would be significant. Rolling friction losses could be reduced by using a [[Maglev (transport)|magnetically levitated]] train. However, unless all air is evacuated from the tunnel, frictional losses due to [[Drag (physics)|air resistance]] would render the gravity train unusable. Evacuating the atmosphere to make it a [[vactrain]] would eliminate this drag but would require additional power.  Such objections would not apply for solid planets and moons that do not have an atmosphere.

==Origin of the concept==

In the 17th century, British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] presented the idea of an object accelerating inside a planet in a letter to [[Isaac Newton]]. A gravity train project was seriously presented to the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]] in the 19th century. The same idea was proposed, without calculation, by [[Lewis Carroll]] in 1893 in ''[[Sylvie and Bruno Concluded]]''. The idea was rediscovered in the 1960s when physicist Paul Cooper published a paper in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' suggesting that gravity trains be considered for a future transportation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842469,00.html | title= To Everywhere in 42 Minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical considerations ==
Under the assumption of a spherical planet with uniform density, and ignoring [[Relativistic speed|relativistic effects]] as well as friction, a gravity train has the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/566538/Gravity-Train-Project Robin Davis: A Physicist's Pipe Dream]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The duration of a trip depends only on the [[density]] of the planet and the [[gravitational constant]], but not on the diameter of the planet.
* The maximum speed is reached at the middle point of the trajectory.

For gravity trains between points which are not the [[antipodes]] of each other, the following hold:
* The shortest time tunnel through a homogeneous earth is a [[hypocycloid]]; in the special case of two antipodal points, the hypocycloid degenerates to a straight line.
* All straight-line gravity trains on a given planet take exactly the same amount of time to complete a journey (that is, no matter where on the surface the two endpoints of its trajectory are located).

On the planet [[Earth]] specifically, since a gravity train's movement is the projection of a very [[Low Earth Orbit]] satellite's movement onto a line, it has the following parameters:
* The travel time equals 2530.30 seconds (nearly 42.2 minutes, half the period of a Low Earth Orbit satellite), assuming Earth were a perfect sphere of uniform density.
* By taking into account the realistic density distribution inside the Earth, as known from the [[Preliminary Reference Earth Model]], the expected fall-through time is reduced from 42 to 38 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/83/3/10.1119/1.4898780&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a train that goes directly through the center of the Earth, the maximum speed is first cosmic velocity - about 7,900 [[metre per second|meters per second]] (28440&amp;nbsp;km/h) ([[Mach number|Mach]] 23.2).

To put some numbers in perspective, the deepest current bore hole is the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]] with a true depth of 12,262 meters. While to cover a distance between London and Paris (350&amp;nbsp;km) via a [[hypocycloid]]ical path would need the creation of a 55,704-metre-deep hole. This depth isn't only 4.5 times as deep; it will also already need a tunnel that passes inside the [[Earth's mantle]].

==Mathematical derivation==

Using the approximations that the [[Earth]] is perfectly
[[sphere|spherical]] and of uniform [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, and the fact that within a
[[Shell theorem|uniform hollow sphere]] there is no gravity, the gravitational acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
experienced by a body within the Earth is proportional to the
ratio of the distance from the center &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to the Earth's radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because underground at distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the center is like
being on the surface of a planet of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, within a hollow sphere
which contributes nothing.

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{G\rho V}{r^2} = \frac{G\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi\,r^3}{r^2} = G\rho \frac{4}{3}\pi\,r &lt;/math&gt;

On the surface, &lt;math&gt;r = R&lt;/math&gt;, so the gravitational acceleration is &lt;math&gt;g = G\rho
\frac{4}{3}\pi\,R &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the gravitational acceleration at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{r}{R}\,g&lt;/math&gt;

===Diametric path to antipodes===

In the case of a straight line through the center of the Earth, the
acceleration of the body is equal to that of gravity: it is falling freely
straight down.  We start falling the surface, so at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
(treating acceleration and velocity as positive downwards):

:&lt;math&gt;r_t = R - \int_0^t v_t \,dt = R - \int_0^t\int_0^t a_t\,dt\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating twice: 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -a_t = -\frac{r}{R}\,g = -\omega^2\,r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt\frac{g}{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  This class of problems, where there is a restoring force proportional to the displacement away from zero, has general solutions of the form &lt;math&gt;r = k \cos(\omega t + \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, and describes [[simple harmonic motion]] such as in a [[spring (device)|spring]] or [[pendulum]].

In this case &lt;math&gt; r_t = R \cos \sqrt\frac{g}{R}\,t &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;r_0 = R&lt;/math&gt;, we begin at the surface at time zero, and oscillate back and forth forever.

The travel time to the [[antipodes]] is half of one cycle of this oscillator, that is the time for the argument to  &lt;math&gt;\cos \sqrt\frac{g}{R}\,t&lt;/math&gt; to sweep out &lt;math&gt;{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; radians.  Using simple approximations of &lt;math&gt;g = 10\text{ m}/\text{s}^2, R = 6500\text{ km}&lt;/math&gt; that time is

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac \pi \omega = \frac \pi {\sqrt\frac{g}{R}} \approx \frac{3.1415926}{\sqrt\frac{10}{6500000}} \approx 2532 \text{ s} &lt;/math&gt;

===Straight path between two arbitrary points===

[[File:GravTrainTangent1.png|thumb|Path of gravity train]]

For the more general case of the straight line path between any two points on the surface of a sphere we calculate the acceleration of the body as it moves [[friction]]lessly along its straight path.

The body travels along AOB, O being the midpoint of the path, and the closest point to the center of the Earth on this path.  At distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; along this path, the force of gravity depends on distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the center of the Earth as above.  Using the shorthand &lt;math&gt;b = R \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; for length OC:

:&lt;math&gt;g_r = \frac{x}{R}\,g = \frac{\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}{R}\,g&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting acceleration on the body, because is it on a frictionless
[[inclined_plane#Analysis|inclined surface]], is &lt;math&gt;g_r \cos \varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

[[File:GravTrainTangent2.png|thumb|Diagram of forces on a gravity train on non-diametrical straight line path]]

:&lt;math&gt;a_r = g_r \cos \varphi =  \frac{\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}{R}\,g \cos \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\cos \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;r/x = \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, so substituting:

:&lt;math&gt;a_r =  \frac{\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}{R}\,g\,\frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2+b^2}} = \frac{r}{R} \, g &lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the same for this new &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, distance along AOB away from O, as for the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; in the [[diameter|diametric]] case along ACD.  So the remaining analysis is the same, accommodating the initial condition that the maximal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;R \cos \theta = AO&lt;/math&gt; the complete equation of motion is

: &lt;math&gt; r_t = R \cos \theta \cos \sqrt\frac{g}{R}\,t &lt;/math&gt;

The time constant &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt\frac{g}{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as in the diametric case so the journey time is still 42 minutes; it's just that all the distances and speeds are scaled by the constant &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Independence from radius of planet===

The time constant &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &lt;math&gt;\frac{g}{R}&lt;/math&gt; so if we expand that we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{g}{R} = \frac{GM/R^2}{R} = \frac{GM}{R^3} = \frac{G\rho\,V}{R^3} = \frac{G\rho\,\frac{4}{3}\pi\,R^3}{R^3} = G\rho\,\frac{4}{3}\pi &lt;/math&gt;

which depends only on the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; the [[density]] of the planet.  The size of the planet is immaterial; the journey time is the same if the density is the same.

==In fiction==
The 1914 book [[Tik-Tok of Oz]] has a tube, that passed from Oz, through the center of the earth, emerging in the country of the Great Jinjin, Tittiti-Hoochoo.

In the 2012 movie ''[[Total Recall (2012 film)|Total Recall]]'', a gravity train called "The Fall" goes through the center of the Earth to commute between Western Europe and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2012/08/13/the-science-of-total-recall/|title=The Science of Total Recall | first=Jason|last=Martinez|date=2012-08-13|work= Wolfram-Alpha Blog |accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/06/spoiler-alert-the-8000-mile-hole-in-total-recall/|title=Spoiler Alert: The 8,000-Mile Hole in Total Recall|first=Lily|last=Rothman|date=August 6, 2012 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=March 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fagus wood.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Beech]] is a popular hardwood]]
'''Hardwood''' is [[wood]] from [[dicot]] [[tree]]s. These are usually found in broad-leaved temperate and [[tropical forest]]s.  In [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] [[latitude]]s they are mostly [[deciduous]], but in [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]] mostly [[evergreen]]. Hardwood contrasts with [[softwood]] (which is from [[gymnosperm]] trees).

==Characteristics==
 [[Image:Hard Soft Wood.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] images showing the presence of pores in hardwoods ([[oak]], top) and absence in [[softwood]]s ([[pine]], bottom)]]
Hardwoods are produced by [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]] trees that reproduce by flowers, and have broad leaves. Many species are deciduous. Those of temperate regions lose their leaves every autumn as temperatures fall and are dormant in the winter, but those of tropical regions may shed their leaves in response to seasonal or sporadic periods of drought.  Hardwood from deciduous species, such as oak, normally shows annual [[dendrochronology|growth rings]], but these may be absent in some [[tropical timber|tropical hardwoods]].

Hardwoods have a more complex structure than softwoods and are often much slower growing as a result. The dominant feature separating "hardwoods" from softwoods is the presence of pores, or [[vessel element|vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;CRC Handbook of Materials Science, Vol IV, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels may show considerable variation in size, shape of perforation plates (simple, scalariform, reticulate, foraminate), and structure of cell wall, such as spiral thickenings.

As the name suggests, the wood from these trees is generally harder than that of softwoods, but there are significant exceptions.  In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, with the range in density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods; some hardwoods (''e.g.'', [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]]) are softer than most softwoods, while [[taxus|yew]] is an example of a hard softwood.

==Applications==
Hardwoods are employed in a large range of applications, including [[fuel]], [[tool]]s, [[construction]], [[boat building]], [[furniture]] making, [[musical instrument]]s, [[Wood flooring|flooring]], [[Outdoor cooking|cooking]], [[barrel]]s, and manufacture of [[charcoal]]. Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood. In the past, tropical hardwoods were easily available, but the supply of some species, such as Burma [[teak]] and [[mahogany]], is now becoming scarce due to over-exploitation. Cheaper "hardwood" doors, for instance, now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a core of softwood, plywood or [[medium-density fibreboard]] (MDF). Hardwoods may be used in a variety of objects, but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability, appearance, and performance. Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes. This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers, including density, grain, pore size, growth and fibre pattern, flexibility and ability to be steam bent. For example, the [[Wood grain |interlocked grain]] of [[elm]] wood (''Ulmus'' spp.) makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Cooking ===
There is a correlation between density and calories/volume. This makes the denser hardwoods like [[oak]], [[cherry]], and [[apple]] more suited for camp fires, cooking fires, and smoking meat, as they tend to burn hotter and longer than softwoods like [[pine]] or cedar whose low-density construction and highly-flammable [[sap]] make them burn quickly and without producing quite as much heat.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually, one electrolyte is an aqueous electrolyte composed of hydrophilic ions such as NaCl dissolved in water and the other electrolyte is a lipophilic salt such as [[tetrabutylammonium]] [[tetraphenylborate]] dissolved in an organic solvent immiscible with water such as [[nitrobenzene]], or [[1,2-dichloroethane]].

An ITIES is an electrochemical interface that is either polarisable or polarised. An ITIES is said ''polarisable'' if one can change the [[Galvani potential]] difference, or in other words the difference of inner potentials between the two adjacent phases, without noticeably changing the chemical composition of the respective phases (i.e. without noticeable electrochemical reactions taking place at the interface).  An ITIES system is said ''polarised'' if the distribution of the different charges and redox species between the two phases determines the Galvani potential difference.

==Charge transfer reactions of an ITIES==
Three major classes of charge transfer reactions can be studied at an ITIES:
*Ion transfer reactions
*Assisted ion transfer reactions
*Heterogeneous electron transfer reactions

[[Image:ITIES1.jpg|center|500px]]

The [[Nernst equation]] for an ion transfer reaction reads

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi = \phi^\text{w} - \phi^\text{o} = \Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_i + \frac{RT}{z_iF}\ln\left(\frac{a^\text{o}_i}{a^\text{w}_i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_i&lt;/math&gt; is the standard transfer potential defined as the Gibbs energy of transfer expressed in a voltage scale.

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_i = \frac{\Delta G^{\ominus ,\text{w}\rightarrow \text{o}}_{tr,i}}{z_iF}&lt;/math&gt;

The Nernst equation for a single heterogeneous electron transfer reaction reads

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi = \Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_\text{ET} + \frac{RT}{F}ln\left(\frac{a^\text{w}_{\text{R}_1}a^\text{o}_{\text{O}_2}}{a^\text{w}_{\text{O}_1}a^\text{o}_{\text{R}_2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_o\phi^\ominus_\text{ET}&lt;/math&gt; is the standard redox potential for the interfacial transfer of electrons defined as the difference the standard redox potentials of the two redox couples but referred to the aqueous standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_\text{ET} = \left[E^\ominus_{\text{O}_2/\text{R}_2}\right]^\text{o}_\text{SHE} - \left[E^\ominus_{\text{O}_1/\text{R}_1}\right]^\text{w}_\text{SHE}&lt;/math&gt;

==Four-Electrode cell==
To study charge transfer reactions of an ITIES, a four-electrode cell is used.

[[Image:4-electrodes cell.png|center]]

Two reference electrodes are used to control the polarisation of the interface, and two counter electrodes made of noble metals are used to pass the current. The aqueous supporting electrolyte must be hydrophilic, such as LiCl, and the organic electrolyte must be lipophilic, such as tetraheptylammonium tetra-pentafluorophenyl borate.

==Ion partition coefficient and ion distribution coefficient==
Contrary to a neutral solute, the partition coefficient of an ion depends of the Galvani potential difference between the two phases:
:&lt;math&gt;P_i = \frac{a^\text{o}_i}{a^\text{w}_i} = \exp \left[\frac{z_iF}{RT}(\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi - \Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_i)\right] = P^\ominus_i \exp \left[\frac{z_iF}{RT}\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi\right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Distribution potential==
When a salt is distributed between two phases, the Galvani potential difference is called the distribution potential and is obtained from the respective Nernst equations for the cation C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the anion A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; to read

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi = \frac{\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_\text{C+}+\Delta^\text{w}_\text{o}\phi^\ominus_\text{A-}}{2} + \frac{RT}{2F}\ln{\left(\frac{\gamma^\text{o}_\text{C+}\gamma^\text{w}_\text{A-}}{\gamma^\text{w}_\text{C+}\gamma^\text{o}_\text{A-}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where γ represents the [[activity coefficient]].

'''Judith Arundell Wright''' (31 May 1915{{spaced ndash}}25 June 2000) was an [[Australia]]n [[poet]], [[environmentalist]] and campaigner for [[Aboriginal land rights]].&lt;ref name="litweb.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litweb.net/biogs/wright_judith.html |title=Judith Wright 1915-200 |author=Petri Liukkonen |publisher=litweb.net |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220044029/http://litweb.net/biogs/wright_judith.html |archivedate=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Judith Wright was born in [[Armidale, New South Wales]]. The eldest child of [[Phillip Wright]] and his first wife, Ethel, she spent most of her formative years in [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="Cornwell2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/aug2000/wrig-a31.shtml|title=Australian poet Judith Wright (1915-2000): An appreciation|last=Cornwell|first=Tony|authorlink=|date=31 August 2000|publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|accessdate=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright was of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yTKFBXfCI1QC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bob+hawke+cornwall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8rHMjdXsOw&amp;sig=3s7qbDBVgoqheXGKPqSgn9HGLlg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h47YTKXiJd3NjAeYnP3JCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=bob%20hawke%20cornwall&amp;f=false|title=The Australian people: an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their origins|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80789-0|author=James Jupp}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the early death of her mother, she lived with her aunt and then boarded at [[New England Girls' School]] after her father's remarriage in 1929. After graduating, Wright studied Philosophy, English, Psychology and History at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref name="Cornwell2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heywood2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0114b.htm|title=Wright, Judith Arundell (1915 - 2000)|last=Heywood|first=Anne|authorlink=|date=11 September 2001|publisher=[[Australian Women's Archives Project]]|accessdate=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of [[World War II]], she returned to her father's station to help during the shortage of labour caused by the war.

Wright's first book of poetry, ''The Moving Image'', was published in 1946 while she was working at the [[University of Queensland]] as a research officer. Then, she had also worked with [[Clem Christesen]] on the literary magazine ''[[Meanjin]],'' the first edition of which was published in late 1947.&lt;ref name="heywood2" /&gt; In 1950 she moved to [[Mount Tamborine, Queensland]], with the novelist and abstract philosopher Jack McKinney. Their daughter Meredith was born in the same year. They married in 1962, but Jack was to live only until 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150293b.htm|title=McKinney, Jack Philip (1891 - 1966)|last=Wright|first=Judith|year=2000|publisher=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, she published ''The Nature of Love'', her first collection of short stories, through Sun Press, Melbourne. Set mainly in Queensland, they include 'The Ant-lion' ,'The Vineyard Woman', 'Eighty Acres', 'The Dugong', 'The Weeping Fig' and 'The Nature of Love', all first published in The Bulletin. Wright was nominated for the 1967 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forteckning over forslag till 1967 ars Nobelpris i litteratur|url=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/sites/default/files/forslagslista_1967.pdf|website=Swedish Academy (Svenska akademien)|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[David Fleay]], [[Kathleen McArthur]] and [[Brian Clouston]], Wright was a founding member and, from 1964 to 1976, President, of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]]. She was the second Australian to receive the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]], in 1991.&lt;ref name="heywood2" /&gt;

For the last three decades of her life, she lived near the New South Wales town of [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twofiresfestival.com/twofires/judith/ The Two Fires Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224060559/http://www.twofiresfestival.com/twofires/judith/ |date=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, she had moved to the Braidwood area to be closer to [[H. C. Coombs]], her lover of 25 years, who was based in Canberra.&lt;ref name="capp2"&gt;[http://www.themonthly.com.au/node/1675 Fiona Capp, "In the Garden"]&lt;/ref&gt;

She started to lose her hearing in her mid-20s, and she became completely deaf by 1992.&lt;ref name="capp2" /&gt;

Judith Wright died in Canberra on 25 June 2000, aged 85.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms5781 National Library of Australia: Papers of Judith Wright]; Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2000-06-26%2F0042;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2000-06-26%2F0000%22 House of Representatives, Statements by Members, 26 June 2000]; Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2F2000-06-27%2F0203;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2000-06-27%2F0000%22 Senate, Adjournment, 27 June 2000]; Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/gehall/Judith.htm Gerard HALL, Judith Wright (1915-2000): Australian Poet &amp; Prophet, Published in National Outlook (November 2000)]; Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jun/29/guardianobituaries.books The Guardian, Obituary, 29 June 2000]; Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poet and critic==
Judith Wright was the author of several collections of poetry, including ''The Moving Image'', ''Woman to Man'', ''The Gateway'', ''The Two Fires'', ''Birds'', ''The Other Half'', ''Magpies'', ''Shadow'', ''Hunting Snake,'' among others.

Her work is noted for a keen focus on the Australian environment, which began to gain prominence in Australian art in the years following World War II. She deals with the relationship between settlers, Indigenous Australians and the bush, among other themes. Wright's aesthetic centres on the relationship between mankind and the environment, which she views as the catalyst for poetic creation. Her images characteristically draw from the Australian flora and fauna, yet contain a mythic substrata that probes at the poetic process, limitations of language, and the correspondence between inner existence and objective reality.

Her poems have been translated into several languages, including [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historyandphilosophyinqueensland.com/queensland-thinkers/intellectuals-and-thinkers/the-dozen/judith-wright/|title=Judith Wright|last=Buch|first=Neville|date=|website=History and Philosophy in Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Birds''===
In 2003, the National Library of [[Australia]] published an expanded edition of Wright's collection titled ''Birds''.&lt;ref name = "McKinney7"&gt;McKinney (2004) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these poems were written in the 1950s when she was living on [[Tamborine Mountain]] in southeast [[Queensland]]. Meredith McKinney, Wright's daughter, writes that they were written at "a precious and dearly-won time of warmth and bounty to counterbalance at last what felt, in contrast, the chilly dearth and difficulty of her earlier years".&lt;ref name = "McKinney89"&gt;McKinney (2004) p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; McKinney goes on to say that "many of these poems have a newly relaxed, almost conversational tone and rhythm, an often humorous ease and an intimacy of voice that surely reflects the new intimacies and joys of her life".&lt;ref name = "McKinney9"&gt;McKinney (2004) p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the joy reflected in the poems, however, they also acknowledge "the experiences of cruelty, pain and death that are inseparable from the lives of birds as of humans ... and [turn] a sorrowing a clear-sighted gaze on the terrible damage we have done and continue to do to our world, even as we love it".&lt;ref name = "McKinney9"/&gt;

==Environmentalist and social activist==
Wright was well known for her campaigning in support of the conservation of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Fraser Island]]. With some friends, she helped found one of the earliest nature conservation movements.&lt;ref name = "McKinney9"/&gt;

Wright was also an impassioned advocate for the [[Aboriginal land rights]] movement. [[Thomas Shapcott|Tom Shapcott]], reviewing ''With Love and Fury'', her posthumous collection of selected letters published in 2007, comments that her letter on this topic to the Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] was "almost brutal in its scorn".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/book-reviews/with-love-and-fury-selected-letters-of-judith-wright/2007/03/09/1173166968695.html Tom Shapcott, Book Review, "With Love and Fury: selected letters of Juhf 284 hey ahey 398rf  dith Wright", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before her death, she attended a march in [[Canberra]] for reconciliation between non-indigenous Australians and the Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name="litweb.net"/&gt;

In 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Judith Wright was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for her role as an "Influential Artists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND’S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|dead-url=|access-date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
[[File:Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Art.jpg|thumb|The Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Art in Fortitude Valley, Australia]]
In June 2006 the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) announced that the new federal electorate in [[Queensland]], which was to be created at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], would be named Wright in honor of her accomplishments as a "poet and in the areas of arts, conservation and indigenous affairs in Queensland and Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Under the 2009 redistribution of Queensland, a [[Division of Wright|new seat]] in southeast Queensland was created and named in Wright's honour; it was first contested in [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010]].

The [[Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts]] in [[Fortitude Valley]], Brisbane is named after her.

On 2 January 2008, it was announced that a future suburb in the district of [[Molonglo Valley]], [[Canberra]] would be named "Wright". There is a street in the Canberra suburb of [[Franklin, Australian Capital Territory|Franklin]] named after her, as well. Another of the Molonglo Valley suburbs is to be named after Wright's lover, "Nugget" Coombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/suburbs-named-in-new-district/419088.aspx Canberra Times, 3 January 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201034339/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/suburbs-named-in-new-district/419088.aspx |date= 1 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Kunyu Quantu''''' ({{zh|s=坤舆全图|t=坤輿全圖|p=Kūnyú Quántú}}), or '''''Full Map of the World''''', was a map of the world developed by [[Jesuit]] father [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] during [[Jesuit China missions|his mission in China]] in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;[http://u21museums.unimelb.edu.au/museumcollections/glasgow/hunterian/map.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A copy is in the [[Hunterian Museum]].

The map follows the earlier works of [[Matteo Ricci]], such as the ''[[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu]]''.

'''Köprülü Canyon''' ({{lang-tr|Köprülü Kanyon}}) is a [[canyon]] and a [[National Park]] in the [[Provinces of Turkey|Province]] of [[Antalya Province|Antalya]], [[Turkey]]. Covering an area of {{convert|366|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it was established as a national park by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest]] on December 12, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doa.gov.tr/Teknik/Teknik29.pdf |publisher=Çevre ve Orman Bakanlığı-Eastern Mediterranean Forestry Research Institute |title=Prioritising and Determining of Ecotourism Strategy with Participatory Approach: A Case Studies of the Cehennemdere Valley and Köprülü Kanyon National Park |author=Yılmaz, Ersin|year=2009 |isbn=978-605-393-055-6 |accessdate=2011-08-23 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canyon is {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in some places and stretches for {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the [[Köprü River]]. There are fish restaurants at the rest area; fresh [[trout]] is a specialty. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Oluklu Bridge (Olukluköprü) over a tributary gorge and the Bugrum Bridge over the Kocadere stream were engineering feats of their time.

==Getting there==
The park, rich in flora and fauna and noted for its wild beauty, is {{convert|92|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Antalya. Northeast of Antalya on the [[Side, Turkey|Side]] road, take the turnoff for [[Taşağıl, Serik|Taşağıl]] and [[Beşkonak, Antalya|Beşkonak]] to reach Köprülü Canyon National Park. A circular scenic route criss-crosses, passing through extensive forests and over waterfalls.

'''Lillering Forest''' is a forest and protected [[Natura 2000]] area in [[Denmark]]. It is located in [[Jutland|peninsular Denmark]] in [[Aarhus Municipality]], south of [[Harlev]] and some 10 km. west of [[Aarhus]]. It is a [[deciduous]] forest covering some 50 hectares and it is composed mainly of [[beech]] and [[European ash]]. It is privately owned but protected and partially managed by [[Aarhus Municipality]] and the [[Danish Nature Agency]]. The Natura 2000 site covers 135 hectares and also encompasses Tåstrup Bog, Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest, south of Lillering Forest. The southern section with Stjær Forest is within, and managed by, [[Skanderborg Municipality]].&lt;ref name="aar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-landskab/Naturhandleplan/Natura-2000-handleplan-Lillering-skov.pdf |title=Natura 2000-handleplan |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mmhiN77V?url=https://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-landskab/Naturhandleplan/Natura-2000-handleplan-Lillering-skov.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2016 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
Lillering Forest and surroundings has been known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 [[vascular plant]]s have been registered, about a third of Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around [[Aarhus]] and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be [[hornbeam]] which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as [[dead-nettle]]s, [[white butterbur]], [[bitter-cress]], [[wall barley]], yellow and blue [[anemone]] and the endangered multicolored [[Viola (plant)|viola]]. In addition a total of nine species of [[orchid]]s have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the [[broad-leaved helleborine]], [[green-flowered helleborine]], [[early-purple orchid]], [[western marsh orchid]], [[early marsh-orchid]], [[eggleaf twayblade]] and the [[greater butterfly-orchid]]. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains [[woodland geranium]] and [[mountain melick]].&lt;ref name="nat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docplayer.dk/20490866-Taastrup-soe-og-taastrup-mose-samt-lillering-skov-stjaer-stenskov-og-soeskov.html |title=Tåstrup Sø og Tåstrup Mose samt Lillering Skov, Stjær Stenskov og Søskov |publisher=[[Danish Nature Agency]] |language=Danish |accessdate=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mmhikolA?url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/nst/90551/N232_Basisanalyse16-21.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2016 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The area contains several rare species of [[geometer moth]]s associated with [[buckthorn]]s that grow at the [[woodland edge]] or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of [[mouse-ear chickweed]]. The meadows in the forest has a number of [[moth]]s such as the [[six-spot burnet]] which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in [[Jutland]] are found only here and 4 are associated with [[Prunus padus|hackberry]] at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon [[mayfly]] siphlonurus aestivalis.
 
== Natura 2000 == 
The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.&lt;ref name="nat1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/nst/90551/N232_Basisanalyse16-21.pdf |title=Natura 2000 basisanalyse 2016-2021 |publisher=[[Danish Nature Agency]] |language=Danish |accessdate=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mmhikolA?url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/nst/90551/N232_Basisanalyse16-21.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2016 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contracting states to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) are the states that have signed and ratified the international agreement banning all nuclear explosions in all environments. Technically they will not be "parties" until the treaty [[Coming into force|enters into force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of key terms used in the UN Treaty Collection|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/page1_en.xml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=14 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101093718/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview%2Fdefinition%2Fpage1_en.xml|archivedate=1 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which point these states will also be Member States of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), which comes into existence upon entry into force of the treaty. Non-contracting states are also listed, including those that are signatories and those are not. States Signatories are Members of the [[CTBTO Preparatory Commission]].

On September 24, 1996, the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) was opened for signature. All five nuclear weapons states recognized under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] ([[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) signed the treaty, with 66 other states following that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When did the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty open for signature?|url=http://www.ctbto.org/faqs/?uid=31&amp;cHash=0a5de2c045|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fiji]] became the first state to [[Treaty ratification#Ratification of an international treaty|ratify]] the treaty on October 10, 1996. As of September 2018, 184 states have signed and 167 states have ratified the treaty. Most recently, [[Tuvalu]] signed and [[Thailand]] ratified the treaty in September 2018.&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbto.org/the-treaty/status-of-signature-and-ratification/ |title=Status of signature and ratification: CTBTO Preparatory Commission |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/ctbt|title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|publisher=[[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]]|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=untc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVI-4&amp;chapter=26&amp;clang=_en|title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|date=2013-02-24|accessdate=2013-02-24|publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signatures are received at the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Headquarters|Headquarters]] in New York City by authorized representatives of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does a State sign the Treaty?|url=http://www.ctbto.org/faqs/?uid=40&amp;cHash=23de2c6936|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratification is achieved with the approval of either or both chamber of the legislature and executive of the state. The instrument of ratification serves as the document binding the state to the international treaty and can be accepted only with the validating signature of the [[head of state]] or other official with full powers to sign it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does a State ratify the Treaty?|url=http://www.ctbto.org/faqs/?uid=41&amp;cHash=0ce0d6a95b|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is deposited with the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does a State deposit its instrument of ratification?|url=http://www.ctbto.org/faqs/?uid=37&amp;cHash=c4b5ce30a1|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the CTBT, there are 195 Annex 1 states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treatytext.tt.html|title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=United Nations}} (Article II, Paragraph 28)&lt;/ref&gt; which include a subset of 44 Annex 2 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treatytext.tt.html|title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=United Nations}} (Article XIV)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annex 1 states are agreed upon by conference and currently comprise all 193 [[United Nations member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Holy See]] and [[Niue]]. All Annex 1 states may become members of the Executive Council, the principal decision-making body of the organization responsible for supervising its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treatytext.tt.html|title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|accessdate=2008-08-02|publisher=United Nations}} (Article I, Section C)&lt;/ref&gt; These states are formally bound to the conditions of the treaty; however, their ratification is not necessary for the treaty to come into effect (unless they are also an Annex 2 state).
* Annex 2 states are those that formally participated in the 1996 [[Conference on Disarmament]] and possessed nuclear power or research reactors at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the Annex 2 States?|url=http://www.ctbto.org/faqs/?uid=44&amp;cHash=303fb705c1|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annex 2 lists the following 44 States: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vietnam.
Eight Annex&amp;nbsp;2 states have not ratified the treaty: [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] have already signed the Treaty, whereas [[India]], [[North Korea]] and [[Pakistan]] have not signed it. The treaty will [[coming into force|come into force]] only with the signature and ratification of the above Annex 2 states of the treaty, 180 days after they have all deposited their instruments of ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When will the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty enter into force?|url=http://www.ctbto.org/faqs/?uid=32&amp;cHash=0c38a43d62|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[UN observer]] [[State of Palestine]] has neither signed nor acceded to the convention.

==Ratification progress==
;India
In 1998, India said it would only sign the treaty if the United States presented a schedule for eliminating its nuclear stockpile, a condition the United States rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Enver|first=Masud|title=Rebuffed by U.S., India, Pakistan Storm Nuclear Club|url=http://www.twf.org/News/Y1998/19980601.html|publisher=The Wisdom Fund|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Israel
In 2016, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that its ratification was dependent upon "the regional context and the appropriate timing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-itll-ratify-nuke-test-ban-at-the-right-time/|title=Israel confirms it’ll ratify nuke test ban ‘at the right time’|date=2016-06-20|accessdate=2016-06-20|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
The United States has signed the CTBT, but not ratified it; there is ongoing debate whether to ratify the CTBT.

The United States has stated that its ratification of the CTBT is conditional upon:

{{quote|
:A: The conduct of a [[Stockpile stewardship|Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program]] to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile, including the conduct of a broad range of effective and continuing experimental programs.

:B: The maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory facilities and programs in theoretical and exploratory nuclear technology which will attract, retain, and ensure the continued application of our human scientific resources to those programs on which continued progress in nuclear technology depends.

:C: The maintenance of the basic capability to resume nuclear test activities prohibited by the CTBT should the United States cease to be bound to adhere to this treaty.

:D: Continuation of a comprehensive research and development program to improve our treaty monitoring capabilities and operations.

:E: The continuing development of a broad range of intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities and operations to ensure accurate and comprehensive information on worldwide nuclear arsenals, nuclear weapons development programs, and related nuclear programs.

:F: The understanding that if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) – advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command – that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical to the U.S. nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard "supreme national interests" clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/nucweps%20test%20ban.htm#stockpile|work=Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress (US)|author=Jonathan Medalia|date=2 June 2005|accessdate=4 December 2011|title=Nuclear Weapons: Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123172029/http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/nucweps%20test%20ban.htm#stockpile|archivedate=23 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Proponents of ratification claim that it would:

# Establish an international norm that would push other nuclear-capable countries like North Korea, Pakistan, and India to sign.
# Constrain worldwide nuclear proliferation by vastly limiting a country's ability to make nuclear advancements that only testing can ensure.
# Not compromise US national security because the [[Stockpile stewardship|Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program]] serves as a means for maintaining current US nuclear capabilities without physical detonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12849 |work=National Research Council of the National Academies |date= 30 March 2012|accessdate=21 May 2012|title=Press Release: U.S. Stockpile Security and International Monitoring Capabilities Strengthened, Says New Report on Technical Issues Behind the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of ratification claim that:
# The treaty is unverifiable and that other nations could easily cheat.
# The ability to enforce the treaty was dubious.
# The U.S. nuclear stockpile would not be as safe or reliable in the absence of testing.
# The benefit to nuclear nonproliferation was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://adamvn1.wordpress.com/tag/ctbt/ Kathleen Bailey and Robert Barker, “Why the United States Should Unsign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and Resume Nuclear Testing,” Comparative Strategy 22 (2003): 131&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 1999, the [[United States Senate]] rejected ratification of the CTBT. During his 2008 presidential election campaign [[Barack Obama]] said that "As president, I will reach out to the Senate to secure the ratification of the CTBT at the earliest practical date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-testing-is-an-acceptable-risk|title=Nuclear Testing Is an Acceptable Risk for Arms Control |work=[[Scientific American]]|date=March 2009|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech in Prague on 5 April 2009, he announced that “[To] achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered|work= The White House|date= 5 April 2005|accessdate= 21 May 2012|title= Remarks by President Barack Obama, Hradcany Square, Prague, Czech Republic|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120521034941/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered|archivedate= 21 May 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists describes how a North Korean underground nuclear test on 25 May 2009 was detected and the source located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/new-way-detect-secret-nuclear-tests-gps|author=Park, J., Grejner-Brzezinska, D., von Frese, R.|title=A new way to detect secret nuclear tests: GPS|work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Marine energy''' or '''marine power''' (also sometimes referred to as '''ocean energy''', '''ocean power''', or '''marine and hydrokinetic energy''') refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[ocean thermal energy|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world’s oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. Some of this energy can be harnessed to [[electricity generation|generate]] electricity to power homes, transport and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]] i.e. power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]] i.e. obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the [[wind]], even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water.

The [[ocean]]s have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new [[renewable energy]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, ''Future Marine Energy. Results of the Marine Energy Challenge: Cost competitiveness and growth of wave and tidal stream energy'', January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global potential ==

There is the potential to develop 20,000–80,000 [[terawatt-hour]]s per year (TWh/y) of electricity generated by changes in ocean temperatures, salt content, movements of tides, currents, waves and swells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iea.org/techinitiatives/renewableenergy/ocean/ |title=Ocean—potential |work=International Energy Agency (IEA) |access-date=2016-08-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054948/http://www.iea.org/techinitiatives/renewableenergy/ocean/ |archivedate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of ocean energy ==
=== Renewable ===
The oceans represent a vast and largely untapped source of energy in the form of surface waves, fluid flow, [[salinity gradient]]s, and thermal.

Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) or marine energy development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using the following devices:

* [[Wave power]] converters in open coastal areas with significant waves;
* [[Tidal stream generator|Tidal turbines]] placed in coastal and estuarine areas;
* [[In-stream turbines]] in fast-moving rivers;
* [[Marine current power|Ocean current turbines]] in areas of strong marine currents;
* [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|Ocean thermal energy converters]] in deep tropical waters.

==== Marine current power ====
{{main|Marine current power}}

Strong ocean currents are generated from a combination of temperature, wind, salinity, [[bathymetry]], and the rotation of the Earth. The Sun acts as the primary driving force, causing winds and temperature differences. Because there are only small fluctuations in current speed and stream location with no changes in direction, ocean currents may be suitable locations for deploying energy extraction devices such as turbines.

Ocean currents are instrumental in determining the [[climate]] in many regions around the world. While little is known about the effects of removing ocean current energy, the impacts of removing current energy on the [[farfield environment]] may be a significant environmental concern. The typical turbine issues with blade strike, entanglement of marine organisms, and acoustic effects still exists; however, these may be magnified due to the presence of more diverse populations of marine organisms using ocean currents for migration purposes. Locations can be further offshore and therefore require longer power cables that could affect the marine environment with electromagnetic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/ocean-current}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Osmotic power ====
{{main|Osmotic power}}

At the mouth of rivers where fresh water mixes with salt water, energy associated with the salinity gradient can be harnessed using pressure-retarded reverse osmosis process and associated conversion technologies. Another system is based on using freshwater upwelling through a turbine immersed in seawater, and one involving electrochemical reactions is also in development.

Significant research took place from 1975 to 1985 and gave various results regarding the economy of PRO and RED plants. It is important to note that small-scale investigations into salinity power production take place in other countries like Japan, Israel, and the United States. In Europe the research is concentrated in Norway and the Netherlands, in both places small pilots are tested. Salinity gradient energy is the energy available from the difference in salt concentration between freshwater with saltwater. This energy source is not easy to understand, as it is not directly occurring in nature in the form of heat, waterfalls, wind, waves, or radiation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanenergy-europe.eu/index.php/policies/technologies/13-technology/46-salinity-gradient&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ocean thermal energy ====
{{main|Ocean thermal energy}}

Water typically varies in temperature from the surface warmed by direct sunlight to greater depths where sunlight cannot penetrate. This differential is greatest in [[tropics|tropical]] waters, making this technology most applicable in water locations. A fluid is often vaporized to drive a turbine that may generate electricity or produce [[desalinization|desalinized]] water. Systems may be either open-cycle, closed-cycle, or hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/OTEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tidal power ====
{{main|Tidal power}}

The energy from moving masses of water — a popular form of [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|hydroelectric]] power generation. Tidal power generation comprises three main forms, namely: [[tidal stream power]], [[tidal barrage power]], and [[dynamic tidal power]].

==== Wave power ====
{{main|Wave power}}

Solar energy from the Sun creates temperature differentials that result in wind. The interaction between wind and the surface of water creates waves, which are larger when there is a greater distance for them to build up. Wave energy potential is greatest between 30° and 60° latitude in both hemispheres on the west coast because of the global direction of wind. When evaluating wave energy as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: [[point absorber buoy]]s, [[surface attenuator]]s, [[oscillating water column]]s, and [[overtopping devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave energy sector is reaching a significant milestone in the development of the industry, with positive steps towards commercial viability being taken. The more advanced device developers are now progressing beyond single unit demonstration devices and are proceeding to array development and multi-megawatt projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanenergy-europe.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; The backing of major utility companies is now manifesting itself through partnerships within the development process, unlocking further investment and, in some cases, international co-operation.

At a simplified level, wave energy technology can be located near-shore and offshore. Wave energy converters can also be designed for operation in specific water depth conditions: deep water, intermediate water or shallow water. The fundamental device design will be dependent on the location of the device and the intended resource characteristics.

=== Non-renewable ===

[[Petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] beneath the ocean floor are also sometimes considered a form of ocean energy. An [[Marine electronics|ocean engineer]] directs all phases of [[Hydrocarbon exploration|discovering]], [[Extraction of petroleum|extracting]], and delivering offshore petroleum (via [[oil tanker]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]],) a complex and demanding task. Also centrally important is the development of new methods to protect marine wildlife and coastal regions against the [[Petroleum#Environmental effects|undesirable side effects]] of offshore oil extraction.

== Marine energy development==

The UK is leading the way in wave and tidal (marine) power generation. The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of the marine energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. The Centre was established with around £36 million of funding from the Scottish Government, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Carbon Trust, UK Government, Scottish Enterprise, the European Union and Orkney Islands Council, and is the only accredited wave and tidal test centre for marine renewable energy in the world, suitable for testing a number of full-scale devices simultaneously in some of the harshest weather conditions while producing electricity to the national grid.

Clients that have tested at the centre include Aquamarine Power, AW Energy, Pelamis Wave Power, Seatricity, ScottishPower Renewables and Wello on the wave site, and Alstom (formerly Tidal Generation Ltd), ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Magallanes, Nautricity, Open Hydro, Scotrenewables Tidal Power, and Voith on the tidal site. 

Leading the €11m FORESEA (Funding Ocean Renewable Energy through Strategic European Action) project, which  provides funding support to ocean energy technology developers to access Europe's world-leading ocean energy test facilities, EMEC will welcome a number of wave and tidal clients to their pipeline for testing on site. 

Beyond device testing, EMEC also provides a wide range of consultancy and research services, and is working closely with Marine Scotland to streamline the consenting process for marine energy developers. EMEC is at the forefront in the development of international standards for marine energy, and is forging alliances with other countries, exporting its knowledge around the world to stimulate the development of a global marine renewables industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental effects==

Common environmental concerns associated with marine energy developments include:

* the risk of [[marine mammals]] and [[fish]] being struck by tidal turbine blades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/stressor/dynamic-device|title=Dynamic Device - Tethys|author=|date=|website=tethys.pnnl.gov|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the effects of [[electromagnetic field|EMF]] and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/stressor/emf|title=EMF - Tethys|author=|date=|website=tethys.pnnl.gov|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the physical presence of marine energy projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and [[seabirds]] with attraction or avoidance
* the potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as [[sediment transport]] and [[water quality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of marine energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tethys |url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics |fundamental concepts |width=20.55em}}
In [[Newtonian mechanics]], '''linear momentum''', '''translational momentum''', or simply '''momentum''' ([[plural|pl.]] momenta) is the product of the [[mass]] and [[velocity]] of an object. It is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. If {{math|''m''}} is an object's mass and {{math|'''v'''}} is the velocity (also a vector), then the momentum is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt;
In [[International System of Units|SI units]], it is measured in [[kilogram metre per second|kilogram meters per second]] ([[kilogram|kg]]⋅[[meters per second|m/s]]). [[Newton's second law]] of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it.

Momentum depends on the [[frame of reference]], but in any inertial frame it is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in [[special relativity]] (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form,  in [[electrodynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and [[general relativity]]. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: [[translational symmetry]].

Advanced formulations of classical mechanics, [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is  ''generalized momentum'', and in general this is different from the ''kinetic'' momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a [[wave function]]. The momentum and position operators are related by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluids and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for fluids or the [[Cauchy momentum equation]] for deformable solids or fluids.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Newtonian==
Momentum is a [[vector quantity]]: it has both magnitude and direction. Since momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction and speed of motion of objects after they collide. Below, the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations (see [[Momentum#Multiple dimensions|multiple dimensions]]).

===Single particle===
The momentum of a particle is conventionally represented by the letter {{math|''p''}}. It is the product of two quantities, the particle's [[mass]] (represented by the letter {{math|''m''}}) and its [[velocity]] ({{math|''v''}}):&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh9&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p = m v. &lt;/math&gt;

The unit of momentum is the product of the units of mass and velocity. In [[SI units]], if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters per second (kg⋅m/s). In [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs units]], if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters per second (g⋅cm/s).

Being a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1&amp;nbsp;kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s due north measured with reference to the ground.

===Many particles===
The momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and velocities {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the total momentum is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} p &amp;= p_1 + p_2 \\
&amp;= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\,. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
The momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:
:&lt;math&gt; p = \sum_{i} m_i v_i .&lt;/math&gt;

A system of particles has a [[center of mass]], a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:
:&lt;math&gt; r_\text{cm} = \frac{m_1 r_1 + m_2 r_2 + \cdots}{m_1 + m_2 + \cdots} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i}m_ir_i}{\sum\limits_{i}m_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

If all the particles are moving, the center of mass will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it). If the center of mass is moving at velocity {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the momentum is:
:&lt;math&gt;p= mv_\text{cm}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is known as [[Euler's laws of motion|Euler's first law]].&lt;ref name="BookRags"&gt;{{cite web

===Relation to force===

If the net force applied to a particle is a constant {{math|''F''}}, and is applied for a time interval {{math|Δ''t''}}, the momentum of the particle changes by an amount
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = F \Delta t\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In differential form, this is [[Newton's second law]]; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to the instantaneous force {{math|''F''}} acting on it,&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh9/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{dp }{d t}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the net force experienced by a particle changes as a function of time, {{math|''F(t)''}}, the change in momentum (or [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] {{math|''J'' }}) between times {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}  is
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p = J = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t)\, dt\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Impulse is measured in the [[SI derived unit|derived units]] of the [[newton second]] (1&amp;nbsp;N⋅s = 1&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s) or [[dyne]] second (1 dyne⋅s = 1 g⋅m/s)

Under the assumption of constant mass {{math|''m''}}, it is equivalent to write
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{d(mv)}{d t} = m\frac{dv}{d t} = m a,&lt;/math&gt;
hence the net force is equal to the mass of the particle times its [[acceleration]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh9/&gt;

''Example'': A model airplane of mass 1&amp;nbsp;kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6&amp;nbsp;m/s due north in 2&amp;nbsp;s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is 3&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|newtons]] due north. The change in momentum is 6&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s. The rate of change of momentum is 3&amp;nbsp;(kg⋅m/s)/s = 3&amp;nbsp;N.

===Conservation===
In a [[closed system]] (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum is constant. This fact, known as the ''law of conservation of momentum'', is implied by [[Newton's laws of motion]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh10&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invitation to Contemporary Physics |edition=illustrated |first1=Quang |last1=Ho-Kim |first2=Narendra |last2=Kumar |first3=Harry C. S. |last3= Lam |publisher=World Scientific |year=2004 |isbn=978-981-238-303-7 |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. Because of the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}}}} and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}}}}. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d p_1}{d t} = - \frac{d p_2}{d t}, &lt;/math&gt;
with the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d t} \left(p_1+ p_2\right)= 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If the velocities of the particles are {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} before the interaction, and afterwards they are {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;m_1 u_{1} + m_2 u_{2} = m_1 v_{1} + m_2 v_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including [[collision]]s and separations caused by explosive forces.&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh10/&gt; It can also be generalized to situations where Newton's laws do not hold, for example in the [[theory of relativity]] and in [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]].&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;

===Dependence on reference frame===
[[File:Relativity an apple in a lift.svg|thumb|Newton's apple in Einstein's elevator. In person A's frame of reference, the apple has non-zero velocity and momentum. In the elevator's and person B's frames of reference, it has zero velocity and momentum.]]
Momentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a [[frame of reference]], in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.

Suppose a particle has position {{math|''x''}} in a stationary frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed {{math|''u''}}, the position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as
:&lt;math&gt; x' = x - ut\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is called a [[Galilean transformation]]. If the particle is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''dx''|''dt''}} {{=}} ''v''}} in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed
:&lt;math&gt; v' = \frac{dx'}{dt} = v-u\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|''u''}} does not change, the accelerations are the same:
:&lt;math&gt; a' = \frac{dv'}{dt} = a\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or [[Galilean invariance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen, where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is the [[center of mass frame]] – one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame,
the total momentum is zero.

===Application to collisions===
By itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, [[kinetic energy]], must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an ''[[elastic collision]]''; if not, it is an ''[[inelastic collision]]''.

====Elastic collisions====
{{Main|Elastic collision}}
[[File:Elastischer stoß.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of equal masses]]
[[File:Elastischer stoß3.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of unequal masses]]
An elastic collision is one in which no [[kinetic energy]] is absorbed in the collision. Perfectly elastic "collisions" can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A [[gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two [[Pool billiards|pool]] balls is a good example of an ''almost'' totally elastic collision, due to their high [[stiffness|rigidity]], but when bodies come in contact there is always some [[dissipation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |title=Elastic and inelastic collisions |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818114930/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |archivedate=18 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} before the collision and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 &amp;= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\
\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass {{math|''m''}}, one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed {{math|''v''}} (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}} and both bodies are moving towards it at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}}. Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed {{math|''v''}}. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh10/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}  v_1 &amp;= u_2\\
v_2 &amp;= u_1\,. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A.|author2=John W. Jewett, Jr|title=Principles of physics : a calculus-based text|date=2012|publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781133104261|page=245|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_{1} = \left( \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{1} + \left( \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_{2} = \left( \frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{2} + \left( \frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If one body has much greater mass than the other, its velocity will be little affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change.

====Inelastic collisions====
{{Main|Inelastic collision}}

[[File:Inelastischer stoß.gif|thumb|right|a perfectly inelastic collision between equal masses]]
In an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is converted into other forms of energy (such as [[heat]] or [[sound]]). Examples include [[traffic collisions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/carcr.html#cc1 |title=Forces in car crashes |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822034313/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/carcr.html#cc1 |archivedate=22 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the effect of lost kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms (as in the [[Franck–Hertz experiment]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/FrHz.html |title=The Franck-Hertz Experiment |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180316/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/FrHz.html |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[particle accelerator]]s in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.

In a perfectly inelastic collision (such as a bug hitting a windshield), both bodies have the same motion afterwards. If one body is motionless to begin with, the equation for conservation of momentum is
:&lt;math&gt;m_1 u_1 = \left( m_1 + m_2 \right) v\,,&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2} u_1\,.&lt;/math&gt;
In a frame of reference moving at the speed {{math|''v'')}}, the objects are brought to rest by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted to other forms of energy.

One measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the [[coefficient of restitution]] {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}}, defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to relative velocity of approach. In applying this measure to a ball bouncing from a solid surface, this can be easily measured using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Peter M.|title=Biomechanics of sport and exercise|date=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL [u.a.]|isbn=9780736051019|page=85|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819020542/https://books.google.com/books?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{R} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{bounce height}}{\text{drop height}}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an [[explosion]] is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. [[Rocket]]s also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward, gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7 |chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple dimensions===
[[File:Elastischer stoß 2D.gif|thumb|right|Two-dimensional elastic collision. There is no motion perpendicular to the image, so only two components are needed to represent the velocities and momenta. The two blue vectors represent velocities after the collision and add vectorially to get the initial (red) velocity.]]
Real motion has both direction and velocity and must be represented by a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]. In a coordinate system with {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} axes, velocity has components {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the {{math|''x''}}-direction, {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the {{math|''y''}}-direction, {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the {{math|''z''}}-direction. The vector is represented by a boldface symbol:&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh11&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \left(v_x,v_y,v_z \right). &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the momentum is a vector quantity and is represented by a boldface symbol:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \left(p_x,p_y,p_z \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The equations in the previous sections, work in vector form if the scalars {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''v''}} are replaced by vectors {{math|'''p'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}= m \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
represents three equations:&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh11/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} p_x &amp;= m v_x\\ p_y &amp;= m v_y \\ p_z &amp;= m v_z. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic energy equations are exceptions to the above replacement rule. The equations are still one-dimensional, but each scalar represents the [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude of the vector]], for example,
:&lt;math&gt; v^2 = v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. Often coordinates can be chosen so that only two components are needed, as in the figure. Each component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a vector result.&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh11/&gt;

A simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere, the two will head off at right angles after the collision (as in the figure).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects of variable mass ===

The concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of [[variable-mass system|variable-mass objects]] such as a [[rocket]] ejecting fuel or a [[star]] [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] gas. In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that varies with time: {{math|''m''(''t'')}}. The momentum of the object at time {{math|''t''}} is therefore {{math|''p''(''t'') {{=}} ''m''(''t'')''v''(''t'')}}. One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by saying that the external force {{math|''F''}} on the object is related to its momentum {{math|''p''(''t'')}} by {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''(''mv'')|''dt''}}}}:&lt;ref name="kleppner135"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|last2=Kolenkow|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|pages=135–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F = m(t) \frac{dv}{dt} + v(t) \frac{dm}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt; (incorrect)
This equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects. The correct equation is
:&lt;math&gt; F = m(t) \frac{dv}{dt} - u \frac{dm}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''u''}} is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass ''as seen in the object's rest frame''.&lt;ref name="kleppner135" /&gt; This is distinct from {{math|''v''}}, which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame.

This equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass (''dm''). When considered together, the object and the mass (''dm'') constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved.

:&lt;math&gt; P(t+dt) = ( m - dm ) ( v + dv ) + dm ( v - u ) = mv+m dv - u dm = P(t) +m dv - u dm &lt;/math&gt;

==Relativistic==
{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}

===Lorentz invariance===
Newtonian physics assumes that [[absolute time and space]] exist outside of any observer; this gives rise to [[Galilean invariance]]. It also results in a prediction that the [[speed of light]] can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to observation. In the [[special theory of relativity]], Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the [[Lorentz transformation]] instead of the [[Galilean transformation]].&lt;ref name=RindlerCh2&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider, for example, a reference frame moving relative to another at velocity {{math|''v''}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction. The Galilean transformation gives the coordinates of the moving frame as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  t' &amp;= t  \\
  x' &amp;= x - v t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
while the Lorentz transformation gives&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh15&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 15-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  t' &amp;= \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right)  \\
  x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - v t \right)\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''γ''}} is the [[Lorentz factor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Newton's second law, with mass fixed, is not invariant under a Lorentz transformation. However, it can be made invariant by making the ''inertial mass'' {{math|''m''}} of an object a function of velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;m = \gamma m_0\,;&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the object's [[invariant mass]].&lt;ref name=Rindler&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=77–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modified momentum,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \gamma m_0 \mathbf{v}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
obeys Newton's second law:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Within the domain of classical mechanics, relativistic momentum closely approximates Newtonian momentum: at low velocity, {{math|''γm''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''v'''}} is approximately equal to {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''v'''}}, the Newtonian expression for momentum.

===Four-vector formulation===
{{Main|Four-momentum}}
In the theory of special relativity, physical quantities are expressed in terms of [[four-vector]]s that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three space coordinates. These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example {{math|'''R'''}} for position. The expression for the ''four-momentum'' depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of [[proper time]], {{math|''τ''}}, defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c^2d\tau^2 = c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;
is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the {{nowrap|(+ − − −)}} [[metric signature]] has been used, different authors use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as [[Euclidean vector]]s and multiplying time by [[Imaginary unit|{{math|{{sqrt|−1}}}}]]; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a [[Minkowski space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Misner|first=Charles W.|author2=Kip S. Thorne |author3=John Archibald Wheeler  |title=Gravitation|date=1973|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716703440|page=51|others=24th printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Minkowski space, the [[scalar product]] of two four-vectors {{math|'''U''' {{=}} (''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|'''V''' {{=}} (''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{U} \cdot \mathbf{V} =  U_0 V_0 - U_1 V_1 - U_2 V_2 - U_3 V_3\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In all the coordinate systems, the ([[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) relativistic four-velocity is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{U} \equiv \frac{d \mathbf{R}}{d \tau} = \gamma \frac{d \mathbf{R}}{dt}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the (contravariant) [[four-momentum]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m_0\mathbf{U}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the invariant mass. If {{math|'''R''' {{=}} (''ct,x,y,z'')}} (in Minkowski space), then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \gamma m_0 \left(c,\mathbf{v}\right) = (m c,\mathbf{p})\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Using Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]], {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, this can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \mathbf{p}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, conservation of four-momentum is Lorentz-invariant and implies conservation of both mass and energy.

The magnitude of the momentum four-vector is equal to {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;||\mathbf{P}||^2 = \mathbf{P}\cdot\mathbf{P} = \gamma^2m_0^2(c^2-v^2) = (m_0c)^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and is invariant across all reference frames.

The relativistic energy–momentum relationship holds even for massless particles such as photons; by setting {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;E = pc\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In a game of relativistic "billiards", if a stationary particle is hit by a moving particle in an elastic collision, the paths formed by the two afterwards will form an acute angle. This is unlike the non-relativistic case where they travel at right angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalized==
{{See also|Analytical mechanics}}
Newton's laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by ''constraints''. For example, a bead on an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal [[Cartesian coordinates]] to a set of ''[[generalized coordinates]]'' that may be fewer in number.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They introduce a ''generalized momentum'', also known as the ''canonical'' or ''conjugate momentum'', that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and [[angular momentum]]. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as ''mechanical'', ''kinetic'' or ''kinematic momentum''.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1975|p=574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FeynmanQM&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 3|loc=Chapter 21-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main methods are described below.

===Lagrangian mechanics===
In [[Lagrangian mechanics]], a Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} and the [[potential energy]] {{math|''V''}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}  = T-V\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If the generalized coordinates are represented as a vector {{math|'''q''' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) }} and time differentiation is represented by a dot over the variable, then the equations of motion (known as the Lagrange or [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s) are a set of {{math|''N''}} equations:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial\dot{q}_j}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_j} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If a coordinate {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not a Cartesian coordinate, the associated generalized momentum component {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear momentum. Even if {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a Cartesian coordinate, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} will not be the same as the mechanical momentum if the potential depends on velocity.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;  Some sources represent the kinematic momentum by the symbol {{math|'''Π'''}}.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lerner|editor-first=Rita G.|title=Encyclopedia of physics|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH-Verl.|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3527405541|edition=3rd  |editor2-last=Trigg |editor2-first=George L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this mathematical framework, a generalized momentum is associated with the generalized coordinates. Its components are defined as
:&lt;math&gt; p_j = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{q}_j}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Each component {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is said to be the ''conjugate momentum'' for the coordinate {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Now if a given coordinate {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not appear in the Lagrangian (although its time derivative might appear), then
:&lt;math&gt; p_j = \text{constant}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the generalization of the conservation of momentum.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;

Even if the generalized coordinates are just the ordinary spatial coordinates, the conjugate momenta are not necessarily the ordinary momentum coordinates. An example is found in the section on electromagnetism.

===Hamiltonian mechanics===
In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the Lagrangian (a function of generalized coordinates and their derivatives) is replaced by a Hamiltonian that is a function of generalized coordinates and momentum. The Hamiltonian is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H}\left(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p},t\right) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{q}} - \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the momentum is obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian as above. The Hamiltonian equations of motion are&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dot{q}_i &amp;= \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial p_i}\\
-\dot{p}_i &amp;= \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial q_i}\\
-\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial t} &amp;= \frac{d \mathcal{H}}{d t}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
As in Lagrangian mechanics, if a generalized coordinate does not appear in the Hamiltonian, its conjugate momentum component is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry and conservation===
Conservation of momentum is a mathematical consequence of the [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] (shift [[symmetry]]) of space (position in space is the [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to momentum). That is, conservation of momentum is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not depend on position; this is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hand|first1=Louis N. |last2=Finch |first2=Janet D. |title=Analytical mechanics|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=9780521575720|edition=7th print |pages=Chapter 4 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetic==
===Particle in a field===

In Maxwell's equations, the forces between particles are mediated by electric and magnetic fields. The electromagnetic force (''[[Lorentz force]]'') on a particle with charge {{math|''q''}} due to a combination of [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} and [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}).&lt;/math&gt;
(in [[International System of Units|SI units]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}
It has an [[electric potential]] {{math|''φ''('''r''', ''t'')}} and [[Magnetic potential|magnetic vector potential]] {{math|'''A'''('''r''', ''t'')}}.&lt;ref name=Lerner /&gt;
In the non-relativistic regime, its generalized momentum is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m\mathbf{\mathbf{v}} + q\mathbf{A}, &lt;/math&gt;
while in relativistic mechanics this becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \gamma m\mathbf{\mathbf{v}} + q\mathbf{A}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Conservation===
In Newtonian mechanics, the law of conservation of momentum can be derived from the [[law of action and reaction]], which states that every force has a reciprocating equal and opposite force. Under some circumstances, moving charged particles can exert forces on each other in non-opposite directions.&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=David J.|title=Introduction to electrodynamics|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-0321856562|edition=Fourth|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the combined momentum of the particles and the electromagnetic field is conserved.

====Vacuum====
The Lorentz force imparts a momentum to the particle, so by Newton's second law the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name="Jackson238" /&gt;

In a vacuum, the momentum per unit volume is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g} = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c^2}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum permeability]] and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. The momentum density is proportional to the [[Poynting vector]] {{math|'''S'''}} which gives the directional rate of energy transfer per unit area:&lt;ref name="Jackson238" /&gt;&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh27&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 27-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{c^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If momentum is to be conserved over the volume {{math|''V''}} over a region {{math|''Q''}}, changes in the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum. If {{math|'''P'''&lt;sub&gt;mech&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the momentum of all the particles in {{math|''Q''}}, and the particles are treated as a continuum, then Newton's second law gives
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d \mathbf{P}_\text{mech}}{d t} = \iiint\limits_{Q} \left(\rho\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}\right) dV\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The electromagnetic momentum is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}_\text{field} = \frac{1}{\mu_0c^2} \iiint\limits_{Q} \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\,dV\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the equation for conservation of each component {{math|''i''}} of the momentum is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d t}\left(\mathbf{P}_\text{mech}+ \mathbf{P}_\text{field} \right)_i = \iint\limits_{\sigma} \left(\sum\limits_{j} T_{ij} n_j\right)d\Sigma\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The term on the right is an integral over the surface area {{math|''Σ''}} of the surface {{math|''σ''}} representing momentum flow into and out of the volume, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a component of the surface normal of {{math|''S''}}. The quantity {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is called the [[Maxwell stress tensor]], defined as
:&lt;math&gt;T_{i j} \equiv \epsilon_0 \left(E_i E_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} E^2\right) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}  \left(B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} B^2\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson238&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1975|pp=238–241}} Expressions, given in [[Gaussian units]] in the text, were converted to SI units using Table 3 in the Appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media====
The above results are for the ''microscopic'' Maxwell equations, applicable to electromagnetic forces in a vacuum (or on a very small scale in media). It is more difficult to define momentum density in media because the division into electromagnetic and mechanical is arbitrary. The definition of electromagnetic momentum density is modified to
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g} = \frac{1}{c^2}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{c^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the H-field {{math|'''H'''}} is related to the B-field and the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left(\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The electromagnetic stress tensor depends on the properties of the media.&lt;ref name=Jackson238/&gt;

==Quantum mechanical==
{{further|Momentum operator}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], momentum is defined as a [[self-adjoint operator]] on the [[wave function]]. The [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once. In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]].

For a single particle described in the position basis the momentum operator can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}={\hbar\over i}\nabla=-i\hbar\nabla\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇}} is the [[gradient]] operator, {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]]. This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum operator, though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms. For example, in [[momentum space]] the momentum operator is represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\psi(p) = p\psi(p)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the operator {{math|'''p'''}} acting on a wave function {{math|''ψ''(''p'')}} yields that wave function multiplied by the value {{math|''p''}}, in an analogous fashion to the way that the position operator acting on a wave function {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} yields that wave function multiplied by the value ''x''.

For both massive and massless objects, relativistic momentum is related to the [[phase constant]]  &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt;  by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Z.Y.Wang|title=Generalized momentum equation of quantum mechanics|journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume=48|pages=1–9|date=2016|doi=10.1007/s11082-015-0261-8|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; p= \hbar \beta&lt;/math&gt;
[[Electromagnetic radiation]] (including [[light|visible light]], [[ultraviolet]] light, and [[radio waves]]) is carried by [[photons]]. Even though photons (the particle aspect of light) have no mass, they still carry momentum. This leads to applications such as the [[solar sail]]. The calculation of the momentum of light within [[dielectric]] media is somewhat controversial (see [[Abraham–Minkowski controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Stephen M.|title=Resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski Dilemma|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=2010|volume=104|issue=7|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.070401|bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104g0401B|pmid=20366861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==In deformable bodies and fluids==

===Conservation in a continuum===
{{Main|Cauchy momentum equation}}
[[File:Equation motion body.svg|right|thumb|Motion of a material body]]
In fields such as [[fluid dynamics]] and [[solid mechanics]], it is not feasible to follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules. Instead, the materials must be approximated by a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] in which there is a particle or [[fluid parcel]] at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density {{math|''ρ''}} and velocity {{math|'''v'''}} that depend on time {{math|''t''}} and position {{math|'''r'''}}. The momentum per unit volume is {{math|''ρ'''''v'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a column of water in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water, two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is {{math|''ρ'''''g'''}}, where {{math|'''g'''}} is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity. The normal force per unit area is the [[pressure]] {{math|''p''}}. The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance equation is&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh40&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 2|loc=Chapter 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla p +\rho \mathbf{g} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates. This acceleration is not simply the partial derivative {{math|{{sfrac|''∂'''''v'''|''∂t''}}}} because the fluid in a given volume changes with time. Instead, the [[material derivative]] is needed:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  + \mathbf{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Applied to any physical quantity, the material derivative includes the rate of change at a point and the changes due to [[advection]] as fluid is carried past the point. Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to {{math|''ρ''{{sfrac|''D'''''v'''|''Dt''}}}}. This is equal to the net force on the droplet.

Forces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a [[shear stress]] {{math|''τ''}}, exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or [[strain rate]]. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in the {{math|''x''}} direction varies with {{math|''z''}}, the  tangential force in direction {{math|''x''}} per unit area normal to the {{math|''z''}} direction is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\text{zx} = -\mu\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial z}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''μ''}} is the [[viscosity]]. This is also a [[flux]], or flow per unit area, of x-momentum through the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=R. Byron|author2=Warren Stewart |author3=Edwin N. Lightfoot  |title=Transport phenomena|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780470115398|page=13|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the effect of viscosity, the momentum balance equations for the [[incompressible flow]] of a [[Newtonian fluid]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} p + \mu\nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho\mathbf{g}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentum balance equations can be extended to more general materials, including solids. For each surface with normal in direction {{math|''i''}} and force in direction {{math|''j''}}, there is a stress component {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The nine components make up the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] {{math|'''σ'''}}, which includes both pressure and shear. The local conservation of momentum is expressed by the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{f}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''f'''}} is the [[body force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Cauchy momentum equation is broadly applicable to [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformations]] of solids and liquids. The relationship between the stresses and the strain rate depends on the properties of the material (see [[Viscosity#Types of viscosity|Types of viscosity]]).

===Acoustic waves===

A disturbance in a medium gives rise to oscillations, or [[wave]]s, that propagate away from their source. In a fluid, small changes in pressure {{math|''p''}} can often be described by the [[acoustic wave equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of sound]]. In a solid, similar equations can be obtained for propagation of pressure ([[P-wave]]s) and shear ([[S-waves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gubbins|first=David|title=Seismology and plate tectonics|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521379954|page=59|edition=Repr. (with corr.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flux, or transport per unit area, of a momentum component {{math|''ρv&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} by a velocity {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is equal to {{math|''ρ v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. In the linear approximation that leads to the above acoustic equation, the time average of this flux is zero. However, nonlinear effects can give rise to a nonzero average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LeBlond|first=Paul H.|title=Waves in the ocean|date=1980|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=9780444419262|page=258|edition=2. impr.|author2=Mysak, Lawrence A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for momentum flux to occur even though the wave itself does not have a mean momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIntyre|first=M.

==History of the concept==
{{see also|Theory of impetus}}
In about 530 AD, working in Alexandria, Byzantine philosopher [[John Philoponus]] developed a concept of momentum in his commentary to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Physics''. Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by something. For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air.  Most writers continued to accept Aristotle's theory until the time of Galileo, but a few were skeptical. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle's claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Sīnā (also known by his Latinized name [[Avicenna]]) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in ''The Book of Healing'' in 1020. He agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower; but unlike Philoponus, who believed that it was a temporary virtue that would decline even in a vacuum, he viewed it as a persistent, requiring external forces such as [[air resistance]] to dissipate it.&lt;ref name=Espinoza&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Espinoza | first1 = Fernando  | date = 2005 | title = An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching | url = | journal = Physics Education | volume = 40 | issue = 2| page = 141 | doi=10.1088/0031-9120/40/2/002|bibcode = 2005PhyEd..40..139E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia |author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=1996 |isbn=0-7007-0314-4 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayili&gt;{{cite journal

The work of Philoponus, and possibly that of Ibn Sīnā,&lt;ref name=Sayili/&gt; was read and refined by the European philosophers [[Peter Olivi]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Buridan, who in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris, referred to [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] being proportional to the weight times the speed. Moreover, Buridan's theory was different from his predecessor's in that he did not consider impetus to be self-dissipating, asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine:an Encyclopedia |page=107 |title=Buridian, John |author=T.F.

[[René Descartes]] believed that the total "quantity of motion" ({{lang-la|quantitas motus}}) in the universe is conserved,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Afriat, [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1699/1/Momentum3.pdf "Cartesian and Lagrangian Momentum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309014638/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1699/1/Momentum3.pdf |date=2017-03-09 }} (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; where the quantity of motion is understood as the product of size and speed. This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of momentum, since he had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size, and more importantly he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved. So for Descartes if a moving object were to bounce off a surface, changing its direction but not its speed, there would be no change in its quantity of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The first correct statement of the law of conservation of momentum was by English mathematician [[John Wallis]] in his 1670 work, ''Mechanica sive De Motu, Tractatus Geometricus'': "the initial state of the body, either of rest or of motion, will persist" and "If the force is greater than the resistance, motion will result".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.F. |last=Scott |title=The Mathematical Work of John Wallis, D.D., F.R.S. |publisher=Chelsea Publishing Company |date=1981 |isbn=0-8284-0314-7 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis uses ''momentum'' and ''vis'' for force. Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', when it was first published in 1687, showed a similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum. His Definition II defines ''quantitas motus'', "quantity of motion", as "arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly", which identifies it as momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Grimsehl |others=Translated by Leonard Ary Woodward |title=A Textbook of Physics |publisher=Blackie &amp; Son limited |date=1932 |location=London, Glasgow |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when in Law II he refers to ''mutatio motus'', "change of motion", being proportional to the force impressed, he is generally taken to mean momentum and not motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aldo |last=Rescigno |title=Foundation of Pharmacokinetics |date=2003 |isbn=0306477041 |location=New York |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained only to assign a standard term to the quantity of motion. The first use of "momentum" in its proper mathematical sense is not clear but by the time of Jenning's ''Miscellanea'' in 1721, five years before the final edition of Newton's ''Principia Mathematica'', momentum {{math|M}} or "quantity of motion" was being defined for students as "a rectangle", the product of {{math|Q}} and {{math|V}}, where {{math|Q}} is "quantity of material" and {{math|V}} is "velocity", {{math|{{sfrac|''s''|''t''}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Jennings |authorlink=John Jennings (tutor) |title=Miscellanea in Usum Juventutis Academicae |publisher=R.

A '''moraine-dammed lake''' occurs when the [[terminal moraine]] has prevented some [[meltwater]] from leaving the valley.  Its most common shape is that of a long ribbon ([[ribbon lake]]). 
Example of moraine dammed lakes include:
*'''Argentina/Chile''': [[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera/Buenos Aires Lake]]
*'''Chile''': [[Calafquén Lake]], [[Panguipulli Lake]] 
*'''New Zealand''': [[Lake Hāwea]], [[Lake Ohau]], [[Lake Pukaki]], [[Lake Tekapo]], [[Lake Wakatipu]], and [[Lake Wanaka]] (i.e., almost all large lakes in the [[South Island]])
*'''Switzerland''': [[Lake Zurich]]
*'''United States''': [[Donner Lake]] in [[California]], [[Flathead Lake]] in [[Montana]], [[Mille Lacs Lake]] in [[Minnesota]], [[Wallowa Lake]] in [[Oregon]]
*'''Wales''': [[Llyn Peris]] and its twin [[Llyn Padarn]].

In the 19th century the Argentine explorer [[Francisco Perito Moreno]] suggested that many Patagonian lakes draining to the Pacific were in fact part of the Atlantic basin but had been [[moraine]] dammed during the [[quaternary]] [[glaciation]]s changing their outlets to the west. He argued that as originally belonging to the Atlantic basin these lakes should be awarded to Argentina. Most of the lakes situated in the Himalaya of Nepal and Bhutan are also of the moraine dammed type. They may burst at any time. That is why the areas below such lakes have high risk of flooding.

In 1971, a group of scientists came together and formed a product called '''Nokomis 3'''. It is formulated to disperse oil that has been spilled into the ocean, lakes, bays, or rivers. &lt;br/&gt;This [[synergetic]] formulation of chemicals is water-based and non-flammable. This product has been used by the [[United States Navy]], State of California Fish and Game and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Marlin Supply Inc. is the main distributor of this product with laboratories in [[San Francisco]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]] and [[Mexico]]. Nokomis 3 is a highly effective mixture{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} that, when it comes into contact with the particles, oils, or greases, breaks up those particles into millions more and speeds up the process of [[biodegradation]].

When the product is released out of an airplane or aerial applied, it has an increased viscosity, causing a better chance for it to reach the ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://nokomis3.com/ Nokomis 3 Hayward CA&lt;/ref&gt;
This product is designed specifically to clean up No. 2 Oil Fuel and is a base on the pH scale, and is completely water [[soluble]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/OEM/content/ncp/products/nokomis3AA.htm United States Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nokomis 3-AA ==

This specific product of Nokomis 3 is a water based [[colloid]]. Nokomis 3-AA can be appied through spray nozzles on workboats or ships and for best use the propellor of the boats can be helpful with mixing the product into the water for the most effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nokomis3.com/pdfs/Nokomis-3AA-datasheet-en.pdf Nokomis 3-AA Data Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nokomis 3-F4 ==

The second design of Nokomis 3 is the Nokomis 3-F4. It is made with a higher [[viscosity]], increasing the chance that the full product with reach the waters surface.  It is not always applied by plane. It can also be sprayed through nozzles to the top of the surface. Depending on the situation and largeness of the oil spill. it can be applied either diluted or at full strength.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nokomis3.com/pdfs/Nokomis-3F4-datasheet-en.pdf Nokomis 3-F4 Data Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Névé''' {{IPAc-en|n|eɪ|ˈ|v|eɪ}} is a young, granular type of [[snow]] which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted, yet precedes the form of ice.  This type of snow is associated with [[glacier]] formation through the process of [[nivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.hofstra.edu/j_b_bennington/33notes/glaciers.html |title=Geol 33 Environmental Geomorphology|publisher=Hofstra University |accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Névé that survives a full season of [[ablation]] turns into [[firn]], which is both older and slightly denser.  Firn eventually becomes glacial ice – the long-lived, compacted ice that glaciers are composed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Névé|volume=19 |short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glacier formation can take days to years depending on freeze-thaw factors.  Névé is annually observed in [[skiing]] slopes, and is generally disliked as an icy falling zone.

Névé has a minimum [[density]] of 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, which is [[Density#Water|roughly half]] of the density of liquid water at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/physgeoglos/n.html |website=PhysicalGeography.net |title=Glossary of Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Névé can also refer to the [[Alpine climate|alpine]] region in which snowfall accumulates, becomes névé, and feeds a glacier.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On ocean basin scales, this technique is also known as acoustic thermometry.  The technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes sound signals to travel between two instruments, one an acoustic source and one a [[hydrophone|receiver]], separated by ranges of 100–5000&amp;nbsp;km.    If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of time-of-flight can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path.  Changes in the [[speed of sound]] are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature.     A 1&amp;nbsp;°C change in temperature corresponds to about 4&amp;nbsp;m/s change in sound speed.   An oceanographic experiment employing [[tomography]] typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a [[Mooring (oceanography)|moored]] array that measures an area of ocean.

== Motivation ==
[[Seawater]] is an [[electrical conductor]], so the oceans are opaque to [[electromagnetic energy]] (e.g., [[light]] or [[radar]]). The oceans are fairly transparent to low-frequency acoustics, however.  The oceans conduct sound very  efficiently, particularly sound at low frequencies, i.e., less than a few hundred hertz.&lt;ref name="HIFT"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;ref name="stormy"/&gt; to suggest "acoustic tomography" for ocean measurement in the late 1970s.  The advantages of the acoustical approach to measuring temperature are twofold.  First, large areas of the ocean's interior can be measured by [[remote sensing]].  Second, the technique naturally averages over the small scale fluctuations of temperature (i.e., noise) that dominate ocean variability.

From its beginning, the idea of observations of the ocean by acoustics was married to estimation of the ocean's state using modern [[Global climate model|numerical ocean models]] and the techniques assimilating data into numerical models.  As the observational technique has matured, so too have the methods of [[data assimilation]] and the computing power required to perform those calculations.

==Multipath arrivals and tomography==
[[Image:Rays test.gif|thumb|right|436px| Propagation of acoustic ray paths through the ocean.  From the acoustic source at left, the paths are [[refraction|refracted]] by faster sound speed above and below the [[SOFAR channel]], hence they oscillate about the channel axis.  Tomography exploits these "multipaths" to infer information about temperature
variations as a function of depth.  Note that the aspect ratio of the figure has been greatly skewed to better illustrate the rays; the maximum depth of the figure is only 4.5&amp;nbsp;km, while the maximum range is 500&amp;nbsp;km.]]

One of the intriguing aspects of tomography is that it exploits the fact that acoustic signals travel along  a set of generally stable ray paths.    From a single transmitted acoustic signal, this set of rays gives rise to multiple arrivals at the receiver, the travel time of each arrival corresponding to a particular ray path.   The earliest arrivals correspond to the deeper-traveling rays, since these rays travel where sound speed is greatest.  The ray paths are easily calculated using computers ("[[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]]"), and each ray path can generally be identified with a particular travel time.  The multiple travel times measure the sound speed averaged over each of the multiple acoustic paths.  These measurements make it possible to infer aspects of the structure of temperature or current variations as a function of depth.  The solution for sound speed, hence temperature, from the acoustic travel times is an [[inverse problem]].

==The integrating property of long-range acoustic measurements==
Ocean acoustic tomography integrates temperature variations over large distances, that is, the measured travel times result from the accumulated effects of all the temperature variations along the acoustic path, hence measurements by the technique are inherently averaging.    This is an important, unique property, since the ubiquitous small-scale turbulent and internal-wave features of the ocean usually dominate the signals in measurements at single points.  For example, measurements by [[thermometers]] (i.e., moored thermistors or [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo]] drifting floats) have to contend with this 1-2&amp;nbsp;°C noise, so that large numbers of instruments are required to obtain an accurate measure of average temperature.  For measuring the average temperature of ocean basins, therefore, the acoustic measurement is quite cost effective.  Tomographic measurements also average variability over depth as well, since the ray paths cycle throughout the water column.

==Reciprocal tomography==
"Reciprocal tomography" employs the simultaneous transmissions between two acoustic transceivers.  A "transceiver" is an instrument incorporating both an acoustic source and a receiver.  The slight differences in travel time between the reciprocally-traveling signals are used to measure [[ocean current]]s, since the reciprocal signals travel with and against the current.  The average of these reciprocal travel times is the measure of temperature, with the small effects from ocean currents entirely removed.   Ocean temperatures are inferred from the ''sum'' of reciprocal travel times, while the currents are inferred from the ''difference'' of reciprocal travel times.  Generally, ocean currents (typically 10&amp;nbsp;cm/s) have a much smaller effect on travel times than sound speed variations (typically 5&amp;nbsp;m/s), so "one-way" tomography measures temperature to good approximation.

==Applications==
In the ocean, large-scale temperature changes can occur over time intervals from minutes ([[internal waves]]) to decades (oceanic [[climate change]]).   Tomography has been employed to measure variability over this wide range of temporal scales and over a wide range of spatial scales.  Indeed, tomography has been contemplated as a measurement of ocean climate using transmissions over [[antipodes|antipodal]] distances.&lt;ref name="HIFT" /&gt;

Tomography has come to be a valuable method of ocean observation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=A.S. |last2=Hall |first2=J.|last3=Harrison|first3=D.E.|last4=Stammer|first4=D.|last5=Benveniste|first5=J. |editor1-last=Hall |editor1-first=J.|editor2-last=Harrison |editor2-first=D.E.|editor3-last=Stammer |editor3-first=D.|title=Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 1) |publisher=ESA Publication WPP-306 |date=2010  |chapter=Conference Summary-Ocean Information for Society: Sustaining the Benefits, Realizing the Potential |chapterurl= http://www.oceanobs09.net/proceedings/summary/|access-date=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploiting the characteristics of long-range acoustic propagation to obtain synoptic measurements of average ocean temperature or current.  One of the earliest applications of tomography in ocean observation occurred in 1988-9.  A collaboration between groups at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] deployed a six-element tomographic array in the [[abyssal plain]] of the [[Greenland Sea]] [[Oceanic gyre|gyre]] to study [[Thermohaline circulation#Formation of deep water masses|deep water formation]] and the gyre circulation.&lt;ref name="GSP1"&gt;{{cite news

==Acoustic thermometry==
Acoustic thermometry is an idea to observe the world's [[ocean]] basins, and the ocean climate in particular, using trans-[[Oceanic basin|basin]] [[acoustics|acoustic]] [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmissions]].  "Thermometry", rather than "tomography", has been used to indicate basin-scale or global scale measurements.  Prototype measurements of [[temperature]] have been made in the [[North Pacific|North Pacific Basin]] and across the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic Basin]].&lt;ref name="OAT"/&gt;

Starting in 1983, John Spiesberger of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]],  and Ted Birdsall and Kurt Metzger of the [[University of Michigan]] developed the use of sound to infer information about the ocean's large-scale temperatures, and in particular to attempt the detection of global warming in the ocean.  This group transmitted sounds from Oahu that were recorded at about ten receivers stationed around the rim of the Pacific Ocean over distances of  4000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="oceanography"&gt;{{cite journal

These experiments demonstrated that changes in temperature could be measured with an accuracy of about 20 millidegrees.  Spiesberger et  al. did not detect global warming. Instead they discovered that other natural climatic fluctuations, such as El Nino, were responsible in part
for substantial fluctuations in temperature that may have masked any slower and smaller trends that may have occurred from global warming

The Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program was implemented in the North Pacific Ocean, with  acoustic transmissions from 1996 through fall 2006.  The measurements terminated when agreed-upon environmental protocols ended.  The decade-long deployment of the acoustic source showed that the observations are sustainable on even a modest budget.  The transmissions have been verified to provide an accurate measurement of ocean temperature on the acoustic paths, with uncertainties that are far smaller than any other approach to ocean temperature measurement.&lt;ref name='Science-1998'&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion was complicated by technical issues from a variety of disciplines ([[physical oceanography]], [[underwater acoustics|acoustics]], marine mammal biology, etc.) that makes understanding the effects of acoustics on marine mammals difficult for the experts, let alone the general public.  Many of the issues concerning acoustics in the ocean and their effects on marine mammals were unknown.  Finally, there were a variety of public misconceptions initially, such as a confusion of the definition of sound levels in air vs. sound levels in water.  If a given number of decibels in water are interpreted as decibels in air, the sound level will seem to be orders of magnitude larger than it really is - at one point the ATOC sound levels were erroneously interpreted as "louder than 10,000 [[Boeing 747|747]] airplanes".&lt;ref name="stormy"&gt;{{cite book

The ocean carries sound so efficiently that sounds do not have to be that loud to cross ocean basins.  Other factors in the controversy were the extensive history of activism where marine mammals are concerned, stemming from the ongoing whaling conflict, and the sympathy that much of the public feels toward marine mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the case of the ATOC, the source was mounted on the bottom about a half mile deep, hence marine mammals, which are bound to the surface, were generally further than a half mile from the source.  This fact, combined with the modest source level, the infrequent 2% duty cycle (the sound is on only 2% of the day), and other such factors, made the sound transmissions benign in its effect on marine life.

==Types of transmitted acoustic signals==
Tomographic transmissions consist of long coded signals (e.g., [[Maximum length sequence|"m-sequences"]]) lasting 30 seconds or more.  The frequencies employed range from  50 to 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz and source powers range from 100 to 250 W, depending on the particular goals of the measurements.  With precise timing such as from [[GPS]], travel times can be measured to a nominal accuracy of 1 millisecond.  While these transmissions are audible near the source, beyond a range of several kilometers the signals are usually below ambient noise levels, requiring sophisticated [[spread-spectrum]] [[signal processing]] techniques to recover them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23197">*The following [[outline (list)|outline]] is presented as an overview and topical guide to air pollution dispersion:

'''Air pollution dispersion''' &amp;ndash;  distribution of air pollution into the atmosphere. [[Air pollution]] is the introduction of particulates, biological molecules, or other harmful materials into Earth's atmosphere, causing disease, death to humans, damage to other living organisms such as food crops, or the natural or built environment. Air pollution may come from anthropogenic or natural sources. Dispersion refers to what happens to the pollution during and after its introduction; understanding this may help in identifying and controlling it.  Air pollution dispersion has become the focus of environmental conservationists and governmental environmental protection agencies (local, state, province and national) of many countries (which have adopted and used much of the terminology of this field in their laws and regulations) regarding [[air pollution control]].

==Air pollution emission plumes==
[[File:Gaussian Plume (SVG).svg|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]

[[Air pollution emission plume]] &amp;ndash; flow of pollutant in the form of vapor or smoke released into the air. Plumes are of considerable importance in the atmospheric dispersion modelling of air pollution. There are three primary types of air pollution [[Air pollutants|emission]] [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plumes]]:
* '''[[Buoyant]] plumes''' — Plumes which are lighter than air because they are at a higher [[temperature]] and lower [[density]] than the ambient air which surrounds them, or because they are at about the same temperature as the ambient air but have a lower [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] and hence lower density than the ambient air. For example, the emissions from the [[flue gas stacks]] of industrial [[furnace]]s are buoyant because they are considerably warmer and less dense than the ambient air. As another example, an emission plume of [[methane]] gas at ambient air temperatures is buoyant  because methane has a lower molecular weight than the ambient air.
* '''[[Density|Dense]] gas plumes''' — Plumes which are heavier than air because they have a higher density than the surrounding ambient air. A plume may have a higher density than air because it has a higher molecular weight than air (for example, a plume of [[carbon dioxide]]). A plume may also have a higher density than air if the plume is at a much lower temperature than the air. For example, a plume of [[evaporation|evaporated]] gaseous methane from an accidental release of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) may be as cold as -161&amp;nbsp;°C.
* '''Passive or neutral plumes''' — Plumes which are neither lighter or heavier than air.

==Air pollution dispersion models==

There are five types of air pollution dispersion models, as well as some hybrids of the five types:&lt;ref&gt;[[List of atmospheric dispersion models]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Box model''' — The box model is the simplest of the model types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter18/dispersion_intro.html Air Pollution Dispersion: Ventilation Factor] by Dr. Nolan Atkins, Lyndon State College&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes the [[airshed]] (i.e., a given volume of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] air in a geographical region) is in the shape of a box. It also assumes that the air pollutants inside the box are homogeneously distributed and uses that assumption to estimate the average pollutant [[concentration]]s anywhere within the airshed. Although useful, this model is very limited in its ability to accurately predict dispersion of air pollutants over an airshed because the assumption of homogeneous pollutant distribution is much too simple.
*'''[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Gaussian model]]''' — The Gaussian model is perhaps the oldest (circa 1936) &lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, C.H. and Pearson, J.L. (1936).''The spread of smoke and gases from chimney'', Trans. Faraday Soc., 32:1249.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps the most commonly used model type. It assumes that the air pollutant  dispersion has a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]], meaning that the pollutant distribution has a normal probability distribution. Gaussian models are most often used for predicting the dispersion of continuous, buoyant air pollution plumes originating from  ground-level or elevated sources. Gaussian models may also be used for predicting the dispersion of non-continuous air pollution plumes (called ''puff models''). The primary algorithm used in Gaussian modeling is the ''Generalized Dispersion Equation For A Continuous Point-Source Plume''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} (Chapter 8, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian]] model''' — a Lagrangian dispersion model mathematically follows pollution plume parcels (also called particles) as the parcels move in the atmosphere and they model the motion  of the parcels as a [[random walk]] process. The Lagrangian model then calculates the air pollution dispersion by computing the statistics of the trajectories of a large number of the pollution plume parcels. A Lagrangian model uses a moving [[frame of reference]]&lt;ref name=JRC&gt;[http://rem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/etex/37.htm Features of Dispersion Models] publication of the [[European Union]] Joint Research Centre (JRC)&lt;/ref&gt; as the parcels move from their initial location. It is said that an observer of a Lagrangian model follows along with the plume.
*'''[[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Eulerian]] model''' — an Eulerian dispersion model is similar to a Lagrangian model in that it also tracks the movement of a large number of pollution plume parcels as they move from their initial location. The most important difference between the two models is that the Eulerian model uses a fixed three-dimensional [[Cartesian grid]]&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt; as a frame of reference rather than a moving frame of reference. It is said that an observer of an Eulerian model watches the plume go by.
*'''Dense gas model''' — Dense gas models are models that simulate the dispersion of dense gas pollution plumes (i.e., pollution plumes that are heavier than air). The three most commonly used {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} {{Dubious|date=December 2011}} dense gas models are:

==Air pollutant emission ==

[[File:AirPollutionSource.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Air pollution emission source]]

* Types of air pollutant emission sources &amp;ndash; named for their characteristics
** Sources, by shape &amp;ndash; there are four basic shapes which an emission source may have. They are:
*** Point source — single, identifiable source of air pollutant emissions (for example, the emissions from a [[combustion]] furnace flue gas stack). Point sources are also characterized as being either elevated or at ground-level. A point source has no [[geometric]] dimensions.
*** Line source — one-dimensional source of air pollutant emissions (for example, the emissions from the [[traffic|vehicular traffic]] on a roadway).
*** Area source — two-dimensional source of diffuse air pollutant emissions (for example, the emissions from a [[forest fire]], a [[landfill]] or the evaporated vapors from a large spill of volatile liquid).
*** Volume source — three-dimensional source of diffuse air pollutant emissions. Essentially, it is an area source with a third (height) dimension (for example, the fugitive gaseous emissions from [[piping]] [[flange]]s, [[valves]] and other equipment at various heights within industrial facilities such as [[oil refineries]] and [[petrochemical]] plants). Another example would be the emissions from an automobile paint shop with multiple roof vents or multiple open windows.
** Sources, by motion
*** [[Major stationary source|Stationary source]] &amp;ndash; [[flue gas]] stacks are examples of stationary sources
*** Mobile source &amp;ndash; [[bus]]es are examples of mobile sources
** Sources, by urbanization level &amp;ndash; whether the source is within a city or not is relevant in that urban areas constitute a so-called ''heat island'' and the heat rising from an urban area causes the atmosphere above an urban area to be more turbulent than the atmosphere above a rural area
*** Urban source &amp;ndash; emission is in an urban area
*** Rural source &amp;ndash; emission is in a rural area
** Sources, by elevation
*** Surface or ground-level source
*** Near surface source
*** Elevated source
** Sources, by duration
*** Puff or intermittent source &amp;ndash; short term sources (for example, many [[Accidental Release Source Terms|accidental emission releases]] are short term puffs)
*** Continuous source &amp;ndash; long term source (for example, most flue gas stack emissions are continuous)

==Characterization of atmospheric turbulence==

Effect of [[turbulence]] on dispersion &amp;ndash; turbulence increases the [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrainment]] and mixing of unpolluted air into the plume and thereby acts to reduce the concentration of pollutants in the plume (i.e., enhances the plume dispersion). It is therefore important to categorize the amount of atmospheric turbulence present at any given time. This type of disperson is scale dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=John|date=April 1973|title=Scale-Dependent Diffusion|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|volume=|pages=548|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1973)012&lt;0547:sdd&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such that, for flows where the cloud of pollutant is smaller than the largest eddies present, there will be mixing. There is no limit on the size on mixing motions in the atmosphere and therefore bigger clouds will experience larger and stronger mixing motions. And hence, this type of dispersion is scale dependent.

===The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes===

[[Pasquill atmospheric stability classes]] &amp;ndash; oldest and, for a great many years, the most commonly used method of categorizing the amount of atmospheric turbulence present was the method developed by [[Frank Pasquill|Pasquill]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Pasquill, F. (1961). ''The estimation of the dispersion of windborne material'', The Meteorological Magazine, vol 90, No. 1063, pp 33-49.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He categorized the atmospheric turbulence into six '''stability classes''' named A, B, C, D, E and F with class A being the most unstable or most turbulent class, and class F  the most stable or least turbulent class. 
* Table 1 lists the six classes 
* Table 2 provides the meteorological conditions that define each class. The stability classes demonstrate a few key ideas. Solar radiation increases [[atmospheric instability]] through warming of the Earth's surface so that warm air is below cooler (and therefore denser) air promoting vertical mixing. Clear nights push conditions toward stable as the ground cools faster establishing more stable conditions and inversions. Wind increases vertical mixing, breaking down any type of stratification and pushing the stability class towards neutral (D).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasquill|first=F.|date=February 1961|title=The estimation of the dispersion of windborne material|url=|journal=Meteorological Magazine|volume=90|pages=33–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced methods of categorizing atmospheric turbulence===

[[Advanced air pollution dispersion model]]s &amp;ndash; they do not categorize atmospheric turbulence by using the simple meteorological parameters commonly used in defining the six Pasquill classes as shown in Table 2 above. The more advanced models use some form of [[Monin-Obukhov length|Monin-Obukhov similarity theory.]] Some examples include:
* [[AERMOD]]&lt;ref name= AERMOD&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/7thconf/aermod/aermod_mfd.pdf AERMOD:Description of Model Formulation]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; US EPA's most advanced model, no longer uses the Pasquill stability classes to categorize atmospheric turbulence. Instead, it uses the surface [[roughness length]] and the [[Monin-Obukhov length]].
* [[ADMS 4]],&lt;ref name=ADMS&gt;[http://www.cerc.co.uk/environmental-software/ADMS-model.html ADMS 4] Description of the model by the developers, Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; [[United Kingdom]]'s most advanced model, uses the Monin-Obukhov length, the [[boundary layer]] height and the windspeed to categorize the atmospheric turbulence.

==Miscellaneous other terminology==

::''(Work on this section is continuously in progress)''

*'''Building effects or downwash''': When an air pollution plume flows over nearby buildings or other structures, turbulent eddies are formed in the downwind side of the building. Those eddies cause a plume from a stack source located within about five times the height of a nearby building or structure to be forced down to the ground much sooner than it would if a building or structure were not present. The effect can greatly increase the resulting near-by ground-level pollutant concentrations downstream of the building or structure. If the pollutants in the plume are subject to depletion by contact with the ground ([[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], for example), the concentration increase just downstream of the building or structure will decrease the concentrations further downstream.
*'''[[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|Deposition]]''' of the pollution plume components to the underlying surface can be defined as either dry or wet deposition:
**'''Dry deposition''' is the removal of gaseous or particulate material from the pollution plume by contact with the ground surface or vegetation (or even water surfaces) through transfer processes such as [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and gravitational  [[sedimentation]].  This may be calculated by means of a ''[[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition velocity]]'', which is related to the resistance of the underlying surface to the transfer.
**'''Wet deposition''' is the removal of pollution plume components by the action of rain. The wet deposition of radionuclides in a pollution plume by a burst of rain often forms so called ''hot spots'' of radioactivity on the underlying surface.
*'''[[Inversion (meteorology)|Inversion layers]]''':&lt;ref  name=Beychok/&gt; Normally, the air near the [[Earth]]'s surface is warmer than the air above it because the atmosphere is heated from below as solar radiation warms the Earth's surface, which in turn then warms the layer of the atmosphere directly above it. Thus, the atmospheric temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude. However, under certain meteorological conditions, atmospheric layers may form in which the temperature increases with increasing altitude. Such layers are called inversion layers. When such a layer forms at the Earth's surface, it is called a '''surface inversion'''. When an inversion layer forms at some distance above the earth, it is called an '''inversion aloft''' (sometimes referred to as a ''[[capping inversion]]''). The air within an inversion aloft is very stable with very little vertical motion. Any rising parcel of air within the inversion soon expands, thereby [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically cooling]] to a lower temperature than the surrounding air and the parcel stops rising. Any sinking parcel soon compresses adiabatically to a higher temperature than the surrounding air and the parcel stops sinking. Thus, any air pollution plume that enters an inversion aloft will undergo very little vertical mixing unless it has sufficient [[momentum]] to completely pass through the inversion aloft. That is one reason why an inversion aloft is sometimes called a capping inversion.
*'''Mixing height''':&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; When an inversion aloft is formed, the atmospheric layer between the Earth's surface and the bottom of the inversion aloft is known as the '''mixing layer''' and the distance between the Earth's surface and the bottom of inversion aloft is known as the '''mixing height'''. Any air pollution plume dispersing beneath an inversion aloft will be limited in vertical mixing to that which occurs beneath the bottom of the inversion aloft (sometimes called the ''lid''). Even if the pollution plume penetrates the inversion, it will not undergo any further significant vertical mixing. As for a pollution plume passing completely through an inversion layer aloft, that rarely occurs unless the pollution plume's source stack is very tall and the inversion lid is fairly low.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7137">'''Oxygen''' '''evolution''' is the process of generating molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by a [[chemical reaction]], usually from water. Oxygen evolution from [[water]] is effected by oxygenic [[photosynthesis]], [[electrolysis]] of water, and thermal decomposition of various oxides.  The biological process supports aerobic life.  When relatively pure oxygen is required industrially, it is isolated by distillation of liquified air.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

==Oxygen evolution in nature==
{{main|Oxygen evolving complex}}
Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is the fundamental process by which oxygen is generated in earth's [[biosphere]]. The reaction is part of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of photosynthesis in [[cyanobacteria]] and the [[chloroplast]]s of [[green algae]] and [[plant]]s. It utilizes the energy of [[light]] to split a water molecule into its [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s for photosynthesis. Free oxygen, generated as a by-product of this reaction, is released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Water oxidation is catalyzed by a [[manganese]]-containing [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] contained in [[photosystem II]] known as the [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) or water-splitting complex. Manganese is an important [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], and [[calcium]] and [[chloride]] are also required for the reaction to occur.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;The stoichiometry this reaction follows:
: 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⟶ 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The protons are released into the [[thylakoid lumen]], thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is the driving force for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis via [[photophosphorylation]] and coupling the absorption of light energy and oxidation of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Raval"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raval M, Biswal B, Biswal U |title=The mystery of oxygen evolution: analysis of structure and function of photosystem II, the water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase |journal=Photosynthesis Research |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=267–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16170631| doi=10.1007/s11120-005-8163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of discovery===
It was not until the end of the 18th century that [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered by accident the ability of plants to "restore" air that had been "injured" by the burning of a candle. He followed up on the experiment by showing that air "restored" by [[vegetation]] was ''"not at all inconvenient to a [[mouse]]."'' He was later awarded a medal for his discoveries that: ''"...no vegetable grows in vain... but cleanses and purifies our atmosphere."'' Priestley's experiments were followed up by [[Jan Ingenhousz]], a Dutch physician, who showed that "restoration" of air only worked in the presence of light and green plant parts.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. |author2=Ray F. Evert |author3=Susan E. Eichhorn  | title = Biology of Plants, 7th Edition | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers | date = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 115–127  | isbn = 0-7167-1007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingenhousz suggested in 1796 that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbon dioxide]]) is split during photosynthesis to release oxygen, while the [[carbon]] combined with water to form [[carbohydrate]]s. While this hypothesis was attractive and reasonable and thus widely accepted for a long time, it was later proven incorrect. Graduate student [[C.B. Van Niel]] at [[Stanford University]] found that [[purple sulfur bacteria]] reduce carbon to carbohydrates, but accumulate [[sulfur]] instead of releasing oxygen. He boldly proposed that, in analogy to the sulfur bacteria's forming elemental sulfur from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]), plants would form oxygen from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In 1937, this hypothesis was corroborated by the discovery that plants are capable of producing oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This discovery was made by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robin Hill]], and subsequently the light-driven release of oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was called the ''Hill reaction''. Our current knowledge of the mechanism of oxygen evolution during photosynthesis was further established in experiments tracing [[isotopes of oxygen]] from water to oxygen gas.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

==Water electrolysis==
Together with [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen is evolved by [[electrolysis of water]]. 
[[File:Electrolysis of Water.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing the overall [[chemical equation]].]]

Electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) are transferred from the cathode to protons to form hydrogen gas. The [[half reaction]], balanced with acid, is:
:2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

At the positively charged anode, an [[redox|oxidation]] reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and releasing electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:

:Overall reaction: 
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Chemical oxygen generation==
[[Chemical oxygen generator]]s consist of chemical compounds that release O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon some stimulation, usually heat. They are used in submarines and commercial aircraft, providing emergency oxygen.  Oxygen is generated by high-temperature decomposition of sodium chlorate:&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 NaCl  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Potassium permanganate also releases oxygen upon heating, but the yield is modest.
:2 KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Proven reserves''', also called '''measured reserves''', '''1P''', and '''reserves''', are industry specific terms regarding fossil fuel energy sources. They are defined as a "Quantity of energy sources estimated with reasonable certainty, from the analysis of geologic and engineering data, to be recoverable from well established or known reservoirs with the existing equipment and under the existing operating conditions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/proved-reserves.html Business Dictionary Proved Reserves]&lt;/ref&gt;  A reserve is considered a proven reserve if it is probable that 90% or more of the resource is recoverable while being economically profitable. These terms relate to common [[fossil fuel]] reserves such as [[oil reserves]], [[natural gas]] reserves, or [[coal]] reserves. 

Operating conditions are taken into account when determining if a reserve is classified as "proven". Operating conditions include operational break-even price, regulatory and contractual approvals, without which the reserve cannot be classified as proven. Price changes therefore can have a large impact on the classification of proven reserves. Regulatory and contractual conditions may change, and also affect the amount of proven reserves. If a reserve's resources can be recovered using current technology but is not economically profitable it is considered "technically recoverable" but cannot be considered a proven reserve. Reserves less than 90% recoverable but more than 50% are considered "probable reserves" and below 50% are "possible reserves".

==Numbered terms==
The ''engineering'' term P90 refers to 90 percent engineering probability, is a commonly accepted specific definition by [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]], it does not take into account anything except technical concerns.  Therefore, it is different from the business term which does take into account current break-even profitability, and regulatory and contractual approval, but is considered a very rough equivalent.  The definition is certainly not universal. [[Energy Watch Group]] uses a different definition, P95.

==More terms==
Disregarding economics, the proper ''engineering'' term for the total technologically extractable amount is the [[Producible fraction]], which is easily confused with the ''business term'' ''proven reserves''.  However, the purely engineering term is also misleading in that squeezing the last bits of fossil fuel out follows the [[law of diminishing returns|diminishing returns]] and at some point is so costly that it becomes highly impractical, as seen on a [[Gaussian function|bell curve]], which is why measures like P90 and P95 were created.  The term ''proven reserves'' is further subdivided into ''proved developed reserves'' and ''proved undeveloped reserves''.  Note that it does not include ''Unproven reserves'', which is broken down into [[probable reserves]] as well as [[possible reserves]] .

These reserve categories are totaled up by the measures 1P, 2P, and 3P, which are inclusive of all reserves types:
* "1P reserves" = proven reserves (both proved developed reserves + proved undeveloped reserves).
* "2P reserves" = 1P (proven reserves) + probable reserves, hence "proved AND probable."&lt;ref&gt;Petroleum review:  62 p732-743 Institute of Petroleum (Great Britain) - 2008 "The field is estimated to hold some 66mn barrels of proved and probable (2P) oil reserves and 143mn barrels of proved, probable and possible (3P) reserves. "&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "3P reserves" = the sum of 2P (proven reserves + probable reserves) + possible reserves, all 3Ps "proven AND probable AND possible."&lt;ref&gt;Offshore Oil Industry Lexicon 2-1 3P RESERVES Proven, Probable plus Possible reserves (3P) are those reserves that , to a low degree of certainty (10% confidence), are recoverable. There is relatively high risk associated with these reserves.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vivek Chandra Fundamentals of natural gas: an international perspective 2006 p20 "Probable reserves are unproved reserves that analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are likely to be ... exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves, also known as “P + Probable + Possible = 3P” reserves. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Energy, Environment and Development p55 José Goldemberg, Oswaldo Lucon - 2009 "3P): reserves that have about 10 per cent probability of exploitation, under favourable circumstances."&lt;/ref&gt; 

New proven reserves are commonly added by new field discoveries. [[Reserves growth]] also commonly occurs in previously existing fields, as the characteristics of the reservoir become better understood, as fields are extended laterally, or new oil and gas reservoirs are found in existing fields.  Reserve growth may also take place due to technological and economic changes.

===Russian reserve categories===
In [[Russia]], reserves categories A, B, and C correspond roughly to developed producing reserves, undeveloped reserves (development is approved), and discovered resources without a firm plan to develop yet, respectively; the designation ABC corresponds to discovered resources. Better references pending. &lt;ref&gt;Ryder Scott newsletter, [https://www.ryderscott.com/wp-content/uploads/July-2015-Newsletter.pdf],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reserve evaluations, valuations and certifications==
Oil companies employ specialist reserve valuation consultants - such as [[Gaffney, Cline &amp; Associates]], Sproule, [[Miller and Lents, Ltd.]], [[DeGolyer and MacNaughton]], [[Ryder Scott]], [[Netherland, Sewell &amp; Associates Inc. (NSAI)]], Evolution Resources, Cawley, Gillespie &amp; Associates Inc. (CG&amp;A) and others - to provide third party reports as part of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [[SEC filings]]. On December 30 2009, recognising advances in exploration and valuation technology, the SEC allowed 2P probable and 3P possible reserves to be reported, along with 1P proved reserves, though oil companies also have to verify the independence of third party consultants. Since investors view 1P reserves with much greater importance than 2P or 3P reserves, oil companies seek to convert 2P and 3P reserves into 1P reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Gianna Bern ''Investing in Energy: A Primer on the Economics of the Energy Industry'' 2011 p55 "Similarly, producers will try to convert their 2P reserves into 1P reserves by virtue of the certification process, which we will ... Bankers, investors, and analysts view 1P reserves with much greater importance than 2P or 3P reserves. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rangelands''' are [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, and [[desert]]s that are grazed by domestic [[livestock]] or wild animals.  Types of rangelands include [[tallgrass prairie|tallgrass]] and [[shortgrass prairie]]s, desert grasslands and shrublands, woodlands, [[savanna]]s, [[chaparral]]s, [[steppe]]s, and [[tundra]]s. Rangelands do not include  [[forest]]s lacking grazable [[understory]] vegetation, barren desert, [[farmland]],  or land covered by solid rock, concrete and/or [[glacier]]s.

Rangelands are distinguished from [[pasture]] lands because they grow primarily native vegetation, rather than plants established by humans. [[Rangeland management|Rangelands are also managed]] principally with  practices such as managed livestock grazing and prescribed fire rather than more intensive agricultural practices of seeding, irrigation, and the use of fertilizers.

Grazing is an important use of rangelands but the term "rangeland" is not synonymous with "grazinglands". Livestock grazing can be used to [[Rangeland management|manage rangelands]] by harvesting forage to produce livestock, changing plant composition or reducing fuel loads.

Fire is also an important regulator of range vegetation, whether set by humans or resulting from lightning.  Fires tend to reduce the abundance of woody plants and promote herbaceous plants including grasses, forbs, and grass-like plants. The suppression or reduction of periodic wildfires from desert shrublands, savannas, or woodlands frequently invites the dominance of trees and shrubs to the near exclusion of grasses and forbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Micropaedia]]: The New [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2010|edition=15th |volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of rangeland==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines rangeland as "lands on which the native vegetation (climax or natural potential plant community) is predominantly grasses, grass-like plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing or browsing use."&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasture, Rangeland, and Grazing Operations|url=http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/anprgidx.html|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA classifies natural grassland and savannas as rangeland, and in some cases includes wetlands, deserts, tundra, and "certain forb and shrub communities."&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;  The primary difference between rangeland and pasture is management; rangelands tend to have natural vegetation along with a few introduced plant species, but all managed by grazing, while pastures have forage that is adapted for livestock and managed, by seeding, mowing, fertilization and irrigation.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

===Prairie===
[[Prairie]]s are considered part of the [[temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands]] [[biome]] by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant [[vegetation type]]. Temperate grassland regions include the [[Pampa]]s of [[Argentina]], and the [[steppe]]s of [[Eurasia]].

===Grasslands===
[[Grasslands]] are areas where  the [[vegetation]] is dominated by [[grass]]es ([[Poaceae]]) and other [[herbaceous]] (non-woody) plants ([[forb]]s). However, sedge ([[Cyperaceae]]) and rush ([[Juncaceae]]) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. In temperate latitudes, such as northwest [[Europe]] and the [[Great Plains]] and [[California]] in [[North America]], native grasslands are dominated by perennial [[bunch grass]] species, whereas in warmer climates annual species form a greater component of the vegetation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Experiments/Biome/biograssland.php NASA Earth Observatory webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steppe===
[[Steppe]], in physical [[geography]], refers to a [[biome]] region characterized by [[grassland]] [[plain]] without [[tree]]s apart from those near rivers and lakes. The [[prairie]] (especially the [[shortgrass prairie|shortgrass]] and [[mixed prairie]]) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such. It may be semi-[[desert]], or covered with [[Poaceae|grass]] or [[shrub]]s or both, depending on the [[season]] and [[latitude]]. The term is also used to denote the [[climate]] encountered in regions too dry to support a [[forest]], but not dry enough to be a desert.

===Pampas===
[[Pampas]] are the fertile [[South America]]n lowlands that include the [[Argentina|Argentine]] provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], [[Santa Fe Province, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[Entre Ríos Province, Argentina|Entre Ríos]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], most of [[Uruguay]], and the State of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], in the southernmost end of [[Brazil]] covering more than {{convert|750000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. These vast plains are only interrupted by the low Ventana and Tandil hills near [[Bahía Blanca]] and [[Tandil]] (Argentina), with a height of {{convert|1300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The climate is mild, with [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, more or less evenly distributed through the year, making the soils appropriate for [[agriculture]]. This area is also one of the distinct physiography provinces of the larger Paraná-Paraguay Plain division. These plains contain unique wildlife because of the different terrains around it. Some of this wildlife includes the [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]], the [[badger]], and the [[prairie chicken]].

===Shrubland===
[[Shrubland]] is a [[plant community]] characterized by [[vegetation]] [[dominance (ecology)|dominated]] by [[shrub]]s, often also including [[grass]]es, [[Herbaceous plant|herb]]s, and [[geophyte]]s. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalengland.communisis.com/NaturalEnglandShop/product.aspx?ProductID=d427c618-201b-4871-8538-a18f07e26c01|title=Chapter 12 Scrub Management|publisher=Natural England}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire.  A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or [[browsing (predation)|browsing]].  Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term "shrubland" was first coined in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodland===
[[Woodland]] is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher densities and areas of trees, with largely closed canopy, provide extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forest.

===Savanna===
[[Savanna]] is a [[grassland]] [[ecosystem]] characterized by the trees being sufficiently small or widely spaced so that the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] does not close.  The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken [[herbaceous layer]] consisting primarily of [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] [[grass]]es.&lt;ref name="WernerIntro"&gt;{{cite book |year=1991 |title=Savanna Ecology and Management: Australian Perspectives and Intercontinental Comparisons |editor=Patricia A.

===Desert===
[[Desert]] is a [[landscape]] or [[region]] that receives an extremely low amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], defined as areas with an average annual precipitation of less than {{convert|250|mm|0}} per year,&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/what/ What is a desert?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/what/ What is a desert?], the 250 mm threshold definition is attributed to [[Peveril Meigs]].&lt;/ref&gt; or as areas where more water is lost by [[evapotranspiration]] than falls as precipitation.&lt;ref name="brittanica" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70815/desert | title = desert | accessdate = 2008-02-09 | work = Encyclopædia Britannica online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, deserts are classed as ''BWh'' (hot desert) or ''BWk'' (temperate desert). In the Thornthwaite climate classification system, deserts would be classified as arid [[megathermal]] climates.&lt;ref name=Fredlund1993&gt;{{cite book | author = Fredlund, D.G. |author2=Rahardjo, H. | year = 1993 | title = Soil Mechanics for Unsaturated Soils | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | url = http://www.soilvision.com/subdomains/unsaturatedsoil.com/Docs/chapter1UST.pdf | format = PDF | isbn = 978-0-471-85008-3 | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology.

===Tundra===
[[Tundra]] is a [[biome]] where the [[tree]] growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term ''tundra'' comes through Russian тундра from the [[Kildin Sami]] word ''tūndâr'' "uplands," "treeless mountain tract."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Scattered trees grow in some tundra. The [[ecotone]] (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the [[tree line]] or timberline.

==North American rangelands==
===Canada===
Rangeland is a prominent feature of rural [[Canada]]. A provincial jurisdiction, administration and policy regarding range use varies across the country. As in many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, public tenures on [[crown land]] for the purpose of range activities are common in geographically compatible areas. Reconciling the economic needs of ranchers and the need for environmental conservation is one of the primary themes in modern range discourse.

In western Canada, both grassland and forested range are significant.  In British Columbia, 70 percent of grassland range is privately owned and 60 percent of the total annual livestock forage requirement is provided by grazing on Crown rangeland (34 million hectares),  80 percent of which is forested range.&lt;ref&gt;British Columbia Ministry of Forest, Mines and Lands.  2010.  The state of British Columbia’s forests.  3rd Ed.  {{cite web |url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfp/sof/2010/SOF_2010_Web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804190014/https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfp/sof/2010/SOF_2010_Web.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grassland range predominates in much of the prairie provinces’ ranching area; however, forested range is particularly important in the boreal region.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Saskatchewan.

Certain rangelands are preserved as provincially-protected areas similar to parks, others are managed as community resources.  For example, in Alberta since 2003 there has been legislation allowing the creation of "Heritage Rangelands" within the parks system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Landals |first=Archie |title=Heritage Rangelands: A Bold Step to Preserve a Legacy |url=http://albertawilderness.ca/issues/wildlands/areas-of-concern/whaleback/archive/2003_AR_WH.pdf |publisher=Alberta Wilderness Association |year=2003 |accessdate=21 July 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 there were 2 heritage rangelands and 6 proposed future heritage rangelands run by [[Alberta Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertaparks.ca/albertaparksca/management-land-use/legislation-regulations.aspx#hr |title=Management &amp; Land-use - Legislation &amp; Regulations |publisher=Alberta Tourism Parks and Recreation |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 32 provincial [[grazing reserve]]s located throughout Alberta administered as public lands by [[Alberta Sustainable Resource Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Provincial Grazing Reserves |url=http://srd.alberta.ca/LandsForests/ProvincialGrazingReserves/Default.aspx |publisher=Alberta Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=22 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819112310/http://srd.alberta.ca/LandsForests/ProvincialGrazingReserves/Default.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government has administered several "Community Pastures" in Western Canada that were reclaimed lands suffering erosion during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1298388156452&amp;lang=eng |title=Community Pasture Program |publisher=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, it was announced that this federal involvement would be phased out over a six-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

===United States===
[[File:NAMAP.jpg|thumb|right|Rangelands of the United States]]
Of the land within the [[United States]] borders, 36% is considered rangeland.  The western side of the United States is 53% rangeland.&lt;ref name="UofIdaho -CNR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/what-is-range/Rangelands_Defined.htm |title=What is Range |publisher=Cnr.uidaho.edu |accessdate=2010-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718074840/http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/what-is-range/Rangelands_Defined.htm |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 399 million acres (1,610,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of rangeland are privately owned. The [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages about 167 million acres (676,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of publicly owned rangeland, with the [[United States Forest Service]] managing approximately 95 million acres (380,000&amp;nbsp;km²) more. [[Rancher]]s may lease portions of this public rangeland and pay a fee based on the number and type of livestock and the period for which they are on the land.

Historically much of the land in the western United States was used for grazing and much of some states still is. In many of those states, such as Arizona, an [[open-range law]] applies which requires a land owner to fence cattle out rather than in; thus cattle are theoretically allowed to roam free. In modern times open-range laws can conflict with urban development as occasional stray cows, bulls, or even herds wander into subdivisions or onto highways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/us/12cattle.html "Arizona Rethinking Open Range Laws"] article by Marc Lacey in ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 11, 2010.

=== Australia ===
&lt;!--reference "ESRM" supports most of this entire section, read it--&gt;
About 75% of Australia’s land mass is Rangeland.&lt;ref name="ESRM"/&gt; 53 of Australia's 85 bioregions have rangelands. In Western Australia, rangelands cover about 87% of the state’s 2.5 million square kilometres.&lt;ref name="ESRM"/&gt;  Australian Rangelands support significant parts of the nation's economy, including Australia's valuable mining industry ($12 billion/yr), tourism ($2 billion/yr), pastoralism ($5.5 billion/yr – cattle $4.4 billion &amp; sheep $1 billion).&lt;ref name="ESRM"/&gt; Australia's rangelands include a diverse group of relatively undisturbed ecosysterms such as; tropical savannas, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands and deserts.&lt;ref name="ESRM"/&gt; Rangelands in Australia cover low rainfall and variable climates which include; arid semi arid and seasonally high rainfall areas.&lt;ref name="ESRM"/&gt;

Australian rangelands are important in; biodiversity, income, social and cultural heritage, sub-artesian water sources and major river systems, clean and green food and fiber production, and carbon storage. Rangelands contain a wealth of biodiversity including a total of 1800 types of plants and 605 vertebrate animals currently identified.&lt;ref name="ESRM"/&gt; Rangelands are managed by Australia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) and the ESRM Programs on the local level &lt;ref name="ESRM"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091025062156/http://www.esrm.com.au/contents/wa-rangelands.htm?id=8 ESRM Australian Rangelands Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
Rangelands in South America are located in regions with climate ranging from arid to sub-humid.  Annual precipitation in these areas ranges from  approximately 150 to 1500&amp;nbsp;mm (6–60&amp;nbsp;inches).  Within South America, rangelands cover about 33% of the total land area.  South American rangelands include; grasslands, shrublands, savannas, and hot and cold deserts.  Rangelands in South America exclude hyperarid deserts.  Examples of the South American rangelands include the; Patagonian Steppe, the Monte, the Pampas, the "Lianos" or   "Cerrado," the "Chaco" and the "Caatinga."
The change in the intensity and location of tropical thunderstorms and other weather patterns is the driving force in the climates of southern South America.

=== Africa ===
In Kenya, rangelands make up for 85% of the land surface area, and are largely inhabited by nomadic pastoralists who are largely dependent on livestock. This movement often brings along an incursion of different diseases with the common one being the rinderpest virus in the Kenyan wildlife population from the Somali ecosystem.

=== Asia ===
In the past, rangelands in western China supported a pastoral economy and large wildlife populations.  Now the rangelands have shrunk due to population growth, economic, government, and social factors.  Rangeland types in China include; Semi-desert,  Dry Alpine Grasslands, Alpine Dwarf Shrub, Wetland types.

==Uses of rangeland==
Rangelands produce a wide variety of goods and services desired by society, including livestock forage ([[Grazing]]), wildlife habitat, [[Water resources|water]], [[mineral resources]], [[Wood processing|wood products]], [[Outdoor recreation|wildland recreation]], open space and natural beauty. The geographic extent and many important resources of rangelands make their proper use and management vitally important to people everywhere.&lt;ref name="UofIdaho -CNR"/&gt;

The '''Sierra Juárez and San Pedro Mártir pine-oak forests''' is an [[ecoregion]], in the [[Temperate coniferous forests]] [[biome]], that covers the higher elevations of the [[Sierra de Juárez|Sierra Juárez]] and [[Sierra San Pedro Mártir]] ranges, of the [[Peninsular Ranges]], in the northern [[Baja California Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; near the border with [[California]] ([[United States]]).

==Setting==
The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It lies at the southeastern extent of the [[Mediterranean climate]] region that covers much of California and the northwestern corner of [[Baja California]], and the climate is [[temperate]] with winter rains.

The pine-oak forests are bounded by the southern extent of the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] to the west, by the [[Baja California Desert]] to the southwest, and by the [[Sonoran Desert]] to the east.

==Flora==
These forests are predominantly [[pine]], [[juniper]], [[fir]], and [[oak]]. Ten pine species can be found in the ranges, including [[Lodgepole Pine|Tamarack Pine (''Pinus contorta'' subsp. ''murrayana'')]], [[Pinus lambertiana|Sugar Pine (''Pinus lambertiana'')]], [[Parry Pinyon|Parry Pinyon ''(Pinus quadrifolia)'']], along with [[Abies concolor|White Fir (''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana'')]], and [[Calocedrus|California Incense Cedar (''Calocedrus decurrens'')]]. Oak species include [[Quercus agrifolia|Coast Live Oak (''Quercus agrifolia'')]], [[Quercus engelmannii|Engelmann Oak (''Quercus engelmannii'')]], [[Quercus chrysolepis|Canyon Live Oak (''Quercus chrysolepis'')]], [[Quercus peninsularis|Baja Oak (''Quercus peninsularis'')]]., and [[Quercus tomentella|Island Oak (''Quercus tomentella'')]]. There are also several isolated strands of aspens ([[Populus tremuloides]]) on the higher altitudes.

[[Cupressus forbesii|Tecate Cypress (''Cupressus forbesii'')]] and [[Cupressus arizonica|San Pedro Martir Cypress (''Cupressus arizonica'' subsp. ''Montana'')]]  are found in scattered groves across the range. The Sierra Juárez and San Pedro Mártir pine-oak forests are near the southern limit of the distribution of the [[Washingtonia filifera|California Fan Palm (''Washingtonia filifera'')]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The higher portions of these Peninsular Ranges harbor many rare and [[Endemism|endemic]] species.

== What is Space for Life ? ==
{{Advert section|date=February 2017}}

The [[Montreal Biodome]], [[Insectarium]], [[Botanical Garden]] and [[Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium]] invite us to rethink the ties between human beings and nature, cultivating a new way of living. Together, the four prestigious institutions form a place where nature and science are honoured. They have positioned themselves as a Space for Life and are dedicated to sharing their vast heritage and knowledge with you.

Space for Life is a place that brings together the Montreal Biodome, Insectarium, Botanical Garden and Planetarium, but it is also much more. It’s a participatory movement and a commitment to biodiversity. It is a vast project based on citizen participation and co-creation with visitors. Just like nature belongs to everyone, it is everyone’s movement. It’s a state of mind, a way of experiencing nature. It is a space we visit where we can exchange, collaborate and learn.

=== The mission ===

Through its efforts in communication, conservation, education and research, Space for Life guides humans to better experience nature.

=== Space for Life is a place ===

The Space for Life comprises the Montreal Biodome,Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium. The institutions are interdependent, and designed to inspire visitors to adopt a new way of experiencing nature. They are connected by the Grande Place, a space that inspires new ways of coming together, enjoying the site, playing outside, building, interacting and experiencing everyday life.

Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada, one of the leading tourist sites in Montréal and all of Quebec and a place with immense potential to impress and thrill visitors through nature, explain nature and encourage behaviour that is respectful of nature.

=== Space for Life is a commitment ===

Space for Life is also committed to increasing awareness of our planet’s biodiversity and encouraging people to better protect it. In fact, our four institutions have created a sustainable development charter.

By offering visitors immersive experiences combining science and emotion, the Biodôme, Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Planetarium invite us all to look at nature differently.

We have a collective commitment to nature, but also a commitment to achievement, meaningfulness and mobilization.

=== Space for Life is a movement ===

With their participatory, unifying approach that is authentic, inventive, committed and open to the world, our four institutions have joined forces to create a movement, a Space for Life; a place where people come together to create, shaped by Montrealers and visitors from around the world.

Space for Life has initiated a movement that aims to help people better understand the concept of interdependence underlying biodiversity, become aware of the services provided by nature and gradually change the way they live. Our institutions invite you to join the movement, by taking an active part and spreading the message yourself.

The Space for Life is a collective initiative encouraging Montrealers and local stakeholders to become involved and make it their own.

'''A movement to get closer to nature'''
'''A participatory, creative, historic movement'''

=== Sustainable development at Space for Life ===
At Space for Life, our approach to sustainable development informs all our decisions and actions, encouraging us to consider the inextricable connections between society, ethics, the economy and the environment.

With this goal in mind, we are committed to integrating sustainable development principles in all our activities. This includes our charter of commitment and 11 areas of focus:

*Biodiversity;
*Natural and cultural heritage;
*Environmentally responsible practices;
*Waste management;
*Natural resource management;
*Sustainable transportation;
*Ecodesign;
*Information, awareness and education;
*Governance and the workplace;
*Economic activity;
*Social engagement.

==== Major project ====


Montréal Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada. By 2019, four major projects will have been developed, creating constantly evolving and changing spaces for life.

==== As Montreal's 375th anniversary approaches ====

The Insectarium Metamorphosis, the Biodôme Migration and two other major Space for Life projects are a legacy for Montrealers, for the planet and for future generations.

At a time when the issues the planet is facing, especially those related to the loss of biodiversity, raise the question of the relevance of our modern lifestyles, Space for Life, which is rooted in these unique institutions whose reputation and credibility are recognized both locally and internationally, has a fundamental role to play.

These two projects – characterized by their uniqueness, both in terms of architecture and design and the memorable and distinctive experiences they offer visitors – will let Space for Life truly play its role by inviting citizens to reconnect with nature and invent new ways of living. Reflecting a multidisciplinary vision wherein the architectural gesture emerges from a global creative approach, a bold architectural design will create living spaces that are permeable, ecological and evolving, while meeting the highest green building standards.

==== The Insectarium’s Metamorphosis ====

===== Winning Submission =====
Kuehn Malvezzi, Pelletier De Fontenay, Jodoin Lamarre Pratte, Dupras Ledoux and NCK

===== The project =====

'''A unique experience'''

The Insectarium will become a true biotope in which insects, plants and people can interact and take an interest in one another. In an architectural space that is both a landscape and an organism, the underground and closed spaces, water, shadow and daylight follow and play off one another along a route that plunges visitors into an immersive, sensory experience in the heart of the world of insects.

===== Technical Aspects =====

*Materials encouraging the greatest proximity with the insects (water, glass)
*New immersive space (butterfly house)
*Changes in architectural and museographic scale and perspective
*Individual experience spaces (face-to-face with insects)
*Museum functional spaces (laboratories, greenhouses, breeding facilities, offices)
*Transparent openings revealing the building’s ecological workings and the support processes for the live insects

==== Biodôme Migration ====

===== The design team =====

KANVA + NEUF architect(e)s, Bouthillette Parizeau + NCK

===== The project =====

'''A renewed experience, re-thinking the deeper meaning of the ecosystems.''' 

The Migration project will revamp the Biodôme and its scenic design, in most areas accessible to the public, to offer an innovative, participatory, immersive experience. The architects compare the Biodôme to a living organism and their concept echoes notions of cellular biology. The cell, the basic building block of life, becomes a model for structuring and shaping the building blocks of nature – ecosystems. The design team is proposing to reorganize the spaces, open up the centre of the Biodôme, and offer bold, complementary experiences.

The overall project budget is $22 million. This includes professional and project management fees, studies, construction costs, restoration, acquisition and relocation of live collections, museology, furniture, various contingencies, etc.

===== Technical Aspects =====
*A curved wall wraps around each ecosystem like a sensitive, delicate skin.
*A mezzanine with a lookout and new perspectives on all the ecosystems.
*The sub-Antarctic region will be expanded and the sub-Arctic region will become more immersive.
*The scenic design in some of the habitats will be redone, for a more immersive and moving visitor experience, appealing to the senses:
*Tropical Forest: larger numbers and more visible birds, fish and invertebrates
*Laurentian Maple Forest: visitors will be closer to the animals
*Gulf of St. Lawrence: reconfigured architecture and scenic design
*New welcoming and distinctive spaces where visitors can wander freely and intuitively.
*A grandiose main lobby, opened up and reconfigured to suit the scale of the building.

The '''sycamine tree''' ({{Lang-el|συκάμινος}} ''sykaminοs'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|suka/minos|συκάμινος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tree mentioned{{Refn|group=n|In the [[dative case]] form of the word, i.e. {{lang|grc|συκαμίνῳ}} ''sykaminōi''.}} in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 17:6 of the [[Bible]]. It is rendered by Luther as "[[mulberry]] tree", which is most probably the correct rendering. It is found in two species, the [[Black Mulberry|black mulberry]] (''Morus nigra'') and the [[White Mulberry|white mulberry]] (''Morus alba''), which are common in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].  It is in the same [[family (biology)|family]] as the [[ficus|fig]]-tree. Some contend, however, that this name denotes the [[sycamore fig]] ({{lang|grc|συκομορέα}} ''sykomorea'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|sukomore/a|συκoμορέα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of Luke 19:4.

A '''vacuum flask''' (also known as a '''Dewar flask''', '''Dewar bottle''' or '''thermos''') is an [[thermal insulation|insulating]] storage vessel that greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than the flask's surroundings. Invented by [[Sir James Dewar]] in 1892, the vacuum flask consists of two [[wiktionary:Flask|flask]]s, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a near-[[vacuum]] which significantly reduces heat transfer by [[heat conduction|conduction]] or [[convection]].

Vacuum flasks are used domestically to keep [[beverage]]s hot or cold for extended periods of time and for many purposes in industry.

== History ==
[[File:Gustav R. Paalen, Double Welled Vessel 1909.png|thumb|Gustav Robert Paalen, Double Walled Vessel, 1. Patent June 27, 1908, published July 13th 1909]]
The vacuum flask was designed and invented by Scottish scientist [[James Dewar|Sir James Dewar]] in 1892 as a result of his research in the field of [[cryogenics]] and is sometimes called a Dewar flask in his honour. While performing experiments in determining the [[specific heat]] of the element [[palladium]], Dewar made a brass chamber that he enclosed in another chamber to keep the palladium at its desired temperature.&lt;ref name=Soulen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soulen|first=Robert|title=James Dewar, His Flask and Other Achievements |journal=Physics Today|volume=49|number=3|date=March 1996|pages=32–37|doi=10.1063/1.881490
|bibcode = 1996PhT....49c..32S }}&lt;/ref&gt; He evacuated the air between the two chambers, creating a partial vacuum to keep the temperature of the contents stable. Through the need for this insulated container James Dewar created the vacuum flask, which became a significant tool for chemical experiments and also became a common household item. The flask was later developed using new materials such as [[glass]] and [[aluminum]]; however, Dewar refused to patent his invention.&lt;ref name=Soulen/&gt;

Dewar's design was quickly transformed into a commercial item in 1904 as two German glassblowers, Reinhold Burger and Albert Aschenbrenner, discovered that it could be used to keep cold drinks cold and warm drinks warm.&lt;ref name=Thermos&gt;{{cite web  |publisher=Thermos, LLC  |title=Our History

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dewar flask design had never been patented but the German men who discovered the commercial use for the product renamed it "[[Thermos L.L.C.|Thermos]]," and subsequently claimed both the rights to the commercial product and the trademark to the name. In his subsequent attempt to claim the rights to the invention, Dewar instead lost a court case to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Co-Di/Dewar-James.html |title=Dewar, James - BRITISH CHEMIST AND PHYSICIST  |author=Frank A. J. L. James  |date= |work= |publisher= Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing and performance of the Thermos bottle was significantly improved and refined by the Viennese inventor and merchant Gustav Robert Paalen, who designed various types for domestic use, which he also patented, and distributed widely, through his Thermos Bottle Companies in the United States and Canada. The name later became a [[generic trademark|genericized trademark]] after the term "thermos" became the household name for such a liquid container.&lt;ref name=Thermos/&gt; The vacuum flask went on to be used for many different types of scientific experiments and the commercial “Thermos” was transformed into a common item. "Thermos" remains a [[registered trademark]] in some countries, but it was declared a genericized trademark by court action in the United States in 1963, since it had become colloquially synonymous with vacuum flasks in general. However, there are other vacuum flasks.

After the German glassblowers determined the commercial uses for the Dewar flask, the technology was sold to the Thermos company, who used it to mass-produce vacuum flasks for at-home use.&lt;ref name=Thermos/&gt; Over time, the company expanded the size, shapes and materials of these consumer products, primarily used for carrying [[coffee]] on the go and carrying liquids on camping trips to keep them either hot or cold.  Eventually other manufacturers produced similar products for consumer use.

== Design ==

The vacuum flask consists of two vessels, one placed within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two vessels is partially evacuated of air, creating a partial-[[vacuum]] which reduces heat [[heat conduction|conduction]] or [[convection]]. Heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]] may be minimized by [[silvering]] flask surfaces facing the gap but can become problematic if the flask's contents or surroundings are very hot; hence vacuum flasks usually hold contents below the boiling point of water. Most heat transfer occurs through the neck and opening of the flask, where there is no vacuum. Vacuum flasks are usually made of [[metal]], [[borosilicate glass]], [[foam]] or [[plastic]] and have their opening [[bung|stoppered]] with [[cork (material)|cork]] or polyethylene plastic. Vacuum flasks are often used as [[insulated shipping container]]s.

Extremely large or long vacuum flasks sometimes cannot fully support the inner flask from the neck alone, so additional support is provided by ''spacers'' between the interior and exterior shell. These spacers act as a thermal bridge and partially reduce the insulating properties of the flask around the area where the spacer contacts the interior surface.

Several technological applications, such as [[NMR]] and [[MRI]] machines, rely on the use of double vacuum flasks. These flasks have two vacuum sections. The inner flask contains liquid [[helium]] and the outer flask contains liquid nitrogen, with one vacuum section in between. The loss of precious helium is limited in this way.

Other improvements to the vacuum flask include the ''vapour-cooled radiation shield'' and the ''vapour-cooled neck'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryogenicsociety.org/resources/cryo_central/history_of_cryogenics/ |title=History of Cryogenics: A Cryo Central resource from the CSA |publisher=Cryogenicsociety.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which help to reduce evaporation from the flask.

== Research and industry ==
{{see also|Cryogenic storage dewar}}

In laboratories and industry, vacuum flasks are often used to hold liquefied gases (often LN2) for flash freezing, sample preparation and other processes where maintaining an extreme low temperature is desired.  Larger vacuum flasks store liquids that become gaseous at well below ambient temperature, such as [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]; in this case the leakage of heat into the extremely cold interior of the bottle results in a slow boiling-off of the liquid so that a narrow unstoppered opening, or a stoppered opening protected by a [[pressure relief valve]], is necessary to prevent [[pressure]] from building up and eventually shattering the flask. The insulation of the vacuum flask results in a very slow "boil" and thus the contents remain liquid for long periods without [[refrigeration]] equipment.

Vacuum flasks have been used to house [[Weston cell|standard cell]]s and ovenized [[Zener diode]]s, along with their printed circuit board, in precision voltage-regulating devices used as electrical standards. The flask helped with controlling the Zener temperature over a long time span and was used to reduce variations of the output voltage of the Zener standard owing to temperature fluctuation to within a few parts per million.

One notable use was by Guildline Instruments, of Canada, in their Transvolt, model 9154B, saturated standard cell, which is an electrical voltage standard. Here a silvered vacuum flask was encased in foam insulation and, using a large glass vacuum plug, held the saturated cell. The output of the device was 1.018 volts and was held to within a few parts per million.

The principle of the vacuum flask makes it ideal for storing certain types of rocket fuel, and [[NASA]] used it extensively in the propellant tanks of the Saturn launch vehicles in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Cortright, Edgar. "Apollo Expeditions to the Moon." Official NASA publications. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and shape of the Dewar flask was used as a model for [[optical]] experiments based on the idea that the shape of the two compartments with the space in between is similar to the way the light hits the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haynes | first1 = John | last2 = Scott | first2 = Jesse | year = 1948 | title = A Method for Silvering a Dewar Flask for Optical Experiments | url = | journal = Science | volume = 107 | issue = 2777| page = 301 | doi=10.1126/science.107.2777.301| bibcode = 1948Sci...107..301H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vacuum flask has also been part of experiments using it as the capacitor of different chemicals in order to keep them at a consistent temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elliot | first1 = Willard | year = 1970 | title = A Spectrophotometric Dewar Flask with Integral Light Shield | url = | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 276–279 | doi=10.2307/4593845| pmc = 2031665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial Dewar flask is the base for a device used to passively insulate medical shipments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/06/how-to-design-a-life-saving-device|title=This Revolutionary Cooler Could Save Millions of Lives|date=18 June 2013|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/gates-backed-device-extends-cold-chain-rural-areas/2013-07-18|title=Gates-backed device extends cold chain to rural areas|work=FierceVaccines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most vaccines are sensitive to heat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frequent exposure to suboptimal temperatures in vaccine cold-chain system in India: results of temperature monitoring in 10 states| pmc=3845272 | pmid=24347729|doi=10.2471/BLT.13.119974|volume=91|year=2013|pages=906–13 | last1 = Murhekar | first1 = MV | last2 = Dutta | first2 = S | last3 = Kapoor | first3 = AN | last4 = Bitragunta | first4 = S | last5 = Dodum | first5 = R | last6 = Ghosh | first6 = P | last7 = Swamy | first7 = KK | last8 = Mukhopadhyay | first8 = K | last9 = Ningombam | first9 = S | last10 = Parmar | first10 = K | last11 = Ravishankar | first11 = D | last12 = Singh | first12 = B | last13 = Singh | first13 = V | last14 = Sisodiya | first14 = R | last15 = Subramanian | first15 = R | last16 = Takum | first16 = T | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the Cold-Chain for Oral Polio Vaccine in a Rural District of India| pmc=1802111 | pmid=17236617|volume=122|year=2007|pages=112–21 | last1 = Samant | first1 = Y | last2 = Lanjewar | first2 = H | last3 = Parker | first3 = D | last4 = Block | first4 = L | last5 = Tomar | first5 = GS | last6 = Stein | first6 = B | doi=10.1177/003335490712200116 | journal=Public Health Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and require a [[cold chain]] system to keep them at stable, near freezing temperatures.

== Safety ==

Vacuum flasks are at risk of  [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] hazard, and glass vessels under vacuum, in particular, may shatter unexpectedly.  Chips, scratches or cracks can be a starting point for dangerous vessel failure, especially when the vessel temperature changes rapidly (when hot or cold liquid is added). Proper preparation of the Dewar vacuum flask by tempering prior to use is advised to maintain and optimize the functioning of the unit. Glass vacuum flasks are usually fitted into a metal base with the cylinder contained in or coated with mesh, aluminum or plastic to aid in handling, protect it from physical damage, and contain fragments should they break.{{Cn|date=November 2018}}

In addition, cryogenic storage dewars are usually pressurized, and they may explode if [[pressure relief valve]]s are not used.

== Thermodynamics ==
{{Technical|section|date=February 2017}}
The rate of heat (energy) loss through a vacuum flask can be analyzed thermodynamically, starting from the second TdS relation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecourses.ou.edu/cgi-bin/ebook.cgi?doc=&amp;topic=th&amp;chap_sec=06.2&amp;page=theory |title=Thermodynamics eBook: TdS Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TdS = dH - VdP&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{surr} \Delta S = mc_p \delta T - Vdp&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming constant pressure throughout the process,

&lt;math&gt;T_{surr} \Delta S = c_p \left ( T_{b'} - T_c \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging the equation in terms of the temperature of the outside surface of the vacuum flask's inner wall,

&lt;math&gt;T_{b'} = T_c + \frac{T_{surr} \Delta S}{c_p}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

* ''T&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the surrounding air
* ''∆S'' is the change in specific entropy of stainless steel
* ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the specific heat capacity of stainless steel
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the liquid contained within the flask
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;b'&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the outside surface of the vacuum flask's inner wall

Now consider the general expression for heat loss due to radiation:

&lt;math&gt;Q'_0  = A \epsilon \sigma \left ( T^4 -T_0^4 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the vacuum flask,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_0  = A_{in} \epsilon _{s.s.} \sigma \left ( T_{b'}^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting our earlier expression for T&lt;sub&gt;b'&lt;/sub&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_0 = A_{in} \epsilon _{s.s.} \sigma \left [ \left ( T_c + \frac{T_{surr} \Delta S}{c_p} \right )^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rate of heat transfer by radiation through the vacuum portion of the flask
* ''A&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the surface area of the outside of the inner wall of the flask
* ''ε&lt;sub&gt;s.s.&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the emissivity of stainless steel
* ''σ'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]

Assuming that the outer surface of the inner wall and the inner surface of the outer wall of the vacuum flask are coated with polished silver to minimize heat loss due to radiation, we can say that the rate of heat absorption by the inner surface of the outer wall is equal to the absorptivity of polished silver times the heat radiated by the outer surface of the inner wall,

&lt;math&gt;\alpha Q'_0 = Q'_{in}&lt;/math&gt;

In order for energy balance to be maintained, the heat lost through the outer surface of the outer wall must be equal to the heat absorbed by the inner surface of the outer wall,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{in} = Q'_{out}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the absorptivity of polished silver is the same as its emissivity, we can write

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{out} = \epsilon _{s.s.} Q'_0&lt;/math&gt;

We must also consider the rate of heat loss through the lid of the vacuum flask (assuming it is made of polypropylene, a common plastic) where there is no vacuum inside the material. In this area, the three heat transfer modes of conduction, convection, and radiation are present. Therefore, the rate of heat loss through the lid is,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{lid} = Q'_{cond} + Q'_{conv} + Q'_{rad}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{lid} = kA_{lid} \left ( \frac{T_b - T_{surr}}{\Delta x} \right ) + hA_{lid} \left (T_b - T_{surr} \right ) + A_{lid} \epsilon _{p.p.} \sigma \left [ \left (T_c + \frac {T_{surr} \Delta S_{p.p.}}{c_p^{p.p.}} \right )^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''k'' is the thermal conductivity of air
* ''h'' is the convective heat transfer coefficient of free air
* ''ε&lt;sub&gt;p.p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the emissivity of polypropylene
* ''A&lt;sub&gt;lid&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the outer surface area of the lid
* ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.p.&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the specific heat capacity of polypropylene
* ''∆S&lt;sub&gt;p.p.&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the specific entropy of polypropylene
* ''∆x'' is the distance over which conduction across the temperature gradient takes place

Now we have an expression for the total rate of heat loss, which is the sum of the rate of heat loss through the walls of the vacuum flask and the rate of heat loss through the lid,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{total} = Q'_{out} + Q'_{lid}&lt;/math&gt;

where we substitute each of the expressions for each component into the equation.

The rate of entropy generation of this process can also be calculated, starting from entropy balance:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{system} = S_{in} - S_{out} + S_{gen}&lt;/math&gt;

Written in rate form,

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S'_{system} = S'_{in} - S'_{out} + S'_{gen}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a steady-state process,

&lt;math&gt;- \int \frac{dQ'}{T_{surr}} + S'_{gen} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S'_{gen} = \frac{Q'_2 - Q'_1}{T_{surr}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no heat added to the system,

&lt;math&gt;S'_{gen} = \frac{Q'_{total}}{T_{surr}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''{{lang|nci|Xōchipilli|italic=no}}''' {{IPA-nah|ʃu˕ːt͡ʃiˈpiɬːi|}} is the god of art, games, beauty, dance, flowers, and song in [[Aztec mythology]]. His name contains the [[Nahuatl]] words {{wikt-lang|nci|xōchitl}} ("flower") and {{wikt-lang|nci|pilli}} (either "prince" or "child"), and hence means "flower prince". As the patron of writing and painting, he was called '''{{lang|nci|Chicomexōchitl|italic=no}}''' the "Seven-flower," but he could also be referred to as '''{{lang|nci|Macuilxōchitl|italic=no}}''' "Five-flower." His wife is the human girl {{lang|nci|[[Mayahuel]]|italic=no}},{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and his twin sister is {{lang|nci|[[Xōchiquetzal]]|italic=no}}. As one of the gods responsible for [[list of fertility gods|fertility]] and agricultural produce, he is also associated with {{lang|nci|[[Tlāloc]]|italic=no}} (god of rain), and {{lang|nci|[[Centeōtl]]|italic=no}} (god of maize).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} {{lang|nci|Xōchipilli|italic=no}} may correspond to the [[Tonsured Maize God]] among the Classic Mayas.

{{lang|nci|Xōchipilli|italic=no}} is also the patron of both [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[male prostitution|male prostitutes]], a role possibly resulting from his being absorbed from the [[Toltec]] civilization.&lt;!--Cites blanked pending confirmation and page number &lt;ref name = "Castillo"&gt; Diaz del Castillo, Bernal.

==Xochipilli statue==
[[File:Statue of Xochipilli (From the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City).jpg|thumb|Statue of Xochipilli (From the [[National Museum of Anthropology]], Mexico City)]]
In the mid-19th century, a 16th-century {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Aztec statue of Xochipilli was unearthed on the side of the volcano [[Popocatépetl]] near [[Tlalmanalco]]. The statue is of a single figure seated upon a temple-like base. Both the statue and the base upon which it sits are covered in carvings of sacred and [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] organisms including mushrooms (''[[Psilocybe aztecorum]]''), [[tobacco]] (''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]''), ''Ololiúqui'' (''[[Turbina corymbosa]]''), ''sinicuichi'' (''[[Heimia salicifolia]]''), possibly ''cacahuaxochitl'' (''[[Quararibea funebris]]''), and one unidentified flower. 


"The texts always use the flower in an entirely spiritual sense, and the aim of the religious colleges was to cause the flower of the body to bloom: This flower can be no other than the soul. The association
of the flower with the sun is also evident. One of the hieroglyphs for the sun is a four-petalled flower, and the feasts of the ninth month, dedicated to Huitzilopochtliupo, were entirely given over to flower offerings."

- Paul Pettennude, Ph.D.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;!--Title of book or article, place of publication, and page citation if appropriate.--&gt;

The figure himself sits on the base, head tilted up, eyes open, jaw tensed, with his mouth half open and his arms opened to the heavens. The statue is currently housed in the Aztec hall of the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]] in [[Mexico City]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the popular reality television show, ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', a statue of Xochipilli was used as the Immunity Idol for the [[Survivor: San Juan del Sur]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Entheogen connection===
[[Image:Lombards Museum 163.jpg|thumb|Xochipilli, Aztec terracotta&lt;br /&gt; ''Lombards Museum'']]

It has been suggested by [[Robert Gordon Wasson|Wasson]],&lt;ref name="Wasson1980p58"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasson |first=Robert Gordon |date=1980 |title=The Wondrous Mushroom: Mycolatry in Mesoamerica |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=58 |isbn=978-0-07-068443-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Evans Schultes|Schultes]],{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}} and [[Albert Hofmann|Hofmann]]{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}} that the statue of Xochipilli represents a figure in the throes of [[entheogen]]ic ecstasy. The position and expression of the body, in combination with the very clear representations of [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] [[List of psychedelic plants|plants]] which are known to have been used in sacred contexts by the Aztec support this interpretation.

Wasson says that in the statue's depiction Xochipilli "is absorbed by ''temicxoch'', 'dream flowers', as the Nahua say describing the awesome experience that follows the ingestion of an entheogen. I can think of nothing like it in the long and rich history of European art: Xochipilli absorbed in ''temicxoch''."&lt;ref name="Wasson1980p58"/&gt;
