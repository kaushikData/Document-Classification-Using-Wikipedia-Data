      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2773">'''Ahistoricism''' refers to a lack of concern for history, historical development, or tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ahistoricism|title=ahistoricism|publisher=Mirriam-Webster Dictionary Online|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges of ahistoricism are frequently critical, implying that the subject is historically inaccurate or ignorant (for example, an ''ahistorical'' attitude).  It can also describe a person's failure to frame an argument or issue in a historical context or to disregard historical fact or implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pepper|first=David|title=Eco-socialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|pages=143–144|isbn=978-0-415-09719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of that would be films including [[dinosaur]]s and prehistoric human beings living side by side, but they were, in reality, millions of years apart.

The term can also describe a view that history has no relevance or importance in the decision making of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defineonline.com/Definition.aspx?Word=ahistoricism |title=ahistoricism |publisher=Define Online |accessdate=2008-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some academic contexts, ahistoricism is the accepted norm. For example, the [[history of science]] is generally considered a discipline that is quite separate and not directly important to research science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gooday|first=Graeme|title=Does Science Education Need the History of Science?|url=http://lynch.faculty.asu.edu/pub/reprints/gooday2008.pdf|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|publisher=[[History of Science Society]]|year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, some criticism has arisen because "the dominant school of philosophy in the English speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]]... has been trenchantly ahistorical, and indeed anti-historical". However, few view that to be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akehursta|first=Thomas|title=Writing history for the ahistorical: Analytic philosophy and its past|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2008.09.002|publisher=History of European Ideas|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Who is Thomas Akehursta (the author in the citation) and why is his opinion on this subject relevant?|date=February 2016}}

A more abstract definition of ahistoricism is simply independence from time: removed from history.
An example is the idea that some concepts are not governed by what is learned or has happened, but they come from an ahistoric power that is independent of what has gone before.

In 2007 a ''Festschrift'' edited by Hagit Amirav and Bas ter Haar Romeny, ''From Rome to Constantinople: Studies in Honour of Averil Cameron'' (Leuven: Peeters), was published in Cameron's honour.

==Work==
Cameron's early articles explored early Byzantine and early Medieval Latin writers such as Corippus, Procopius, and Gregory of Tours from literary and historical perspectives. Her early monographs, ''Agathias'' (1970) and ''Procopius and the Sixth Century'' (1985) were accompanied by a number of influential edited collections, including ''Images of Women in Antiquity'', edited jointly with Amélie Kuhrt (1983), and ''History as Text'' (1989). With ''Christianity and the Rhetoric of Empire: The Development of Christian Discourse'' (1990), Cameron sparked a scholarly conversation about 'the power of discourse in society' in later antiquity, seeking to understand 'how Christianity was able to develop a "totalizing discourse" ' (the phrase itself is borrowed from the work of [[Michel Foucault]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=R. A.|title=Review of Christianity and the Rhetoric of Empire. The Development of Christian Discourse. (Sather Classical Lectures, 55.)|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=1992|volume=43|issue=2|pages=702, 701–705 |doi=10.2307/23963957|jstor=23963957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron's mature scholarship has included substantial surveys such as ''The Later Roman Empire, AD 284-430'' (1993) and significant editorial commissions, including joint editorship of volumes 12, 13, and 14 of the ''[[Cambridge Ancient History]]'' (second edition) along with a number of influential studies on dialogue and debate in Byzantium from the early Christian period to the twelfth century.

The '''British Archaeological Association''' (BAA) was founded in 1843 and aims to inspire, support and disseminate high quality research in the fields of Western [[archaeology]], [[art]] and [[architecture]], primarily of the mediæval period, through lectures, conferences, study days and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Journal of the British Archaeological Association|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/journal/journal-british-archaeological-association|journal=Maney Publishing|volume=|pages=|via=www.history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BAA was founded in December 1843 by [[Charles Roach Smith]], [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]] and [[Thomas Joseph Pettigrew]], to encourage the recording, preservation, and publication of archaeological discoveries, and to lobby for government assistance for the collection of British antiquities. All three men were Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] but felt the older body was too aristocratic, too London-focused and lacked the campaigning vigour required. The naming of the new body was symbolic: British referred to the campaign for a museum of British Antiquities, Archaeological differentiated their field from older antiquarian methods and Association had reformist, even revolutionary, overtones. Smith became its first secretary and arranged the first six annual congresses. Although he remained one of the secretaries until 1851, he had effectively resigned the post in 1849.

One of the aims of the association was to promote dialogue between self-identified experts and local archaeologists, to be achieved through the organization of an annual congress, along the model of the French Congres Archaeologique or the annual meetings of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. The first meeting was held in [[Canterbury]] in 1844. The site, with its magnificent cathedral, had obvious appeal and was close to the seat of the association’s first president, Lord [[Albert Conyngham]] (1805-1860).  The Canterbury Congress occasioned the dispute which led to a split and the formation of the [[Royal Archaeological Institute|Archæological Institute]] (AI). The public reason for the feud was the publication by Thomas Wright of ''The Archæological Album, or, Museum of National Antiquities'' (1845), a commercial publication from which Wright drew profit. This infuriated Oxford publisher John Henry Parker, who was to have been the publisher of the official proceedings. Behind the scenes, however, the dispute had other dimensions, both social (all the founders of the BAA were 'trade', the seceding members of the AI considered themselves to be socially superior) and religious (the ''[[Oxford Chronicle]]'' of 16 August 1845 suggested that the dispute had acquired [[Tractarian]]/anti-Tractarian overtones).

The nineteenth-century passion for archaeology meant that both the BAA and the AI (later the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]) flourished, although the earlier society retained the reputation for enthusiasm rather than elegance. In 1905, however, the BAA had reached a low ebb. The congress, held in Bath, made no money, the journal was delayed and many members were in arrears. The custom had emerged of electing as President a dignitary from the locality in which the next Congress was to take place.  In 1905, the mayor of Reading was elected, to preside over a Congress in the same town.  However, by the time the Congress took place, local landowner and former High Sheriff of Berkshire, [[Charles Edward Keyser]], had become President. Keyser remained resident until his death in 1929.

The annual conference was revived in 1975, with the first of the new series being held in [[Worcester]]. Since then, the association has held an annual conference at a centre of established importance in the mediæval period, usually in the British Isles and occasionally in mainland Europe, collating the results of recent research on major cathedrals, minsters and abbeys and including visits to places of relevant interest. The conference proceedings are published as the ''British Archaeological Association Conference Transactions''.

The association's annual publication is '''''The Journal of the British Archaeological Association'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/baa/publications.html|title=Annual journal|publisher=British Archaeological Association (www.britarch.ac.uk/baa)|accessdate=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Thomasius''' (1 January 1655 – 23 September 1728) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist and philosopher.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Leipzig]] and was educated by his father, [[Jakob Thomasius]] (1622–1684), at that time head master of [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig]].  Through his father's lectures, Christian came under the influence of the [[political philosophy]] of [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]], and continued the study of law at the [[University of Frankfurt (Oder)]] in 1675, completing his doctorate in 1679. In 1680, he married Anna Christine Heyland and started a legal practice in Leipzig; the following year he began teaching at the university’s law school as well. In 1684 he became professor of natural law, soon attracting attention by his abilities, and particularly by his attack on traditional prejudices, in [[theology]] and [[jurisprudence]]. In 1685 he published a provocative dissertation, ''De crimine bigamiae'' (The crime of bigamy), in which he argued that [[bigamy]] is permissible under [[natural law]].

In 1687 he made the daring innovation of lecturing in [[German language|German]] instead of [[Latin]] and gave a lecture on the topic "How One Should Emulate the French Way of Life," referring to the French use of their native language not only in everyday life but in scholarship as well; according to scholar Klaus Luig, this event marks the real beginning of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Germany. In the following year he began publishing a monthly periodical (''Scherzhafte und ernsthafte, vernüftige'' [sic] ''und einfältige Gedanken über allerhand lustige und nutzliche Bücher und Fragen'') in which he ridiculed the pedantic weaknesses of the learned, taking the side of the [[Pietists]] in their controversy with the [[Lutheran orthodoxy|orthodox]], and defending mixed marriages of [[Martin Luther|Luther]]ans and [[John Calvin|Calvin]]ists; he also published a volume on natural law which emphasized natural reason and a paper defending marriage between Lutherans and members of the Reformed church.

In consequence of these and other views, on 10 May 1690 he was denounced from the pulpits, forbidden to lecture or to write, and his arrest was ordered. He escaped by going to Berlin, and the elector [[Friedrich I of Prussia|Frederick III]] offered him a refuge in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], with a salary of 500 [[thaler]] and permission to lecture. He helped found the [[University of Halle]] (1694), where he became second and then first professor of law and (in 1710) rector of the university. He was one of the most esteemed university teachers and influential writers of his day, and in 1709 he was appointed to the privy council.

Though not a profound philosophical thinker, Thomasius prepared the way for great reforms in philosophy, as well as in law, literature, social life and theology. It was his mission to introduce a rational, common-sense point of view, and to bring the divine and human sciences to bear on the everyday world. He thus created an epoch in [[German literature]], philosophy and law, and, along with [[Ludwig Timotheus Spittler|Spittler]], began the modern period of ecclesiastical history. One of the aims of his life was to free politics and jurisprudence from the control of theology. He fought bravely and consistently for freedom of thought and speech on religious matters and mediated between the academic and the public sphere. In this regard, he shared much in common with his disciple [[Gabriel Wagner]], who subsequently objected to Thomasius' religious metaphysical beliefs.&lt;ref name=israel06&gt;Israel (2006), pp. 173–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In law, he tried to prove that the rules of [[Roman law]], which contradicted his own principles of [[natural law]], had never actually been accepted and were therefore invalid; he also tried to legitimize his own principles by showing them to be common law built on Germanic foundations. In this way he contributed to the creation of scholarship of private law separate from that of Roman law.

Thomasius is often spoken of in German works as the author of the "territorial system," or [[Erastianism|Erastian]] theory of ecclesiastical government; but he taught that the state may interfere with legal or public duties only, and not with moral or private ones. He would not have even [[atheism|atheists]] punished, though they should be expelled from the country, and he came forward as an earnest opponent of the prosecution of [[witch]]es and of the use of [[torture]]. In theology he was not a naturalist or a [[deism|deist]], but a believer in the necessity of revealed religion for salvation. He came strongly under the influence of the [[pietists]], particularly of [[Philipp Jakob Spener|Spener]], and there was a mystic vein in his thought; but other elements of his nature were too powerful to allow him to attach himself wholly to that party.

He died in Halle in 1728.

Thomasius's most popular and influential German publications were his periodical already referred to (1688–1689); ''Einleitung zur Vernunftlehre'' (1691, 5th ed. 1719); ''Vernünflige Gedanken über allerhand auserlesene und juristische Handel'' (1720–1721); ''Historie der Weisheit und Torheit'' (3 vols., 1693); ''Kurze Lehrsätze van dem Laster der Zauberei mit dem Hexenprozess'' (1704); ''Weitere Erläuterungen der neueren Wissenschaft anderer Gedanken kennen zu lernen'' (1711). He expressed his pedagogical principles in two main Latin works, ''Institutiones iurisprudentiae divinae'' (Institutes of Divine Jurisprudence, 1688), based on a lecture on [[Samuel Pufendorf|Pufendorf]]’s natural law, and ''Fundamenta juris naturae et gentium'' (Foundations of the Law of Nature and Nations, 1705).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12182">The '''Council for British Archaeology''' ('''CBA''') was established in 1944 and is an educational charity working throughout the [[United Kingdom]] to involve people in archaeology and to promote the appreciation and care of the historic environment for the benefit of present and future generations. It achieves this by promoting research, conservation and education, and by widening access to archaeology through effective communication and participation.

==History and objectives==
The origins of the CBA lie in the '''Congress of Archaeological Societies''', founded in 1898, but it was in 1943, with the tide of war turning, that archaeologists in Britain began to contemplate the magnitude of tasks and opportunities that would confront them at the end of hostilities. In London alone more than 50 acre of the City lay in ruins awaiting redevelopment, while the historic centres of Bristol, Canterbury, Exeter, Southampton, and many other towns had suffered devastation. In response to a resolution from the Oxford Meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, Sir [[Alfred Clapham]], then President of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], called a meeting of the Congress of Archaeological Societies "to discuss the requirements of archaeology in the post-war period".{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} As a result, it was agreed to form a Council for British Archaeology to promote, both collectively and through its members, British archaeology in all its aspects.

The new Council defined one of its objectives as the "safeguarding of all kinds of archaeological material and the strengthening of existing measures for the care of ancient and historic buildings, monuments, and antiquities".{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Following its first meeting in March 1944 under Clapham's Presidency (he was succeeded later that year by Sir [[Cyril Fox]]), the Council initiated local excavation committees in a number of war-damaged towns, began to seek information about reconstruction projects, and set its Regional Groups the task of watching sites of all kinds. The '''Congress of Archaeological Societies''' was quickly wound up, and one of the tasks that the CBA inherited from it was the drawing up of a Survey and Policy for Field Research, which was seen as fundamental to an integrated approach to the exploration of Britain's heritage. This monumental task was undertaken by [[Christopher Hawkes]] and [[Stuart Piggott]] (both subsequently CBA Presidents) and the first volume appeared in 1948. The CBA also recognised the need for adequate bibliographical backup for British archaeology, and the first volume of its regular ''Archaeological Bulletin'' (later renamed the ''Archaeological Bibliography'',) and now the online [http://www.biab.ac.uk/ British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography] first appeared in 1949.

Within five years the CBA had established the direction of its programme and key roles. It provides a forum and acts as a facilitator for opinion, ideas and policy development in British archaeology, connecting government, the media, and the public. It champions archaeology at all levels in education. It promotes and supports research, in the professional and voluntary sectors alike, with the essential services of its bibliographic information, digital resources, and publications. Today British archaeology is served by scores of specialist and thematic societies and groups. This busy scene did not exist in the early 1950s, when the Council set up six period-based Research Committees, spanning the whole of Britain's past from the Palaeolithic to the post-medieval period which, along with the Natural Sciences Panel (set up as early as 1945) had the remit of coordinating earlier initiatives, providing guidance where required, and establishing new projects on a national basis. In 1959 the CBA set up the first Industrial Archaeology Committee in the world. In 1965, the CBA's response to the [[Colin Buchanan (town planner)|Buchanan]] report ''[[Traffic in Towns]]'' introduced the concept of historic urban areas, as opposed to individual buildings or sites. Further CBA specialist Committees were established throughout the 1960s to 1980s. Further information on their many and varied remits, and the organisations which they then became, can be found [http://new.archaeologyuk.org/about-us/ here].

Today the CBA's work is focused on three strategic areas: participation, discovery and advocacy which bring together its wide-ranging activities in education, research, publication, and information provision. More recently the CBA has adopted "archaeology for all" as its focus,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} concentrating on increasing opportunities for participation and learning through archaeology and the care of the historic environment. They work in partnership with many other heritage and environmental bodies and with educational and research institutions across the UK.

As one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], the Council is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[Listed Building|listed buildings]], and by law must be notified of any applications in England and Wales to demolish in whole or part any listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Until 1993, ''[http://new.archaeologyuk.org/become-a-cba-member/ membership]'' of the CBA was limited to societies and organisations. Today there are over 600 institutional members, which range from village archaeological groups to museums, county societies, universities, commercial archaeological units and national bodies. Individual membership has climbed steadily since its introduction in 1993, and now exceeds 6,000. Through the eleven English Regional Groups, CBA Wales/Cymru and the Council for Scottish Archaeology (all of which have individual membership), the CBA provides a unique forum for the British archaeological community, and the public beyond.

Members of the CBA help to ensure they have the resources to develop their work in education, conservation and providing information, and strengthen the profile of archaeology in the minds of decision-makers. Members receive:

* Six issues of the CBA's flagship magazine ''British Archaeology'', including ''CBA Briefing'', with lists of projects and events
* Three issues a year of the ''CBA Newsletter'', with news of the latest CBA projects and initiatives
* Membership of a CBA English regional group with access to local meetings, newsletters, activities and publications; or membership of national groups in Scotland or Wales for a small additional fee
* An annual 16pp booklet featuring all [[Festival of British Archaeology]] events (see below)
* Discounts on publications and access to events

Young people up to the age of 16 can join their local [http://www.yac-uk.org/ '''Young Archaeologists' Club'''] supported by the CBA.

==Research priorities==
From its earliest years, the CBA has invested strongly in research support services for the UK archaeological community through its publication programme and latterly through a growing range of web-based resources and services. In addition to its role in facilitating, convening and disseminating the research of others, it has maintained its own programme of research.

The CBA's track record is principally in applied research to support its programmes in education, public participation and environmental protection. The CBA has also led research in key areas such as the impact of metal detecting on archaeology, television archaeology and the media, education outside the classroom, and assessment of information and data management needs for archaeology. The Mick Aston Archaeology Fund and the Marsh Award for Community Archaeology aim to foster and celebrate voluntary research in the historic environment.

Research themes relate to the CBA's central aim to increase opportunities for participation and learning through archaeology. Priority areas for research in partnership with major heritage organisations and other bodies in the sector are:

1) Archaeology in the classroom and beyond: developing local and national identities&lt;br/&gt;
2) Social outcomes and impacts of community archaeology and conservation projects&lt;br/&gt;
3) Adapting archaeology: mediating climate change histories&lt;br/&gt;
4) Innovation in managing digital media and serving up archaeological information to a wide audience

The CBA provides research support services through the ''[http://new.archaeologyuk.org/ CBA]'' website, the ''[http://www.torc.org.uk/ TORC]''(Training Online Resource Centre) website, with its online guide to educational and research opportunities, and the extensive programme of publication and electronic dissemination outlined below.

==Information provision and publishing==
The CBA provides electronic access to archaeological materials, information, interpretations and discussion.

It has published almost 200 books since 1945. Today, these publications take two main forms: the Research Report series publishes monographs of research into the archaeology of Britain, largely deriving from excavation, buildings and landscape surveys. The Practical Handbooks series is methodological, and aims to present straightforward summaries of topics for those new to a particular specialism. Further details of these are available on the [http://new.archaeologyuk.org/'''CBA'''] website.

It also publishes ''[https://reader.exacteditions.com/magazines British Archaeology]'', a bi-monthly news magazine aimed at both the general reader and the academic. Since 1997, it has published the e-journal ''[[Internet Archaeology]]''. Since 1949, it has overseen the compilation of a comprehensive archaeological bibliography, now available free-of-charge online as the [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/library/?dm_i=10MV,4SA89,OPIBLO,I9KLF,1 British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography]. A programme of digitisation has enabled free, electronic access to much of the CBA's back catalogue of publications, including ''British Archaeology'' and many books and occasional papers.

==Events==
The flagship CBA event each year is [[The Festival of Archaeology]], held in July. This two-week event brings together around 500 excavation open days, guided tours, exhibitions, lectures, ancient art and craft workshops and much more. Over a hundred thousand people take part.

In September, the Weekend Event brings together CBA members and specialists to examine the archaeology of a particular region of the UK. The weekend also includes the annual [[Beatrice de Cardi]] lecture, in honour of the CBA’s first permanent secretary, and the CBA AGM. Each year, the CBA hosts its Winter General Meeting at the British Academy, featuring a series of lectures on a theme linking archaeology with a related discipline.

In addition, the twelve CBA English Regional Groups, CBA Wales/Cymru and Archaeology Scotland (formerly the Council for Scottish Archaeology), along with Branches of the Young Archaeologists’ Club, hold over a thousand events each year throughout the UK.

'''Cromford''' is a village and civil parish in [[Derbyshire]], England, in the valley of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] between [[Wirksworth]] and [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]]. It is first mentioned in the 11th-century [[Domesday Book]] as a [[wikt:berewick|berewick]] (supporting farm) of Wirksworth and this remained the case throughout the middle ages. The population at the 2011 Census was 1,433.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&amp;b=11122466&amp;c=Cromford&amp;d=16&amp;e=62&amp;g=6413716&amp;i=1001x1003x1032x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1458657393656&amp;enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is principally known for its historical connection with [[Richard Arkwright]], and the nearby [[Cromford Mill]] which he built outside the village in 1771. Cromford is in the [[Derwent Valley Mills]] [[World Heritage site]].

==Geography==
The River Derwent, with its sources on [[Bleaklow]] in the [[Dark Peak]], flows southward to [[Derby]] and then to the [[River Trent]].  The geology of this section in the Derbyshire Dales is that of [[limestone]]. The fast flowing river has cut a deep valley.  The [[A6 road (England)|A6 trunk road]], which was the main road between London and Manchester in former times; the Cromford Canal and the [[Derwent Valley Line]], linking Derby and Matlock, were all built in the river valley. The [[Via Gellia]] valley joins the Derwent at Cromford, however, the stream which runs through that valley is actually the Ivonbrook and historically the valley was called the Ivonbrook Valley. The Via Gellia is simply the name of the road which runs along it, named after the [[Gell baronets|Gell family]] who owned many mines in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey Explorer Map OL24&lt;/ref&gt;

The A6 passes to the north of the village of Cromford; its land rises from 80m to 150m above mean sea level. It is {{convert|27|km|mi}} north of [[Derby]], {{convert|3|km|mi}} south of Matlock and {{convert|1|km|mi}} south of [[Matlock Bath]]. Trains operate from [[Cromford railway station|Cromford Station]], on the north bank of the Derwent to Derby and Nottingham.

==History==
[[File:Cromford workers cottages.jpg|thumb|275px|Workers cottages in Cromford, some having "weavers' windows" visible on the top floors]]
It is one of the significant sites in the development of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Here, [[Richard Arkwright]] built his [[cotton mill]] to make use of the [[water frame]].

The [[Gell baronets|Gell]] family, who were local [[Hopton, Derbyshire|Hopton]] landowners heavily involved in the nearby [[Wirksworth]] [[Derbyshire lead mining history|lead mining]] district, had the [[Via Gellia]] built to connect Cromford and Grangemill in the late 18th century.

Some cottages and farm buildings pre-date Arkwright's time, but a large part of the village was built to house the mill workers. They were provided with shops, pubs, chapels and a school.

The 20th century saw the development of council and private housing. Dene quarry, currently operated by Tarmac Ltd for the production of aggregates and roadstone, was excavated to the south west of the village from 1942 onwards.
 
In December 2001 a {{convert|15|mi|km}} corridor from [[Masson Mill]] in Matlock Bath to the Silk Mill in Derby and including the mills in Cromford, Milford, Belper and Darley Abbey was declared the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site.&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.cromfordvillage.co.uk/ Cromford Village Website] Accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The 1931 novel 'Saturday Night at the Greyhound' by [[John Hampson (novelist)|John Hampson]] takes place over the course of one evening in the bar at the Greyhound Hotel, Cromford.

In late 2006, [[Anand Tucker]] used certain parts of Cromford, including its historic bookshop, for his film ''[[And When Did You Last See Your Father?]]'', based on the autobiographical memoir by poet [[Blake Morrison]]. [[Colin Firth]] plays the adult Blake, with [[Jim Broadbent]] cast as his dying father.

A quarter of the German town [[Ratingen]] is named after Cromford, as this is where industrial pioneer Johann Gottfried Brügelmann 1783 erected the first factory outside England, using Arkwright's factory as an archetype. The factory today forms part of the [[Rheinisches Industriemuseum]].

[[Cromford railway station]] is located on the [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]]-[[Derby]] [[Derwent Valley Line]] and can be seen on the cover of the 1995 [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] single "[[Some Might Say]]".

==Governance==
Historically Cromford was part of the Wirksworth Wapentake or Hundred, this administrative area, also known as the Soke of Wirksworth (the "small county of Wirksworth") became, in due course, West Derbyshire Council and is now called Derbyshire Dales District Council. The village is run locally by the Cromford Parish Council.

==Landmarks==
The [[Cromford Mill]] (1771) buildings and accommodation for workers to staff the factories form part of the [[Derwent Valley Mills]], which is recognised as a [[World Heritage Site]] for its importance. North Street, constructed by Arkwright is important as a very early purpose built industrial workers housing and was rescued from dereliction in the 1970s by the [[Ancient Monument Society]] who have since sold off the houses. One house in the street is now a [[Landmark Trust]] holiday cottage.

[[Masson Mill]] (1783) is on the northern fringe of the village.

[[Willersley Castle]] dominates hill on the east side of the river, with commanding views of Masson Mill, the village, and the road from Derby. Commissioned by Richard Arkwright, building work began in 1790, but was delayed by a fire in 1791. Richard Arkwright died in 1792, and the building was occupied by his son Richard in 1796. The Arkwright family moved out in 1922, and the building was acquired by some Methodist businessmen, and opened to guests as a Methodist Guild hotel in 1928. During World War II, the building was used as a maternity hospital by the Salvation Army while evacuated from their hospital in the East End of London.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Guild website, [http://www.christianguild.co.uk/willersley/history.php History of Williersley Castle page], accessed 19 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St Mary's Church, Cromford]] built between 1792 and 1797 by Richard Arkwright.

The [[Cromford Canal]] – built to service the mills – is now in disuse, but has been designated a [[Site of Scientific Interest]] (SSSI). The canal tow path can be followed from [[Cromford Wharf]] to [[High Peak Junction]], and on to [[Whatstandwell]] and [[Ambergate]].  The [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]], completed in 1831, ran from High Peak Junction to the [[Peak Forest Canal]] at [[Whaley Bridge]]. Its track bed now forms the [[High Peak Trail]], a walk and cycle route which is joined by the [[Tissington Trail]] at [[Parsley Hay]].

'''Debre Berhan''' ({{Lang-am|ደብረ ብርሃን}}), formerly spelled '''Debra-Berhan''' or '''Bernam''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Abyssinia#7 |display=Abyssinia: (7) Provinces and Towns |volume=1 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city and [[woreda]] in central [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[Semien Shewa Zone (Amhara)|Semien Shewa Zone]] of the [[Amhara Region]], about 120 kilometers north east of [[Addis Ababa]] on the paved highway to [[Dessie]], the town has a latitude and longitude of {{coord|9|41|N|39|32|E|type:city(67243)_region:ET-AM|display=inline,title}} and an elevation of 2,840 meters. It was an early capital of Ethiopia and afterwards, with [[Ankober]] and [[Angolalla]], was one of the capitals of the kingdom of [[Shewa]]. Today, it is the administrative center of the Semien Shewa Zone of the Amhara Region.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Debre Berhan was founded by [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Zara Yaqob]], in response to a [[miraculous]] light that was seen in the sky at the time. Believing this was a sign from [[God]] showing his approval for the death by [[stoning]] of a group of heretics 38 days before, the emperor ordered a church built on the site, and later constructed an extensive palace nearby, and a second church, dedicated to [[Saint Cyriacus]]. Zara Yaqob spent 12 of the last 14 years of his life in Debre Berhan.

Historian [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] offers the date of 1456 for the date of the founding of this church, providing a plausible argument that the light in the sky was [[Halley's Comet]], which could have been in Shewa that year, although the traditional dates (10th day of the month of Maggabit, i.e. 6 or 7 March) do not coincide with the days that the comet was most visible (13 through 17 June).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pankhurst|first= Richard K. P.|title= History of Ethiopian Towns|year= 1982|publisher= Franz Steiner Verlag|location= Wiesbaden|page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his son [[Baeda Maryam of Ethiopia|Baeda Maryam]] did spend the first part of his reign in Debre Berhan, eventually Baeda Maryam returned to the established itinerant practice of living in a permanent encampment that was constantly on the move through the realm. The departure of the court led to a decline in the population and importance of this town. Pankhurst explains that the needs of the imperial court and army—who numbered in the thousands—for firewood and food was so burdensome that, "it could not remain in any one locality for more than four months, nor return to the same place in less than 10 years due to the resultant shortage of food",&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; which prevented the growth of any capital city in this period.

=== 16th-18th Century ===
While little more than a large village, Debre Berhan is mentioned a few times in the 16th century, the first time as a mustering center by Emperor [[Lebna Dengel]] against the invading armies of [[Ahmad Gragn]].&lt;ref&gt;Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, ''Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia'', translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After he had defeated Lebna Dengel at the [[Battle of Amba Sel]], Ahmad mustered his troops twice in Debre Berhan before leading them on campaigns deeper into Ethiopian territory. At the second mustering in 1535, he proclaimed before his followers, "Thanks be to God, Abyssinia is conquered. Only [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], [[Begemder]] and [[Gojjam]] are left... Shall we march against them, or shall we stay on in this region for a year until we have settled it down?" then led them into the [[Ethiopian highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, ''Futuh al-Habasa'', pp. 337f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th Century ===
The village regained importance in the reign of [[Asfa Wossen]] (1775-1808), [[Rulers of Shewa|Meridazmach of Shewa]], who built a palace there, and divided his time amongst this town, Ankober and Angolalla.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', pp. 188f&lt;/ref&gt; The succeeding Meridazmaches prized Debre Berhan as a hunting lodge for its surrounding plains, and used it as a riding place.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Sahle Selassie]] rebuilt Debre Berhan after it had been ravaged by [[Abichu Oromo]] at the beginning of his reign, and built a church dedicated to the Selassie ("[[Trinity]]") in this capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Abir|first= Mordechai |title= Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769-1855)|year= 1968|publisher= Longmans|location= London|pages=152f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When then [[Negus]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] submitted to Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] in the treaty of Wadara of 1878, it was also stipulated that the capital of Shewa would be moved from [[Liche]] to Debre Berhan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Marcus|first= Harold G.|title= The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913|year= 1995|publisher=Red Sea Press|location= Lawrenceville|isbn= 1-56902-010-8|page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Debre Berhan market in the 1880s was considered important for mules and horses. The Selassie church was rebuilt by Emperor Menilek in 1906 and contains many mural paintings.&lt;ref name=NAI-website&gt;[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB1.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 16 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; David Buxton believes that it was inevitable that Debre Berhan would regain importance, "Although a somewhat cold and inhospitable place," he writes about the town, "it has an obvious advantage as commanding what must always have been an important focus of routes. Even in modern times it was inevitable that the Asmara road should be brought through this easy passage, avoiding the impassable gorges on the other."&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Buxton, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1789582 "The Shoan Plateau and Its People: An Essay in Local Geography", ''Geographical Journal''], 114, (1949), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th Century ===
Debre Berhan received electricity in 1955 when a 90&amp;nbsp;kW hydro-electric power station was put into service; by 1965, the installed electrical capacity in the town was 125 kVA and annual production 103,000 kWh. On 26 April 1957, Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] opened the Community Teacher Training School in the town.&lt;ref&gt;"Opens Debre Berhan Teacher Training Center", ''Selected Speeches of His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I'', New York : One Drop Books, 2000, pp.76-79&lt;/ref&gt; By 1958 it was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township.&lt;ref name=NAI-website/&gt;

On 2 July 1994 it was broadcast that nine people were killed and eleven captured in an exchange of fire with security forces in [[Angolalla Terana Asagirt|Asagirt]] woreda. The people were alleged to have broken into the Debre Berhan prison before that, setting a number of prisoners free. According to the police, Andale Melaklu, the Debre Berhan representative of the [[All-Amhara People's Organization]] was one of the "bandits" killed in the fire exchange.&lt;ref name=NAI-website/&gt;

== Local economy ==
Debre Birhan is located along [[Ethiopian Highway 2]], which connects [[Addis Abeba]] with the north of the country. The gravel road between Debre Berhan and Ankober, 42 kilometers in length, was overhauled in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.gov.et/EnglishNews/2009/May/29May09/88660.htm "42-km Debrebirhan-Ankober road being maintained"]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, [[Ethiopian News Agency]], 29 May 2009 (accessed 30 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Debre Berhan Wool Factory, the first wool factory in Ethiopia, started production was 1 January 1965 with 120 spindles and 6 looms, having the capacity to process one metric ton of wool daily. In its first six months, the factory produced 7,065 blankets in a single-shift operation with a labor force of about 200, of whom 45% were women. The [[Derg]] government announced 3 February 1975 that the Debre Berhan Wool Factory was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully nationalised.&lt;ref name="NAI-website" /&gt;

Debre Berhan is also a famed center of [[rug making]].

== Landmarks ==
Despite its historical importance, none of the buildings Emperor Zara Yaqob built exist today, and no obvious 19th century construction is visible. The present church, although located on the site of the 15th century church, was built in 1906 at the orders of Emperor [[Menelik II]].

== International Relations ==
Debre Berhan is twinned with (sister city of)
*[[Le Blanc-Mesnil]] in [[France]]

'''Elisabeth Munksgaard''' (1924 – 13 November 1997) was a Danish historian and the assistant Keeper in the Department of the Prehistory of Denmark at the [[National Museum of Denmark]],{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=5}}{{sfn|Storms|1978|p=314}} a position she held from 1962 until retiring in 1990.{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=5}} She was "Denmark's acknowledged expert" on art from the [[Nordic Iron Age|late Iron Age]] and [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=5}}

Munksgaard's work encompassed multiple aspects of prehistoric Denmark. In 1974 she published the work ''Oldtidsdragter'', for decades the authoritative work on ancient [[Scandinavia]]n clothing.{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=5}} Over time her ideas developed to suggest a particular style of dress for the eleventh century [[Cnut the Great|King Canute]], an idea so central to her scholarship that the "finale" to her career was the installation in the museum of a replica of the king.{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=6}} In 1984 Munksgaard furthermore identified the [[Tjele helmet fragment]] as the remnant of one of the only known Viking helmets, rather than the saddle mount it had been misidentified as for 130 years.{{sfn|Munksgaard|1984|p=87}}

==Biography==
Born in 1924, Munksgaard earned her MA in Prehistoric Archaeology at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1953. Following a research fellowship in Cambridge and London from 1953 to 1954, she joined the National Museum of Denmark as a research assistant, becoming assistant keeper at the museum's Prehistory of Denmark department in 1962 until she retired in 1990. Taking a special interest in late Iron-age and [[Viking Age]] art, her papers on 5th-century gold rings and Late Antique silver were published in ''Acta Archaeologica'' in 1953 and 1955, presenting the results of her MA thesis. She went on to conduct studies into discoveries of late Iron-Age treasures and gold [[bracteates]].{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=5}}

From 1967, Munksgaard developed an interest in the museum's unique collection of ancient textiles and clothing, publishing ''Oldtidsdragter'' on ancient Scandinavian clothing in 1974. At the time of her death it was still considered to be the authoritative work on the subject. She argued that two triangular silks from the Viking Age chamber tomb in [[Mammen]] were fragments of cloak bands, later maintaining in the 1989 edition of ''Aarbøger for Nordish Oldkyndighed'' that some of the Mammen textiles reflected details shown in the drawing of [[Cnut the Great|Canute]] in ''[[Durham Liber Vitae|Liber Vitae]]''. As a result, the Copenhagen Draper's Guild funded work on a costume designed to show "King Canute in all his splendour."{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=6}} It was unveiled shortly before Munksgaard's retirement in 1990, sixteen years after she had initially proposed the theory, in a "fine finale" to her career.{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=6}}

In the decade before her retirement, Munksgaard also identified the [[Tjele helmet fragment]] as the remainder of a [[Viking Age]] helmet.{{sfn|Munksgaard|1984}} Discovered in 1850 amidst the tools of a [[metalsmith]], it was mistaken for a saddle mount.{{sfn|Munksgaard|1984|pp=85–87}}{{sfn|Leth-Larsen|1984}}{{sfn|Boye|1858|pp=197–198}} The fragment led an "unnoticed existence" in the museum for the next 130 years; recognising it for what it actually was in 1984, Munksgaard noted that "it is quite true that the best finds are often made not in the field, but in the museums."{{sfn|Munksgaard|1984|p=87}} The fragment is now identified as the remainder of one of only five known Viking helmets.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1125–1128}}

Elisabeth Munksgaard died on 13 November 1997, following a career during which she had made significant contributions to the National Museum's Department of Prehistory.{{sfn|Jørgensen|1998|p=6}}

'''Eugène Boban''' or '''Boban-Duvergé''' (1834–1908) was a French [[antiquarian]].  He was the official archaeologist of the court of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], and a member of the French Scientific Commission in Mexico.  At one time, he held then sold a number of [[crystal skull]]s, one which is now in the [[Musée du Quai Branly]] and another in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sax ''et al.'' (2008), Walsh (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Eugène Boban came to Mexico as a teenager, and became fluent in both Spanish and [[Nahuatl]].  He headed an expedition commissioned by [[Napoleon III]] to collect Mexican art and artifacts, later exhibited at the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro|Trocadéro Museum]] in connection with the [[International Exposition (1867)]]. In 1885 he had published a poster, ''Cuadro arqueológico y etnográfico de la republica mexicana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!silibraries&amp;uri=full=3100001~!526234~!0#focus Smithsonian Library on-line].&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1886, he moved his business to New York City.  Two sale catalogues of his collection, catalogued by Ed. Frossard, were published in New York in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!silibraries&amp;uri=full=3100001~!254125~!0#focus Smithsonian Library on-line]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1891, he organized and published the Aubin-Goupil Collection of manuscripts, bought in 1889 by [[Eugène Goupil]] and now in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]].

Ethnological objects from his collection were sold in Paris, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''Préhistorique; ages de la pierre, du bronze, du fer. Catalogue spécial des objets provenant de la collection Eugène Boban et des collections Émile Collin, du Chambon, Gaberel, Landesque, etc.'' Schleicher frères, Paris 1908 ([http://siris-libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!254125!0 Smithsonian Library on-line])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions of authenticity==
A crystal skull originally sold by Boban, now in the British Museum, has been demonstrated to be a modern fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rincon |first=Paul |title=Crystal skulls 'are modern fakes' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7414637.stm | work=BBC News | date=2008-05-23 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silverioortiz.jpg|thumb|Silverio Ortiz, Guatemalan labor leader and Hernández's close friend.]]

During his more than six years of imprisonment in the Central Penitentiary, Hernández de León suffered many indignities that left him on the brink of death; but his friend, the labor leader Silverio Ortiz advocated for him to the minister plenipotentiary of the United States, showing Hernández de León's bloody clothes {{sfn |De los Ríos | 1948|p =322}}

After the fall of Estrada Cabrera in 1920, he was released and returned to journalism; he was in the legislature and in the National Congress in the 1920s and 1930s.  On December 12, 1930 there was a lot of turmoil in the Guatemalan government after general [[Lázaro Chacón]] suffered a stroke that forced him to resign from office. Hernández de León was a first hand witness as he was in Congress and he was also de Director of newspaper ''Nuestro Diario''.{{sfn|Time|1930|p=}}{{sfn|Time|1931|p=}}{{sfn|Díaz Romeu|1996|pp=37–42}}

In [[heraldry]], the background of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] is called the '' '''field'''''.  The field is usually composed of one or more [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s ([[colour]]s or [[metal]]s) or [[Heraldic fur|fur]]s.  The field may be [[Division of the field|divided]] or may consist of a [[Variation of the field|variegated pattern]].

In rare modern cases the field (or a subdivision thereof) is not a tincture, but is shown as a scene from a [[landscape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Símbolos Patrios Municipales |url=http://www.alcaldianaguanagua.gov.ve/cont_simb.htm |accessdate=2007-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009100235/http://www.alcaldianaguanagua.gov.ve/cont_simb.htm |archivedate=2007-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or, in the case of the 329th Fighter Group of the [[United States Air Force]], blazoned as ''the sky proper''&lt;ref&gt;''Air Force Combat Units of World War II'', p.210&lt;/ref&gt;.  Landscape fields are regarded by many heralds as unheraldic and debased, as they defy the heraldic ideal of simple, boldly coloured images and cannot be consistently drawn from [[blazon]].

The arms of the Inveraray and District Community Council in Scotland have as a field ''In waves of the sea''. The correct language of heraldry is very flexible and virtually any image may be blazoned in a correct manner, for example "sky proper" might be blazoned simply ''Azure'' or ''[[bleu celeste]]'', whilst "waves of the sea" might be blazoned correctly as ''Azure, 3 bars undee argent'' which would provide 3 wavy thick white lines on a blue field.

'''Frank Maloy Anderson''' (Feb. 3, 1871 - Apr. 26, 1961) was an author, historian and professor of history. He was born in  [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska and spent most of his adult life teaching and writing about American and Western European history. He was a prolific writer for ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' and is noted among [[American Civil War]] historians for his book ''[[The Diary of a Public Man]]''.

==Life==
He taught history at the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] from 1895-1896. The following year he attended [[Harvard University]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts from 1896-1897.  He married his first wife Mary G. Steele in 1898, who died in 1938. Their marriage produced one son, Troyer Steele Anderson, (1900 - 1948).&lt;ref name=FAG&gt;[[#Grave|Find a Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Maloy taught history at [[Dartmouth College]], Hanover, N.H. from 1914-1941. He became a member and was Executive Council of the [[American Association of University Professors]] from 1917-1920. He was a member and eventual Executive Council of the [[American Historical Association]] from 1926-1928. In 1944 he married his second wife, Mary Maud Case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maloy|Google Analytic, Frank Maloy Anderson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 Anderson published ''Mystery of a "Public Man,"'' a historical detective story regarding quotes made in a diary, known as The Diary of a Public Man, first published in a popular magazine in 1879, quoting people closely associated with [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and [[William H. Seward]] just before the Civil War broke out.  The diary's publisher for reasons that are still disputed concealed the identity of its author and has been the center of much debate and controversy regarding the conclusions and surrounding history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson|Andrson, 1948]] -- see also Kathryn Allamong Jacob, ''King of the Lobby: The Life and Times of Sam Ward, Man-About-Washington in the Gilded Age'' (Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Maloy Anderson died in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], Minnesota, on April 26, 1961, at the age of 90, and is buried at [[Lakewood Cemetery]] in Minnesota.&lt;ref name=FAG/&gt;

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Georgian era''' is a period in [[British history]] from 1714 to {{circa|1830&amp;ndash;37}}, named after the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The sub-period that is the [[Regency era]] is defined by the regency of George IV as [[Prince of Wales]] during the illness of his father George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-III |title=George III King of Great Britain |author=John Steven Watson  |website=Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the Georgian era is often extended to include the relatively short reign of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], which ended with his death in 1837.

The term "[[wikt:Georgian|Georgian]]" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history [[Georgian architecture|and architecture]].  The term "[[Augustan literature]]" is often used for [[Augustan drama]], [[Augustan poetry]] and [[Augustan prose]] in the period 1700–1740s. The term "Augustan" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of [[Latin literature]] from the ancient [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Lund,  ''Ridicule, Religion and the Politics of Wit in Augustan England'' (Ashgate, 2013) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Jane Austen]], characterised by the architecture of [[Robert Adam]], [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Wyatt]] and the emergence of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, which hearkened back to a supposed [[Golden Age|golden age]] of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, principally through [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[William Blake]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Robert Burns]]. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of [[Thomas Gainsborough]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the young [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]] illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|Capability Brown]], the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]].

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], [[Georgian Dublin]], [[Grainger Town]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the Georgian Quarter of [[Liverpool]] and much of Bristol and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

The music of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Handel]], [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Mendelssohn]] was some of the most popular in England at that time.

==Social change==
It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] which began the process of intensifying [[social class|class divisions]], and the emergence of rival [[political party|political parties]] like the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]].

In rural areas the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated [[historic transport|transportation system]] but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in [[emigration]] to Canada, the [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]] (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the [[British Empire]].

===Evangelical religion and social reform===
The evangelical movement inside and outside the [[Church of England]] gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper-class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to "redeem the time" and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Armstrong, ''The Church of England: the Methodists and society, 1700–1850'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The age of improvement, 1783–1867'' (1959), pp 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction the "Low Church". Its leaders included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Hannah More]]. It reached the upper class through the [[Clapham Sect]]. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God's view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's People: English Society 1714–1815'' (1992) ch 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;  As R.J. Morris noted in his 1983 article "Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850," "[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner," but "in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.J.|date=March 1983|title=Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850: An Analysis|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=26|issue=1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book ''Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution'', functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel after the French Revolution|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lewisburg, PA|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire==
The Georgian period saw  continual warfare, including the [[Seven Years' War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]] (1756–63), the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802), the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15).  The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] in the [[American War of Independence]] was regarded as a national disaster and was seen by some foreign observers as heralding the end of Britain as a [[great power]]. In Europe, the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France]] dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Victory over [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815) under  [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould, "American independence and Britain's counter-revolution", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1997) #154 pp 107–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of empire brought fame to statesmen and explorers such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]] and [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], and sowed the seeds of the worldwide British Empire of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s which were to follow.

===The trading nation===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204–211]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ₤31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ₤130 a share to ₤1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.  The prime minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) pp 334–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Myths of the South Sea Bubble", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141–165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social revolt==
With the ending of the [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]], Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] political party published a leaflet called ''The Political Register'', also known as "The Two Penny Trash" to its rivals. The so-called [[Blanketeers|March of the Blanketeers]] saw 400 [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and [[Weaving|weavers]] march from [[Manchester]] to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The [[Luddite]]s destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] of 1820 sought to blow up the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and then move on to storm the [[Tower of London]] and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or [[penal transport|transported]] to Australia.

==Enlightenment==
{{Further|Age of Enlightenment}}
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Koch, ed., ''The American enlightenment: The shaping of the American experiment and a free society'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

===Scottish Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
English historian [[Peter Gay]] argues that the Scottish Enlightenment "was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith,  Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities that had stronger reputations than any in England.  The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Daniel Eddy, "Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership", in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800'' (2012),
 pp 297-309 [https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.  Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history architecture, and medicine. Leaders included  [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].  The Scottish Enlightenment influenced England and the American colonies, and to a lesser extent continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David  Daiches, Peter Jones, Jean Jones, eds., ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment 1731–1790'' (Edinburgh UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Enlightenment===
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars.   The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include as enlightenment intellectuals such representative Englishmen as Newton, Locke, Jonathan Swift, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the  reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim few thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|author=José Rabasa et al. eds.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing|volume=3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supported the standing order.  Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 36-37, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5241">'''Guram Sharadze''' ({{lang-ka|გურამ შარაძე}}) (17 October 1940 – 20 May 2007) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[philologist]], [[historian]], and [[politician]]. In 1995, he founded a small nationalist movement ''Ena, Mamuli, Sartsmunoeba'' ("Language, Homeland, Faith"). He was [[assassinated]] in downtown [[Tbilisi]].

== Career ==
Sharadze was involved in the [[anti-Soviet]] Georgian national movement in the late 1980s and was closely associated with [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] who became, in 1991, the first elected [[President of Georgia]]. After Gamsakhurdia's ouster in the 1992 [[coup d'etat]], Sharadze was in opposition to [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]'s government. In 1995, he founded the nationalist ''Ena, Mamuli, Sartsmunoeba'' ("Language, Homeland, Religion") movement, and was elected to the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. In 2002, he spearheaded, though unsuccessfully, a drive to try to ban the [[Jehovah's Witness]] religious denomination from the country,&lt;ref name="WHDH-TV"&gt;[http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/world/BO52752/ Leader of Georgian opposition movement gunned down in Tbilisi, interior ministry says.] ''[[WHDH-TV]] World News''. May 20, 2007. Retrieved on May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and was heavily criticized by the Georgian [[human rights]] activists and reformist politicians for his sympathy to the group of Orthodox radicals led by the ex-priest Basil Mkalavishvili which was involved in [[pogrom#Modern usage and examples|pogroms]] of the Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/189322::georgia/324391.317214.8379...mr.317215/freedom-of-religion.htm 00.10.2003 - HRIDC: Wanted ex-priest Mkalavishvili appears with parliamentary candidate] ("Monthly Bulletin 10 (56), October 2003")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102002045|title=Religious Persecution in Georgia—How Much Longer?|pages=18&amp;ndash;24|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he joined Shevardnadze's election bloc "For A New Georgia" in the controversial parliamentary elections which were widely denounced as rigged and triggered mass demonstrations concluded with the bloodless [[Rose Revolution]]. Since then, Sharadze withdrew from politics, but attempted to organize a civic movement against [[Western world|Western]] influences in Georgia, denouncing the [[civil society]] work of philanthropist [[George Soros]] as potentially more pernicious to Georgia than the [[Bolshevik]] revolution.&lt;ref name="WHDH-TV"/&gt;

In 2004, he was sentenced to fifteen days imprisonment for [[hooliganism]], after he tore down posters of the [[Poland|Polish]] artist [[Rafal Olbinski]] at an exhibition at the [[National Parliamentary Library of Georgia]], labeling them as "[[pornography|pornographic]]". Next year, he was briefly arrested again for insulting the rector of [[Tbilisi State University]] who had launched a Western-modeled program of reforms.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15150 Ex-MP Shot Dead in Tbilisi.] ''Civil Georgia''. May 21, 2007. Retrieved on May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharadze was a professor of philology at [[Tbilisi State University]], a Corresponding Member of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]], and [[Academician]] of the [[Abkhazian Regional Academy of Sciences]]. He authored several works on Georgian literature and history, with a particular emphasis on the 1918-1921 [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era Georgian political emigration in [[Europe]].

==Assassination==

On 20 May 2007, Guram Sharadze was assassinated on [[Melikishvili Avenue]] in central Tbilisi in front of the [[Aldagi Insurance Company]] office by Giorgi Barateli, an erstwhile friend of his son. Shortly thereafter, Barateli was arrested after a minor shootout with police.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt; Sharadze’s daughter has alleged that the killing was political and her father was murdered in order to silence a vocal and a long-time critic of the expected repatriation of [[Meskhetian Turks|Muslim Meskhetians]], the group deported from Georgia in 1944 by [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15383&amp;search=Sharadze Daughter Alleges Politics Behind Ex-MP's Murder].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5188">[[File:Papłoński Helmolda Kronika Słowiańska.jpeg|260px|right|thumb|''[[Chronica Slavorum]]'' translated into [[Polish language|Polish]] by Jan Papłoński in 1862.]]
'''Helmold of Bosau''' (ca. 1120 &amp;ndash; after 1177) was a [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[historian]] of the 12th century and a [[priest]] at [[Bosau]] near [[Plön]]. He was a friend of the two bishops of [[Oldenburg in Holstein]], [[Vicelinus]] (died 1154) and Gerold (died  1163), who did much to Christianize the [[Polabian Slavs]].

==History==

Helmold was born near [[Goslar]]. He grew up in [[Holstein]], and received his instruction in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] from Gerold, the future [[bishop]] of Oldenburg (1139–42). Later he came under the direction of [[Vicelinus]], the Apostle of the [[Wends]], first in the Augustinian monastery of [[Faldera]], afterwards known as [[Neumünster]] (1147–53). He became a [[deacon]] about 1150, and finally became a parish priest in 1156 at Bosau on [[Großer Plöner See]].

At Bishop Gerold's instigation Helmold wrote his ''[[Chronicon Slavorum|Chronica Slavorum]]'', a history of the conquest and conversion of the [[Polabian Slavs]] from the time of [[Charlemagne]] (about 800) to 1171. The purpose of this chronicle was to demonstrate how Christianity and the German nationality gradually succeeded in gaining a footing among the Wends, especially in the eastern portion of Holstein. As an eyewitness he gives a clear description in fluent Latin of Vicelinus's missionary labors, of the founding of the bishopric in Oldenburg, of the transfer of this bishopric to [[Lübeck]] when German commerce at the latter place had become more important than in the former city, of the spread of German influence among the Wends, of the merciless subjugation and extermination of these, and of the summoning to their lands of foreign settlers, principally [[Westphalia]]n and [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The work is divided into two parts: the first covers a period closing with the year 1168, while the second continues to the year 1171. This second part, however, was written subsequently to 1172.

Helmold was a critical historian, calling [[Henry the Lion]] "out for money", and criticizing the [[Wendish Crusade]]s. He said that among the troops of [[Henry the Lion]] during the Wendish Crusade, there was "only talk of money, never about Christianity" and missionary conversion of the Slavs.

Helmold drew his knowledge of the earliest period from the church history of [[Adam of Bremen]] and the Saxon records bearing on [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], besides the life of [[Willehadus]], the list of [[Ansgarius]], and perhaps also a life of Vicelinus, but the summaries which he made of these records are unreliable. He is, however, the most important source of information for the history of his own period, his account of which rests on the verbal information of Vicelinus and of Gerold. His fund of information becomes noticeably meager after the latter's death in 1163. His trustworthiness was seriously questioned in the 19th century (see particularly Sehirren, ''Beiträge zur Kritik holsteinischer Geschichtsquellen'', Leipzig, 1876) owing to his antagonism towards the [[Archbishops of Bremen]] and his partiality for the Oldenburg-Lübeck bishopric, but it should not be supposed that be was guilty of an intentional falsification of facts. The chronicle was first published in 1556 at [[Frankfurt]], and later in ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores'', XXI (1868), 11-99, and in "Script. rer. Germ."

[[Henry the Lion]], Duke of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], was Helmold's patron. The chronicle was continued down to 1209 by Abbot [[Arnold of Lübeck]].

[[File:2013 NE India Groups Separatist Demands (30584184850).jpg|thumb|2013 Northeast India Groups Separatist Demands]]
'''Insurgency in Northeast India''' involves multiple armed factions operating in [[India]]'s [[Northeast India|northeastern states]], which are connected to the rest of India by the [[Siliguri Corridor]], a strip of land as narrow as {{convert|14|miles}} wide.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Some factions favour a separate state while others seek [[Autonomous entity|regional autonomy]]. Some groups demand complete independence.

Northeastern India consists of seven states (also known as the ''[[Seven Sister States]]''): [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], and [[Nagaland]]. Tensions exist between these states and the central government as well as amongst their native tribal people and migrants from other parts of India. Regional tensions eased off in late 2013, with the Indian and state governments making a concerted effort to raise the living standards of people in these regions. However, in late 2014 tensions again rose as the Indian government launched an offensive, which led to a retaliatory attack on civilians by tribal guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/12/deaths-reported-northeast-india-attack-20141223151344571967.html|title=Northeast India attack|publisher=al-Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 January 2015, major militant activities are being conducted in [[Assam Conflict|Assam]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Tripura]].

The [[Indian general election, 2014]] had an 80% [[voter turnout]] in all northeastern states, the highest among all states of India. Indian authorities claim that this shows the faith of the northeastern people in Indian democracy.&lt;ref name="Government of India"&gt;{{cite news|title=State-Wise Voter Turnout in General Election 2014|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=105116|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=Election Commission of India|agency=Press Information Bureau|publisher=Government of India|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a number of organizations [[Terrorism in India|listed as terrorist groups]] continue to promote an insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/NE-outfits-form-common-platform-Khaplang-at-helm/articleshow/47043409.cms] NE outfits form common platform, Khaplang at helm, ''Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=8..250415.apr15] Rebel Govt-in-exile in the offing with Chinese support, E-pao.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanglaonline.com/2015/04/united-national-liberation-front-of-west-south-east-asia-formed/] ‘United National Liberation Front of West South East Asia’ Formed, ''KanglaOnline''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arunachal Pradesh ==

=== NLCT ===
The [[National Liberation Council of Taniland]] (NLCT) was active along the Assam – Arunachal Pradesh border, and its members belong to the [[Tani (tribes)|Tani groups of people]] which are demanding [[Taniland]].The group enjoys no support from the local population of Arunachal Pradesh who are fiercely pro-India and the group is all but defunct now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/detailsmall_news.asp?date1=10/22/2009&amp;id=21 NSCN-IM designs to rejuvenate NLCT in Arunachal Pradesh, reveals investigation], ''South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhaskarpegu.blogspot.in/2009/01/taniland-outfit-in-culminationorders.html|title=LOTTA|author=bhaskar pegu|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tani groups are Mongoloid people (variously known as [[Mishing people|Mising]] in Assam and [[Adi people|Adi]], [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], [[Galo tribe|Galo]], Bangni, Apa, Tagin, Hill Miri in [[Arunachal Pradesh]]) in India as well as the Luoba in China who live along the frontier of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasiareview.com/21012014-india-outside-intrusions-arunachal-pradesh-analysis/ INDIA: OUTSIDE INTRUSIONS IN ARUNACHAL PRADESH – ANALYSIS], ''Eurasia Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assam ==
{{Main|Assamese nationalism|Bodo nationalism}}
[[Assam]] has been a refuge for militants for a number of years, due to its porous borders with [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bhutan]]. The main causes of the friction include anti-foreigner agitation in the 1980s, and the simmering Assam-Bodo tensions. The insurgency status in Assam is classified as "very active".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The government of Bangladesh has arrested and extradited senior leaders of the ULFA.&lt;ref name="First Post"&gt;{{cite web|title=India to get back Ulfa leader Anup Chetia from Bangladesh|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/india-to-get-back-ulfa-leader-anup-chetia-from-bangladesh-919409.html|publisher=First Post|accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ULFA ===

The [[United Liberation Front of Assam]] was formed in April 1979 to establish a sovereign state of Assam through armed struggle. In recent times the organisation has lost its middle rung leaders after most of them were arrested.&lt;ref name="First Post"/&gt;

=== NDFB ===

The [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland]] was formed in 1989 as the Bodo Security Force, and aims to set up an independent state [[Bodoland]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== KLNLF ===

The [[Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front]] is a militant group operating in the [[Karbi Anglong]] and [[Dima Hasao]] districts of [[Assam]] that was formed on 16 May 2004. The outfit claims to fight for the cause of Karbi tribes, and its declared objective is Hemprek Kangthim, meaning self-rule/self-determination of the [[Karbi people]]. It is closely linked with the ULFA ([[United Liberation Front of Asom]]){{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== UPDS ===

The [[United People's Democratic Solidarity]] was formed in March 1999 with the merger of two terrorist outfits in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, the Karbi National Volunteers (KNV) and the Karbi People’s Front (KPF).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2004, the UPDS (Anti-Talks) renamed itself as the [[Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front|Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF)]], and its armed wing as the Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Resistance Force (KNPR).

In 2014 the UPDS disbanded, following the mass surrender of all it cadres and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twocircles.net/2011dec14/assam_terror_outfit_disbands.html|title=Assam terror outfit disbands|publisher=Twocircles.net|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DHD ===

The [[Dima Halam Daoga]] (DHD) is a descendant of the Dimasa National Security Force (DNSF), which ceased operations in 1995. Commander-in-Chief Jewel Gorlosa, refused to surrender and launched the Dima Halam Daogah. After the peace agreement between the DHD and the central government in the year 2003, the group further broke out and DHD(J) also known as Black Widow was born which was led by Jewel Gorlosa. The Black Widow's declared objective is to create Dimaraji for the Dimasa people in Dima Hasao district only. However the objective of DHD (Nunisa faction) is to include parts of Cachar, Karbi Anglong, and Nagaon districts in Assam, and sections of Dimapur district in Nagaland.

In 2009 the group surrendered en masse to the [[CRPF]] and local police, 193 cadres surrendering on 2009-09-12 and another 171 on the 13th.&lt;ref name=pti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptinews.com/news/281233_Over-360-militants-surrender-with-hi-tech-arms |title=Site Under Construction |publisher= |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922213600/http://www.ptinews.com/news/281233_Over-360-militants-surrender-with-hi-tech-arms |archivedate=22 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KLO ===

The objective of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) is to carve out a separate [[Kamtapur]] State. The proposed state is to comprise six districts in [[West Bengal]] and four contiguous districts of [[Assam]] which are [[Cooch Behar]], [[Darjeeling]], [[Jalpaiguri]], North and South [[Dinajpur]] and [[Malda district|Malda]] of [[West Bengal]] and four contiguous districts of Assam – [[Kokrajhar]], [[Bongaigaon]], [[Dhubri]] and [[Goalpara]]. The KLO in the beginning was an over-ground{{clarify|date=September 2014}} organisation which was formed to address problems of the [[Koch Rajbongshi people]] such as large-scale unemployment, land alienation, perceived neglect of [[Rangpuri language|Kamtapuri language]], identity, and grievances of economic deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/klo.htm|title=South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) on KLO|publisher=Satp.org|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manipur ==
{{Main|Insurgency in Manipur}}
Manipur's long tradition of independence can be traced to the foundation of the [[Manipur (princely state)|Kangleipak State]] in 1110. The Kingdom of Manipur was conquered by [[Great Britain]] following the brief [[Anglo-Manipuri War]] of 1891, becoming a British protectorate.&lt;ref name=Psiu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/insurgencies-in-manipur-politics-ideology/article95770.ece|title=Insurgencies in Manipur: politics &amp; ideology|work=The Hindu|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipur became part of the Indian Union on 15 October 1949. Manipur's incorporation into the Indian state soon led to the formation of a number of insurgent organisations, seeking the creation of an independent state within the borders of Manipur, and dismissing the merger with India as involuntary.&lt;ref name=CDPS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdpsindia.org/manipur_insurgency.asp|title=Overview: Insurgency &amp; Peace Efforts in Manipur|work=CDPS|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that Manipur became a separate state of the Indian Union on 21 January 1972, the insurgency continued.&lt;ref name=Psiu/&gt;
On 8 September 1980, Manipur was declared an area of disturbance, when the Indian government imposed the [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act|Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958]] on the region; the act currently remains in force.&lt;ref name=CDPS/&gt;

The parallel rise of [[Naga nationalism]] in neighbouring [[Nagaland]] led to the emergence of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (NSCN) activities in Manipur. Clashes between the Isak-Muivah and Khaplang factions of the NSCN further aggravated tensions, as [[Kuki people|Kuki tribals]] began creating their own guerrilla groups in order to protect their interests from alleged Naga violations. Skirmishes between the two ethnic groups took place during the 1990s. Other ethnic groups such as the [[Paite people|Paite]], [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]], [[Pangal]]s and [[Hmar people|Hmars]] followed suit establishing militant groups.&lt;ref name=CDPS/&gt;

=== UNLF ===

The first separatist faction known as the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) was founded on 24 November 1964.

=== PLA, PREPAK and KCP, KRA, and the student organisation===

Between 1977 and 1980, the [[People's Liberation Army of Manipur]] (PLA), the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) and the [[Kangleipak Communist Party]] (KCP), were formed, immediately joining the war.&lt;ref name=CDPS/&gt;

== Nagaland ==
{{Main|Naga nationalism|Nagaland conflict}}
Nagaland was created in 1963 as the 16th state of the Indian Union, before which it was a district of Assam. Insurgent groups classified as active mainly demand full independence. The [[Naga National Council]] led by [[Phizo]] was the first group to dissent in 1947 and in 1956 they went underground.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== NSCN(IM) ===

The [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] was formed in 1980 to establish a Greater Nagaland, encompassing parts of Manipur, Nagaland, and the north Cachar hills (Assam). The NSCN split in 1988 to form two groups, NSCN(IM) and NSCN(K). As of 2015, both groups have observed a ceasefire truce with the Indian government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33762445 India signs peace accord with Naga rebels]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NSCN(K) ===

The [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland|National Socialist Council of Nagaland—Khaplang]] is the second faction with the same aim of a Greater Nagaland and was formed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/manipur-ambush-groups-that-attacked-the-6-dogra/|title=Manipur ambush: Groups that attacked the 6 Dogra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Suspected-NSCNK-militants-fire-at-Assam-Rifles-camp/articleshow/47573022.cms?|title=Suspected NSCN(K) militants fire at Assam Rifles camp|work=The Times of India|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/manipur-ambush-chinese-army-officials-in-touch-with-nscnk-leaders/|title=Manipur Ambush: ‘Chinese Army officials in touch with NSCN(K) leaders’|date=9 June 2015|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nscnk-move-at-behest-of-elements-in-china/article7295857.ece|title=NSCN(K) move at behest of elements in China?|author=Devesh K.

== Tripura ==
{{Main|Tripuri nationalism}}
The insurgent groups in [[Tripura]] emerged at the end of the 1970s, as ethnic tensions between the [[Bengal]]i immigrants and the tribal native population who were outnumbered by the former, hailing from other parts of India and nearby Bangladesh, which resulted in their being reduced to minority status even threatening them economically, socially, culturally; this resulted in a clarion call for safeguarding tribal rights and cultures. Such being the extent of desperation, this naturally resulted in hatred and suspicion and their status is classified as active.

=== NLFT ===

The [[National Liberation Front of Tripura]] was formed in March 1989.

The [[All Tripura Tiger Force]] was formed by local aboriginal tribes in 1990, who were gradually outnumbered both directly and indirectly, even at the cost of being threatened for their survival economically and culturally, not to speak of their being reduced to minority population-wise; their sole aim is the expulsion of all [[Bengali language|Bengali speaking]] immigrants from the rest of India and nearby Bangladesh.

== Meghalaya ==
{{Main|Insurgency in Meghalaya}}
The state of [[Meghalaya]] was separated from the state of Assam in 1971, in order to satisfy the [[Khasi people|Khasi]], [[Synteng]] and [[Garo people|Garo]] for a separate state. The decision was initially praised as an example of successful national integration into the wider Indian state.&lt;ref name=SwO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethanylacina.com/Lacina_IndiaSeparatism_2013.pdf |title=Nationalism and the origins of separatist civil war in India |work=University of Rochester |date= |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133721/http://www.bethanylacina.com/Lacina_IndiaSeparatism_2013.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, however, failed to prevent the rise of [[national consciousness]] among the local tribal populations, later leading to a direct confrontation between [[Indian nationalism]] and the newly created Garo and Khasi nationalisms. A parallel rise of nationalism in the other members of the [[Seven Sister States]] further complicated the situation, resulting in occasional clashes between rebel groups.&lt;ref name=SwO/&gt;

The state wealth distribution system further fueled the rising separatist movements, as funding is practised through per-capita transfers, which largely benefits the leading ethnic group.&lt;ref name=SwO/&gt;

The first militant outfit to emerge in the region was the [[Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council]] (HALC). It was formed in 1992, aiming to protect the interests of Meghalaya's indigenous population from the rise of non-tribal ("Dkhar") immigration.&lt;ref name=SoPR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpsindia.org/meghalaya_insurgency.asp|title=Overview: Insurgency &amp; Peace Efforts in Meghalaya|work=CPDS|date=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HNLC ===

A conflict of interest soon led to a split of the HALC into the Garo-dominated [[Achik Matgrik Liberation Army]] (AMLA), and the joint Systeng-Khasi alliance of [[Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council]] (HNLC).{{fact|date=July 2018}}

=== ANVC ===

The AMLA passed into obscurity, while the Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC) took its place. The Garo-Khasi drift persisted as the HNLC had set up the goal of turning Meghalaya into an exclusively Khasi region; the ANVC, on the other hand, sought the creation of an independent state in the Garo Hills.&lt;ref name=SoPR/&gt;

=== GNLA ===

The most active outfit in the state is the Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA), which was formed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/Meghalaya/terrorist_outfits/GNLA.htm] GNLA, Satp&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of non-Meghalayan separatist groups have also operated in the region, including the [[United Liberation Front of Assam]] and the [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/meghalaya/terrorist_outfits/plf_m.htm|title=People’s Liberation Front of Meghalaya (PLF-M)|work=SATP|date=20 May 2014|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mizoram ==
{{see also|March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising}}

[[Mizoram]]'s tensions were largely due to the simmering [[Assamese people|Assamese]] domination and the neglect of the [[Mizo people]]. In 1986, the [[Mizo accord]] ended the main secessionist movement led by the [[Mizo National Front]], bringing peace to the region.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Insurgency status is classified as partially active, due to secessionist/autonomy demands by the [[Hmar]]s, Chakmas and Brus.

=== HPC-D ===

The [[Hmar Peopl]]e's Convention-Democracy is an armed insurgency group formed in 1995 to create an independent [[Hmar]] State in North East India. It is the offspring of the Hmar People's Convention (HPC), which entered into an agreement with the Government of Mizoram in 1994 resulting in the formation of the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in North Mizoram. Their recruited cadres are from the States where the Hmar people are spread – Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya. The HPC(D) is demanding a separate administrative unit under the Sixth [[Third Schedule|Schedule of the Constitution of India]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Spillover in Bhutan ==
{{Main|Operation All Clear}}
Following the 1990 Operations ''Rhino'' and ''Bajrang'', Assamese separatist groups relocated their camps to Bhutan.&lt;ref name=XdF/&gt; In 1996 the Bhutan government became aware of a large number of camps on its southern border with India. The camps were set up by four Assamese separatist movements: the ULFA, NDFB, [[Bodo Liberation Tigers Force]] (BLTF)  and [[Kamtapur Liberation Organization]] (KLO). The camps also harboured separatists belonging to the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (NSCN) and the [[All Tripura Tiger Force]] (ATTF).&lt;ref name=CsV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/02/09/Nation/HSEB-to-appoint-new-teachers/4979/|title=Operation All Clear: Bhutan's step for regional security|author=Anand Kumar|work=Kathmandu Post|date=25 December 2003|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India then exerted diplomatic pressure on Bhutan, offering support in removing the rebel organisations from its soil. The government of Bhutan initially pursued a peaceful solution, opening dialogue with the militant groups on 1998. Five rounds of talks were held with ULFA, three rounds with DNFB, with KLO ignoring all invitations sent by the government. In June 2001 ULFA agreed to close down four of its camps; however, the Bhutanese government soon realized that the camps had simply been relocated.&lt;ref name=XdF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/IB18-OperationAllClear.pdf|title=Implications for insurgency and security cooperation|author=Dipankar Banerjee|work=IPCS|date=January 2004|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003 the talks had failed to produce any significant result. On 14 July 2003, military intervention was approved by the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=XdF/&gt; On 13 December 2003, the Bhutanese government issued a two-day ultimatum to the rebels. On 15 December 2003, after the ultimatum had expired, Operation All Clear – the first operation ever conducted by the [[Royal Bhutan Army]] – was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EL19Df04.html |title=Bhutan army sees action at last|work=Asia Times|author=Arun Bhattacharjee|date=19 December 2003|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3 January 2004, the Royal Bhutan Army had killed about 120 militants. They managed to capture several senior ULFA commanders. Large numbers of rebels fled to [[Bangladesh]] and India. Militants also were dislodged from all 30 camps and 35 observation posts, with the camps burned and razed to the ground.&lt;ref name=CsV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raonline.ch/pages/bt/btbodo12d.html |title=RBA Makes Good Progress in Flushing Out Operations |work=Kuensel|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=3 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2011, [[Royal Bhutan Police]] and [[Royal Bhutan Army]] personnel undertook numerous actions against alleged north Indian militants. Several firefights occurred while Bhutan military personnel were required to dispose of several explosive devices and destroyed a number of guerrilla camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsheringtobgay.com/monarchy/2011/thanking-our-armed-forces.html|title=Thanking our armed forces|author=Tshering Tobgay|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 Indian General Election ==

Despite threats from insurgent militants groups in Northeast India, people turned out in large numbers for the [[Indian general election, 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/ThreatofIslamicterrorloomslargeoverAssam_RBhattacharjee_121114.html|title=Threat of Islamic terror looms large over Assam|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ummid.com/news/2014/March/03.03.2014/ls-polls-prospects-of-ten-partes.html|title=LS Poll 2014: Prospects of Ten Parties Regional Front in Northeast India  - ummid.com|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voter turnout in northeast India was best among all regions or states of India.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5301">The '''International Numismatic Congress''' (INC) is the largest international conference for [[Numismatist (specialist)|numismatists]]. It is organised every six years by the [[International Numismatic Council]]. Since the 7th INC in Copenhagen, the conference has also marked the launch of the ''Survey of Numismatic Literature'', in which specialist numismatists review research and publications since the previous Congress. A special medal is created for each Congress.  The Congress has, from the 6th INC in Rome forward, met at six-year intervals with the only slight disturbance being that the 10th INC in London convened seven years after the previous Congress and saw a slightly shortened span of five years following the London INC.

{{Today/AD/SH/AH}}

The '''Iranian calendars''' ({{lang-fa|گاه‌شماری ایرانی}} ''Gâh-Shomâriye Īrâni'') are a succession of calendars invented or used for over two millennia in [[Iran]] and formerly Persia. One of the longest chronological records in human history, the Iranian calendar has been modified time and time again during its history to suit administrative, climatic, and religious purposes.

The modern Iranian calendar is currently the official calendar in Iran. It begins at the midnight nearest to the instant of the [[vernal equinox]] as determined by astronomical calculations for the [[Iran Standard Time]] [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (52.5°E or GMT+3.5h).   It is, therefore, an observation-based calendar, unlike the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]], which is rule-based.&lt;ref name="heydari"&gt;M. Heydari-Malayeri, [http://aramis.obspm.fr/~heydari/divers/ir-cal-eng.html A concise review of the Iranian calendar], Paris Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian year usually begins within a day of 21 March of the Gregorian calendar. To find the corresponding year of the Gregorian calendar, add 621 or 622 (depending on the time of the year) to a [[solar hijri]] year. A short table of year correspondences between the Persian and Gregorian calendars is provided below.

=== Ancient calendars ===
{{See also|Royal stars}}

Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the [[second millennium BCE]], predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet [[Zoroaster]], the first fully preserved calendar is that of the [[Achaemenid]]s. Throughout recorded history, [[Persian people|Persians]] have been keen on the idea and importance of having a [[calendar]]. They were among the first cultures to use a [[solar calendar]] and have long favoured a solar over [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in [[Iranian culture]] and is closely related to the folklore regarding [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name=EI-C-i&gt;{{harv|Panaino|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Persian calendar ====
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a [[360-day calendar]] based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the [[pastoral]] year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

The following table lists the Old Persian months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/calendars Encyclopaedia Iranica. Article "Calendars". By Antonio Panaino, Reza Abdollahy, Daniel Balland.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zoroastrian calendar ====
{{main article|Zoroastrian calendar}}
The first calendars based on [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BCE). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified [[Achaemenid Empire]] required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in [[Egypt]]ian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a [[yazata]] (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to [[Ahura Mazda]] and seven were named after the six [[Amesha Spenta|Amesha Spentas]]. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, [[Tishtrya|Tiri]] and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, [[Sraosha]] (Soroush, yazata of prayer), [[Rashnu]] (the Judge), [[Fravashi]], [[Verethragna|Bahram]] (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and [[Vayu-Vata|Vata]], the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, [[Daena]] (yazata of religion and personified conscious), [[Ashi]] (yazata of fortune) and [[Arshtat]] (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to [[Asman]] (lord of sky or Heaven), [[Zam]] (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).

The month names and their modern versions are given in the following table.

The calendar had a significant impact on religious observance. It fixed the pantheon of major divinities, and also ensured that their names were uttered often, since at every Zoroastrian act of worship the yazatas of both day and month were invoked. It also clarified the pattern of festivities; for example, Mitrakanna or [[Mehregan]] was celebrated on Mithra day of Mithra month, and the Tiri festival (Tiragan) was celebrated on Tiri day of the Tiri month.

In 538 BC Cyrus the Great (uncertain if he was a Zoroastrian) conquered Babylon and the Babylonian luni-solar calendar came into use for civil purposes.   Cambyses conquered Egypt in 525 BC.  He was accompanied by Darius, a Zoroastrian who became ruler of the Persian empire in 517 BC.   The Zoroastrians adopted the wandering Egyptian solar calendar of twelve months of thirty days plus five epagomenal days.   As their year began in the spring (with the festival of ''norouz'') the epagemonai were placed just before ''norouz''.

In Egypt the star Sirius had significance since every 1460 years (the [[Sothic cycle]]) its heliacal rising (just before sunrise) marked the Egyptian new year and the inundation of the Nile.   In Persia also the star had significance, since its heliacal rising there also coincided with the coming of the rain.   The fourth Persian month was ''Tishtrya'' (Sirius, rain star).   The vernal equinox at Greenwich fell on the first day of the first month from 487 to 483 BC (inclusive).   Adopting S H Taqizadeh's date of 28 March 487 BC for the reform&lt;ref&gt;Taqizadeh S H:  ''Old Iranian Calendars'', Royal Asiatic Society (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; the calendar for that year is as follows:

{|class="wikitable" style="float:centre"

|-
|4||23 March||1||23*–28 March

|}

The fourth month includes 20 July, the date of the heliacal rising of Sirius.   In the first year the people carried on using the old calendar, anticipating festival dates by five days.   As each day is named after a god, it is important to observe the celebrations on the right day.   Thus the ''fravasis'' festival, which in the old calendar was kept between sunset on 30 Spandarmad and sunrise on 1 Frawardin, was now observed throughout the ''epagemonai''.   In the second year of the reform, the old 30 Spandarmad was the new 25 Spandarmad, so from then on the festival covered eleven days, up to the new 1 Frawardin.   Five days was considered enough for other festivals, however.

In all the lands where the Persian calendar was used the ''epagemonai'' were placed at the end of the year.   To offset the difference between the agricultural year and the calendar year (the tax-gathering season began after the harvest) the start of the ''araji'' (land-tax) year was delayed by one month every 120 years.   A Roman historian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, describing a ceremony in 333 BC, writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magi were followed by three hundred and sixty-five young men clad in purple robes, equal in number to the days of a whole year; for the Persians also divided the year into that number of days.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, iii, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the conquests by [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander of Macedon]] and his death, the Persian territories fell to one of his generals, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] (312 BCE), starting the [[Seleucid]] dynasty of Iran. Based on the Greek tradition, Seleucids introduced the practice of dating by era rather than by the reign of individual kings. Their era became known as that of Alexander, or later the [[Seleucid era]]. Since the new rulers were not Zoroastrians, Zoroastrian priests lost their function at the royal courts, and so resented the Seleucids.   Although they began dating by eras, they established their own era of Zoroaster.

That was the first serious attempt to determine the dates associated with the prophet Zoroaster's life. Priests had no Zoroastrian historical sources, and so turned to Babylonian archives famous in the ancient world. From these they learned that a great event in Persian history took place 228 years before the era of Alexander. In fact, this was the conquest of [[Babylon]] by Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE. But the priests misinterpreted this date to be the time the "true faith" was revealed to their prophet, and since [[Avestan]] literature indicates that revelation happened when Zoroaster was 30 years old, 568 BCE was taken as his year of birth. The date entered written records as the beginning of the era of Zoroaster, and indeed, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This incorrect date is still mentioned in many current encyclopedias as Zoroaster's birth date.

==== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ====
The [[Parthia]]ns (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BCE, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the [[Middle Persian]] names used by the [[Sassanians]]. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month 'Day' was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, [[Ardashir I]], abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian.   This involved a correction to the places of the ''gahanbar'', which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed.   These were placed eight months later, as were the ''epagemonai'', the 'Gatha' or 'Gah' days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name.   Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.   The new dates were:

{|class="wikitable" style="float:centre
!No.||Name||Achaemenid||Choresmian||Sasanian||Time since previous
|-
|1||maidyozarem||(11-) 15 ii (Ardawahisht)||15 v||(11-) 15 x (Day)||45 days

|-
|6||hamaspathmaidyem||(1-) 5 Epagomene||30 iii||(1-) 5 Epagomene||80 days
|}

In AD 224 the vernal equinox at Greenwich fell at noon on 21 March, which was 22 Shahrewar.   Immediately after the reform 21 March corresponded to 27 Shahrewar.   Here is the calendar for AD 225–6:

{|class="wikitable" style="float:centre"

|}

The change caused confusion and was immensely unpopular.   The new ''epagemonai'' were referred to as "robber days".   The people now observed the "Great" ''nowruz'' on 6 Frawardin, which was Zoroaster's birthday and corresponded to 1 Frawardin in the old calendar.   The new 1 Frawardin was observed as the "lesser" ''nowruz''.   [[Hormizd I]] (AD 272–273) made the intervening days into festivals as well.   In AD 273 the vernal equinox at Greenwich fell at 5 AM on 21 March.

[[Yazdegerd I]] reigned from AD 399–420.   In AD 400 the equinox fell about 19 March, which was 9 Aban.   According to al-Biruni, in that reign there was a double adjustment of the start of the ''araji'' year.   The tenth-century astronomer Abu'l-asan Kusyar noted that during the reign of Osrow II (AD 589–628) the sun entered Aries in Adur.   This happened throughout his reign.   An ''araji'' era was introduced dating from AD 621, and the Yazdegerdi era dates from 16 June AD 632, so the Yazdegerdi era is eleven years behind the ''araji''.

===Muslim conquest===

The Muslim rulers who took over from the middle of the seventh century used the Islamic calendar for administration, which caused hardship because the year was shorter – i.e. a tax which was formerly collected after the harvest would now have to be paid before the harvest.   Traditionally the caliph Omar reintroduced the Persian calendar for tax collection purposes.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In AD 895 there was another double readjustment of the start of the ''araji'' year.   It moved from 1 Frawardin (12 April) to 1 Khordad (11 June).   By AD 1006 the vernal equinox, 15 March, was again coinciding with ''nowruz'', 1 Frawardin.   In that year, therefore, the ''epagemonai'' were delayed four months, moving from the end of Aban to their old position at the end of Spandarmad.   This is the calendar for AD 1006/7:

{|class="wikitable" style="float:centre"

|}

The ''gahanbar'' didn't move quite to their old places, because the fifth moved to 20 Day, which was the old 15 Day, thus increasing the interval between the fourth and fifth to eighty days and reducing the interval between the fifth and sixth to 75 days.   The new dates were:

{|class="wikitable" style="float:centre"

=== Medieval era: Jalali calendar ===
{{main article|Jalali calendar}}

From 15 March AD 1079, when the calendar had slipped a further eighteen days, the ''araji'' calendar was reformed  by repeating the first eighteen days of Frawardin.   Thus 14 March was 18 Frawardin ''qadimi'' (old) or ''farsi'' and 15 March was 1 Frawardin ''jalali'' or ''maleki''.   This new calendar was astronomically calculated so did not have ''epagemonai'' – the months began when the sun entered a new sign of the zodiac.

About 120 years after the reform of AD 1006, when the vernal equinox was starting to fall in Ardawahisht, Zoroastrians made it again coincide with ''nowruz'' by adding a second Spandarmad.   This ''Shensai'' calendar was a month behind the ''qadimi'' still used in Persia, being used only by the Zoroastrians in India, the Parsees.   On 6 June 1745 (Old Style) some Parsees re-adopted the ''qadimi'' calendar, and in 1906 some adopted the ''Fasli'' calendar in which 1 Frawardin was equated with 21 March, so that there was a sixth epagomenal day every four years.   In 1911 the ''jalali'' calendar became the official national calendar of Persia.   In 1925 this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernised.   1 Farvardin is the day whose midnight start is nearest to the instant of vernal equinox.   The first six months have 31 days, the next five thirty, and the twelfth has 29 days and 30 in leap years.   Some Zoroastrians in Persia now use the ''Fasli'' calendar, having begun changing to it in 1930.

It does not cover the [[Roman usurper|imperial usurpers]] of the period, including [[Magnentius]], [[Vetranio]], [[Claudius Silvanus]], and Poemenius.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 310 n. 3, with the note that Poemenius probably never claimed the title of Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronology is principally derived from [[Timothy Barnes]]' ''Athanasius and Constantius''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 218&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial additions and further sources are based on recent research that seeks to go beyond Barnes' own chronology and slightly modifying his at a few places.

This article begins its coverage at the death of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] on 22 May 337. After an interregnum of three months, during or after which the army and its agents lynched other potential successors, the three sons of Constantine declared themselves [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]] on 9 September 337.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Discarding their father's succession arrangements, the brothers divided the empire into three parts.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Imperial Chronology," 160.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The original succession plan would have had [[Dalmatius]] rule the dioceses of [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]], [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and [[Hannibalianus]] rule [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and neighboring allied nations. Both were now dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 41.20; ''Origo Constantini Imperatoris'' 35; Barnes, "Imperial Chronology," 160.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Constantinus ruled the provinces of [[Diocese of Gaul|Gaul]], [[Diocese of Britain|Britain]], [[Diocese of Spain|Spain]], and [[Septem Provinciae|Germany]] from [[Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 112;  Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 218.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Constantinus had ruled from Trier before 337 as well.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Imperial Chronology," 161, citing Eusebius, ''Triac''. 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Constantius ruled the provinces of Asia Minor (the [[Roman diocese|dioceses]] of [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Diocese of Asia|Asia]]), [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]], the Levant and Egypt (the  [[Diocese of the East]]) from [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 112; Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Constans ruled Italy, [[Diocese of Africa|Africa]], and the dioceses of [[Diocese of Pannonia|Pannonia]], [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]], and [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] from [[Naissus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 112; Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 340, Constantinus attempted to seize his brother Constans' territory, and was killed in battle during the ensuing civil war. Constans acquired his territory, and ruled from Trier, [[Milan]], and [[Sirmium]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 112&amp;ndash;13; Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 224.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 350, Constans was overthrown and killed in a palace revolution instigated by Magnentius. Magnentius was defeated and killed in the summer of 353 at the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]], making Constantius the sole emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 112&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 351 to 359, Constantius ruled from Sirmium and Milan.&lt;ref name="Barnes, Athanasius, 219"&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius appointed Gallus [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] (subordinate emperor) on 15 March 351, and delegated the rule of the eastern provinces to him. Gallus ruled from Antioch.&lt;ref name="Barnes, Athanasius, 226"&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 226.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently proved violent and cruel, and was recalled and executed in autumn 354.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius appointed Julian, the last surviving male relative of Constantine other than himself, Caesar on 6 November 355.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian ruled the western provinces from [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], [[Sens]], and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Barnes, Athanasius, 226"/&gt; To address [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]] influence and aggression on the eastern frontier, Constantius ruled from Antioch from 360 until his death.&lt;ref name="Barnes, Athanasius, 219"/&gt;

Julian's  troops proclaimed him Augustus in February 360. Constantius did not recognize Julian's claim to the title, but was detained from campaigning against him by Persian raids. Constantius died on 3 November 361 after declaring Julian his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus 21.15.3. John Matthews, ''The Roman Empire of Ammianus'' (London: Duckworth, 1989), 101, treats the account with skepticism: "Whether truthfully or by a useful fiction, he was said while his mind was still lucid to have named Julian as his successor." The date is that of Jones (''Later Roman Empire'', 120) and Barnes (''Athanasius'', 224). See table; Barnes, "Ammianus Marcellinus," 64&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian was sole emperor from Constantius' death until his own death in 363.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''Ammianus'', 105.&lt;/ref&gt; This article ends its coverage at Julian's death on June 26, 363. For a further timeline until 426, consult Matthews, John. Western Aristocracies and Imperial Court A.D. 364-425. Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1975.

A † indicates that a date or an event is uncertain. A superscript S indicates that the manuscript is corrupt, and has been emended to follow [[Otto Seeck]]'s corrections in his edition of the ''Codex Theodosianus''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Imperial Itineraries," 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscript details are given in brackets (as "mss. date" or "mss. year", etc.) for all emended texts. Unsourced events are purely conjectural. Note that some are based on triangulation of different sources and can be, as such, somewhat inexact. These cases have been noted.

|347†, spring{{#tag:ref|A date of c. 350 is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Heather and Moncur, 43; Vanderspoel, 71&amp;ndash;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most contemporary panegyrics, the ''Oratio'' 1 makes few overt references to political events.&lt;ref&gt;Heather and Moncur, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Foerster, the compiler of the modern edition of Libanius' works, ''Libanii Opera'' (1903), argued for a date in the 340s on the belief that Libanius wrote his ''Oratio'' 59 after seeing Themistius' speech. Foerster dated ''Oratio'' 59 to 348/9, a dating most scholars have since followed. Foerster adduced the attestation at Ancyra (where the speech was known to have been delivered) in the ''Codex Theodosianus'' 11.36.8 (see entry above) in favor of a 347 date.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderspoel, 73, citing Foerster, ''Libanii Opera'' (1903), 4.201&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Foerter's view, Otto Seeck argued that since Constans is not mentioned, it must have been delivered after his death. The attestation in the ''Codex Theodosianus'' was not decisive, since Constantius would have passed Ancyra whenever he traveled through Asia Minor. Given that the only other date Constantius could have traveled along this path was in the Autumn of 350,&lt;ref&gt;Callu, 136 n. 18, citing G. Dagron, "L'Empire au IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; S. et les traditions politiques de l'héllenisme," in ''Travaux et Mémoires'' 3 (1968), 20 n. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeck held that to be the only other plausible dating.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderspoel, 73, citing Otto Seeck, ''Die Briefe des Libanius zeitlich geordnet'' (Leipzig, 1906), 293&amp;ndash;94.&lt;/ref&gt; Most twentieth-century scholars followed Seeck.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 313 n. 21; Vanderspoel, ''Themistius'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes and the scholar John Vanderspoel take the 347 date.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 220, 313 n. 21; Vanderspoel, ''Themistius'', 76&amp;ndash;77.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Barnes considers Foerster's premise on Themistius' influence on Libanius "erroneous", the absence of any remarks on the usurpations in the west makes a 350 dating untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Athanasius'', 313 n. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Vanderspoel argues that Themistius' allusion to the destruction of the Persian king by "the virtue of the emperor shining nearby",&lt;ref&gt;Themistius, ''Oratio'' 1.12a&amp;ndash;b, qtd. and tr. Vanderspoel, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; when compared with the catalog of Roman victories against the Persians that occurred while Constantius was merely nearby, and not personally involved, points to a date between the two sieges of Singara in 346 and 348.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderspoel, 75&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

''' José Ignacio García Hamilton''' (1 November 1943{{spaced ndash}}17 June 2009) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer, noted historian, lawyer and politician.  He was elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] for the [[Radical Civic Union]] representing [[Tucumán Province]].

== Biography ==
García Hamilton was born in [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] to Lucía Elena Aráoz and Enrique García Hamilton. He studied at the [[National University of Tucumán]], graduating in 1969, and received his [[PhD]] in Legal and Social Sciences from the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he later was a Professor of history and law. He worked as a columnist and Secretary General of ''[[La Gaceta (Tucumán)|La Gaceta]]'' newspaper in Tucumán - which was owned by his family and edited by his father.&lt;ref&gt;''ETC Magazine'' Yr 1, No. 9: [http://www.etcmagazine.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=393&amp;Itemid=36'José Ignacio García Hamilton'], 6 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded ''El Pueblo'', a local newspaper, in 1972, and was named director of the Association of Provincial Newspapers; his brother, Eduardo, was also a prominent Tucumán journalist, serving as director of ''La Gaceta'', and founder of ''[[Siglo XXI (newspaper)|Siglo XXI]]''. In the mid-1970s, in the final months of the Presidency of [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]], he was imprisoned by the government.&lt;ref name=Cuba&gt;''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'': [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/21/sociedad/s-03701.htm Cuba deportó al historiador José Ignacio García Hamilton], 21 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a columnist for newspapers and magazines in Argentina, [[Uruguay]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Wallenberg&gt;[http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/awards/mendes/sm/jose-ignacio-garcia-hamilton.1037.htm Profile] by the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. Accessed 1 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, after his release from prison and exile to Buenos Aires, García Hamilton initiated his career as a lawyer and founded García Hamilton &amp; Asociados law firm. The firm has grown since then to become an advisory firm providing legal, tax and finance advisory services ([http://estudioghb.com.ar/ GHB Advisory]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), and is now run by his sons.

García Hamilton was the author of numerous books, including ''Hispano-American authoritarianism and unproductiveness'' (1990), and biographies of [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], ''Life of an absentee'' (1993); [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], ''Rowdy Cuyano'' (1997), and [[José de San Martín]], ''Don José'' (2000). ''Don José'' sold over 60,000 copies in Argentina.&lt;ref name=Wallenberg /&gt; He won the [[Konex Award|Merit Diploma]] from the [[Konex Foundation]] for ''Life of an Absentee''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garciahamilton.com.ar/ Official website]. Accessed 1 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He has presented several television programmes on Argentine history.

In 2006, he was deported from [[Cuba]] without explanation. García Hamilton suggested that his ongoing interest in the subject of [[authoritarianism]] in Latin American politics might have been responsible.&lt;ref name=Cuba/&gt;

In 1991 García Hamilton ran as a candidate for vice-governor of Tucumán Province. In 2007 he was elected a national deputy for the province in support of the presidential bid of [[Roberto Lavagna]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo'': [http://www.elsigloweb.com/portal_ediciones/230/portal_notas/9511-garca-hamilton-encabeza-la-nueva-oposicin-poltica García Hamilton encabeza la nueva oposición política] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201140045/http://www.elsigloweb.com/portal_ediciones/230/portal_notas/9511-garca-hamilton-encabeza-la-nueva-oposicin-poltica |date=2007-12-01 }}, 29 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He later spoke out against Lavagna's return to the [[Kirchnerism|Kirchnerist]] fold.&lt;ref&gt;''La Gaceta'': [http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/256959/Politica/Garcia_Hamilton_afirmo_Lavagna_cometio_un_grave_error_politico.html García Hamilton afirmó que Lavagna cometió "un grave error político"], 9 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was vice-president of the interfaith [[NGO]] Casa Argentina en Jerusalem. In 2002, García Hamilton was awarded with the [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/awards/mendes/sm/2002-sousa-mendes.1043.htm Sousa Mendes International Award], and in February 2010, the [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?es/premios/estampilla/estampilla-jose-ignacio-garcia.6363.htm International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation] issued a commemorative set of post stamps in his memory, to remember his dedication to interfaith dialogue and tolerance.

He was married to Graciela Gass, with whom he had six children. He died on 18 June 2009 after a ten-year-long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-126900-2009-06-19.html ''Murió el historiador y diputado García Hamilton''] [[Página 12]], 19 June 2009 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA115,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', p. 115]–121; Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979). ''Gukanshō'', pp. 286–288; Varley, H. Paul. ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', pp. 166–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''February 7, 859''' {{nihongo|''Jōgan gannen''|貞観元年}}&lt;!-- NengoCalc  貞観一年一月一日 --&gt;: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Ten'an'' 3, on the 25th day of the 4th month of 859.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the ''Jōgan'' era==
* '''859''' (''Jōgan 1, 1st month''): All New Year's festivities were suspended because of the period of national mourning for the death of Emperor Montoku.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA116,M1  p. 116.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''864''' (''Jōgan 6, 5th month''): [[Mount Fuji]] erupted during 10 days, and it ejected from its summit an immense quantity of cinders and ash which fell back to earth as far away as the ocean at Edo bay. Many people perished and a great number of homes were destroyed. The volcanic eruption began on the side of Fuji-san closest to Mount Asama, throwing cinders and ash as far away as [[Kai Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA118,M1  p. 118.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''869''' (''Jōgan 10''): Yōzei was born, and he is named Seiwa's heir in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA122,M1  p. 122.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''July 9, 869''' (''May 26, Jōgan 11''). The [[869 Jogan Sanriku earthquake|869 earthquake and tsunami]] devastates a large part of the [[Sanriku]] coast near [[Sendai]].
* '''876''' (''Jōgan 17, 11th month''): In the 18th year of Seiwa''-tennō'' 's reign (清和天皇18年), the emperor ceded his throne to his five-year-old son, which means that the young child received the succession (''senso''). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōzei formally acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA122,M1  p. 122;] Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]],  [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After its collapse, the [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Gutians]], a ''pre-Iranic'' race from [[Ancient Iran]], overran the region for a few decades, making Arrapha their capital, before being ejected from Mesopotamia by the [[Sumer]]ians during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (2112–2004 BC). The city later came to be dominated by the [[Hurrians]] from eastern [[Anatolia]] before being incorporated into the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (2025–1750 BC), after which Arrapha and the whole of northern Mesopotamia, together with parts of north east Syria and south east Turkey, became a part of Assyria proper. During the late 15th century BC Assyria and Arrapha was under the domination of the short-lived [[Mitanni|Mittani]]-Hurrian empire, but after the Assyrians overthrew and destroyed the Hurri-Mitanni in the early 14th century BC the city was once more under Assyrian rule. Arrapha remained an important Assyrian city until the fall of the [[Assyrian empire]] between 615–599 BC. After this it remained a part of the [[geo-political]] province of Assyria ([[Achaemenid Assyria]], [[Athura]], [[Seleucid Syria]], [[Assyria (Roman province)]] and [[Assuristan]]) under various foreign empires, and between the 2nd century BC and 3rd century AD became the capital of the [[Neo-Assyrian]] state of [[Beth Garmai]] before this was conquered into the [[Sassanid empire]] and became a part of [[Assuristan]]. The [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest]] of the 7th century AD saw the dissolution of Assyria as a geo-political entity.

==Etymology==
The ancient name of Kirkuk was the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]] ''Arrap'ha''. During the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era, a ''Korkura/Corcura'' ({{lang-grc|Κόρκυρα}}) is mentioned by [[Ptolemy]], which is believed to refer either to Kirkuk or to the site of [[Baba Gurgur]] {{convert|4.5|km|mi}} from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Balfour, Encyclopaedia Asiatica, p. 214, Cosmo Publications, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Seleucid Empire]] it was known as ''Karkha D-Bet Slokh'', which means 'Citadel of the House of Seleucid'&lt;ref&gt;''The Acts of Mar Mari the Apostle'' By Amir Harrak. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; in Mesopotamian [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]] in that era.&lt;ref&gt;''The World's Greatest Story: The Epic of the Jewish People in Biblical Times'' By [[Joan Comay]]. p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region around Kirkuk was known historically in the [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] Assyrian sources as "Beth Garmai" ({{lang-syr|ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ}}). The name "Beth Garmai" or "Beth Garme" may be of Syriac origin which meaning "the house of bones",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garmai is the plural of Garma/Garmo meaning "bone" |url=http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/cuneiform.languages/syriac/dosearch.php?searchkey=2592&amp;language=id |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727085745/http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/cuneiform.languages/syriac/dosearch.php?searchkey=2592&amp;language=id |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is thought to be a reference to bones of slaughtered [[Achaemenids]] after a decisive battle{{which|date=November 2017}} between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III]] on the plains between the [[Upper Zab]] and [[Diyala river]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Asahel|title=Nestorians|year=1841|publisher=Harper|pages=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5z4AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of a number of independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states which flourished during the [[Parthian empire]] (150 BC-226 AD). Kirkuk itself was the Assyrian ''Karkha D'Beth Slokh'', the metropolitan centre of Beth Garmai.

It is also thought that region was known during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] periods as ''Garmakan'', which means the 'Land of Warmth' or the 'Hot Land'. In [[Persian language|Persian]] "Garm" means warm;&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"&gt;[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/032622FF4B21AC90802570B7005944D1/$file/Talabani_report.pdf Iraq’s Policy of Ethnic Cleansing: Onslaught to change national/demographic characteristics of the Kirkuk Region by Nouri Talabany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222524/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/%28httpDocuments%29/032622FF4B21AC90802570B7005944D1/%24file/Talabani_report.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Seleucid]] period, the city was renamed after king [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], Karkha d' Beth Slokh ("Fort Seleucus"), a corruption of which is at the root of modern name Karkuk/Kirkuk. After the 7th century, Muslim writers used the name ''Kirkheni'' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]] for "citadel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/cuneiform.languages/syriac/dosearch.php?searchkey=13974&amp;language=id meaning of Karkha in Syriac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727085805/http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/cuneiform.languages/syriac/dosearch.php?searchkey=13974&amp;language=id |date=27 July 2011 }}, Syriac dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;) to refer to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rojname.com/show-all-last-minute-news.php?nuce=144940 Kirkuk and its dependencies: Historically part of Kurdistan – II by Mufid Abdulla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927154410/http://www.rojname.com/show-all-last-minute-news.php?nuce=144940 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others used other variant, such as ''Bajermi'' (a corruption of Aramaic "B'th Garmayeh" or ''Jermakan'' (a corruption of Persian Garmakan) .&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"/&gt;
A [[cuneiform script]] found in 1927 at the foot of [[Kirkuk Citadel]] stated that the city of Erekha of Babylonia was on the site of Kirkuk. Other sources consider Erekha to have been simply one part of the larger [[Arrapha]] metropolis.

==History==
===Ancient history===
It is suggested that Kirkuk was one of the places occupied by [[Neanderthals]] based on archeological findings in the [[Shanidar Cave]] settlement.&lt;ref name=CAHipi256&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|Gadd|Hammond|1991|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of pottery shards dating to the [[Ubaid period]] were also excavated from several [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]]s in the city.&lt;ref name=CAHipi374&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|Gadd|Hammond|1991|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[Arrapkha]] was a part of [[Sargon of Akkad]]'s [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC),&lt;ref name=CAHipi433&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|Charlesworth|Boardman|1970|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; and city was exposed to the raids of the [[Lullubi]] during [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin's]] reign.&lt;ref name=CAHipi443&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|Charlesworth|Boardman|1970|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the city was occupied around 2150 BC by [[language Isolate]] speaking Zagros Mountains dwellers who were known as the Gutian people by the Semitic and Sumerian of Mesopotamians. Arraphkha was the capital of the short lived Guti kingdom (Gutium), before it was destroyed and the Gutians driven from Mesopotamia by the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] c. 2090 BC.&lt;ref name="William Gordon East 1961"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux- Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Arrapkha became a part of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (c.2025–1750 BC), before [[Hammurabi]] briefly subjected Assyria to the short lived [[Babylonian Empire]], after which it again became a part of [[Assyria]] c.1725 BC.

However, by the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[Mittani]] of [[Anatolia]] formed a ruling class over the [[language isolate]] speaking [[Hurrians]], and began to expand into a [[Hurri]]-[[Mitanni]] Empire. In the 1450s they attacked Assyria, sacking [[Assur]], and bringing the cities of [[Gasur]] and Arrapkha under their control.&lt;ref name="M. Chahin p. 77"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chahin|first=M|title=Before the Greeks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gal_11QHPqUC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=3 January 2013|year=1996|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-7188-2950-6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; From c.1450 to 1393 BC the kings of Assyria paid tribute to the kingdom of Mittani.&lt;ref name="M. Chahin p. 77"/&gt;

The [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC) overthrew the Hurri-Mitanni in the mid 14th century BC and Arrapha once more became incorporated into [[Assyria]] proper. In the 11th and 10th centuries BC the city rose to prominence, becoming an important city in Assyria until the fall of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talabany|first=Nouri|year=1999|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/business/laur/791/nouri_kirkuk.htm|title=Iraq's Policy of Ethnic Cleansing: Onslaught to change national/demographic characteristics of the Kirkuk Region|accessdate=2006-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010909025453/http://www.fortunecity.com/business/laur/791/nouri_kirkuk.htm|archivedate=9 September 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Hurri-Mitanni domination of Assyria was broken in the 1390s BC, and Arrapkha once more became an integral part of Assyria with the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC) which saw the Hurrian population driven from the region. It remained as such throughout the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) where it became an important Assyrian city.

After the fall of Assyria between 612–599 BC it was still an integral part of the geo-political province of Assyria – [[Achaemenid Assyria]], [[Athura]], [[Seleucid Syria]], [[Assyria (Roman province)]] and [[Assuristan]]. In the [[Parthia]]n and [[Sassanid]] eras Kirkuk was capital of the small Assyrian state of [[Beth Garmai]] (c.160 BC-250 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BĒṮ GARMĒ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bet-garme|publisher=Iranica|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city briefly came to be part of the short lived [[Median Empire]] before falling to the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (546–332 BC) where it was incorporated into the province of [[Athura]] ([[Achaemenid Assyria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker. ''The Pre-Islamic Middle East'', Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Ancient History' p. 178-179"&gt;I. E. S. Edwards, John Boardman, John B. Bury, S. A. Cook. ''The Cambridge Ancient History''. p. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later it became part of the [[Macedonian Empire]] (332–312 BC) and succeeding [[Seleucid Empire]] (311–150 BC) before falling to the [[Parthian Empire]] (150 BC-224 AD) as a part of Athura. The Parthians seemed to only exercise loose control, and a number of small [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdoms sprang up in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD, one such kingdom named  "ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ", (that is Bit Garmai in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]) had Arrapha as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mohsen|first=Zakeri|title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: the origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|year=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03652-8|pages=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity also arose during this period, with Arrapha and its surrounds being influenced by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The [[Sassanid Empire]] destroyed these kingdoms during 3rd and early 4th centuries AD, and Arrapha was incorporated into Sassanid ruled [[Assuristan]] (Sassanid Assyria).

In AD 341, the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Shapur II]] ordered the massacre of all [[Assyrian Christians]] in the Persian Sassanid Empire. During the persecution, about 1,150 were martyred in Arrapha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/Caption.asp?FSID=101122 |title=OCA – Hieromartyr Simeon the Bishop in Persia, and those with him in Persia |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city appears on the [[Peutinger Map]] of this time. The city remained a part of the Sassanid Empire until the [[Islamic conquest]] in the mid 7th century AD.

===After the Islamic Conquests===
[[Arab]] [[Muslims]] fought the [[Sassanid]] empire in the 7th century AD, conquering the region. The city was a part of the Islamic [[Caliphate]] until the tenth century. Kirkuk and the surrounding areas were then ruled by the [[Great Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] for many years. After the divided empire collapsed, the city became a part of [[Zengid dynasty|Turkic Zengid dynasty]] for a century. After the Mongol invasion, the [[Ilkhanate]] State was founded in the region and the city became a part of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]]. The [[Ilkhanate]] region was then conquered by the [[Kara Koyunlu|Black Sheep Turkomans]] and [[Ak Koyunlu|White Sheep Turkomans]]. [[Ottoman Empire]] took control of Iraq, Syria, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Egypt and [[Hejaz]] in the early 16th century. [[Turkish people|Turkish]] rule continued until [[World War I]] when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown in the region by the [[British Empire]].

===British occupation===
At the end of World War I, the British occupied Kirkuk on 7 May 1918. Abandoning the city after about two weeks, the British returned to Kirkuk a few months later after the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. Kirkuk avoided the troubles caused by the British-backed Shaykh Mahmud, who quickly attempted to defy the British and establish his own fiefdom in [[Sulaymaniyah]].

===Entry into the Kingdom of Iraq===
As both Turkey and Great Britain desperately wanted control of the [[Vilayet of Mosul]] (of which Kirkuk was a part), the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 failed to solve the issue. For this reason, the [[Mosul Question|question of Mosul]] was sent to the [[League of Nations]]. A committee travelled to the area before coming to a final decision: the territory south of the "Brussels line" belonged to Iraq. By the Treaty of Angora of 1926, Kirkuk became a part of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].

===Discovery of oil===
{{Main|Kirkuk Field}}
[[File:Kirkukoil.jpg|thumb|[[Baba Gurgur]]]]

In 1927, Iraqi and American drillers working for the foreign-owned and British-led [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC) struck a huge [[oil gusher]] at [[Baba Gurgur]] ("St. Blaze" or father blaze in Kurdish) near Kirkuk. The IPC began exports from the Kirkuk oil field in 1934. The Company moved its headquarters from Tuz Khormatu to a camp on the outskirts of Kirkuk, which they named Arrapha after the ancient city. Arrapha remains a large neighborhood in Kirkuk to this day. The IPC exercised significant political power in the city and played a central role in Kirkuk's urbanization, initiating housing and development projects in collaboration with Iraqi authorities in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Bet-Shlimon, Arbella. 2013.

Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 33, no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the oil industry had an effect on Kirkuk's demographics. The exploitation of Kirkuk's oil, which began around 1930, attracted both Arabs and Kurds to the city in search of work. Kirkuk, which had been a predominantly Turkmen city, gradually lost its uniquely Turkmen character.&lt;ref name="mod-hist-kurds-329-330"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1: Introduction: Kurdish Identity and Social Formation, page 3. // A Modern History of the Kurds.

"Tension had been growing for some time between Turkomans, the originally predominant element, and Kurds who had settled increasingly during the 1930's and 1940's, driven from the land by landlord rapacity and drawn by the chance for employment in the burgeoning oil industry. By 1959 half the population of qo,ooo were Turkoman, rather less than half were Kurds and the balance Arabs, Assyrians and Armenians."&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, large numbers of Kurds from the mountains were settling in the uninhabited but cultivable rural parts of the district of Kirkuk. The influx of Kurds into Kirkuk continued through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Looking into Iraq"&gt;Bruinessen, Martin van, and Walter Posch. 2005. [http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Iraq_paper_ISS.htm#_ftnref30 Looking into Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417225809/http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Iraq_paper_ISS.htm |date=17 April 2017 }}. Paris: European Union Institute for Security Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1957 census, Kirkuk city was 37.63% [[Iraqi Turkmen]], 33.26% [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] with [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] making up less than 23% of its population.&lt;ref name="cris-kirk-2011-43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Understanding radical Islam: medieval ideology in the twenty-first century,Brian R. Farmer, page 154,  2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts believe that poor [[Oil reservoir|reservoir]]-management practices during the [[Saddam Hussein]] years may have seriously, and even permanently, damaged Kirkuk's oil field.  One example showed an estimated {{convert|1500000000|oilbbl}} of excess fuel oil being reinjected. Other problems include refinery residue and gas-stripped [[Petroleum|oil]]. Fuel oil reinjection has increased oil [[viscosity]] at Kirkuk making it more difficult and expensive to get the oil out of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=9 July 2005|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm|title=Kirkuk|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over all, between April 2003 and late December 2004 there were an estimated 123 attacks on Iraqi energy infrastructures, including the country's 7,000&amp;nbsp;km-long [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] system. In response to these attacks, which cost [[Iraq]] billions of US dollars in lost oil-export revenues and repair costs, the US military set up the [[Task Force Shield]] to guard Iraq's energy infrastructure and the [[Kirkuk-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline]] in particular. In spite of the fact that little damage was done to Iraq's oil fields during the war itself, [[looting]] and [[sabotage]] after the war ended was highly destructive and accounted for perhaps eighty percent of the total damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html|title=Iraq|work=Country Analysis Briefs|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=2006-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060606034149/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html|archivedate=6 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of vast quantities of oil in the region after [[World War I]] provided the impetus for the annexation of the former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Vilayet of Mosul (of which the Kirkuk region was a part), to the Iraqi Kingdom, established in 1921. Since then and particularly from 1963 onwards, there have been continuous attempts to transform the ethnic make-up of the region.

Pipelines from Kirkuk run through [[Turkey]] to [[Ceyhan]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and were one of the two main routes for the export of Iraqi oil under the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] following the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. This was in accordance with a United Nations mandate that at least 50% of the oil exports pass through Turkey. There were two parallel lines built in 1977 and 1987.

===Kurdish autonomy and Arabization===
In 1970 the Iraqi government reached an agreement with Kurdish leader [[Mustafa Barzani]] called the [[Iraqi–Kurdish Autonomy Agreement of 1970|March Agreement of 1970]], but the question of whether the oil-rich province of Kirkuk would be included within the Kurdish autonomous region remained unresolved, pending a new census.&lt;ref name="mod-hist-kurds-329-330"&gt;Book IV. Ethno-nationalism in Iraq. – 16. The Kurds under the Baath, 1968–1975, page 329–330. // A Modern History of the Kurds. Author: David McDowall. Third edition. First published in 1996. Third revised and updated edition published in 2004, reprinted in 2007. London: [[I.B. Tauris]], 2007, 515 pages. {{ISBN|9781850434160}}. "It now began to look as if the Baath were playing for time and the year 1971 brought a disintegration of trust between the two parties. The central issue was a demographic one. The census (Article 14) for disputed areas planned for December 1970 had been postponed till the spring by mutual agreement, but when spring came it was unilaterally postponed sine die. Mulla Mustafa accused the government of resettling Arabs in the contested areas, Kirkuk, Khanaqin and Sinjar, and told the government he would not accept the census results if they indicated an Arab majority. He also dismissed the offer of the 1965 census, which he said was forged. When the government proposed to apply the 1957 census to Kirkuk, Mulla Mustafa refused it, since this was bound to show that the Turkomans, although outnumbered in the governorate as a whole, were still predominant in Kirkuk town. Given the residual animosity after the events of July 1959, the Turkomans were likely to opt for Ba'ati rather than Kurdish rule. The Baath thought the Kurds might be packing disputed areas with Kurds from Iran and Turkey, but the real tensions surfaced over the Faili Kurds, resident in Iraq since Ottoman days and yet without Iraqi citizenship. The government argued they were Iranians, and now determined their fate by the simple expedient of expelling roughly 50,000 of them from September onwards."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crisis&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| isbn = 978-0-8122-0604-3| last1 = Anderson| first1 = Liam| last2 = Stansfield| first2 = Gareth| title = Crisis in Kirkuk: The Ethnopolitics of Conflict and Compromise| chapter=2. Kirkuk in the 20th Century |date = 2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the signing of the March Agreement, relations between the Kurds and Iraqi government continued to deteriorate due to the unresolved status of Kirkuk, and there were two attempts to assassinate Barzani in 1972. In response to Barzani's continued demands during the early 1970s for Kirkuk to be recognized as part of the autonomous region under the terms of the March Agreement, settlement construction for newly arrived Arab families increased drastically as the [[Ba'athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq|Ba'athist government implemented Arabization policies]] to increase the Arab population of Kirkuk. Kurds were forbidden from buying property in Kirkuk, and could sell their properities only to Arabs. They were denied permission to renovate properties in need of maintenance, and poor Shi'a Arab families were paid to move to Kirkuk, while Kurds were paid to move out.&lt;ref name=crisis /&gt;

Negotiations between Barzani's [[Kurdish Democratic Party]] and the Iraqi government collapsed in March 1974 and Barzani rejected President [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] declaration of Kurdish autonomy. Many disputes persisted between the Kurds and Arabs and the conflict escalated into the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War]] (also called the Barzani rebellion). The rebellion collapsed after Iran withdrew it's support for Barzani's forces following the [[1975 Algiers Agreement]] and the Ba'ath regime intensified Arabization efforts.&lt;ref name=crisis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-94575-6| last = Peretz| first = Don| title = The Middle East Today| chapter=15. Iraq |date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Barzani's rebellion was defeated in 1974, the districts of [[Chemchemal]] and [[Kelar]], which had been part of Kirkuk, became part of [[Sulaymaniyah]] and [[Kifri]] became part of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala province]]. Other Arab-populated districts, like [[Al Zab|Zab]], became part of Kirkuk.&lt;ref name=Ihsan&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-317-09016-8| last = Ihsan| first = Mohammed| title = Nation Building in Kurdistan: Memory, Genocide and Human Rights| chapter=2.

The expulsions continued after the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991 uprisings]]. Kurdish villages were razed and thousands of new homes were built, including at least 200 homes for relatives of Iraqi soldiers killed during the [[Iran–Iraq War|Iran-Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=crisis /&gt; Between 1968, when the Ba'ath Party first rose to power in Iraq, and 2003 between 200,000 and 300,000 persons were forcibly relocated out of Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-317-96875-7| last = Stroschein| first = Sherrill| title = Governance in Ethnically Mixed Cities| chapter=The Future of Kirkuk |date = 2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Iraqi Ministry of Planning, by August 2005 (during the Iraq War), approximately 224,544 Kurds had returned to Kirkuk and 52,973 Arab persons had left the city.&lt;ref name=Ihsan /&gt;

===Nationalization of Iraqi Petroleum Company===
In 1972 the Iraqi government, led by then Vice-President Saddam Hussein, nationalized the [[Iraqi Petroleum Company]] (IPC), after being unable to reach an agreement that would increase oil exports and resolve a longstanding dispute over [[Law 80 of 1961]]. The Iraqi government began to sell its oil to [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc]] countries and the IPC's French partner CFP. After reaching an agreement with the Iraqis in 1973, the IPC members were able to retain some of their interests in southern Iraq through the [[Basra Petroleum Company]] but had lost Iraq's main oilfields, including the Kirkuk field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-78515-0| last = Bamberg| first = James| title = British Petroleum and Global Oil 1950-1975: The Challenge of Nationalism| chapter=18.

===The First Gulf War===
In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded [[Kuwait]] and was quickly routed by the United States in the [[First Gulf War]] (also called ''Operation Desert Storm''). In the aftermath of the Iraqi army's defeat, rebellions broke out in Iraq; first in southern Iraq on March 1, and in the northern Kurdish region a few days later. By March 24 Kurdish ''[[peshmerga]]'' forces had seized control of Kirkuk , but they were only able to hold it until March 28 when it was reclaimed by Hussein's forces.&lt;ref name=sluglett&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-0-85771-373-5| last1 = Farouk-Sluglett| first1 = Marion| last2 = Sluglett| first2 = Peter| title = Iraq Since 1958: From Revolution to Dictatorship|chapter=9. The Risings in the Shi'i South and Kurdistan |date = 2001-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US and UK began to enforce a [[no-fly zone]] in Northern Iraq and a ''de facto'' Kurdish Autonomous region emerged in the North. Arabs families were expelled from the Kurdish region and relocated to Kirkuk, which was still controlled by the Iraqi government. In these circumstances, Hussein's government further intensified the decades long policy of Arabization in Kirkuk, requiring that Kurds, Turkmen and Assyrians fill out "ethnic identity correction" forms and register as Arabs and many who refused to comply were forcibly relocated north of the Green Line.&lt;ref name=crisis /&gt;
In May 1991, [[Massoud Barzani]] announced that [[Baghdad]] had conceded Kirkuk as the capital of the autonomous region, but when the Iraqi government demanded the Kurds join the Ba'athist government the dispute once again escalated to violent conflict and in October 1991 Iraqi forces had withdrawn from several Kurdish provinces in the North including [[Erbil]], [[Dohuk]] and [[Sulaymaniyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Pluto Press| isbn =978-0-7453-2662-7| last = Yildiz| first = Kerim| title = The Kurds in Iraq: The Past, Present and Future| chapter=The First Gulf War: From Uprising to Democracy | year=2007| jstor = 10.2307/j.ctt18fs45h| doi =10.2307/j.ctt18fs45h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War (2003-2011)===
[[File:Iraqi Personnel Graduate From Kirkuk Training Center DVIDS236956.jpg|thumb|Iraqi Personnel Graduate From Kirkuk]]

American and British military forces led an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in March 2003, marking the start the [[Iraq War|Second Iraq War]]. Kurdish ''peshmerga'' fighters assisted in the 2003 capture of Kirkuk. Though the ''peshmerga'' were allowed to operate even after the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) disbanded and outlawed most of the armed militias in Iraq, the ''peshmerga'' were eventually asked to withdraw from Kirkuk and other Kurdish held provinces.&lt;ref name=federalism /&gt;

Under the supervision of chief executive of [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] [[L. Paul Bremer]], a convention was held on 24 May 2003 to select the first City Council in the history of this oil-rich, ethnically divided city. Each of the city's four major [[ethnic groups]] was invited to send a 39-member [[delegation]] from which they would be allowed to select six to sit on the City Council. Another six council members were selected from among 144 delegates to represent independents social groups such as teachers, lawyers, religious leaders and artists.

Kirkuk's 30 members council is made up of five blocs of six members each. Four of those blocs are formed along ethnic lines—[[Kurd]]s, [[Arab]]s, [[Assyria]]n and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]]—and the fifth is made up of [[independent (politician)|independents]]. Turkmen and Arabs complained that the [[Kurd]]s allegedly hold five of the seats in the independent block. They were also infuriated that their only representative at the council's helm was an assistant mayor whom they considered pro-Kurdish. [[Abdul Rahman Mustafa]] ({{lang-ar|عبدالرحمن مصطفى }}), a [[Baghdad]]-educated lawyer was elected mayor by 20 [[votes]] to 10. The appointment of an Arab, [[Ismail Ahmed Rajab Al Hadidi]] ({{lang-ar|اسماعيل احمد رجب الحديدي }}), as deputy mayor went some way towards addressing Arab concerns.

On 30 June 2005, through a secret direct voting process, with the participation of the widest communities in the province and despite all the political legal security complexities of this process in the country generally and in Kirkuk in particular, Kirkuk witnessed the birth of its first elected Provincial Council. The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq IECI approved and announced the outcomes of this process, which filled the 41 seats of [[Kirkuk Provincial Council]] as follows:
* 26 seats 367 List Kirkuk Brotherhood List KBL
* 8 seats 175 List Iraqi Turkmen Front ITF
* 5 seats 299 List Iraqi Republic Gathering
* 1 seats 178 List Turkmen Islamic Coalition
* 1 seats 289 List Iraqi National Gathering

The new [[Kirkuk Provincial Council]] started its second turn on 6 March 2005. Its inaugural session was dedicated to the introduction of its new members, followed by an oath ceremony supervised by Judge Thahir Hamza Salman, the Head of Kirkuk Appellate Court.

Kirkuk is located in a disputed area of Iraq that runs from [[Sinjar]] on the Syrian border southeast to [[Khanaqin]] and [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]] on the Iranian border.&lt;ref name=bartu&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 86| last = Bartu| first=Peter |title = Wrestling with the integrity of a nation: the disputed internal boundaries in Iraq| journal = International Affairs| jstor = 40929765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkuk has been a disputed territory for around eighty years — Kurds have wanted Kirkuk to become part of [[Kurdistan Regional Government]], which has been opposed by the regions Arab and Turkmen populations.

The Kurds sought to annex the long disputed territory to the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) through Article 140 of the [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi Constitution]] that was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref name=gunter&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield| isbn = 978-1-5381-1050-8| last = Gunter| first = Michael M.| title = Historical Dictionary of the Kurds| date = 2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=galbraith /&gt; Under Article 140 the Ba'athist Arabization policy would be reversed: Displaced Kurds who had relocated to areas in the Kurdish autonomous region would return to Kirkuk, while the Arab Shi'a population would be compensated and relocated to areas in the south. After the Ba'athist regimes demographic and redistricting policies were undone a census and referendum would determine whether Kirkuk would be administered by the KRG or Baghdad.&lt;ref name=bartu /&gt;

Following the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]] the Kurds signed the [[Erbil Agreement]] and backed [[Nouri al-Maliki]] on the condition that Article 140 would be implemented.&lt;ref name=federalism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-317-11292-1| last = Danilovich| first = Alex| title = Iraqi Federalism and the Kurds: Learning to Live Together| chapter=2.

===Violence after US withdrawal===

Five churches in Kirkuk were targeted with bombs in August 2011&lt;ref&gt;[[Barnabas Fund]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}} On 12 July 2013, Kirkuk was hit by a deadly bomb, killing 38 people in an attack on a café.

A report by the [[International Crisis Group]] points out that figures from the 1977 and 1997 censuses (see below) "are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation" because Iraqi citizens were only allowed to indicate belonging to either the Arab or Kurdish ethnic groups;&lt;ref name=ICG&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2008|title= Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds: Conflict or Cooperation?|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Iraq_08_11_13_Turkey_and_Iraqi_Kurds_Conflict_or_Cooperation.pdf|publisher=[[International Crisis Group]]|page=16|accessdate=19 June 2018|quote=In Kirkuk governorate overall, the Kurds were the largest group (187,593), with the Arabs second (109,620) and the Turkomans third (83,371). Subsequent censuses, in 1967, 1977, 1987 and 1997, are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation. Moreover, the last three reflect the changes wrought by Arabisation, when Iraqis could indicate belonging to one of two ethnicities only: Arab or Kurd. This meant that many Turkomans identified themselves as Arabs (the Kurds not being a desirable ethnic group in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq), thereby skewing the numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, this skewed the number of other ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=ICG/&gt; Many Turkmen declared themselves as Arabs (because the Kurds were not desirable under [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime), reflecting the changes wrought by [[Arabisation]].&lt;ref name=ICG/&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
[[File:Kirkuk Demographical Map 2014.png|237px|right|thumb|Ethnic groups in Kirkuk and its environs in 2014{{dubious|date=February 2018}}, at the time of the capture of the area by Kurdish forces.]]
The three largest ethnicities in Kirkuk are Turkmen, Kurdish and Arabs.

====Kurds====
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
[[Kurdish people|Kurds]] have a long history in Kirkuk before the [[Baban]] family.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The [[Baban]] family was a Kurdish family that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, dominated the political life of the province of [[Sharazor]], in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan. The first member of the clan to gain control of the province and its capital, Kirkuk, was Sulayman Beg. Enjoying almost full autonomy, the Baban family established Kirkuk as their capital. It was from this time that Kurds in Iraq began to view Kirkuk as their capital. This persisted even after the Babans moved their administration to the new town of Sulaymaniya, named after the dynasty's founder, in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=encyclopedia+of+the+ottoman+empire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PdV4PdGMx7&amp;sig=pPCly6cFOp920yG7lz8sug5yO9A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ArujTbi3HKuy0QH3-_HoCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'',  Baban Family Entry], p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman====

&lt;!--[[File:Misaki-milli.jpg|frame|left|Misak-ı Milli]]--&gt;
The [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen/Turkoman]] are descendants of numerous Turkic migration waves. The earliest arrivals date back to the [[Umayyads]] and [[Abbasid]] eras, when they arrived as military recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Gordon, The Breaking of a Thousand Swords: A History of the Turkish Military of Samarra, A.H. 200-275/815-889 C.E., SUNY Press, 2001, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable Turcoman settlement continued during the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] era when [[Tughril|Toghrul]] entered Iraq in 1055 with his army composed mostly of [[Oghuz Turks]]. Kirkuk remained under the control of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Empire for 63 years. However, the largest Turkic migration waves occurred during the four centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (1535–1919) when Turkish migrants from [[Anatolia]] were encouraged to settle in the region;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Taylor|first=Scott|year=2004|title=Among the Others: Encounters with the Forgotten Turkmen of Iraq|place=|publisher=Esprit de Corps Books|page=31|isbn=978-1-895896-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, it is largely from this period that modern Turkmens claim association with [[Anatolia]] and the modern [[Republic of Turkey|Turkish state]].&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=17"/&gt;

In particular, following the conquest of Iraq by the Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1535, Kirkuk came firmly under Ottoman control and was referred to “Gökyurt” (Blue Homeland) in the Ottoman records, "perhaps indicating that Kirkuk was identified as a particularly Turkic town by that time."&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=17"&gt;{{citation |last1=Anderson|first1=Liam D.|last2=Stansfield|first2=Gareth R.

Currently Iraqi Turkmen politicians hold just over 20 percent of seats on Kirkuk's city council, while Turkmen leaders say they make up nearly a third of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkmen-iraq-between-rock-and-hard-place-1460749597|title=The Turkmen of Iraq: Between a rock and a hard place

====Arabs====
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The principal Arab extended families in the city of Kirkuk were: the [[Tikrit]]i and the [[Hadidi (tribe)|Hadidi]] ({{lang-ar|حديدي}}). The Tikriti family was the main [[Arab]] family in Kirkuk coming from [[Tikrit]] in the 17th century. Other [[Arab]] tribes who settled in Kirkuk during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Period are the [[Al-Ubaid (tribe)|Al-Ubaid]] ({{lang-ar|آل عبيد}}) and the [[Al-Jiburi]] ({{lang-ar|آل جبور}}). The Al-Ubaid came from just northwest of Mosul when they were forced out of the area by other Arab tribes of that region. They settled in the [[Hawija]] district in Kirkuk in 1805 during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Period.&lt;ref&gt;Book Bedouins, Part I: Mesopotamia, Syria, northern Iraq, Al-Ubaid, Author Max Oppenheim&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assyrians====
The Assyrians have an ancient history in Kirkuk, as they do throughout northern Iraq. As [[Arrapha]] it was a part of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (c.1975–1750 BC), and fully incorporated into Assyria proper by the 14th century BC during the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–105 BC), and remained so until the downfall of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] between 615 and 599 BC. After this it was an integral part of [[Achaemenid Assyria]] ([[Athura]]), and during the [[Parthian Empire]] was centre to an independent [[Neo Assyrian]] state named [[Beth Garmai]], before being incorporated into [[Assuristan]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]].

The Seleucid town, like many other [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n cities had a significant [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population. Christianity was established among them in the 2nd century by the bishop Tuqrītā (Theocritos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=BĒṮ SELŌḴ | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=24 June 2014 | author=Morony, Michael | year=1989 | volume=IV | pages=188 | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bet-selok}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Sasanian times the town became an important centre of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], with several of its bishops rising to the rank of Patriarch. Tensions among Christians and Zoroastrians led to a severe persecution of Christians during the reign of [[Shapur II]] (309–379 A.D.) as recorded in the Acts of the Persian Martyrs. Persecution resumed under [[Yazdegerd II]] in 445 A.D. who massacred thousands of them. Their situation greatly improved under the Sasanians in the following two centuries after the advent of a national Persian church of free of [[Byzantine]] influence, namely [[Nestorianism]].&lt;ref name="Bosworth 1954 144"&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|1954|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Sasanian times the town became an important centre of the [[Church of the East]], with several of its bishops rising to the rank of Patriarch.

Persecution resumed under [[Yazdegerd II]] in 445 A.D. who massacred thousands of them. Tradition puts the death toll at 12,000 among them the patriarch [[Shemon Bar Sabbae]].&lt;ref name="Antioch)2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Afram I Barsoum|first1=|authorlink1=Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum|last2=Moosa|first2=Matti|title=The Scattered Pearls: A History of Syriac Literature and Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0f-eB_KK7fAC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2003|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-931956-04-8|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The city was known as the centre of the prosperous [[Beth Garmaï (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of Beth Garmai]] which lingered until the conquests of [[Timur Leng]] in 1400 A.D.
During the Ottoman period most of Kirkuk's Christians followed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] whose bishop resided in the Cathedral of the Great Martyrion which dates back to the 5th century. The Cathedral was however used as a powder storage and was blown up as the Ottomans retreated in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|1954|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of oil brought more Christians to Kirkuk, however they were also affected by the Arabization policy of the Baath Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2013|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2013|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they occupy 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2013|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; They number around 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Iraq_Kirkuk_Ethnic_lg.png Kirkuk and environs – Ethnic composition, 2014] Created by [[Mehrdad Izady]], Gulf 2000 Project. Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Armenians====
The Armenians of Kirkuk established a church in the old part of the city in 1906, and the population grew afterwards with the arrival of refugees from the [[Armenian Genocide]]. During the rule of Saddam Hussein, many Armenians were killed and deported. There are currently around 500 in the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Jews====
Jews had a long history in Kirkuk.  Ottoman records show that in 1560 there were 104 Jewish homes in Kirkuk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomaticobserver.com/EN/belge/2-1783/a-note-on-the-population-distribution-of-kirkuk-subdivi-.html |title=Diplomatic Observer |publisher=Diplomatic Observer |date=2 December 2004 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121115704/http://www.diplomaticobserver.com/EN/belge/2-1783/a-note-on-the-population-distribution-of-kirkuk-subdivi-.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1896 there were 760 Jews in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/1075/who-owns-kirkuk-the-kurdish-case#_ftn1 |title=Who Owns Kirkuk? The Kurdish Case :: Middle East Quarterly |publisher=Meforum.org |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, the Jewish population increased, especially after Kirkuk became a petroleum center; in 1947 there were 2,350 counted in the census.  Jews were generally engaged in commerce and handicraft.  Social progress was slow, and it was only in the 1940s that some Jewish students acquired secondary academic education.  By 1951 almost all of the Jews had left for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11168.html |title=Kirkuk |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sites==
Ancient architectural monuments of Kirkuk include:
* [[Kirkuk Citadel|the citadel]]
* [[Qishla of Kirkuk|the ''qishla'']]
* the [[Daniel in Islam|Prophet Daniel]]'s [[Tomb of Daniel|Tomb]]
* the market Bazari Pirehmerd
* [[Qaysareyah of Kirkuk]]

The archaeological sites of Qal'at [[Jarmo]] and [[Yorgan Tepe]] are found at the outskirts of the modern city. In 1997, there were reports that the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] "demolished Kirkuk's historic citadel with its mosques and ancient church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/1075#_ftn11 |title=Who Owns Kirkuk? The Kurdish Case :: Middle East Quarterly |publisher=Meforum.org |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2000/photo3.htm |title=Kirkuk Citadel |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural heritage of Kirkuk sustained serious damage during [[World War I]] (when some pre-Muslim Assyrian Christian monuments were destroyed) and, more recently, during the [[Iraq War]]. [[Simon Jenkins]] reported in June 2007 that "eighteen ancient shrines have been lost, ten in Kirkuk and the south in the past month alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=In Iraq's four-year looting frenzy, the allies have become the vandals | first=Simon | last=Jenkins | date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Kirkuk experiences a hot [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: BSh) with extremely hot and dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Snow is rare but it has fallen in 22 February 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cole|first=William|title=Rare Iraq snowfall lifts troops' spirits|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/dispatches/stories/022304b|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=23 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 10 to 11 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq under cold front bringing snow and below zero temperatures |url=http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2008/jan/11/iraq_under_cold_front_bringing_snow_and_below_zero_temperatures.html |accessdate=3 March 2013 |newspaper=Indian Muslims |date=11–12 January 2008 |agency=Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) |quote=BAGHDAD, Jan 11 (KUNA) – Snow fell on large areas of Iraq following two days of low temperature.  Dr. Daoud Shaker, head of the Iraqi weather bureau told the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) snow fell in Baghdad during two hours in the morning on Friday after coming under the effect of two pressure systems, one cold originating from Siberia and the other warm coming from the sea. He said the temperature on Friday was "below zero in several Iraqi areas" resulting in snowfalls Thursday in several western areas. But the snowfall continued on Friday along with the low temperatures, he added.  He predicted that the snowfalls and rain would subside as of Friday night paving the way for subzero temperatures in the next few days that could reach six degrees Celsius below zero specifically at night. He added that the snow that fell on Baghdad has melted. But in Kirkuk and several northern cities including Suleimaniah, snow fell again on Friday along with very low temperatures. According to weather sources, up to four millimeters of snow fell on Kirkuk Friday. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928003714/http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2008/jan/11/iraq_under_cold_front_bringing_snow_and_below_zero_temperatures.html |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lapidary''' is a text, often a whole book, giving "information about the properties and virtues of precious and semi-precious stones", that is to say a work on [[gemology]].&lt;ref&gt;Glick et al, 306; Vauchez, 821&lt;/ref&gt; Lapidaries were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], when belief in the inherent power of gems for various purposes was widely held, and among the wealthy collecting jewels was often an obsession, as well as a popular way to store and transport capital.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton&lt;/ref&gt;  

The medieval world had little systematic geological knowledge, and found it difficult to distinguish between many stones with similar colours, or the same stone found in a variety of colours.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; Lapidaries are often found in conjunction with [[herbal]]s, and as part of larger encyclopedic works.  Belief in the powers of particular types of jewel to achieve effects such as protecting the wearer against diseases or other kinds of harm was strong in the Middle Ages, and explaining these formed much of the material in lapidaries.  In the Middle Ages, scholars often distinguish "three different kinds of lapidaries: 1. the scientific lapidary 2. the magical or astrological lapidary and 3. the Christian symbolic lapidary", although contemporary readers would have regarded both the first two categories as representing scientific treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, quoted; Harris, 11 note 15, 35–39.  Harris, 11–15 gives her own classification into six types.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The objects regarded as "stones" in the classical, medieval Renaissance periods included many now classified as metallic compounds such as [[cinnabar]], [[haemetite]], [[calamine]], or organic or fossil substances including [[pearl]], [[coral]], [[amber]], and the mythical [[lyngurium]] described below.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 14–16, 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;  

There were traditions of lapidary texts outside Europe, in the Islamic world as well as East Asia. The Chinese tradition was for long essentially concerned with the aesthetic qualities of stones, but by the later Middle Ages were influenced by the classical Western tradition, as transmitted through Islamic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sources==
The tradition goes back to ancient [[Mesopotamia]] with books like [[Abnu šikinšu]].  [[Theophrastus]] (died c. 287 BC) treated rocks and other minerals as well as gems, and remained a significant indirect source for the scientific tradition; he was all but unknown in Europe in the Middle Ages, and not translated into Latin until the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, 359–360; Wheaton&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to fill out with specifics the general remarks on minerals of [[Aristotle]], and took an approach more compatible with modern concepts of [[mineralogy]] than any other writer of a full-length treatise on the subject until [[Georgius Agricola]] in the 16th century, widely recognised as the "father" of modern mineralogy.  Both concentrated on the appearance of a wide range of minerals, where they came from, and how they were extracted and used.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 45–50&lt;/ref&gt; While Pliny and others wrote on how to detect fake or imitation gems, some, like [[Jean d'Outremeuse]] (d. 1400), described how to make them in coloured glass, which by the Late Middle Ages was recommended for use in church metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Vauchez, 822; Harris, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Most classical lapidaries are lost; of the 38 works listed by Pliny (in Book XXXVII), only Theophrastus' text survives.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 55&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of different medieval texts, but most are mainly based on a number of large works which were redacted, translated and adapted in various ways to suit the needs of the individual manuscript. The oldest of these sources was [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] from the 1st century AD, Book 37 of which covered gems, drawing on Theophrastus and other classical predecessors.  [[Solinus]] was another ancient source, and [[Isidore of Seville]] an early medieval one.  Later works, which also drew on Arabic sources ([[Avicenna]]'s work was available in Latin), included the verse ''De Gemmis'' (or ''De Lapidibus'') by Bishop [[Marbode of Rennes]] (d. 1123), the most popular late medieval lapidary, describing 60 stones, and works by [[Arnold of Saxony]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and that traditionally attributed (probably wrongly) to [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Glick et al, 306; Vauchez, 821–822; Harris, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of Marbode's work were translated into eight languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], and 33 manuscripts survive of the English version alone.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, 362&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other areas, medieval scholarship was highly conservative. Theophrastus had described [[lyngurium]], a gemstone supposedly formed of the solidified urine of the [[lynx]] (the best ones coming from wild males), which was included in "almost every medieval lapidary" until it gradually disappeared from view in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, 365, quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
Just as drugs derived from plants were and are important in medicine, it seemed natural to the ancient and medieval mind that minerals also had medical properties (and indeed many mineral-derived chemicals are still in medical use).  Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], the dominant theologian of the Late Middle Ages, propounded the view that the whole of the natural world had ultimately been created by God for the benefit of man, leading medieval Christians to expect to find beneficial uses for all materials.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1–2, 41–42, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Lapidaries listed the medical benefits of particular gems, with "the most common method of medical application" being wearing the stone on one's person in a jewellery setting, for example in a ring.  Open-backed settings allowing direct contact between the skin and stone were encouraged; otherwise the stone might simply be held against the skin.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 8–9, 8 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of application included [[ointment]]s containing ground stones or taking the stone internally in ground form, often as part of a cocktail of several different herbal, mineral and other ingredients; this seems to have become especially often mentioned in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; There were other methods of application; Theophrastus is much less concerned with medical aspects of his subject than the writers of later lapidaries, but he notes that [[smaragus]] is good for the eyes, and operates by being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Stones were covered in other general medical books, ranging from the 1st century Greek ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' by [[Dioscurides]] to a wide range of Early Modern medical self-help books.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 50–55, 13–14, 30–34, 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian symbolism==
A school of lapidaries expounded the symbolism of [[List of precious stones in the Bible|gems mentioned in the Bible]], especially two sets of precious and semi-precious stones listed there. The first of these were the twelve jewels, in [[engraved gem]] form, on the [[Priestly breastplate]] described in the [[Book of Exodus]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|28:15–19|}}), and the second the twelve stones mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]] as forming the [[New Jerusalem#Foundation stones|foundation stones of the New Jerusalem]] ({{Bibleverse||Revelation|21:18–20|}})—eight of these are the same (or were in the [[Vulgate]] translation).  The late [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Old English Lapidary]] took the latter group as its subject.  The symbolism of these sets had been explored by theologians since Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Vauchez, 821; Walton, 362&lt;/ref&gt; Various other schemes were developed, linking stones to particular saints, classes of angels, and other areas of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrology==
Another type of lapidary dealt with the [[History of astrology#Medieval and Renaissance Europe|astrological]] relationships and significance of gems; one of the largest was the ''Lapidary of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]]'' or "Alfonso the Learned", King of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] (r. 1252–1284), which was compiled for him by other authors, mostly Muslim.  This was in several parts and set out the relationships between the [[Signs of the Zodiac]], with each degree of each sign relating to a stone, and the astrological planets and other bodies, again related to particular stones. The strength of the medical and magical properties of stones was said to vary with the movements of the heavenly bodies that controlled them.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 424–426; Nunemaker, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
===Japan===
* This statue in Kyoto is a memorial to the Unknown Scout Soldier, representing a true story during a fierce battle in [[Okinawa]] during World War II. The inscription on the memorial reads as follows "This statue is a memorial of a true story of a fierce battle in World War II, which happened on an island in the South Pacific Ocean somewhere. An American soldier was seriously wounded, and he was lying where he had fallen. The sound of gunfire stopped, and the surroundings quieted down. He heard someone's footsteps approaching him. A Japanese soldier who had a gun with a bayonet was standing over him when he opened his eyes. He thought that he was going to be killed by the Japanese soldier, and he fainted. After a while, he woke up. He found a white slip of paper on the sand by his side, and he put it in his pocket. He was carried on a stretcher to the field operations aid station soon after that. When he was put on the operating table, he remembered the slip of paper in his pocket, and gave it to the doctor. It was a message from the Japanese soldier, and was as follows: "When I was about to kill you, you made the three fingered Scout salute. I am a Scout. A Scout is a brother. Therefore, I could not kill any person who lost the fighting spirit. I tended to your wound. Good luck!" After the war, the American soldier and his father visited the Boy Scout headquarters in the United States, and told this story. They donated money for the Boy Scouts to put up a monument to the Scouting Spirit. In 1952, Mr. Finnel came to inspect the Boy Scout movement of Japan from the headquarters in the United States and passed on this true story as a fine anecdote from during the war. The American soldier's name is not known. The Japanese soldier was killed. This monument is to the Unknown Scout Soldier. This is an example of the Scout Spirit of Japan."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerknapp.com/download/JapanMonumentforBoyScout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">'''Martin Hiberniensis'''  ('''Martin the Irishman''')  (819 - 875), was a [[teacher]], [[scribe]], and master of the [[cathedral school]] at [[Laon]].

==Background==
Hiberniensis, ''"one of the greatest Irish Carolingian scholars,"'' notes that he was an exile in &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|last=Breen|first=Aidan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521633314|location=|pages=404–5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annals of Laon'' (''Annales Laudunenses''). There is not much known about the reason for his exile, or what happened after.

==Career==
Martianus is assumed to have been a [[Laity|lay]] [[teacher]] all his adult life; there is no indication that he was a [[monk]]. He settled at Laon in the late 840s during the term of Bishop [[Pardule]]. By the early 850s, he was master of the cathedral school where he remained until the end of his life. His students included [[Dido (medieval student)|Dido]], [[Manno]], [[Bernard]], and [[Hincmar]].

His intellectual interests included [[computus]], [[exegesis]], [[medicine]], [[history]], [[grammar]], and [[Greek language|Greek]]. He annotated the ''Annals of Laon,'' the computistical works of [[Bede]]. He also provided a commentary on [[Martianus Capella]]'s ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' and preserved fragments of a lost commentary on [[Virgil]] by [[Aelius Donatus]].

Following the deposition of Hincmar, Martianus actively helped restore order in the cathedral chapter.

A copy of a letter from Martianus to a fellow humanist, [[Servatus Lupus]] of [[Ferrières Abbey|Ferrières]], has survived. Martianus is thought to have corresponded with Irish and continental scholars at the court of [[Charles the Bald]].

==Greek literature==
''"Martin is especially remarkable for his considerable knowledge of Greek, being particularly noted as the scribe of the most extensive Greek-Latin [[thesaurus]] then in existence in western Europe (Laon MS 444), which he may possibly have copied from an Irish exemplar. He has also been credited with a work known as 'Scholica graecarum glossarum,' a series of notes on Greek words. Additionally, he copied some Greek verse by [[John Scottus Eriugena]], with whom he appears to have been acquainted."'' (Breen, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;405)

==Scribal innovations==
Martianus was an innovative [[calligrapher]].  He contributed to what is called the 'grammar of legibility' by use of word separation and punctuation, almost unheard of in his lifetime. ''"In his role as teacher and supervisor of a school of scribes he cultivated the use of [[Carolingian minuscule]], a very neat and legible type" in place of his native [[insular script]]'' (Breen, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;405)

At least twenty-one manuscripts survive containing specimens of his [[autograph]], which are now housed in Laon, Paris, and Berlin.

==Manuscripts==
Martianus was an avid collector of manuscripts, which he bequeathed to Laon.

==Summation==
Breen (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;405) describes Martianus's legacy as not as an original thinker and translator of works in Greek, but as a [[humanism|humanist]] and [[educator]] of great distinction."''

'''Martin Bauzer''' (11 November 1595 &amp;ndash; 23 December 1668), also known as '''Martin Bavčer''' (other spellings: Martin Baučer, Martin Bavčar), was a [[historian]] from [[County of Görz|Gorizia]] who wrote in [[Latin]].

Bauzer was born in the village of [[Selo, Ajdovščina|Selo]] near [[Ajdovščina]] in the [[Vipava Valley]], in what was then the [[County of Gorizia]], a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (now the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region of northeastern Italy). He studied [[philosophy]] and graduated from it in the [[Moravia]]n town of [[Brno]], where he also joined the [[Jesuit]] order. He then studied [[theology]] before being ordained a [[Catholic priest]].

Bauzer's most important work is ''The History of [[Noricum]] and [[Friuli]]'' (''Historia rerum Noricarum et Forojuliensium''; 1663), written in Latin in ten books and comprising a period going from the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] to the coronation of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. In its original language, it has never been published, but it was published in the Slovene translation in 1975 and in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=xw7yXrOGhgMC&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Historiografija in mentaliteta v novoveški Furlaniji in Goriški |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Historiography and Mentality in the Early Moder Period Friuli and the County of Gorizia |first=Neva |last=Makuc |year=2001 |publisher=Založba ZRC |isbn=9789612543068 |pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other important works include a Chronicle of Contemporary Events and a comprehensive biography of the [[Counts of Gorizia]].

Bauzer died in [[Gorizia]] in 1668.

According to the Slovene historian [[Bogo Grafenauer]], Bauzer's descriptions of earlier periods are of little worth, while his accounts of contemporary events are an important source for the history of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bogo |last=Grafenauer |title=Struktura in tehnika zgodovinske vede |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Structure and the Technique of the Historical Science |year=1960 |place=Ljubljana |publisher=University of Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9611">The '''mill''' or ('''₥''') (sometimes '''mil''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], when discussing [[property taxes]] in the [[United States]], or previously in [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]]) is a now-abstract unit of [[currency]] used sometimes in [[Coin of account|accounting]]. In the United States, it is a notional unit equivalent to {{frac|1000}} of a [[United States dollar]] (a one-hundredth of a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] or a tenth of a [[cent (currency)|cent]]). In the [[United Kingdom]] it was proposed during the decades of discussion on the [[Decimal Day|decimalization of the pound]] as a {{frac|1000}} division of the [[pound sterling]].  Several other currencies used the mill, such as the [[Maltese lira]].

The term comes from the [[Latin]] "millesimum", meaning "thousandth part".&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 6th Ed, Vol. 1, at 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===United States===
[[File:Missouri 1 Mill Tax Token.jpg|thumb|right|[[Missouri]] mill token]]
In the United States, the term was first used by the [[Continental Congress]] in 1786, being described as the "lowest money of account, of which 1000 shall be equal to the federal dollar."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc0317)) Journals of the Continental Congress],'' August 8, 1786&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coinage Act of 1792]] describes milles and other subdivisions of the dollar:

{{quote|That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars or units, [[Dime (United States coin)|{{not a typo|dismes}}]] or tenths, [[Cent (United States coin)|cents]] or hundredths, and milles or thousandths, a {{not a typo|disme}} being the tenth part of a dollar, a cent the hundredth part of a dollar, a mille the thousandth part of a dollar, and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landru.i-link-2.net/monques/coinageact.html#Chap. U.S. Coinage Act of 1792]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mint of Philadelphia made [[Half cent (United States coin)|half cents]] worth 5 mills each from 1793 to 1857.

[[Token coin|Tokens]] in this denomination were issued by some states and local governments (and by some private interests) for such uses as payment of [[sales tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Rxm, "Sales Tax Tokens: US State issues during the 1930's Depression," [http://www.brianrxm.com/comdir/cnssalestax.htm Brian Rxm website]&lt;/ref&gt; These were of inexpensive material such as [[tin]], [[aluminium]], [[plastic]] or [[paper]]. Rising [[inflation]] depreciated the value of these tokens in relation to the value of their constituent materials; this depreciation led to their eventual abandonment. Virtually none were made after the 1960s.

Today, most Americans would refer to fractions of a cent rather than mills, a term which is widely unknown.  For example, a gasoline price of $3.019 per gallon, if pronounced in full, would be "three dollars (and) one and nine-tenths cents". Discount coupons, such as those for grocery items, usually include in their fine print a statement such as "Cash value less than {{frac|10}} of 1 cent." There are also common occurrences of "half-cent" discounts on goods bought in quantity. However, the term "mill" is still used when discussing billing in the [[electric power industry]] as shorthand for the lengthier "{{frac|1000}} of a dollar per [[kilowatt hour]]". The term is also commonly used when discussing stock prices, the issuance of founder's stock of a company, and [[cigarette tax]]es.

====Property tax====
&lt;!----this subtitle is linked----&gt;
[[Property tax]]es are also expressed in terms of mills per dollar assessed (a [[mill levy]], known more widely in the US as a "[[mill rate]]"). For instance, with a millage rate of 2.8₥, a house with an assessment of $100,000 would be taxed (2.8 × 100,000) = 280,000₥, or $280.00. The term is often spelled "mil" when used in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci862852,00.html |title=per mil symbol |publisher=Tech Target |accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finance====
The term mill is often used in [[finance]], particularly in conjunction with equity [[market microstructure]]. The term is sometimes used as one-hundredth of a cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradeworx.com/media/pdf/TWX-SEC-2010.pdf |title=SEC Market Structure Concept Release |publisher=Tradeworx, Inc |page=5 |accessdate=2014-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a broker that charges 5 mils per share is taking in $5 every 10,000 shares traded. Additionally, in finance the term is sometimes spelled "mil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradeworx.com/media/pdf/TWX-SEC-2010.pdf |title=SEC Market Structure Concept Release |publisher=Tradeworx, Inc |page=5 |accessdate=2014-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some exchanges allow prices to be accounted in ten-thousandths of a dollar ($29.4125, for example).  This last digit is sometimes called a "decimill" or "deci-mill", but no exchange officially recognizes the term.

====Fiction====
&lt;!---subtitle used to set aside material following from linked material on property tax---&gt;
[[Mark Twain]] introduced a fictional elaboration of the mill in ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''. When Hank Morgan, the American [[time travel]]er, introduces decimal currency to [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] Britain, he has it denominated in cents, mills, and "milrays", or tenths of a mill (the name perhaps suggested by "[[myriad]]", meaning ten thousand or by the Portuguese and Brazilian [[milreis]]).

===Canada===
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
Mills are or were formerly used in some cities to express property tax rates, in the same manner as in the U.S.

===United Kingdom===
Proposed on several occasions as a division of the [[pound sterling|British pound]] under the "Pound and Mil" system, the mill was occasionally used in [[accounting]]. The 1862 report from the ''[[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Weights and Measures''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metric.org.uk/Docs/DTI/met1862.pdf REPORT (1862) FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WEIGHTS AND MEASURES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609211239/http://www.metric.org.uk/Docs/DTI/met1862.pdf |date=2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the Equitable Insurance Company had been keeping accounts in mills (rather than in shillings and pence) for such purposes for over 100 years.  Such a unit of a thousandth of a pound would have been similar in value to the then-existing [[British farthing coin|farthing]] coin ({{frac|960}} of a pound). By the time British currency was decimalised in 1971, the farthing had lost its legal tender status eleven years prior, and thus the mill was not necessary.

===Malta===
[[Maltese lira]] coinage included 2 mil, 3 mil, and 5 mil coins from 1972 to 1994, with 10 mils being equal to one cent. Prices could still be marked using mils until the country switched to the [[euro]] in 2008, however these were then rounded up for accounting purposes.

===Republic of Rose Island===
The short-lived and unrecognized [[Republic of Rose Island]] (a [[micronation]] off the Italian coast) had the mill as its official currency (''milo'' in the official language Esperanto).

=== Mandatory Palestine, Israel, Jordan ===
The [[Palestine pound]], used as the currency of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] from 1927 to 1948, was divided into 1,000 mils. Its successor currencies, the [[Israeli lira]] and the [[Jordanian dinar]], were also divided into {{frac|1000}} units, respectively named the ''[[Israeli pruta|peruta]]'' and ''[[Fils (currency)|fils]]''. The Israeli peruta lasted until 1960, and the Jordanian fils until 1992.

===Hong Kong===
Between 1863 and 1866 the mill coin was the lowest denomination issued by the British government in [[Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong]]; it was eliminated due to its unpopularity.&lt;ref&gt;Ma Tak Wo 2004, Illustrated Catalogue of Hong Kong Currency, Ma Tak Wo Numismatic Co., LTD. Kowloon, Hong Kong.{{ISBN|962-85939-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
The mill was used with the [[Cypriot pound]], starting with decimalization in 1955, and lasting until 1983. However, coins smaller than 5 mils ceased being used in the mid 1960s. When switched to [[Cent (currency)|cents]] in 1983, a ½-cent coin was struck that was abolished a few years later.

===Tunisia===
Coins for 5 [[Tunisian dinar|millimes]] (mills) are still in circulation. However, larger coins such as the 10, 20, 50, and 100 millime coins are still in use and production.

==Similar units==
*The [[Egyptian pound]] is divided into 1000 milliemes, and 10 milliemes equal 1 piastre.
*The [[Tunisian dinar]] is divided into 1000 millimes (10 millimes is the smallest currently-minted coin)
*The national currencies which are divided into 1000 [[Fils (currency)|fils]] are the [[Kuwaiti dinar]] (5 fils is the smallest currently-minted coin), [[Bahraini dinar]] (1 fils), [[Iraqi dinar]] (25 dinars). But as with the case of the [[United Arab Emirates dirham]] and the [[Yemeni rial]], they are divided into 100 subunits.
*The [[Omani rial]] is divided into 1000 baisa.
*The [[Libyan dinar]] is divided into 1000 [[dirham]] since 1971.
*The [[Japanese yen]] was formerly divided into 100 ''sen'' or 1000 ''rin''.  An early proposed (but not accepted) design for the 1-rin coin used "1 mil" in the Romanized text

[[File:Map of America by Sebastian Munster.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Sebastian Münster]]'s map of the New World, first published in 1540]]
[[File:Graverat titelblad - Skoklosters slott - 93404.tif|thumb|History of the New World "Historia antipodum oder newe Welt". Matthäus Merian, 1631.]]

The '''New World''' is one of the names used for the majority of [[Earth]]'s [[Western Hemisphere]], specifically the [[Americas]] (including nearby islands such as those of the [[List of Caribbean islands|Caribbean]] and [[Bermuda]]).

The term originated in the early 16th century after [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Europeans made landfall]] in what would later be called the Americas in the [[age of discovery]], expanding the geographical horizon of [[Greco-Roman geography|classical geographers]], who had thought of the [[world]] as consisting of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], collectively now referred to as the [[Old World]] (a.k.a. [[Afro-Eurasia]]).

The phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled ''Mundus Novus'' attributed to [[Italians|Italian]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=upkyAQAAMAAJ Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci; translation by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press; 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Americas were also referred to as the "fourth part of the world".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"&gt;M.H.Davidson (1997) ''Columbus Then and Now, a life re-examined. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press'', p. 417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The terms "[[Old World]]" vs. "New World" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[ecozones]], and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.

One can speak of the "New World" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.

The term "New World" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]], [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the "New World" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the "Old World" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.

The label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as "Old World". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see "[[Columbian Exchange]]"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as "[[New World crops]]"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maiz]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] – the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]" – as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the dog, are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].

In [[wine terminology]], "New World" has a different definition. "[[New World wines]]" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.&lt;ref name="Wine Folly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |publisher= Wine Folly|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: [[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America]] 
The term "New World" ("Mundus Novus") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503–04 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a "New World".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"/&gt;

Vespucci first approached this realization in June 1502, during a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions at the watering stop of "Bezeguiche" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) – his own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.&lt;ref&gt;This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 78–82]).&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:&lt;ref&gt;English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham (1894: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 42–52])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the  cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the  truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}

Vespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Varnhagen, ''Amerígo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 13–26]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation "El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior usage ===

While Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term "New World" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term "un altro mundo" ("another world") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZ5TZHXOnYcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA106-IA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new "fourth" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.

The [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magnífico señor Don Cristóbal Colón | page= 363 | quote= "nuevo mundo", [...] designación que Pedro Mártyr será el primero en usar | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, "New Globe", but often translated as "New World") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, "orbis" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while "mundus" refers to the land within it).&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on Columbus's discoveries since 1493 and, from the start, doubted Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia ("the Indies"), and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bourne ''Spain in America, 1450–580'' New York: Harper (1904: p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Peter Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the "western antipodes" ("antipodibus occiduis", letter of May 14, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 72])&lt;/ref&gt; the "new hemisphere of the earth" ("novo terrarum hemisphaerio", September 13, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 133, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter dated November 1, 1493, refers to Columbus as the "discoverer of the new globe" ("Colonus ille novi orbis repertor").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 138, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 76])&lt;/ref&gt; A year later (October 20, 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe ("Novo Orbe") and the "Western hemisphere."("ab occidente hemisphero").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 156 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] touched the continent of South America in his 1498 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]]. In his own 1499 letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the [[Orinoco]] delta rushing into the [[Gulf of Paria]] implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it.&lt;ref&gt;"if the river mentioned does not proceed from the terrestrial paradise, it comes from an immense tract of land situated in the south, of which no knowledge has been hitherto obtained" (Columbus 1499 letter on the third voyage, as reproduced in R.H. Major, ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'', 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 147])&lt;/ref&gt; However, bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world, Columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the South American landmass is not a "fourth" continent, but rather the [[terrestrial paradise]] of Biblical tradition, not a previously unknown "new" part of the world, but a land already "known" (but location undiscovered) by [[Christendom]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: pp. 266–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter (to the nurse of Prince John, written 1500), Columbus refers to having reached a "new heavens and world" ("nuevo cielo e mundo")&lt;ref&gt;Columbus 1500 letter to the nurse (in Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 154])&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had placed "another world" ("otro mundo") under the dominion of the Kings of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus's 1500 letter to the nurse(Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 170])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acceptance ===
The Vespucci passage above applied the "New World" label to merely the continental landmass of [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Ober ''Amerigo Vespucci'' New York: Harper (1907: pp. 239, 244)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, most of the continent of [[North America]] was not yet discovered, and Vespucci's comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the [[Antilles]] discovered earlier by [[Christopher Columbus]] might still be the eastern edges of Asia, as Columbus continued to insist down to his dying day.&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Morison ''The European Discovery of America, v.2: The southern voyages, 1492–1616''.(1974: pp. 265–66).&lt;/ref&gt; A critical step in the transition was the conference of navigators (''Junta de Navegantes'') assembled by the Spanish monarchs at [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]] in 1505, and continued at [[Burgos]] in 1508, to digest all existing information about the Indies, come to an agreement on what had really been discovered, and set out the future goals of Spanish exploration. Amerigo Vespucci attended both conferences, and seems to have had an outsized influence on them – Vespucci ended up being appointed the first ''piloto mayor'', the chief of navigation of Spain, at Burgos.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of Vespucci at Toro and Burgos,  see Navarette ''Colección de los viages y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV''(1829: v.iii, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESYW_1DUELoC&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 320–23])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proceedings of the Toro-Burgos conferences are missing, it is almost certain that Vespucci articulated his recent "New World" thesis to his fellow navigators there. It was during these conferences when Spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the Antilles and the known stretch of Central America were definitely ''not'' the Indies they had originally sought, and Columbus had insisted they were, and set out the new goal for Spanish explorers: to find a sea passage or [[strait]] through the Americas which would permit them to sail to Asia proper.&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Sauer ''The Early Spanish Main''. Cambridge (1966: pp. 166–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In English usage the term "New World" was problematic and only accepted relatively late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=New World Discovery|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|date=2015|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935338-e-141|accessdate=2 June 2016|doi-broken-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartographic representation ===

[[File:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|The World Map by [[Diogo Ribeiro]] (1529) labels the [[Americas]] as ''MUNDUS NOVUS''. It traces most of South America and the east coast of North America.]]
While it became generally accepted after Vespucci that Columbus's discoveries were not Asia but a "New World", the geographic relationship between the two continents was still unclear.&lt;ref name = parry&gt;J.H. Parry, ''The Discovery of the Sea'' (1974: p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt; That there must be a large ocean between Asia and the Americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of [[East Asia]]. Given the size of the Earth as calculated by [[Eratosthenes]] this left a large space between Asia and the newly discovered lands.  

Even prior to Vespucci, several maps, e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 and the [[Canerio map]] of 1504, placed a large open ocean between China on the east side of the map, and the inchoate largely water-surrounded North American and South American discoveries on the western side of map. However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes [[Greenland]] as "Punta d'Asia" – "edge of Asia"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 [[Contarini–Rosselli map]] and the 1508 [[Johannes Ruysch]] map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.). These maps place the island of Japan near Cuba and leave the South American continent – Vespucci's "New World" proper – detached and floating below by itself.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt; The [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507, which accompanied the famous ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'' volume (which includes reprints of Vespucci's letters) comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea (with no stretching land fingers) between Asia on the eastern side and the New World (being represented two times in the same map in a different way: with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named Central America) on the western side – which (on what is now named South America) that same map famously labels simply "''[[Naming of America|America]]''". However, [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the "America" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]''.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

The western coast of the New World – the [[Pacific Ocean]] – was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]. But it would take a few more years – [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of 1519–22 – to determine that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Schöner globe]]).&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

In 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm "The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3902">'''Philostephanus of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]''' ('''Philostephanus Cyrenaeus'''&lt;ref&gt;He is referred to once, mistakenly, by [[Aulus Gellius]], as ''Polystephanus''. (FHG); Aulus Gellius found an old manuscript of "Polystephanus" at [[Brundisium]] (Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''Aulus Gellius: An Antonine Scholar and His Achievement'' (Oxford University Press) 2003:70.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] writer from [[North Africa|North]] [[Africa]], who was a pupil of the poet [[Callimachus]] in [[Alexandria]] and doubtless worked there during the 3rd century BC.

His [[history]] of [[Cyprus]], ''De Cypro'', written during the reign of [[Ptolemy Philopator]] (222&amp;ndash;206 BC), has been lost, but it was known to at least two Christian writers, [[Clement of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;Clement, ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'', vi.22.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arnobius]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, chs. 17, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It contained a narration of the story of the [[Greek mythology|mythical]] [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], of Cyprus, who fashioned a [[cult image]] of the Greek [[goddess]] [[Aphrodite]] that came to life. [[Ovid]] depended on the account by Philostephanus for his dramatised and expanded version in ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', through which the Pygmalion myth&lt;ref&gt;The name ''Galatea'' was not applied to his statue until the 18th century: see [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]].&lt;/ref&gt; was transmitted to the medieval and modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jordan, "Montaigne's Pygmalion: The Living Work of Art in 'De l'affection des pere aux enfans'", ''Sixteenth Century Journal''. '''9''',4 (Winter 1978:5-12) p. 5 note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remarks on Cyprus seem to have come from a larger work, ''On Islands''. Scattered brief quotes of Philostephanus on islands refer also to [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;Philostephanus, frs. 16, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calauria]] off the coast of [[Troezen]]&lt;ref&gt;fr. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stryme, off the Thracian coast.&lt;ref&gt;fr. 19; Mogens Herman Hansen and Thomas Heine Nielsen, eds. ''An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis'' (Oxford University Press) 2004:880, no. 650&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny's Natural History]] adduces Philostephanus as a source for the assertion that [[Argonautica|Jason]] was the first that went out to sea in a long vessel.&lt;ref&gt;''N.H.'', vii.57: ''Longa nave Jasonem primum navigasse, Philostephanus Auctor est''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other works of Philostephanus cited in surviving passages from other authors were works ''Of the Cities of Asia'', ''On [[Mount Kyllini|Cyllene]]'', ''Epirotica'' ("On [[Epirus]]"), ''On Marvellous Rivers''&lt;ref&gt;frs. 20-25. ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' reports glancingly Philostephanus' remarks on fishes, which may belong here: "Clearchus says this also more plainly than Philostephanus the Cyrenaean, whom I have previously mentioned: 'There are some fish which, though they have no throats, can utter a sound.'" ([http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus8.html On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Inventions'', and various commentaries. 

The fragments of Philostephanus, surviving in quotes from other authors, were published in ''[[Fragmenta historicorum graecorum]]''&lt;ref&gt;Karl Müller et al. ''Fragmenta historicorum graecorum'' (FHG)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another '''Philostephanus''' was a comic poet, of whom little is known.&lt;ref&gt;Kassel, R. and C. Austin,''Poetae Comici Graeci'', (Berlín-New York) 1983-2000,&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sealers' War''', also known as the "War of the Shirt", was a conflict in southern [[New Zealand]] that started in 1810. It began following the theft, by [[Māori people|Māori]] chief, of a red shirt, a knife, and several other items from the sealing vessel ''[[Sydney Cove (1803 ship)|Sydney Cove]]'' in [[Otago Harbour]]. The war gave rise to the view, among some Europeans, that the Māori were treacherous by nature.&lt;ref&gt;Robert McNab, ''Murihiku'', Invercargill, NZ: 1907,p.263 for the suggestion the attacks arose from a supposedly treacherous nature of Māori.&lt;/ref&gt; The true cause was revealed by the discovery of the Creed manuscript in 2003, which records the views of Māori who were alive at the time of the events.&lt;ref&gt;The text of the Creed manuscript is reproduced in [[Peter Entwisle]]'s, ''Taka: A Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784–1817'',Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005 as appendix vi, pp. 128–131. Charles Creed, MS papers, 1187/201, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, NZ.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The initial incident==
Late in 1810, ''Sydney Cove'', an English [[Seal hunting|sealing vessel]], was anchored in [[Otago Harbour]] while its crew were working at [[Cape Saunders]] on the [[Otago Peninsula]].  Māori were in the habit of visiting such vessels to trade for pork and potatoes.  During one such visit, a Māori chief, [[Te Wareripirau]], according to one of Creed's informants, or [[Te Wahia]], according to the other, stole a red shirt and a knife amongst other items. Some of the sailors attacked the chief with [[cutlasses]]. He "fled from them with his bowels protruding through the wound in the side" and died. "The Europeans fled, by ship &amp; boats to the [[Molyneux]]" – the modern [[Clutha River]] mouth – where they attacked and killed another chief, [[Te Pahi]]. They left behind [[James Caddell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1c1/1 "The story of James Caddell..."], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; who became one of the first [[Pākehā Māori|Pākehā-Māori]].

At [[Waipapa Point]] one of ''Sydney Cove''{{'}}s gangs landed and proceeded overland to the [[Mataura River]] mouth, where they were surprised and killed by Māori under [[Honegai]]. The ''Sydney Cove'' paused at [[Stewart Island]] before continuing its voyage. Men from ''[[The Brothers (ship)|Brothers]]'', who had been in the vicinity of Otago Harbour, proceeded south late in 1810. They were seeking a passing ship to take them back to Sydney, but four of them were surprised and killed.&lt;ref&gt;The quotes are from the Creed manuscript, cited above.  The identification of some of the personnel and ships is made in Peter Entwisle, ''Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784–1817'', Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escalation==
These tensions still existed when six [[lascar]]s, Indian seamen, from ''Matilda'', absconded from her in a long boat somewhere on the south west coast in 1814. Encountering Māori, apparently at [[Dusky Sound]], three were killed and eaten and the others enslaved. ''Matilda'' went on to [[Stewart Island]] and from there sent Robert Brown in an open boat to look for the missing men. He came up the east coast and touched at Cape Saunders before going on up the coast to a point some eight miles north of [[Moeraki]]. There he and his seven companions hauled the boat ashore and went to sleep under it,  but were seen by Māori and attacked. All but two were killed and eaten. The two survivors fled through the night to what is now known as Bobby's Head near the Pleasant Valley. Māori initially entertained the survivors, but upon discussion with later arriving Māori who had participated in the attack, killed and ate the two survivors as well. The [[mere (weapon)|mere]] [[Pounamu|greenstone]] club used to dispatch one of them became legendary. Meanwhile, Fowler brought ''Matilda'' into Otago Harbour where he received a friendly reception from the Māori that he later reported to correct a misconception that the Māori were hostile to Europeans and unlikely candidates for conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;The Creed manuscript, cited above; also Peter Entwisle, ''Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker, 1784–1817'', Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, pp. 84–87 and Samuel Fowler, in the ''Sydney Gazette''2 December 1815 p.2b-c.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815 [[William Tucker (settler)|William Tucker]], who had been in the Otago Harbour area as early as 1809, landed again from a [[Hobart]] sealer and settled at Whareakeake, later called Murdering Beach. There he kept goats and sheep, had a Māori wife (but no children), built a house (or houses), and apparently set up an export trade in ornamental hei-tiki – jade neck pendants made from old adzes. He left but returned on ''Sophia'', a Hobart sealer commanded by [[James Kelly (Australian explorer)|James Kelly]], apparently with other Europeans meaning to settle.  ''Sophia'' anchored in Otago Harbour and Tucker – "Taka" to Māori – was well-received but the harbour chief Korako wouldn't ferry across other Māori. This was late in 1817.  Two or three days later Kelly went to visit Whareakeake in an open boat, with Tucker and five others, having been persuaded by Tucker not to take their firearms. At Whareakeake they had a friendly reception and encountered one of the ''Matilda''{{'}}s lascars, an Indian seaman who told them of his countrymen's fate. It seems Tucker had gone into his house but Kelly was attacked, at the instigation of the Whareakeake chief Te Matahaere.&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov14_08Rail-t1-body-d19.html "The Story of Murdering Beach"], November 1939, RONALD K. MCFARLANE, The New Zealand Railways Magazine, Volume 14, Issue 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing melee Veto Viole, John Griffiths, and William Tucker were killed. (Griffiths was Kelly's brother-in-law.) The dead were eaten. Escaping by longboat, Kelly returned to ''Sophia'' in Otago Harbour, but suspected that the Māori there were planning an attack. As a preemptive measure, he attacked the Māori first. Then, and over the next few days, he apparently killed several people, possibly including Korako, destroyed multiple canoes and set fire to "the beautiful City of Otago."&lt;ref&gt;The Creed mansucript cited above; Peter Entwisle, ''Taka: A Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784–1817'', Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, pp. 88–97; James Kelly in ''Hobart Town Courier'', 12 April 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on sealing==
These hostilities and the diminution of seal populations, saw a decline in sealing ventures to southern New Zealand. It seems this was unknown to Captain Abimeleck Riggs of the American sealer ''General Gates'', who in late 1819 landed a gang at [[Stewart Island]]. He had a troubled cruise and it wasn't until 1821 that he returned. He then dropped a second gang and then a third at [[Chalky Island (New Zealand)|Chalky Inlet]]. Māori attacked the second gang in October 1821. Six of his men were captured, taken north up the west coast, where eventually four were killed and eaten. Meanwhile, the Māori attacked and ate a young boy that the gang at Chalky left to look after their stores. The Māori pursued the rest of the gang and killed two members before the survivors came across Captain Edwardson of ''Snapper'' in Chalky Inlet. Their pursuers included men, women, and dogs, all under the leadership of "Te Pehi", "Topi", and "Te Whera". With them were two Pākehā-Māori. Also with them was James Caddell, who, originally captured from ''Sydney Cove'', had acculturated himself to Māori society, in part by being tattooed and married to a high-born Māori woman. Edwardson now took Caddell to Sydney,  where his arrival caused a sensation in 1823 and where a peace was brokered. Thereafter, sealing resumed although it soon petered out again because the animal populations had been severely depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Creed manuscript cited above; Peter Entwisle,''Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784–1817'', Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Charles Begg|A.C. Begg]] &amp; [[Neil Begg|N.C. Begg]], ''Port Preservation: the story of Preservation Inlet and the Solander Grounds'', Christchurch, NZ: Whitcombe &amp; Tombs, 1973, pp. 117–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sealers' War – really a rolling feud – may have seen seventy-four people killed, among them forty-three Pākehā (non-Māori). William Tucker was not a cause of it, as has previously been thought, but one of its victims. The Creed manuscript clearly reveals the original cause, invisible to history for nearly two hundred years, identifies the later triggers of particular events while observing they were all consequences of the first theft and its revenge, often visited on people unaware of what had set these events in motion. When people of different cultures clash they are quick to react against any member of the other group, regardless of personal responsibility. The Sealers' War is a classic example of the tendency of incident to turn into inter-communal strife at the interface of cultural contact.

[[File:Pendón real de Medina del Campo.svg|thumb| Flag of Spanish [[conquistador]]s with crown of Castile on a red flag, used by [[Hernán Cortés]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] and others]]

The overseas expansion under the [[Crown of Castile]] was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s''.  The Americas were incorporated into the [[Spanish Empire]], with the exception of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[British Canada|Canada]], and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean. The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the [[Catholic]] faith through [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] conversions.

Beginning with the 1492 arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] would expand across the [[Caribbean]] Islands, half of [[South America]], most of [[Central America]] and much of [[North America]] (including present day [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal]] regions of the [[United States]]). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492–1832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850–1950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, the [[Genocide_of_indigenous_peoples#Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas|outcome for indigenous populations]] was much worse, with an estimated 8 million deaths following the initial conquest through contact with old world diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. Spanish wars of conquest included laying waste to much of the [[Netherlands]] and a failed attempt to invade [[England]].

In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent balcanization of most Spanish colonies in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish–American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific. Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.

==Conquests==

The Catholic Monarchs [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]], Queen of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and her husband [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]], King of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], pursued a policy of joint rule of their kingdoms and created a single [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]]. Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, S.L. Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003 pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Indies===
Columbus made four voyages to the [[West Indies]] as the monarchs granted Columbus the governorship of the new territories, and financed more of his trans-Atlantic journeys. He founded [[La Navidad]] on the island later named [[Hispaniola]] (now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), in what is the present-day [[Haiti]] on his first voyage. After its destruction by the indigenous [[Taino]] people, the town of Isabella was begun in 1493, on his second voyage. In 1496 his brother, [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]], founded [[Santo Domingo]]. By 1500, despite a high death rate, there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area. The local [[Taíno]] people continued to resist, refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish-occupied villages. The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest. In 1500 the city of [[Nueva Cádiz]] was founded on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]],  followed by the founding of [[Aragua (state)|Santa Cruz]] by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in present-day [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira peninsula]]. [[Cumaná]] in Venezuela was the first permanent settlement founded by [[Europe]]ans in the mainland [[Americas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edosucre.gov.ve/documentos/pdf/CUMANA%20EN%20LA%20HISTORIA.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320091649/http://edosucre.gov.ve/documentos/pdf/CUMANA%20EN%20LA%20HISTORIA.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }} Sucre State Government: ''Cumaná in History'' (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1501 by [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] [[friar]]s, but due to successful attacks by the indigenous people, it had to be refounded several times, until [[Diego Hernández de Serpa]]'s foundation in 1569. The Spanish founded San Sebastian de Uraba in 1509 but abandoned it within the year. There is indirect evidence that the first permanent Spanish mainland settlement established in the Americas was [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tibesar, A.S.|year=1957|title=The Franciscan Province of the Holy Cross of Espanañola, 1505–1559|journal=The Americas|volume=13|issue=4|pages=377–389|jstor=979442|doi=10.2307/979442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===

[[File:Spanish Colonization of Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish Conquest of Mexico, meeting of Cortés and Moctezuma II]]
[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Map depicting Cortés invasion route]]

The Spanish conquest of Mexico is generally understood to be the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] (1519–21) which was the base for later conquests of other regions. Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Chamberlain, ''The Conquest and Colonization of Yucatan''. Washington DC: Carnegie Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, ''The War for Mexico's West''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip W. Powell, ''Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: North America's Last Frontier War''. Tempe: Center for Latin America Studies, Arizona State University 1975. First published by University of California Press 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; But not until the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] was the conquest of the Aztecs matched in scope by the victory over the Inca empire in 1532.

The Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire was led by [[Hernán Cortés]]. The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.

The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hernán Cortés]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].

Spain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].

===Peru===
{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire}}
[[File:Balboa südsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]
[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]

In 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].

The Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Huáscar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Cañari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Perú]] was established in 1542. The [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.

===Río de la Plata and Paraguay===
European explorers arrived in [[Río de la Plata]] in 1516. Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Fort of Sancti Spiritu]] established in 1527 next to the [[Paraná River]]. [[Buenos Aires]], a permanent colony, was established in 1536 and in 1537 [[Asunción]] was established in the area that is now [[Paraguay]]. Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away, and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paraná River]] from [[Asunción]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement "Santísima Trinidad" and its port became "Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires." The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]].

===New Granada===

The [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] originally organized it as a [[Captain general|captaincy general]] within the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The crown established the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'' in 1549. Ultimately, the kingdom became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] first in 1717 and permanently in 1739. After several attempts to set up independent states in the 1810s, the kingdom and the viceroyalty ceased to exist altogether in 1819 with the establishment of [[Gran Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;Avellaneda Navas, José Ignacio.

==Governance==
{{Main article|Spanish Empire|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Viceroyalty of Peru|Intendant#The Spanish Monarchy}}
[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Argentine [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo council]]]]

Spain's administration of its colonies in the Americas was divided into the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] 1535 (capital, [[Mexico City]]), and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] 1542 (capital, [[Lima]]). In the 18th century the additional [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] 1717 (capital, Bogotá), and [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] 1776 (capital, Buenos Aires) were established from portions of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The change diminished the political and economic power of the viceroyalty and opened formal connections between the mining district of Upper Peru and the port of Buenos Aires.

The system of crown rule evolved from the era of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], which established the [[Council of the Indies]], to the establishment of viceroyalties in Mexico and Peru following their conquests in the Hapsburg era, and then into an [[Intendant]] system in the eighteenth century as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. The reform was aimed at increasing crown control over its colonies, raising more revenue, and promoting greater efficiency.

==19th century==
{{Main article|Spanish American wars of independence}}
[[File:Spanish America XVIII Century (Most Expansion).png|thumb|Spanish colonialization in the [[Americas]].]]

During the Napoleonic [[Peninsular War]] in Europe between France and Spain, assemblies called ''[[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]]'' were established to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].
The [[Libertadores]] (Spanish and Portuguese for "Liberators") were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence. They were predominantly ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' (Americas-born people of European ancestry, mostly Spanish or Portuguese), [[bourgeois]] and influenced by [[liberalism]] and in some cases with military training in the [[Homeland|mother country]].

In 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. The first two were in present-day [[Bolivia]] at [[Sucre]] (May 25), and [[La Paz]] (July 16); and the third in present-day [[Ecuador]] at [[Quito]] (August 10). In 1810 Mexico declared independence, with the [[Mexican War of Independence]] following for over a decade. In 1821 [[Treaty of Córdoba]] established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The [[Plan of Iguala]] was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico.

These began a movement for [[Spanish American wars of independence|colonial independence]] that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the [[French Revolution|French]] and the [[American Revolution]] influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s. The [[British Empire]] offered support, wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas.

In 1898, the [[United States]] achieved victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] with Spain, ending the Spanish colonial era. Spanish possession and rule of its remaining colonies in the Americas ended in that year with its sovereignty transferred to the United States. The United States took occupation of [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. Puerto Rico continues to be a possession of the United States, now officially continues as a [[self-governing]] [[unincorporated territory]].

It has been estimated that over 1.86 million Spaniards emigrated to Latin America in the period between 1492 and 1824, with millions more continuing to immigrate following independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=lvvynCzrJOwC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=emigraci%C3%B3n+espa%C3%B1ola+a+las+indias+cifras#v=onepage&amp;q=emigraci%C3%B3n%20espa%C3%B1ola%20a%20las%20indias%20cifras&amp;f=false | title=La emigración española a América, 1765-1824| isbn=9788474688566| last1=MacIas| first1=Rosario Marquez| last2=MacÍas| first2=Rosario Márquez| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hispaniola, the indigenous Taíno pre-contact population before the arrival of Columbus of several hundred thousand had declined to sixty thousand by 1509. Although population estimates vary, Dominican friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], the "Defender of the Indians" estimated there were 6 million (6,000,000) [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] in the Caribbean at the time of Columbus's arrival in 1492.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The population of the Native American population in [[Mexico]] declined by an estimated 90% (reduced to 1–2.5 million people) by the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In [[Peru]] the indigenous Amerindian pre-contact population of around 6.5 million declined to 1 million by the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The overwhelming cause of the decline in both Mexico and Peru was [[infectious diseases]], although the brutality of the [[Encomienda]] also played a significant part in the population decline.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Of the history of the indigenous population of [[California]], [[Sherburne F. Cook]] (1896–1974) was the most painstakingly careful researcher. From decades of research he made estimates for the pre-contact population and the history of demographic decline during the Spanish and post-Spanish periods. According to Cook, the indigenous Californian population at first contact, in 1769, was about 310,000 and had dropped to 25,000 by 1910. The vast majority of the decline happened after the Spanish period, during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[United States|US]] periods of Californian history (1821–1910), with the most dramatic collapse (200,000 to 25,000) occurring in the US period (1846–1910).&lt;ref&gt;Baumhoff, Martin A. 1963.

The second factor was disease. ...A third factor, which strongly intensified the effect of the other two, was the social and physical disruption visited upon the Indian. He was driven from his home by the thousands, starved, beaten, raped, and murdered with impunity. He was not only given no assistance in the struggle against foreign diseases, but was prevented from adopting even the most elementary measures to secure his food, clothing, and shelter. The utter devastation caused by the white man was literally incredible, and not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident."Cook, Sherburne F. 1976b.

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Libeň''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in the Cadastral area and district [[Libeň]] ({{lang-de|Lieben}}) of [[Prague]]. The district has been split off. Since 2002 it belongs mainly to Praha 8, but parts of it are now in Praha 7 and Praha 9. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých''.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

== Dates of collocations ==
According to the website of Gunter Demnig the Stolpersteine of Prague were posed on 8 October 2008, 7 November 2009, 12 June 2010, 13 to 15 July 2011 and on 17 July 2013 by the artist himself. A further collocation occurred on 28 October 2012, but is not mentioned on Demnig's page. The Stolpersteine of Prague-Libeň were posed before 6 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;On this day, pictures of all Stolpersteine in this district were taken by vets.cz, see: [http://www.vets.cz/vpm/12891-kameny-zmizelych-emil-lustig/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech Stolperstein project was initiated in 2008 by the ''Česká unie židovské mládeže'' (Czech Union of Jewish Youth) and was realized with the patronage of the Mayor of Prague.&lt;ref&gt;Zdeňka Kuchyňová: ''[http://www.radio.cz/cz/rubrika/udalosti/praha-ma-na-chodnicich-sve-prvni-pametni-kameny-holocaustu Praha má na chodnících své první pamětní kameny holocaustu]'', [[Radio Praha]], 19 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/6bh0z#selection-293.1-293.45 archive.is/6bh0z Stolpersteine in der Tschechischen Republik]'', stolpersteine.cz, retrieved on 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main exhibition rooms==

=== Apollo Astronaut training in Iceland ===
The Exploration Museum opened its first exhibition in May 2011, detailing the Apollo geology training in [[Iceland]] in 1965 and 1967. The exhibition was opened 50 years after US president [[John F. Kennedy#Space policy|John F. Kennedy]] first announced the goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of 1969. The geology field exercises were intended to develop the astronauts observational skills in recognizing basic geologic structures. Over 50 photographs from the field training are in the museums collection.&lt;ref name=ayt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorationmuseum.com/2011/05/opening-of-apollo-space-exhibit/|title=Opening of Apollo Space Exhibit|accessdate=2014-06-30|publisher=explorationmuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of Phinney, "Iceland was probably the most Moon-like of all the field areas that were visited." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phinney |first1=William |title=Science Training History of the Apollo Astronauts |date=2015 |publisher=NASA SP -2015-626 |page=63,65-67,189,193,222,225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, on the 50th anniversary of the first Apollo geology field trip to Iceland, the museum organized a return trip to the training area with three Apollo astronauts, [[Walter Cunningham]] of Apollo 7, [[Rusty Schweikart]] of Apollo 9, and [[Harrison Schmitt]] of Apollo 17. On the same occasion, [[Neil Armstrong]]'s grandchildren unveiled a [[The Astronaut Monument|monument]] outside the museum, honoring the astronauts that trained in Iceland.

=== Viking Explorers ===
The Viking Explorers exhibition details the history of Viking exploration and settlement. Among the items on display are portraits of some of the most known Viking explorers, including [[Leif Ericson]], [[Erik the Red]], [[Guðríður Þorbjarnardóttir]] and [[Garðar Svavarsson]].&lt;ref name=vik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandreview.com/de/news/2014/05/26/husavik-als-treffpunkt-fuer-wikinger-raumfahrer-und-andere-entdecker|title=Húsavík als Treffpunkt für Wikinger, Raumfahrer und andere Entdecker|accessdate=2014-06-30|publisher=Iceland Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The race to the South Pole ===
The first expedition to reach the geographic [[South Pole]] was led by the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]. He and four others arrived at the pole in December 1911, five weeks ahead of a British party led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] as part of the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]. Photographs from the two expedition and replicas of equipment used by the explorers are among the items on display. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base. Scott and his four companions died on their return journey.&lt;ref name=pol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorationmuseum.com/2013/12/documentary-the-race-for-the-poles/|title=Documentary: The Race For The Poles|accessdate=2014-06-30|publisher=explorationmuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pos&gt;[[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Outer Space Connection''''' is a 1975 [[documentary film]] produced by [[Alan Landsburg]], directed by [[Fred Warshofsky]] and narrated by [[Rod Serling]]. This documentary was the last in a trilogy of [[ancient astronaut]] documentaries produced by Landsburg. This film was one of the last projects that Rod Serling worked on prior to his death in 1975.

==Plot==
This documentary explores the controversial theory that [[extraterrestrials]] explored the Earth in the distant past. These extraterrestrials had a profound effect on the creation of human life and the founding of civilization, after which they left mankind to evolve on its own with a promise they would return at a future date.

==Production==
Landsburg created two other television documentaries dealing with the ancient astronaut subject. ''In Search of Ancient Astronauts'' and ''In Search of Ancient Mysteries'' both produced in 1973. All three projects were narrated by Rod Serling. ''The Outer Space Connection'' was based on a book by the same name, also written by Landsburg and published by [[Bantam Books]]. Parts of the film were shot in [[Park City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] who also released the documentary film, ''[[Chariots of the Gods]]'', in 1970. This film was released on VHS during the 1980s and is also found on many video sharing sites on the internet.

'''Thoth''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|oʊ|θ|,_|t|oʊ|t}}; from {{lang-grc-koi|Θώθ}} ''{{transl|grc|thṓth}}'', borrowed from {{lang-cop|[[wikt:Ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ|Ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ]]}}, the reflex of {{lang-egy|[[wikt:ḏḥwtj|ḏḥwtj]]}} "[He] is like the Ibis") is one of the [[ancient Egyptian deities]]. In art, he was often depicted as a man with the head of an [[African sacred ibis|ibis]] or a [[baboon]], animals sacred to him. His feminine counterpart was [[Seshat]], and his wife was [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;Thutmose III: A New Biography By Eric H Cline, David O'Connor University of Michigan Press (January 5, 2006)p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoth's chief [[Egyptian temple|temple]] was located in the city of {{lang-egy|[[wikt:ḫmnw|ḫmnw]]}} {{ipa|χaˈmaːnaw}}, [[Egyptological pronunciation]]: "Khemenu", {{lang-cop|Ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛ}} ''Shmun'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Not to be confused with the deity [[Khnum]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Society: Egypt's Nile Valley Supplement Map''. (Produced by the Cartographic Division)&lt;/ref&gt; which was known as {{lang|grc|Ἑρμοῦ πόλις}} ''Hermoû pólis'' "The City of [[Hermes]]", or in Latin as ''[[Hermopolis|Hermopolis Magna]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Great Hermopolis", for distinction with [[Damanhur|Lesser Hermopolis]],
e.g. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s.v.'' {{lang|grc|Ἑρμοῦ πόλις}}; [[Ptolemy]] IV 5. § 60. [[Antonine Itinerary]] pp. 154f.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Hellenistic period]]&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Society: Egypt's Nile Valley Supplement Map'': ''Western Desert portion''. (Produced by the Cartographic Division)&lt;/ref&gt; through the [[interpretatio graeca]] that Thoth was [[Hermes]]. Later known ''el-Ashmunein'' in [[Egyptian Arabic]], it was partially destroyed in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Verner, Temple of the World: Sanctuaries, Cults, and Mysteries of Ancient Egypt (2013) 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hermopolis, Thoth led "the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]", a [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of eight principal deities, and his spouse was [[Nehmetawy]]. He also had numerous shrines within the cities of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Hesert, Urit, [[Pr (hieroglyph)|Per]]-Ab, Rekhui, Ta-ur, Sep, Hat, Pselket, Talmsis, Antcha-Mutet, Bah, Amen-heri-ab, and Ta-kens.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Thoth was said to be born from the skull of set also said to be born from the heart of Ra.p. 401)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoth played many vital and prominent roles in [[Egyptian mythology]], such as maintaining the universe, and being one of the two deities (the other being Maat) who stood on either side of [[Solar deity#Solar barge .2F sun chariot|Ra's solar barge]].&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 400)&lt;/ref&gt; In the later history of ancient Egypt, Thoth became heavily associated with the arbitration of godly disputes,&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 405)&lt;/ref&gt; the arts of magic, the system of writing, the development of science,&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 414)&lt;/ref&gt; and the judgment of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' p. 403)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
{{Hiero|Common names for Thoth&lt;ref&gt;Hieroglyphs verified, in part, in (Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 402) and (Collier and Manley p. 161)&lt;/ref&gt;|

The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pronunciation of ''ḏḥwty'' is not fully known, but may be reconstructed as *''ḏiḥautī,'' perhaps pronounced *{{IPA|[t͡ʃʼi.ˈħau.tʰiː]}} or *{{IPA|[ci.ˈħau.tʰiː]}}. This reconstruction is based on the [[Ancient Greek]] borrowing ''{{transl|grc|Thōth}}'' ({{lang|grc|Θώθ}} {{IPA|[tʰɔːtʰ]}}) or ''{{transl|grc|Theut}}'' and the fact that the name was transliterated into [[Coptic language|Sahidic Coptic]] variously as {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲟⲟⲩⲧ}} ''Thoout'', {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲱⲑ}} ''Thōth'', {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲟⲟⲧ}} ''Thoot'', {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲁⲩⲧ}} ''Thaut'', as well as [[Coptic language|Bohairic Coptic]] {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ}} ''Thōout''. These spellings reflect known sound changes from earlier Egyptian such as the loss of ''ḏ'' palatalization and merger of ''ḥ'' with ''h'' i.e. initial ''ḏḥ &gt; th &gt; tʰ.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;f=false|title=The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|last=Allen|first=James P.|date=2013-07-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107032460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of pre-Coptic final ''y/j'' is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;f=false|title=The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|last=Allen|first=James P.|date=2013-07-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107032460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Egyptological convention, which eschews vowel reconstruction, the consonant skeleton ''ḏḥwty'' would be rendered "Djehuti" and the god is sometimes found under this name. However, the Greek form "Thoth" is more common.

According to Theodor Hopfner,&lt;ref&gt;Hopfner, Theodor, b. 1886. Der tierkult der alten Agypter nach den griechisch-romischen berichten und den wichtigeren denkmalern. Wien, In kommission bei A. Holder, 1913. Call#= 060 VPD v.57&lt;/ref&gt; Thoth's Egyptian name written as ''ḏḥwty'' originated from ''ḏḥw'', claimed to be the oldest known name for the [[African sacred ibis|ibis]], normally written as ''hbj''. The addition of ''-ty'' denotes that he possessed the attributes of the ibis.&lt;ref name="Budge p. 402"&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 402)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Thoth's name would mean "He who is like the ibis", according to this interpretation.

=== Further names and spellings ===
Other forms of the name ''ḏḥwty'' using older transcriptions include ''Jehuti, Jehuty, Tahuti, Tehuti, Zehuti, Techu,'' or ''Tetu''. Multiple titles for Thoth, similar to the [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], are also known, including ''A'', ''Sheps'', ''Lord of Khemennu'', ''Asten'', ''Khenti'', ''Mehi'', ''Hab'', and ''A'an''.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 pp.&amp;nbsp;402–3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Thoth was also known by specific aspects of himself, for instance the moon god [[Iah]]-Djehuty (''j3ḥ-ḏḥw.ty)'', representing the Moon for the entire month.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 pp.&amp;nbsp;412–3)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greeks related Thoth to their god [[Hermes]] due to his similar attributes and functions.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' p.&amp;nbsp;402)&lt;/ref&gt;
One of Thoth's titles, "Thrice great" (see [[Thoth#Titles|Titles]]) was translated to the Greek {{lang|grc|τρισμέγιστος}} (''{{transl|grc|trismégistos}}''), making [[Hermes Trismegistus]].&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;415)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoth has been depicted in many ways depending on the era and on the aspect the artist wished to convey. Usually, he is depicted in his human form with the head of an [[African sacred ibis|ibis]].&lt;ref name="Budge 401"&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 401)&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, he can be represented as the reckoner of times and seasons by a [[headdress]] of the lunar disk sitting on top of a crescent moon resting on his head. When depicted as a form of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] or Ankher, he was depicted to be wearing the respective god's headdress. Sometimes he was also seen in art to be wearing the [[Atef]] crown or the [[Pschent|United Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Budge p. 402"/&gt; When not depicted in this common form, he sometimes takes the form of the ibis directly.&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt;

He also appears as a dog-faced [[baboon]] or a man with the head of a baboon when he is A'an, the god of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 403)&lt;/ref&gt; In the form of A'ah-Djehuty he took a more human-looking form.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 plate between pp. 408–9)&lt;/ref&gt; These forms are all [[symbol]]ic and are [[metaphor]]s for Thoth's attributes. The Egyptians did not believe these gods actually looked like humans with animal heads.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. (2000). ''[[Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs]]'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Ma'at is often depicted with an [[ostrich]] feather, "the feather of truth," on her head,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, op. cit., p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; or with a feather for a head.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 416)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoth's roles in Egyptian mythology were many. He served as scribe of the gods,&lt;ref name="Budge p. 408"&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 408)&lt;/ref&gt; credited with the invention of writing and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].&lt;ref name="Budge p. 414"&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 414)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[underworld]], [[Duat]], he appeared as an ape, [[Aani]], the god of equilibrium, who reported when the scales weighing the deceased's heart against the feather, representing the principle of Maat, was exactly even.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 403)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians regarded Thoth as One, self-begotten, and self-produced.&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt; He was the master of both physical and [[morality|moral]] (i.e. [[divinity|divine]]) law,&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt; making proper use of Ma'at.&lt;ref name="Budge 407"&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 407)&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with making the calculations for the establishment of the heavens, stars, Earth,&lt;ref name="Budge p. 401"&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 401)&lt;/ref&gt; and everything in them.&lt;ref name="Budge 407" /&gt; He is said to direct the motions of the heavenly bodies. Without his words, the Egyptians believed, the gods would not exist.&lt;ref name="Budge p. 408"/&gt; His power was unlimited in the Underworld and rivalled that of Ra and Osiris.&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt;

The Egyptians credited him as the author of all works of science, religion, philosophy, and magic.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall ''The Hermetic Marriage'' p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks further declared him the inventor of [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[numerology|the science of numbers]], [[mathematics]], [[geometry]], [[surveying]], [[medicine]], [[botany]], [[theology]], civilized government, the alphabet, reading, writing, and [[public speaking|oratory]]. They further claimed he was the true author of every work of every branch of knowledge, human and divine.&lt;ref name="Budge p. 414"/&gt;

[[File:Weighing of the heart3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|This detail scene, from the Papyrus of [[Hunefer]] (c. 1275 BCE), shows the scribe Hunefer's heart being weighed on the scale of [[Maat]] against the feather of truth, by the jackal-headed [[Anubis]]. The ibis-headed Thoth, scribe of the gods, records the result. If his heart equals exactly the weight of the feather, Hunefer is allowed to pass into the afterlife. If not, he is eaten by the waiting chimeric devouring creature [[Ammit]] composed of the deadly crocodile, lion, and hippopotamus. Vignettes such as these were a common illustration in Egyptian books of the dead. ]]
Thoth has played a prominent role in many of the Egyptian myths.  In the [[Osiris myth]], being of great aid to [[Isis]]. After Isis gathered together the pieces of Osiris's dismembered body, he gave her the words to resurrect him so she could be impregnated and bring forth Horus. After a battle between Horus and Set in which the latter plucked out Horus' eye, Thoth's counsel provided him the wisdom he needed to recover it.

This mythology also credits him with the creation of the 365-day calendar. Originally, according to the myth, the year was only 360 days long and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] was sterile during these days, unable to bear children. Thoth gambled with the Moon for 1/72nd of its light (360/72 = 5), or 5 days, and won. During these 5 days, Nut and Geb gave birth to Osiris, Set, Isis, and Nephthys.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:thothbw1.JPG|right|thumb|Thoth, sitting on his throne]]
Thoth was originally a moon god. The moon not only provides light at night, allowing time to still be measured without the sun, but its phases and prominence gave it a significant importance in early astrology/astronomy. The cycles of the moon also organized much of Egyptian society's rituals and events, both civil and religious. Consequently, Thoth gradually became seen as a god of [[wisdom]], [[magic and religion|magic]], and the measurement and regulation of events and of time.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, Jan, ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'', 2001, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; He was thus said to be the secretary and counselor of the [[solar deity|sun god]] Ra, and with Ma'at (truth/order) stood next to Ra on the nightly voyage across the sky.

Thoth became credited by the ancient Egyptians as the inventor of writing ([[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mythology. The illustrated anthology of world myth &amp; storytelling|last=Littleton|first=C.Scott|publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers|year=2002|isbn=9781903296370|location=London|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also considered to have been the scribe of the underworld. For this reason Thoth was universally worshipped by ancient Egyptian scribes. Many scribes had a painting or a picture of Thoth in their "office". Likewise, one of the symbols for scribes was that of the ibis.

In art, Thoth was usually depicted with the head of an ibis, possibly because the Egyptians saw curve of the ibis' beak as a symbol of the crescent moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H., ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt'', 2003, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, he was depicted as a baboon holding up a crescent moon, as the baboon was seen as a nocturnal and intelligent creature. The association with baboons led to him occasionally being said to have as a consort [[Astennu]], one of the (male) baboons at the place of judgment in the underworld. On other occasions, Astennu was said to be Thoth himself.

During the [[History of Egypt|late period of Egyptian history]], a cult of Thoth gained prominence due to its main centre, Khmun ([[Hermopolis Magna]]), also becoming the capital. Millions of dead ibis were mummified and buried in his honour.

Thoth was inserted in many tales as the wise counselor and persuader, and his association with learning and measurement led him to be connected with [[Seshat]], the earlier deification of wisdom, who was said to be his daughter, or variably his wife. Thoth's qualities also led to him being identified by the Greeks with their closest matching god Hermes, with whom Thoth was eventually combined as Hermes Trismegistus, also leading to the Greeks' naming Thoth's cult centre as Hermopolis, meaning ''city of Hermes''.

It is also considered that Thoth was the scribe of the gods rather than a messenger. [[Anpu]] (or [[Hermanubis]]) was viewed as the messenger of the gods, as he travelled in and out of the Underworld and presented himself to the gods and to humans. It is more widely accepted that Thoth was a record keeper, not a divine messenger. In the [[Papyrus of Ani]] copy of the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]] the scribe proclaims "I am thy [[scribe's palette|writing palette]], O Thoth, and I have brought unto thee thine ink-jar. I am not of those who work iniquity in their secret places; let not evil happen unto me."&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Dead'' by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], 1895, Gramercy, 1999, p. 562, {{ISBN|0-517-12283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XXXb (Budge) of the Book of the Dead is by the oldest tradition said to be the work of Thoth himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Dead'' by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], 1895, Gramercy, 1999, p. 282, {{ISBN|0-517-12283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an Egyptian pharaoh of the [[Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt|Sixteenth dynasty]] named Djehuty (Thoth) after him, and who reigned for three years.

[[Artapanus of Alexandria]], an Egyptian Jew who lived in the third or second century BC, [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] Thoth-Hermes as a historical human being and claimed he was the same person as [[Moses]], based primarily on their shared roles as authors of texts and creators of laws. Artapanus's biography of Moses conflates traditions about Moses and Thoth and invents many details.&lt;ref&gt;Mussies, Gerald (1982), "The Interpretatio Judaica of Thot-Hermes", in van Voss, Heerma, et al. (eds.) ''Studies in Egyptian Religion Dedicated to Professor Jan Zandee'', pp. 91, 97, 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Many later authors, from [[late antiquity]] to the [[Renaissance]], either identified Hermes Trismegistus with Moses or regarded them as contemporaries who expounded similar beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mussies (1982), pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Numa Pompilius]] consulted her frequently, but on the early [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]. The life of Numa was of extensive interest to Antias. In Fragment 6 ([[Plutarch]], Numa, 15 and elsewhere) following the nymph's advice he summons [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] from heaven and forces him to accept a remedy of onion and fish heads to counter the effects of a lightning strike, instead of the human heads proposed by the god. Livy ignores the story.&lt;ref&gt;Howard (1906), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Valerius Antias''' (1st century BC) was an ancient Roman [[annalists|annalist]] whom [[Livy]] mentions as a source. No complete works of his survive but from the sixty-five fragments said to be his in the works of other authors it has been deduced that he wrote a chronicle of ancient Rome in at least seventy-five books.&lt;ref&gt;Howard (1906), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The latest dateable event in the fragments is mention of the heirs of the orator, [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]], who died in 91 BC. Of the seventy references to Antias in classical (Greek and Latin) literature sixty-one mention him as an authority on Roman legendary history.

[[File:Numa-pompilius.jpg|thumb|left|[[Numa Pompilius]] consulting [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]].]]

== Background ==

Antias' family were the Valerii Antiates, a branch of the [[Valerius|Valeria gens]] residing at least from early republican times in the vicinity of ''[[Antium]]'' (modern towns of [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]]). He may have been descended from [[Lucius Valerius Antias]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1870), ''Antias''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==

Not much is known about the life of Valerius Antias. He was probably a younger contemporary of [[Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius]] and lived in the times of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] although some scholars believe that he was a contemporary of [[Julius Caesar]] and wrote his work after 50 BC, because he seems to have been unknown to [[Cicero]] (who especially does not mention him in his enumeration of famous historians (''de legibus'' 1.2.3-7)). He was the most important of the so-called “younger annalists”.

The nearly completely lost work of Antias – cited as ''annales'' or as ''historiae'' – began its account of the Roman history with the foundation of [[Rome]] and extended at least to the year 91 BC. The second book told about the legendary Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]], the twenty-second book about the capitulation of [[Gaius Hostilius Mancinus]] in 136 BC (this event Livy only reports in book 55 of his history). Therefore, the earlier times were reported much shorter than the contemporary history of the author.

The work of Antias was not very reliable. Livy criticizes his exaggerated numbers of killed and captured enemies in the Roman wars. Sometimes he seems to have invented even battles.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Annalists|display=Annalists s.v.|volume=2|page=60|first=John Henry|last=Freese}}&lt;/ref&gt; But sometimes he also delivered correct values, which fact can be concluded from a comparison with some values given by [[Polybius]].

Antias’ account of each year included the allocation of troops and provinces, important omen, battles, foundation of new colonies etc. At the end of the description of each year he reported about plays, temple inaugurations, and other news, in particular about events in the city of Rome. Under the influence of Hellenistic historiography Antias related his stories very long-winded and filled with sensationalism to entertain his readers. He embroidered the mostly short accounts of older historians with dramatic details and also recounted legends and miracles. He falsified the report about the trials of the Scipio brothers (compare Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 38#50|38.50-60]]) and seems to have invented high offices and deeds of members of his house, the gens Valeria, who lived in the early Roman republic because there were no reliable sources about these early times, which could have disproved his assertions. Antias gave a rationalistic account about the discovery of the coffins with the books of king Numa, because he had the coffins uncovered by rain and not by excavation like in the older tradition.

The style of Antias was simple, but not archaic, and [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] (''epistel ad Verus'' 1, 1, p.&amp;nbsp;134, 2 ed. Van den Hout) judged his language and style to be unattractive (''invenuste''). Therefore, he was rarely cited literally by later grammarians.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Volkmann, ''Valerius 98''. In: ''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]'' (RE), vol. 7A, 2 (1948), col. 2313-2340&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on Livy ==

In one long-standing view of Antias' influence on [[Livy]], the latter relied mainly on the former in Books 1-10 of ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'', the legendary history of Rome.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; To elucidate this possible influence, A.A. Howard compared each of Antias' fragments with the equivalent story in Livy. He deduced that there is no evidence of such influence in the first ten books. Of twenty fragments falling within the period Livy does not use any, either omitting the information, or explicitly disagreeing with it. Howard says:&lt;ref&gt;Howard (1906), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The argument that Livy made free use of Antias and mentioned him only in case of disagreement is absolutely without foundation, for we have seen fourteen specific instances in which, although Livy does not mention him, he nevertheless disagrees with his statements as known to us from other sources, or absolutely disregards them...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For example, in Fragment 1 [[Acca Larentia]] willed her property to [[Romulus]]. Livy does not mention it. Fragment 3 mentions that exactly 527 [[Sabine Women]] were kidnapped.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Livy says the number is greater than 30, and so on. For the entire period covered by Livy, 33 fragments of Antias come from Livy.&lt;ref&gt;Howard (1906), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He disagrees with six of these, criticizes eleven more, quotes Antias in disagreement on ten, and agrees with, but later disproves, two. Howard concludes disparagingly that&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is on such evidence as this that we are asked to believe that Antias was the source of considerable portions of Livy's history and that Livy followed blindly, at least in the earlier part of his work. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''William Anderson''' (1805–1866) was a Scottish miscellaneous writer.

==Biography==
Anderson was born in Edinburgh 10 December 1805. His father was supervisor of excise at [[Oban]], and his mother the daughter of John Williams, author of the ‘Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom.’ He was thus a younger brother of [[John Anderson (genealogist, 1789-1832)]], the historian of the house of Hamilton. After receiving a good education in Edinburgh he became clerk to a [[Leith]] merchant, but subsequently entered a lawyer's office in Edinburgh. At an early period he began to contribute to the newspapers, and in 1830 published a volume of verse, entitled ‘Poetical Aspirations,’ which reached a second edition in 1833. This was followed by a volume of prose and verse, entitled ‘Odd Sketches.’ After a short residence in London in 1831 he obtained a situation on the ‘Aberdeen Journal.’

In 1836 he returned to London, where he formed a rather extensive literary connection, and in 1839 brought out the ‘Gift of all Nations,’ an annual which numbered among its contributors [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Sheridan Knowles]], the [[Countess of Blessington]], and [[Miss Pardoe]]. In the same year he also published ‘Landscape Lyrics,’ which reached a second edition in 1854. In 1842 he became editor of the ‘Western Watchman,’ a weekly newspaper published at Ayr; in 1844 he was chosen subeditor of the ‘[[Edinburgh Witness]],’ which, although the articles of [[Hugh Miller]] had secured it a wide circulation, had hitherto been subedited in a very perfunctory manner; and in 1845 he became the chief subeditor of the ‘[[Glasgow Daily Mail]],’ the first daily newspaper published in Scotland.

On account of the serious effects on his health of severe night labour, he was two years afterwards compelled for a time to abandon literary work, and he never formed any subsequent connection with a newspaper. With the exception of a volume of ‘Poems’ published in 1845, and the ‘Young Voyager,’ 1855, a poem descriptive of the search after Sir John Franklin, and intended for juvenile readers, the remaining works of Anderson are of the nature chiefly of popular compilations. They include an edition of the ‘Works of Lord Byron,’ with a life and notes, 1850; the ‘Poems and Songs of R. Gilfillan,’ with a memoir, 1851; and a ‘Treasury’ series, embracing the ‘Treasury of Discovery,’ 1853; of the ‘Animal World,’ 1854; of ‘Manners,’ 1855; of ‘History,’ 1856; and of ‘Nature,’ 1857. Of a somewhat higher character than these compilations are the ‘Scottish Nation,’ 1859–63, an expansion of his ‘Popular Scottish Biography’ published in 1842; and ‘Genealogy and Surnames,’ 1865. The ‘Scottish Nation,’ though diffuse and ill arranged, displays great industry and a minute acquaintance with Scottish family history; while ‘Genealogy and Surnames,’ amid much that is commonplace, contains some curious information not easily accessible elsewhere.

He died suddenly at London 2 August 1866.

==Academic career==
After postgraduate work at Indiana University in the late 1960s, Pickett was a professor of history at Rose-Hulman for 35 years. He was a [[Fulbright Scholar]] at [[Nanzan University]] in [[Nagoya]], Japan in 1989-90, lecturing on American history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://libraries.uark.edu/specialcollections/fulbrightdirectories/1988%20-%201989.pdf |title= Directory of American Fulbright Scholars 1989-90 |last= |first= |date= |website= Fulbright Scholar Grantee Directories |publisher=University of Arkansas Special Collections|access-date=May 25, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught American history on U.S. military bases in Korea as a visiting professor for the University of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 1991 |title=Contributors |url= |journal= The SHAFR Newsletter |publisher=Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations |volume=22-24 |issue= |pages=51 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an educational consultant to the American University of [[Kyrgyzstan]] (now called [[American University of Central Asia]]) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pickett |first=William B. |date=June 2002 |title=Liberal Education: Its Goals and Methods |url= http://elibrary.auca.kg/handle/123456789/211?mode=full |journal= Bulletin of the American University of Kyrgyzstan |volume= |issue= |pages=5–7 |doi= |access-date=May 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992-93, he served as president of the Indiana Association of Historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.in.gov/history/iah/2441.htm |title=Presidents of the Indiana Association of Historians |last= |first= |date= |website=Indiana Association of Historians |publisher= |access-date=May 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he co-founded the Web History Center, a hub for archiving and preserving early Internet history, with branches in Indiana at Rose-Hulman and at California's [[Computer History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/avoiding-a-digital-dark-age/3046 |title= Avoiding a Digital ‘Dark Age’ |date= May 21, 2007 |work= The Chronicle of Higher Education |access-date=May 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/33574 |title=William Pickett: Tech professor and web historian launch web-history center |last= |first= |date=January 2, 2007 |website=historynewsnetwork.org |publisher=History News Network |access-date=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his lectures about Eisenhower were featured on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Book TV]]'' series in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Eisenhower Decides to Run |url= https://www.c-span.org/video/?160056-1/eisenhower-decides-run |access-date=May 25, 2018 |series=Book TV|first= William B. |last=Pickett |network=C-SPAN |date=October 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Eisenhower as a Historical Figure |url= https://www.c-span.org/video/?173540-2/eisenhower-historical-figure |access-date=May 25, 2018|series=Book TV |first= William B. |last=Pickett |network=C-SPAN |date=October 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, he has been a member of the historical advisory panel for the [[Eisenhower Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Dispatches From The Eisenhower Memorial Commission |url= http://www.eisenhowermemorial.gov/sites/default/files/public/press/General%27ly%20Speaking%20-%20Dispatches%20from%20the%20Eisenhower%20Memorial%20Commission%20%28Week%20of%20October%2023%29.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher= Eisenhower Memorial Commission |date= October 23, 2017 |access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickett retired from teaching in 2007 but continues to write.

=== Published works ===
Over the course of his career, Pickett produced a number of books, journal articles, reviews, and oral histories.
Pickett wrote his doctoral thesis on Indiana Sen. Homer Capehart, and his 1990 book ''Homer E. Capehart: A Senator's Life'' was the first scholarly biography of the politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schapsmeier |first=Edward L. |date=1991 |title=Homer E. Capehart: A Senator's Life, 1897-1979 by William B. Pickett (review) |url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/annals-of-iowa/vol51/iss1/15 |journal= The Annals of Iowa |volume=51 |issue= |pages=102–104 |doi= |access-date=May 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homer E. Capehart'' won an Award of Merit from the Ohio Museums Association in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 12, 1991 |title= Rose-Hulman Professor's Book Wins Award |url= http://scholar.rose-hulman.edu/rosethorn/799 |journal= Rose Thorn Archive |volume=26 |issue=22 |pages= |doi= |access-date=May 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pickett's work on Eisenhower included two full-length books. Reviewer Lawrence S. Conner called 1995's ''Dwight David Eisenhower and American Power'' a "concise and readable" work that helped to revise previous historians' "harsh assessments of Eisenhower."&lt;ref name="Indianapolis Star 1996"&gt;{{cite news |last=Conner |first=Lawrence S. |title=Assessing the Career of Eisenhower |work=[[Indianapolis Star]] |date=1996-02-24 |page=A11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in Presidential Studies Quarterly, Herbert Parmet called the book a "gracefully written," more contemporary view of Eisenhower as a politician who "understood and moved with the rhythms of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parmet |first=Herbert S. |date=Summer 1995 |title= Book Review: William B. Pickett, ''Dwight David Eisenhower and American Power'' |jstor=27551474 |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume= 25|issue=3 |pages= 576–577 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickett's 2000 book ''Eisenhower Decides to Run'' was one of the first scholarly looks at the 1952 presidential campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=American Politics at Mid-Century |last=Reichard |first=Gary W. |editor-last= Pach |editor-first= Chester J.|title=A Companion to Dwight D. Eisenhower|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uqyhDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focused particularly on Eisenhower's political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 1, 2000 |title=Review: ''Eisenhower Decides to Run'' |url= |journal= Library Journal |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Michigan State University]]'s [[H-Net]] forum, Steven Wagner called the book "required reading for Eisenhower specialists" that helped to overturn the older consensus that Eisenhower was only a passive player in his own political career, and made the case that long-simmering political ambitions led to his consciously seeking the presidency in order to block the ambitions of Ohio Senator [[Robert A. Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=5126 |title=Review of Pickett, William B., ''Eisenhower Decides to Run: Presidential Politics and Cold War Strategy'' |last=Wagner |first=Steven |date=May 2001 |website=H-Pol, H-Net Reviews |access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Thomas R. Maddux wrote that Pickett's book challenged the "standard view advanced by [[Stephen Ambrose]] and others" that Eisenhower was a reluctant candidate, positing instead that Eisenhower was cautious after witnessing the controversial political rise of his military rival [[Douglas MacArthur]], and was a more skilled behind-the-scenes leader than generally acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Maddux |first= Thomas R. |date= Spring 2002 |title= Book Review: ''Eisenhower Decides to Run: Presidential Politics and Cold War Strategy'' |url= https://muse.jhu.edu/article/9254/pdf |journal= Journal of Cold War Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages= 139–141 |doi= |access-date=May 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
