The '''2017 Census of Pakistan''' was a detailed enumeration of the [[Pakistani]] population which began on 15 March 2017 and ended on 25 May 2017.

The second phase began on 25 April 2017 and lasted until 24 May 2017 covering the remaining 88 districts. However, the census in the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] and neighbouring districts of [[Attock District|Attock]] and [[Rawalpindi District|Rawalpindi]], although included in the second phase, began on 30 March 2017 and concluded on 23 May 2017. Furthermore, for administrative purposes, the census in the [[Kech District]] of [[Balochistan]] was spread over both phases.&lt;ref name="distribution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribution of Districts in Phases|url=http://www.pbscensus.gov.pk/content/distribution-districts-phases|website=Pakistan Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
===Transgender population===
Transgender rights campaigners have claimed the count of 10,418 transgender people nationally in the 2017 census significantly underestimates the size of Pakistan's transgender population. Mona Ali, who is a leader of a Lahore-based transgender rights group known as the [[Khawaja Sira Society]], estimates there are 400,000 to 500,000 transgender people in the Punjab province alone. Bindya Rana, leader of the Karachi-based transgender rights group [[Jiya (organization)|Jiya]], estimates that there are 300,000 transgender people across Pakistan. The census identified transgender people according to their national identity cards, not accounting for those whose cards do not disclose their transgender status in order to avoid discrimination.&lt;ref name="transgender-census"&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't we count? Transgender Pakistanis feel sidelined by census|date=2017-10-07|access-date=2018-05-02|newspaper=[[Thomson Reuters]]|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters Foundation]]|last=Ebrahim|first=Zofeen T.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-transgender-census/dont-we-count-transgender-pakistanis-feel-sidelined-by-census-idUSL8N1ME398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sindh population===
The [[Sindh Assembly]] refused to accept the results of the 2017 census, stating that millions of people were shown with double addresses and counted in their home provinces despite living and working in Sindh.&lt;ref name="sindh-assembly"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1367985|title=Sindh Assembly refuses to accept census results|date=2017-11-03|access-date=2018-05-11|last=Ghori|first=Habib Khan|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan|publisher=[[Pakistan Herald Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, [[Syed Mustafa Kamal|Mustafa Kamal]], chairman of the [[Pak Sarzameen Party]] and former [[Mayor of Karachi]], challenged the results of the 2017 census in the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]], seeking a third-party audit of the national census. Kamal pleaded that records from the [[National Database and Registration Authority]] (NADRA) showed the population  of Karachi to be 20.15 million, rather than 16 million as shown in the census.&lt;ref name="kamal-petition"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mustafa Kamal challenges census 2017 results in SC|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/mustafa-kamal-challenges-census-2017-results-in-sc/|access-date=2018-05-11|date=2018-04-25|newspaper=[[Daily Pakistan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FATA population===
[[Shahab Uddin Khan]], a [[Constituency NA-41 (Tribal Area-II)|Member of the National Assembly]] (MNA) from [[Bajaur Agency]], has stated he believes that a large number of people displaced from the [[Mamund Tehsil|Mamund]] and [[Nawagai Tehsil|Nawagai]] regions due to security operations have not been counted by the census. He has stated he intends to challenge the census in court. [[Bismillah Khan (politician)|Bismillah Khan]], an MNA from Bajaur Agency, has stated he believes the population of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas is double of what is reflected in the census. He added that he will take up the issue with the federal government along with other lawmakers. [[Sajid Hussain Turi]], an MNA from [[Khyber Agency]], claimed that more than three million people from FATA are living in other cities in the country due to military operations, and expressed concerned that developmental work in the region could be underfunded if the population is underestimated by the census.&lt;ref name="fata-lawmakers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1491331/census-2017-fata-lawmakers-dispute-census-count/|title=Census 2017: FATA lawmakers dispute census count|last=Ullah|first=Izhar|date=2017-08-26|access-date=2018-05-11|newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political opposition===
[[Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP), Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, questioned the provisional census results. He issued a statement demanding that data collected by the statistics division should be compared to data from the [[Pakistan Army]]. PPP leader [[Nawab Muhammad Yousuf]] accused authorities of doctoring the results, alleging that the population of Sindh had been intentionally underestimated by at least 10 million and the population of Punjab had been overestimated by 10 million. He described the results as an attempt to usurp the rights of Sindh. PPP Senator [[Mukhtiar Ahmed Dhamrah]] disputed the population of Karachi and Lahore reported in the preliminary results.&lt;ref name="opp-parties"&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition parties suspicious of census results|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1354150|last=Khan|first=Iftikhar A.|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|publisher=[[Pakistan Herald Publications]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan|date=2017-08-27|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bushra Gohar]], leader of [[Awami National Party]] (ANP), pointed out in a [https://twitter.com/BushraGohar/status/901313331537092608 tweet] that the reported population of around 5 million for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas seems contradictory to the fact that there have been nearly 2 million [[internally displaced persons]] registered from [[North Waziristan]] alone.&lt;ref name="opp-parties"/&gt;

Chief Census Commissioner Asif Bajwa rejected allegations that the census results had been manipulated and that the population of Karachi had been intentionally understated. He stated that the populations of Karachi and Lahore were counted as per the record of national identity cards and voter lists, and that the census data had already been verified with statistics recorded by the army.&lt;ref name="bajwa-response"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1369642|title=Census commissioner rejects political parties' concerns|date=2017-11-10|access-date=2018-05-13|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|publisher=[[Pakistan Herald Publications]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan|last=Guramani|first=Nadir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abbe Lyn Smith''' (born 1956) is an American [[criminal defense attorney]] and professor of law at [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. Smith is Director of the Criminal Defense and [[Prisoner]] Advocacy Clinic and Co-Director of the [[E. Barrett Prettyman]] Fellowship Program.

Before joining the faculty at [[Georgetown Law]], Smith worked as a [[public defender]] in [[Philadelphia]] for many years and she was also on the faculty at [[Harvard Law School]]. Professor Smith regularly writes and comments on [[criminal defense]], the [[criminal justice system]], criminal [[prosecution]], [[legal ethics]], and [[juvenile justice]]. Smith wrote a [[memoir]] about her experience of helping Patsy Kelly Jarrett earn her freedom from a conviction for which Jarrett maintained her [[innocence]].

==Education==
Smith earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Yale College]] in 1978 and a law degree from the [[New York University School of Law]] in 1982. During her second year of law school at NYU—while working in the Prison Law Clinic with Professor Claudia  Angelos—Smith began working on Patsy Kelly Jarrett's federal [[habeas corpus]] petition.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=The Plea|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plea/interviews/smith.html|website=www.pbs.org|publisher=PBS|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1977, a jury found Jarrett guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of robbery, but Jarrett maintained her innocence.&lt;ref name=pbsfilm/&gt;  Smith worked on Jarrett's case for the next 25 years.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; From 2005-2006, Smith was a [[Fulbright Program]] scholar at the [[University of Melbourne]] School of Law in [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref name=fulbright&gt;{{cite web|title=Fulbright Scholar Stories  Abbe Smith|url=http://www.cies.org/fulbright-scholar-stories-abbe-smith|website=cies.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

===Public defender===
After law school, Ms. Smith began work as an assistant [[public defender]] with the [[Defender Association of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="law stories"/&gt; She would later work as a member of the Special Defense Unit, and a Senior Trial Attorney.&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Anniversary Conference|url=http://www.yale.edu/wgss/anniversaries/speakers.html|website=yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bozorgi|first1=Susan|title=Women Criminal Defense Attorneys: Interview with Abbe Smith|url=http://womencriminaldefenseattorneys.com/women-criminal-defense-attorneys-interview-with-abbe-smith/|website=womencriminaldefenseattorneys.com/|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working as a public defender in Philadelphia, Smith began working as a law professor, teaching criminal law at [[City University of New York Law School]].&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

===Law professor===
In 1990, Smith moved to [[Harvard Law School]] where she was Deputy Director of the Criminal Justice Institute, a clinical instructor in HLS' criminal defense clinic, and a lecturer on law in Harvard's Trial Advocacy Workshop.&lt;ref name="law stories"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellow|first1=Gary|last2=Minnow|first2=Martha|title=Law Stories|date=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Justice Institute is the curriculum-based criminal law clinical program of [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/clinical/cji/&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith joined the [[Georgetown University Law Center]] faculty in 1996.&lt;ref name=Yale/&gt; Professor Smith is the Director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy (CDPAC) Clinic.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile Abbe Smith|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/smith-abbe.cfm|website=law.georgetown.edu|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994-2005, Smith was the attorney for Patsy Kelly Jarrett.&lt;ref name=pbsfilm&gt;{{cite web|title=The Plea|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plea/four/jarrett.html|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Smith contacted journalists, public relations firms and wrote about Kelly in law journals.&lt;ref name=wpost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=Case of a Lifetime|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/24/AR2008062401155_5.html|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Smith convinced documentarian [[Ofra Bikel]]—who was working on a film about guilty pleas for the PBS television show [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]—to include Jarrett in the documentary.&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt; The documentary aired in 2004. During a March 2005 review of the case, the members of the New York Parole Board watched Bikel's account of Jarrett's story, and she was released.&lt;ref name=market&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Kito|title=FRONTLINE Producer Credited With Freeing 13th Inmate|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/frontline-producer-credited-with-freeing-13th-inmate-658353.htm|website=www.marketwired.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lifetime&gt;{{cite web|title=CASE OF A LIFETIME: A Criminal Defense Lawyer's Story|url=http://us.macmillan.com/caseofalifetime/abbesmith-1|website=us.macmillan.com/|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Trade|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Case of a Lifetime'' was a finalist in the [[21st Lambda Literary Awards]] for best lesbian memoir/biography.

In 2010, she was elected to the American Board of Criminal Lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Talks |url=http://gideonspromise.org/justice-talks/ |website=gideonspromise.org |accessdate=31 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151049/http://gideonspromise.org/justice-talks/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also on the board at the [[Bronx defenders]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Member Abbe Smith's new book "How Can You Represent Those People?" |url=http://www.bronxdefenders.org/board-member-abbe-smiths-new-book-how-can-you-represent-those-people/|website=bronxdefenders.org|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Juvenile Defender Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mid-Atlantic Juvenile Defender Center|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/JJC/new-projects/majdcmd.cfm|website=georgetown.law.edu|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she was the recipient of the Legal Teaching Award from [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Abbe Smith Honored by NYU School of Law|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/professor-abbe-smith-honored-by-nyu-law.cfm|website=law.georgetown.edu|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Smith eulogized her friend and colleague [[Monroe Freedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolley|first1=Alice|title=Eulogy for Monroe Freedman|url=http://www.legalethicsforum.com/blog/2015/03/eulogy-for-monroe.html|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings &amp; commentary==
Professor Smith writes and comments on criminal defense, the criminal justice system, criminal prosecution, legal ethics, and juvenile justice.&lt;ref&gt;"I Ain't Taking' No Plea": The Challenges in Counseling Young People Facing Serious Time, 60 Rutgers L. Rev. 11-31 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Defending and Despairing: The Agony of Juvenile Defense, 6 Nev. L.J. 1127-1136 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Her scholarship has been cited in numerous opinions. In ''State v. Citizen'', The [[Supreme Court of Louisiana]] cited her scholarship on indigent defendants' right to appointed counsel under ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2005/04ka1841.opn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal defense===
Professor Smith writes about representing unpopular clients. She wrote an opinion article in the [[Washington Post]] titled, "What motivates a lawyer to defend a [[Tsarnaev]], a Castro or a [[George M. Zimmerman|Zimmerman]]?"&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=What motivates a lawyer to defend a Tsarnaev, a Castro or a Zimmerman?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-motivates-a-lawyer-to-defend-a-tsarnaev-a-castro-or-a-zimmerman/2013/07/25/e81737e8-f2e5-11e2-ae43-b31dc363c3bf_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith co-edited ''How Can You Represent Those People?'' with [[Monroe Freedman]].&lt;ref name="pal"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Can You Represent Those People?|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/how-can-you-represent-those-people-abbe-smith/?K=9781137311931|website=palgrave.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book—a collection of essays—criminal defense lawyers and others share stories about how it feels to defend people accused of crimes ranging from the ordinary to the horrific.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt; In a piece on [[Judy Clarke]] and representing unpopular clients, she remarked: "Criminal defense is kind of a unique calling — not to sound pretentious — it takes a peculiar heart-set, mind-set to do the work for a career." She continued, "We stand behind people who are often the most reviled."&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Mike|title=Meet The Lawyer Who Could Save Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Lif|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/meet-the-lawyer-who-could-save-dzhokhar-tsarnaevs-life#.dy5OwnQv8|website=www.buzzfeed.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed why lawyers defend monsters on [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why lawyers defend monsters|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/the-cycle/52940281#52940281|website=nbcnews.com|publisher=NBC|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Too Much Heart and Not Enough Heat: The Short Life and Fractured Ego of the Empathic, Heroic Public Defender,'' Smith writes about how one can sustain a career in indigent criminal defense. In order to do this, Smith recommends respect for clients, passion for the professional craft of defense lawyering, and a sense of outrage about the system. Smith writes about two former Prettyman fellows who left indigent criminal defense. Smith rejects [[Charles Ogletree]]'s paradigm of public defenders as empathetic heroes.&lt;ref name=Heat&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=Too Much Heart and Not Enough Heat: The Short Life and Fractured Ego of the Empathic, Heroic Public Defender|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1219&amp;context=facpub|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Bounds of Zeal in Criminal Defense: Some Thoughts on [[Lynne Stewart]],'' Smith discusses the conduct that led to [[Lynne Stewart]]'s prosecution and her approach to lawyering generally. Smith examines whether Stewart's view of zeal and devotion is at odds with the prevailing ethics and ethos of defense lawyering.&lt;ref name=Lynne&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=The Bounds of Zeal in Criminal Defense: Some Thoughts on Lynne Stewart|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1552&amp;context=facpub|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith finds it troubling when the government criminally prosecutes members of the defense bar, especially when it goes after lawyers who represent unpopular clients.&lt;ref name=Lynne/&gt;

===Prosecutors===
Smith often writes about prosecutors. In ''Are Prosecutors Born or Made?,'' Smith writes about her encounters with prosecutors and countless conversations during the course of her thirty-year criminal law practice.&lt;ref name=prosecutors&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=Are Prosecutors Born or Made?|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/1215/|website=scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/|publisher=Geo. J. Legal Studies|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Can You Be a Good Person and a Good Prosecutor?,'' Smith examines the morality of prosecution.&lt;ref name=lawandorder&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbe|first1=Smith|title=Can You Be a Good Person and a Good Prosecutor?|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/887/|website=scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/|publisher=Geo. J. Legal Ethics|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, she explores the context of criminal lawyering at the millennium and what it means to prosecute under current conditions.&lt;ref name=lawandorder/&gt; Then, she discusses whether it is possible to do "good" in this context—that is, whether a well-intentioned prosecutor can temper the harsh reality of the criminal justice system—in view of the institutional and cultural pressures of prosecutor offices.&lt;ref name=lawandorder/&gt; Smith concludes by answering the question posed: she hopes so, but thinks not.&lt;ref name=lawandorder/&gt;

In ''A Call to Abolish Peremptory Challenges by Prosecutors,'' Smith argues that courts should acknowledge the unenforceability of ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'', the landmark United States Supreme Court case prohibiting prosecutors from excluding jurors in criminal cases based solely on race, and admit that the only way to end this insidious practice that leads to less diverse juries is to abolish peremptory challenges by prosecutors.&lt;ref name=abolish&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Abbe|title=A Call to Abolish Peremptory Challenges by Prosecutors|journal=Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7129">'''Al-Mahdi Muhammad bin Ahmed''' (October 27, 1637 &amp;ndash; August 2, 1718), also known as ''Ṣāḥib al-Mawāhib'',&lt;ref&gt;''Judaeo-Yemenite Studies - Proceedings of the Second International Congress'' (ed. Ephraim Isaac &amp; Yosef Tobi), Institute of Semitic Studies: Princeton University 1999, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1689&amp;ndash;1718.&lt;ref&gt;David Solomon Sassoon (ed.), ''Ohel Dawid'' (vol. 2), Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. 969, s.v. דופי הזמן - Vicissitudes of Time - being a description of 17th and 18th century chronology written by a Yemenite Jew (Hebrew); a Microfilm of the manuscript is available at the National Library at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Dept., Microfilm # F-9103, and where pp. 13-14 mention in great detail the struggles of al-Mahdi Muhammad (Hebrew). Of singular importance is the date 2,028 of the [[Seleucid era]] (corresponding to 1717 CE) which is said to have been the twenty-eighth year of his reign, meaning, he rose to power officially in 1689.&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to the [[Qasimid]] family that was descended from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] in 1597&amp;ndash;1962.

==Way to power==

Muhammad was the son of the imam [[al-Mahdi Ahmad]]. When the latter died in 1681, Muhammad was prevented from succeeding him. When the next imam [[al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad II]] died in 1686, a struggle for the imamate broke out between various contenders for a period of three years. Muhammad claimed the imamate in Mansura, but was besieged by opposing relatives. However, he managed to break the siege and capture the enemy leaders. He was now generally acknowledged by the various parts of the country. He is known under the name ''Ṣāḥib al-Mawāhib'' because he kept his residence in al-Mawahib east of Dhamar.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==

Al-Mahdi Muhammad was known to Zaidi [[historiography]] as a tough and arbitrary ruler who was unwilling to listen to advice. He exacted taxes that were not according to the [[shariah]]. On the other hand, he had an ascetic outward appearance and declined silk or fine cloths. His arbitrary killings of subjects gave rise to popular beliefs that his evil actions were influenced by a [[Genie|jinn]]. A [[France|French]] delegation met the imam in February 1712. The visitors described him as a man about 80 with handsome figure and countenance. He displayed very little pomp except when going to the Friday prayer; then he would be accompanied by 1,000 foot soldiers and 200 horsemen, together with mounted officers of the household and court.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Jewish exiles had returned from their banishment to [[Mawza Exile|Mawza]], Imam al-Mahdi Muhammad is said to have drawn the Jews near to himself, defended them and made it possible for them to return to their previous status.&lt;ref&gt;''Judaeo-Yemenite Studies - Proceedings of the Second International Congress'' (ed. Ephraim Isaac &amp; Yosef Tobi), Institute of Semitic Studies: Princeton University 1999, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political events==

Al-Mahdi Muhammad's long reign was interspersed with internal rebellions and crises. In 1689 he attempted to win back [[Yafa]] in the east, which had been lost to the Zaidi state in the previous reign. The enterprise failed, however, and Yafa tribesmen raided [[Ibb]] in 1708. [[Sa'dah]] in the far north rebelled in 1691 under the [[emir]] Ali bin Ahmad bin al-Qasim. The emir led an army of tribesmen against San'a, but the siege was defeated. The imam's troops, in turn, conquered Sa'dah and forced Ali to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Tomislav Klaric, 'Chronologie du Yémen (1045-1131/1635-1719)', ''Chroniques yémenites'' 9 2001, http://cy.revues.org/36 .&lt;/ref&gt; In 1699 a [[Sayyid]], Ibrahim al-Mahatwari, rose against the imam. He was reputed to be a great [[magician (paranormal)|magician]], and his ecstatic followers defeated several of the imam's armies. Eventually he claimed to be the expected [[Mahdi]] of [[Shi'a]] belief. The imam's sons finally crushed the rebellion, and Ibrahim al-Mahatwari was killed. On the positive side, the reign of al-Mahdi Muhammad enjoyed some external prestige. In 1701-1702 he received envoys from Shah [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]] of [[Persia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[pasha]] in [[Jeddah]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Stookey, ''Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic''. Boulder 1978, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The soaring prices of coffee, which was still almost solely produced in Yemen, underpinned the resources and prestige of the imamate.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Gavin, ''Aden under British Rule, 1839-1967.'' London 1975, pp. 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the reign==

Towards the end of al-Mahdi Muhammad's reign several persons rose and claimed the imamate, as a consequence of his highhanded governance and abuse of the laws. An al-Mu'ayyad al-Husayn was proclaimed imam in [[Sa'dah]] in 1709-1712, and in 1714 an al-Mutawakkil bin Ali briefly besieged the imam at al-Mawahib. In 1716 [[al-Mansur al-Husayn]] rebelled against al-Mahdi Muhammad and set forth his claim ([[da'wah]]) as king of the northern tribes in the strong fortress Shaharah. His call was heeded in a large part of Yemen. At that time, towns and villages in the outlying regions of [[Sana'a]] were attacked by hordes of pillaging armies from the north. Jewish houses in the newly built Jewish Quarter outside of Sana'a, ''Bir al-'Azab'', were ravaged.&lt;ref&gt;David Solomon Sassoon (ed.), ''Ohel Dawid'' (vol. 2), Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. 969, s.v. דופי הזמן - ''Vicissitudes of Time'' - being a description of 17th and 18th century chronology written by a Yemenite Jew (Hebrew); a Microfilm of the manuscript is available at the National Library at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103, and where pp. 13-14 mention in great detail the struggles of al-Mahdi Muhammad (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mahdi Muhammad sent his nephew al-Qasim to deal with the situation. After a lost battle, al-Qasim submitted to the pretender-imam. Al-Mahdi Muhammad was forced to yield, and his name was removed from the address in the [[Friday prayer]]. However, al-Qasim took the first opportunity to proclaim himself imam, as [[al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim]], thus opposing al-Mansur al-Husayn. In this uneasy situation, the old al-Mahdi Muhammad died in 1718 while his residence al-Mawahib was under siege.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amphidromia''' ({{lang-el|τὰ Ἀμφιδρόμια}}), in [[ancient Greece]], was a ceremonial feast celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child.

It was a family [[Athenian festivals|festival]] of the [[Athens|Athenians]], at which the newly born child was introduced into the family, and children of poorer families received their names. Wealthier families held a naming ceremony for their children on the tenth day called ''dekate''. This ceremony, unlike the Amphidromia, was open to the public by invitation. No particular day was fixed for this solemnity; but it did not take place very soon after the birth of the child, for it was believed that most children died before the seventh day, and the solemnity was therefore generally deferred till after that period, that there might be at least some probability of the child remaining alive.

According to [[Suda|Suidas]], the festival was held on the fifth day, when the women who had lent their assistance at the birth washed their hands, but this purification preceded the real solemnity. The friends and relations of the parents were invited to the festival of the amphidromia, which was held in the evening, and they generally appeared with presents, among which are mentioned the [[cuttlefish]] and the marine [[polyp]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesych. and Harpocr. s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; The house was decorated on the outside with [[olive branch]]es if the child was a boy, or with [[garland]]s of [[wool]] if the child was a girl; and a repast was prepared, at which, if we may judge from a fragment of [[Ephippus of Athens]] in [[Athenaeus]] (ix. p.&amp;nbsp;370 ; comp. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;65), the guests must have been rather merry..

The child was then carried round the fire by the nurse, and thus, as it were, presented to the gods of the house and to the family, and at the same time received its name, to which the guests were witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Isaeus. ''De Pyrrhi Haered.'' p. 34. s. 30. Bekker.&lt;/ref&gt; The carrying of the child round the hearth was the principal part of the solemnity, from which its name was derived. But the [[Scholiast]] on [[Aristophanes]] (''Lysistr.'' 758) derives its name from the fact that the guests, whilst the name was given to the child, walked or danced around it.

This festival is sometimes called from the day on which it took place.&lt;ref&gt;Hesych. and Aristoph. Av. 923; K. F. Hermann, ''Lehrb. d. gottesdienstlichen Altertümer d. Griechen'', § 48. n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Soldier controversy==
[[File:Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Bronze Soldier]] monument, with the stone structure reconstructed, at its new permanent location, June 2007]]
Christopher Walker and Robert Orttung allege that [[Government of Russia|Kremlin]]-controlled sectors of the [[Russian media]] took advantage of anti-Estonian sentiment during Estonia's 2007 relocation of the [[Bronze Soldier]], a Soviet-era monument to Russia's victory over Germany in the [[Second World War]], originally called "Monument to the Liberators of [[Tallinn]]".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walker and Robert Orttung, [http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1079468.html "Russia: Putinism's Impact On The Neighbors"].

According to [[Lilia Shevtsova]], Senior Associate at the Russian Domestic Politics and Political Institutions Program Chair of the [[Carnegie Moscow Center]], anti-Estonian sentiment was intentionally escalated by Kremlin in its "search for enemies", however she also notes that even Russian democrats took Estonia's removal of the statue immediately before one of the [[Victory Day (9 May)|most respected and cherished dates in the Russian calendar]], to be an affront to the Russian national honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Russia--lost in Transition |last=Shevtsova |first=Lilia |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Carnegie Endowment |location= |isbn=0-87003-236-4 |page=200 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7giTPNSJx3cC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government used its state controlled media to propagate anti-Estonian sentiment in order to encourage ethnic Russian outrage, leading to [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia|coordinated waves of cyber attacks against Estonian internet infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance |last=Mueller |first=Milton L. |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=MIT Press |location= |isbn=978-0-262-01459-5 |page=23 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qH3TAvkAtsEC&amp;pg=PA23 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of Estonia [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] stated at the time: "We are witnesses to the information war against Estonia which already reminds of an ideological aggression".&lt;ref&gt;Statement made by the President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves, 30.04.2007 {{cite web | last=Sinisalu | first=Arnold | title=Propaganda, Information War and the Estonian-Russian Treaty Relations: Some Aspects of International Law | url=http://www.juridica.ee/international_en.php?document=en/international/2008/2/145397.ART.10.pub.php | date= | work=Juridica International | publisher= | accessdate=2009-04-04 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===eSStonia===
[[File:I don't go to eSStonia.jpg|thumb|"I won't go to eSStonia" badge produced by ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' as part of its Estonian boycott campaign. The SS refers to the Nazi German [[Schutzstaffel]], commonly known as SS.]]

An anti-Estonian [[pejorative]] [[neologism]], ''eSStonia'', appeared in the [[Russia]]n media, on [[Runet]], and at the street protests in the midst of the [[Bronze Soldier]] controversy in 2007. The term, a [[portmanteau]] of [[Estonia]] and [[SS]], is intended to portray Estonia as a [[neo-Nazi]] state.&lt;ref name="baltic"&gt;{{cite news   | url = http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/19265/  | title = If you're a real Russian, don't have any fun in Tallinn  | publisher = [[Baltic Times]]  | location = [[Tallinn]]  | date = 13 November 2007 | accessdate = 2008-01-26 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080122072029/http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/19265/| archivedate= 22 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, some participants in the protested outside the [[Embassy of Estonia in Moscow]] organized by the Russian youth organisation [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] carried signs stating "Wanted. The Ambassador of the Fascist State of eSStonia" ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|«Разыскивается посол фашистского государства эSSтония»}}), referring to the then-[[Russian-Estonian relations|Ambassador of Estonia to Russia]] [[Marina Kaljurand]].&lt;ref name="kommersant"/&gt; In May 2007, members of the [[Young Guard of United Russia]] picketed the Consulate-General of Estonia in [[Saint Petersburg]] holding up pickets with slogans such as "eSStonia–the shame of Europe!" ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|«эSSтония&amp;nbsp;— позор Европы!»}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:"Молодая Гвардия" подсчитала ненужные эстонские товары |location=Saint Petersburg |agency=''[[Rosbalt]]'' |date=7 May 2007 |url=http://www.rosbaltpiter.ru/2007/05/07/308791.html |accessdate=2008-12-27 |language=ru }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''eSStonia'' in protests by Nashi and the Young Guard determined the head of the [[Saint Petersburg]] youth branch of [[Yabloko]] to file a complaint with [[Yury Chaika]], the [[Prosecutor General of Russia]], asking for an investigation into a possible breach of Article 282: Incitement of National, Racial, or Religious Enmity of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]].&lt;ref name="kommersant"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Boronov  | first = Alexander  |author2= Shevchuk, Mikhail  | script-title=ru:Между прокремлевскими движениями посеяли рознь  | location = Saint Petersburg  |agency='' [[Kommersant]]'' | date = 21 June 2007  | url = http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=776169  | accessdate = 2008-12-27 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура проверяет "Наших" и "Молодую гвардию" на экстремизм  | agency= ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]''  | date = 21 June 2007  | url= http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/121956.html  | accessdate = 2009-01-23 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]], the biggest selling [[List of newspapers in Russia|daily newspaper in Russia]], ran a campaign asking readers to boycott travel to Estonia, Estonian goods and services.

==Russian accusations of sympathies with Nazism==

In 2007, as a response to the possibility of removal of World War II graves (in the context of the [[Bronze Soldier]] controversy) Russian [[State Duma]] issued a statement accusing "the Estonian government's intention to continue its course of representing Nazism in a heroic light and justifying its ideology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Estonia_ignores_Russian_accusations_01182007.html "Estonia "ignores" Russian accusations as graves row grows"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/world/20070730/69968600.html "Estonia dismisses Russian charge it glorifies Nazism"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Russia, the youth movement [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] has been noted for anti-Estonian sentiments among its members; often, it is [[framing (social sciences)|framed]] as anti-fascism activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paber.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/CB6B8795DD740079C225733700664730 ekspress.ee]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assyrian Canadians''' are [[Canadians]] of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] descent or Assyrians who have [[Canadian citizenship]]. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] there were 10,810 Canadians who claimed Assyrian ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=1118296&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0 |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |author=[[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase compared to the 8,650 in the 2006 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=92333&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=801&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=80&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|title=Ethnic Origin (247), Single and Multiple Ethnic Origin Responses (3) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, |year=2006|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are the indigenous ''pre-Arab'' and ''pre-Turkic'' people of [[Northern Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northeastern [[Syria]], and northwest [[Iran]], who speak dialects of [[Eastern Aramaic]] and are mainly Christian, although some are irreligious. Although most come from the aforementioned countries, many Assyrians have immigrated to Canada from [[Jordan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] as well.

== History ==
Most Assyrians arrived in Canada due to both [[ethnic persecution]] and [[religious persecution]], mainly from their ancient ancestral [[Assyrian homeland]] in northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northeast [[Syria]] and northwest [[Iran]]. The migration to Canada may be broken up into a number of distinct periods: early settlement and the subsequent waves of migration sparked by the [[Assyrian genocide]] in present-day Turkey and Iran, the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 and, more recently, the [[Iraq War]] and [[Syrian Civil War]]. The last 2006 [[Census Canada]] counted 8,650&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=92333&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=801&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=80&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|title=Ethnic Origin (247), Single and Multiple Ethnic Origin Responses (3) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, |year=2006|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first period of known mass-migration came just after the [[Assyrian Genocide]] in the dying days of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. The second and perhaps largest wave of migration into came during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Under the shadow of war, Saddam Hussein's [[al-Anfal Campaign]] constituted a major force for migration for Iraq's Assyrian population.

A '''Canadian Brazilian''' ({{lang-pt|canadense-brasileiro}}) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] person who is fully, partially or predominantly of Canadian descent, or a [[Canadian]]-born [[immigrant]] in Brazil. Many Canadians also travel to [[Brazil]] for work. From 1925–1968, over 11,631 Canadians had settled in Brazil.
Canada has always had a significant relationship with Brazil since the 1800s. The countries have had extensive interactions in the financing of infrastructure projects, particularly utilities. Brazil is the largest recipient of Canadian investment in South America and until 1974 was the venue for the largest single Canadian foreign investment. In 1991, Canadian investment in Brazil totalled around CANS 2 billion.

One of the more interesting aspects of Canadian - Brazilian relations is the quiet nature of the relationship, and a lack of interest in this relationship on the part of scholars in particular and Canadians in general.

To a Canadian, Brazil has meant coffee and Carnival, while to a Brazilian 'Canada is sometimes seen as a remote northern country, a pale reflection of the United States.

[[Image:Corfou 1720.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Map of Venetian Corfu by [[Christoph Weigel]] in 1720, when the Corfiot Italians were the majority in the capital "Cittá di Corfu"]]

'''Corfiot Italians''' (or "Corfiote Italians") are a population from the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Corfu]] (Kerkyra) with ethnic and linguistic ties to the [[Republic of Venice]]. Their name was specifically established by [[Niccolò Tommaseo]] during the Italian [[Risorgimento]]. During the first half of the 20th century, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] (whose fascist regime promoted the ideals of [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]]) successfully used the Corfiot Italians as a pretext to occupy Corfu twice.

==Origins==
[[Image:Corfuvenetianblazon.jpg|thumb|Venetian [[blazon]] with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], as frequently found on the New Fortress walls]]

The origins of the Corfiot Italian community can be found in the expansion of the Italian States toward the [[Balkans]] during and after the [[Crusades]]. In the 12th century, the [[Kingdom of Naples]] sent some Italian families to Corfu to rule the island. From the [[Fourth Crusade]] of 1204 onwards, the [[Republic of Venice]] sent many Italian families to Corfu. These families brought the Italian language of the [[Middle Ages]] to the island.&lt;ref&gt;Tagliavini, Carlo. ''Le origini delle lingue neolatine'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Venice ruled Corfu and the [[Ionian islands]], which lasted during the [[Renaissance]] and until the late 18th century, most of the Corfiote upper classes spoke [[Italian language|Italian]] (or [[Venetian language|Venetian]] in many cases), but the mass of people remained Greek ethnically, linguistically, and religiously before and after the Ottoman sieges of the 16th century.

Corfiot Italians were mainly concentrated in the city of Corfu, which was called "Città di Corfù" by the Venetians. More than half of the population of Corfu city in the 18th century was Venetian-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano...Malta, Corsica, Nizza'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-emergence of Greek nationalism, after the [[Napoleonic]] era, contributed to the disappearance of the Corfiot Italians. Corfu was ultimately incorporated into [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] in 1864. The Greek government abolished all Italian schools in the Ionian islands in 1870, and as a consequence, by the 1940s there were only four hundred Corfiote Italians left.&lt;ref&gt;Vignoli Giulio. ''Gli Italiani Dimenticati. Minoranze Italiane In Europa'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venetian heritage==
[[Image:Dalmazia1560.png|thumb|right|Map of the Republic of Venice in 1560, partially showing Corfu at the bottom.]]

The [[Republic of Venice]] dominated Corfu for nearly five centuries until 1797. Although assailed several times by Turkish naval and land forces and subjected to four notable sieges in 1537, 1571, 1573 and 1716, in which the great natural strength of the city and its defenders asserted itself time after time. The effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications of the island was a great factor that enabled Corfu to remain the last bastion of free, uninterrupted Greek and [[Christian civilization]] in the southern Balkans after the [[fall of Constantinople]]. [[Will Durant]], an American historian, claims that Corfu owed to the Republic of Venice the fact that it was the only part of Greece never conquered by the Muslim Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant. ''The Renaissance'', p. 684.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks occupied briefly some of the other [[Ionian islands]], but were unsuccessful with their four sieges of Corfu. This fact gave Corfu and [[Malta]] the title of "Bastions of Christian Europe" during the late Renaissance.

===Language===
During these centuries, many Venetians moved to the island. Because of its association with the ruling elite, by the end of the 15th century, the influence of the [[Italian language]] and culture (including in some ways the [[Roman Catholic church]]) assumed a predominant role in the island. Until the second half of the 20th century the ''[[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]]'' was spoken in Corfu, and the local [[Greek language]] assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. Indeed, even before the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] much of the population in Corfu spoke the ''Veneto da mar'' or the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca|Mediterranean Lingua Franca Sabir]] as a second, or first, language.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano... Malta, Corsica, Nizza'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"Corfu had also a demographic problem because of the constant Turkish invasions. Venice declared an invitation to everyone who wanted to move and live in Corfu. Cretans, Peloponnesians, people from Epirus and many Venetians were moved to Corfu. Pieces of land were given to Venetians in order to stay on the island permanently."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1084646 BBC: the Venetian town of Corfu]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Corfu passed as a dowry from the Greek [[Despot of Epirus]] to [[Manfred of Sicily]] in 1259, and was not ruled by [[Greeks]] again until the 19th century. It became Venetian in 1386 although, with the exception of Corfu city which maintained a majority of a Venetian-speaking population (due partially to the [[Italkian]] of the capital's Jewish community), most of the peasants retained Greek as their first language.

According to historian Ezio Gray, the small communities of Venetian-speaking people in Corfu were mostly assimilated after the island became part of Greece in 1864 and especially after all Italian schools were closed in 1870.&lt;ref name="Gray, Ezio p. 118"&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano... Malta, Corsica, Nizza'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Italian language]] maintained some importance, as can be seen by the fact that poets like Stefano Martzokis (Marzocchi was the surname of the father, an Italian from [[Emilia-Romagna]]) and Geranimos Markonos, the first from Corfù and the second from [[Cefalonia]], wrote some of their poems in Italian during the second half of the 19th century.

===Culture and learning===
Venetian rule significantly influenced many aspects of the island's culture. The Venetian feudal families pursued a mild but somewhat assimilating policy towards the natives, who began to adopt many aspects of Venetian customs and culture. The Corfiotes were encouraged to enrich themselves by the cultivation of the olive, but were debarred from entering into commercial competition with Venice. The island served even as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732 became the home of the first Academy of modern Greece. The first newspaper of Corfu was in Italian: the official weekly newspaper (''Gazzetta degli Stati Uniti delle Isole Jone'') was first published in 1814. First in Italian, then in both Greek and Italian, finally from 1850 in Greek and English; and it continued for the entire duration of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|English Protectorate]] until 1864. Many Italian Jews took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian period and spoke their own language, a mixture of Hebrew and Venetian with some Greek words.

Venetian influence was also important in the development of the [[opera]] in Corfu. During Venetian rule, the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of [[Italian opera]], and many local composers, such as the Corfiot Italians Antonio Liberali and Domenico Padovani developed their career with the theatre of Corfu, called ''Teatro di San Giacomo''.

Corfu's cuisine also maintains some Venetian delicacies, cooked with local spicy recipes. Dishes include "Pastitsado" (the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, that comes from the Venetian dish Spezzatino), "Strapatsada", "Sofrito", "Savoro", "Bianco" and "Mandolato". Some traditions in Corfu were introduced by the Venetians such as the Carnival (''Ta Karnavalia'').

===Architecture===
[[Image:Corfu town.jpg|thumb|right|View over Corfu City from the New Fortress, with the Old Fortress visible in the background.]]
[[File:Corfu venetian quarter overview bgiu.jpg|thumb|View of the Venetian quarter]]

The architecture of [[Corfu City]] still reflects its long Venetian heritage, with its multi-storied buildings, its spacious squares such as the popular "Spianada" and the narrow cobblestone alleys known as "Kantounia". The town began to grow during the Venetian period on a low hillock situated between the two forts. In many respects, Corfu typifies the small Venetian town, or ''borgo'', of which there are numerous other surviving examples in the former Venetian territories of the [[Adriatic Sea]], such as [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] and [[Spalato]] in [[Dalmatia]]. As in [[Venice]] itself, the "campi" developed haphazardly in the urban fabric where it was natural for residents to congregate, especially around churches, civic buildings, fountains, and cisterns. The best example of such a space is Plateia Dimarcheiou ("Town Hall Square"), overlooked on its north side by the 17th century Loggia dei Nobili (which today serves as the seat of the local government) and on the east side by the late sixteenth century Catholic Church of St. Iakovos, or St. James. The Italian Renaissance is best represented on Corfu by the surviving structures of the ''Fortezza Vecchia'' (the Old Fortress) on the eastern side of the town, built by the Veronese military engineer [[Michele Sanmicheli]] and the Venetian Ferrante Vitelli, who also designed the later fortress on the west, the ''Fortezza Nuova''.

Venetians promoted the Catholic Church during their four centuries of rule in Corfu. Today, the majority of Corfiots are Greek Orthodox Christians (following the official religion of Greece). However, there is still a percentage of Catholics (5% or {{circa}} 4,000 people) who owe their faith to their Venetian origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from Malta (about two thirds), but also from Italy during Venetian rule. The Catholic community almost exclusively resides in the Venetian "Citadel" of [[Corfu City]], living harmoniously alongside the Orthodox community.

====Teatro di San Giacomo====
[[File:Corfu Town Hall R01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]] (now Corfu City Hall)]]

During Venetian rule, the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian opera, which was the real source of the extraordinary (given conditions in the mainland of Greece) musical development of the island during that era. The opera house of Corfu during 18th and 19th centuries was that of the ''[[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo]]'', named after the neighbouring Catholic cathedral, but the theatre was later converted into the Town Hall. A long series of local composers, such as Antonio Liberali (a son of an Italian bandmaster of the British Army, who later translated his surname to 'Eleftheriadis'), Domenico Padovani (whose family has been in Corfu since the 16th century) or [[Spyridon Xyndas]] contributed to the fame of the Teatro di San Giacomo.

The first opera to be performed in the San Giacomo Theatre had been as far back as 1733 ("Gerone, tiranno di Siracusa"), and for almost two hundred years between 1771 until 1943 nearly every major operatic composition from the Italian tradition, as well as many others of Greek and French composers, were performed at the stage of the San Giacomo theatre. This impressive tradition, invoking an exceptional musical past, continues to be reflected in the mythology supporting the opera theatre of Corfu, reputed to be fixture on famous opera singers' working travel itineraries. Operatic performers who found success at the theatre were distinguished with the accolade ''applaudito in Corfu'' ("applauded in Corfu") as a tribute to the discriminating musical sensibility of the island's audience.

==Corfiot Italians and the Risorgimento==
[[Image:Ugo Foscolo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ugo Foscolo]], hero of the Italian Risorgimento, was born in Zante and briefly lived in Corfu.]]
The Italian [[Risorgimento]] was initially concentrated in the Italian peninsula with the surrounding continental areas ([[Istria]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Trentino]], [[Nice|Nizzardo]], etc.) and did not reach Corfu and the [[Ionian islands]]. One of the main heroes of the Italian Risorgimento, the poet [[Ugo Foscolo]], was born in [[Zante]] from a noble Venetian family of the island, but only superficially promoted the possible unification of the Ionian islands to Italy.

The first newspaper of Corfu was in Italian: the official weekly newspaper (''Gazzetta degli Stati Uniti delle Isole Jone'') was first published in 1814. First in Italian, then in both Greek and Italian, finally from 1850 in Greek and English; and it continued for the entire duration of the English Protectorate until 1864.

According to historian Ezio Gray, the small communities of Venetian-speaking people in Corfu were mostly assimilated after the island became part of Greece in 1864 and especially after all Italian schools were closed in 1870.&lt;ref name="Gray, Ezio p. 118"/&gt;

However, the Italian language maintained some importance, as can be seen by the fact that poets like Stefano Martzokis (Marzocchi was the surname of the father, an Italian from [[Emilia-Romagna]]) and Geranimos Markonos, the first from Corfù and the second from [[Cefalonia]], wrote in Italian some of their poems in the second half of the 19th century.

The island of Corfu was a refuge for many Italians in exile during the [[Unification of Italy|Wars of Independence of Italy]], like [[Niccolò Tommaseo]] (who married Diamante Pavello-Artale, a Corfiot Italian).&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism, 1870-1925'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], however, the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] started to apply a policy of expansionism toward the Adriatic area and saw Corfu as the gate of this sea. [[Benito Mussolini]] developed an extreme nationalistic position in accordance to the ideals of [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]] and actively promoted the unification of Corfu to Italy.

The Corfiote Italians, even if reduced to a few hundreds in the 1930s, were strongly supported by [[fascist]] propaganda and in the summer of 1941 (after the Italian occupation of the Ionian islands)  Italian schools were reopened in Corfu city.&lt;ref name="Vignoli Giulio p. 143"&gt;Vignoli Giulio ''Gli Italiani Dimenticati. Minoranze Italiane In Europa'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II Mussolini promoted an initial development of Italian irredentism in Corfu, similar to the one being promoted in [[Italian irredentism in Savoy|Savoy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano... Malta, Corsica, Nizza'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian occupations of Corfu==
Italy occupied Corfu two times: the first for a few months only in 1923 after the assassination of Italian officers; the second during World War II, from April 1941 to September 1943.

===Corfu Incident of 1923===
{{details|Corfu incident}}
At the end of December 1915, Italy sent a military force to Corfu under the command of General Marro. They established Post Offices with the French occupation troops there. In 1915–1919, the Italian and French forces (as well as [[Serbia]]n forces) remained on the island. The Italians did not have any intention of pulling out, but the British and the French government forced them to displace.

In 1923, the Italians tried to occupy Corfu again, but, on the morning of 27 August 1923, unknown persons murdered General Enrico Tellini and three officers of the Italian border commission on the Greek–Albanian border.

Italy made an announcement asking within 24 hours the following [[ultimatum|demands]]: an official apology of the Greek government; the commemoration of the dead in the Catholic Church of Athens, with all the members of the Greek government to participate; the rendering of honors to the Italian flag and the Italian naval squadron anchored in Faliro; an investigation of the Greek authorities, with the participation of the Italian officer Perone di San Martino, which should end within 5 days; the death penalty for those found guilty; the  payment of 50 million Italian lire within 5 days by the Greek government as indemnity; and finally, that the dead should be honored with military honors in [[Preveza]].

The Greek government responded accepting only the first three and the last demands. Consequently, using this as a pretext, the [[Italian Army]] suddenly attacked Corfu on 31 August 1923. Commander Antony Foschini asked the prefect of Corfu to surrender the island. The prefect refused and he informed the government. Foschini warned him that the Italian forces would attack at 17:00 and the Corfiots refused to raise the white flag in the fortress. Seven thousand refugees, 300 orphans plus the military hospital were lodged in the Old Fortress, as well as the School of Police in the New Fortress. At 17:05 the Italians bombarded Corfu for 20 minutes. There were victims among the refugees of the old Fortress and the Prefect ordered the raising of the white flag. The Italians besieged the island and set the forces ashore. From the beginning of their possession, they started to inflict hard penalties on the people who had guns, and the officers declared that their possession was permanent. There were daily requisitions of houses and they censored the newspapers. Greece asked for the intervention of the [[League of Nations]], of which both Greece and Italy were members, and demanded the solution of the problem through arbitration. The Italian government of [[Benito Mussolini]] refused, declaring that Corfu would remain occupied until the acceptance of the Italian terms. On 7 September 1923, the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] in Paris ended with the evacuation of the Italian forces from Corfu, which finally began on 20 September 1923 and ended on the 27th of the same month.

===World War II===
{{See also|Axis Occupation of Greece}}
After World War I, Italy had embarked on a policy of expansionism towards the Adriatic, in which Corfu played an important role, as it controlled entrance to it. As shown by the incident of 1923, Mussolini and [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]] had set their sights firmly on the island. The Italian community was an especially useful tool, and it was both supported and exploited by Fascist propaganda.&lt;ref name="Vignoli Giulio p. 143"/&gt;

During the Second World War Mussolini wanted to possess the Ionian Islands, which he succeeded with the help of the Germans during the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The Italians occupied Corfu from 28 March 1941. They implemented a process of [[italianization]], with creation of Italian schools, centered around the small surviving community of the Corfiote Italians, who still spoke the Venetian dialect,&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano... Malta, Corsica, Nizza'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; but which by that time numbered only 500 people, living mainly in Corfu city.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ezio. ''Le terre nostre ritornano...Malta, Corsica, Nizza'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-177-1459-32, Korfu, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Italian soldiers taken prisoner by the Germans in Corfu, September 1943]]

The first reaction to the Italian occupation happened on the first Sunday of November 1941. During the procession of the [[Saint Spyridon]], the fascist young Corfiot Italians participated and provoked the students of the Greek high schools. When the procession arrived in the Upper Square, the students started to leave whilst singing the national Greek songs. The "Carbinaria" and the "Finetsia" [[fascist]] groups attacked and arrested many Greek students, beating them and exiling some of them to the island of Othonous. After that episode there was a relative calm in Corfu until the [[Italian armistice|surrender]] of Italy on 9 September 1943.

From 10 to 14 September 1943, the Germans tried to force the Italian garrison in Corfu to surrender, while the political prisoners from the small island of Lazaretto were set free. Finally, on the morning of 13 September, Corfiots woke up to the disasters of the war, as the Germans attacked the island. The German air raids continued the whole day bombarding the port, the Fortresses and strategic points. During the night of 14 September, huge damages were inflicted to the Jewish quarters of Saint Fathers and Saint Athanasios, the Court House, the Ionian Parliament, the Ionian Academy, in which the Library was lodged, the Schools of Middle Education, the Hotel "Bella Venezia", the Customs Office, the Manor-Houses and the Theatre. Finally the next week the Germans occupied the island with huge losses among the Italians, and subsequently deported the nearly 5,000 Jews (speakers of the [[Italkian]]) of the island to concentration camps, where most of them perished.

Currently, the Venetian language is no longer spoken in Corfu as its last speakers died in the 1980s. Moreover, there are only a few Jews in Corfu city who still speak [[Italkian]], a Jewish language mixed with many Venetian words.

==Italian with Venetian/Apulian influences==
[[Image:Greece Corfu Island - Capital Kérkira domicile.jpg|thumb|right|Old Venetian-style buildings of downtown Corfu city.]]

Historically, the upper class of the Jewish community of Corfu spoke a Venetian dialect with some modifications (due to the influence of Greek) (see "[[Italkian]]").

The Venetian of the Corfiote Jews accordingly differed from the same Venetian dialect as spoken by non-Jews in the same town. A characteristic of this dialect is the formation in "ò" of the plural of nouns ending in "à", a formation which originated in the Hebrew ending, simplified, according to the Italian laws of phonology, into "ò", e.g., the Italianized plural of "berakah" is "berakhò" (for "berakot"); hence "novità", "novitò"; "città", "cittò." There has presumably been no Jewish literature in this dialect, since [[Venice]] herself very early adopted pure Italian as her official language, and all documents of the Corfu Jewish community were written in that language, which served as well in [[Hebrew]] schools as the means of translating the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Fortis, Umberto and Zolli, Paolo. ''La parlata giudeo-veneziana'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent residence in Corfu was also found by the Apulian Jews, who brought from the Italian coast their vernacular and a few specimens, still preserved, of their literature. The dialect from [[Apulia]] was accordingly spoken by the under class of the Jewish community. Two Apulian love-songs, seemingly original, exist in manuscript, of which one is an independent composition of a rather scurrilous purport, while in the second each stanza is preceded by one of a religious Hebrew poem on a quite different subject. Both are written in Hebrew characters, as is a semioriginal composition containing the rules for the [[Passover]] supper, of which the following paragraph (with Italian words retransliterated) may be cited:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pigiamu la  cu li doi signali, e la spartimu a menzu, edizzimu: Comu spartimu chista, cussi   spardiu lu Mari Ruviu, e passàra li padri nostri intra di issu e fizzi cun issi  e . Cussì cu fazza cu nùi; chistu annu accà, l'annu che veni à la terra di  omini liberi.—Menza mintimu sotto la tovaggia pir, e l'altva menza infra li doi, pir cu farrimu."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The simple past tense ("vitti", "vidisti", "vitti") was the only one in use among the Apulian Jews, who agreed in this respect with the Apulians of the Italian coast; they differed from the latter, however, in forming the future, which is expressed by means of the auxiliary "anzu" (= "I have"), as on the Continent, and a following infinitive, which is always, as in modern Greek, resolved. Such resolution occurs quite frequently in the area of [[Bari]] (with the particles "mu" or "mi"), but not as regularly as in Corfu, where with the exception of the substantivized forms "lu manzari", "lu mbiviri", and a few others, the unresolved infinitive is absolutely unknown. So to-day "dirò", "aggiu diri" and "aggiu mu dicu" occur on the Continent, but only "anzu cu dicu", in Corfu.

This dialect has brought all borrowed words under its own laws of accidence; but its original vocabulary has been hopelessly impoverished and deprived of its finest elements. A Corfiote Jew visiting any part of Apulia would have found difficulty in understanding the spoken vernacular or the songs of the natives, although the grammatical structure is exactly the same as that of his own dialect.

The Jews can boast of having preserved the oldest text in the Apulian dialect, a collection of translations of Hebrew dirges dating from the thirteenth century and now in the [[British Museum]] (MS. Or. 6276). It contains many obsolete terms which are very close to the Latin and many of the older and fuller grammatical forms. Among its points of interest are words and phrases such as "tamen sollicitatevi" (="mind"), "etiam Ribbi Ismahel", "lu coriu" (="skin"), "di la carni sua", "la ostia" (="army"), and "di li cieli." In the fourteenth century the decay of Apulian in Corfu had so far advanced that readers were no longer able to pronounce correctly the words of this Hebrew manuscript or to grasp their meanings. Vowel-points were accordingly inserted, but very inaccurately; and later an incompetent scribe incorrectly substituted "duzzini" (= "dozens"), "douzelli" (= "young men"), "macchina" (= "machine") for "magina" (= "image"), and attempted to erase the superlative termination of "grandissima." It was perhaps owing to the influence of the Venetian [[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]] that he spared all the simple futures; but in four or five places where the pronoun of the first person was erased the substituted words have so thoroughly obliterated the original readings that it is impossible to discover what was the old form of the peculiar "joni" which is now used side by side with "jò."

Today there are less than one hundred Corfiote Jews in the island of Corfu, subsequent to the [[Nazi]] deportations during World War II.

==Maltese Italians in Corfu==
A large community of descendants of [[Italian irredentism in Malta|Maltese Italians]] is still present in Corfu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maltamigration.com/history/exodus/chapter3-2.shtml Malta Migration]&lt;/ref&gt; Their forebears came to the island during the 19th century, when the British authorities brought many skilled workers from [[Malta]] to the Ionian Islands. The British needed married men so that their work would be continued by their children, and as a consequence 80 people (40 families from 1815 until 1860) were transported to Corfu, whose descendants remain on the island today.

In 1901, there were almost one thousand people in Corfu who considered themselves to be ethnic Maltese. In [[Cephalonia]] the number was 225. There were another hundred Maltese spread among the other lesser islands of the Ionian Group. Maltese emigration to these islands practically ceased when they were returned to Greece in 1864. Because of the union with Greece, a number of Maltese families abandoned Corfu and settled in [[Cardiff]], Wales, where their descendants still live.

In Corfu, two villages on the island bear names testifying to Maltese presence: Maltezika is named after Malta and Cozzella got its name from [[Gozo]]. In Cozzella the Franciscan Sisters of Malta opened a convent and a school in 1907. Those two institutions still flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Charles. ''Malta and the Maltese: a study in nineteenth century migration'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, there were some 1,200 ethnic Maltese in Corfu, but many of them spoke either Greek or the local Corfiot dialect, which still bore traces of the Venetian occupation of the island. Because of this Venetian connection, Fascist propagandists tried to build up an [[Italia irredenta|irredentist]] case for Corfu. Guido Puccio wrote in "Tribuna", a leading Roman newspaper on 12 September 1923, that the Maltese element in Corfu could be used as an instrument to further Italian claims on that island.

In 1930, the Maltese in Corfu had their own priest who looked after their welfare while he kept useful contacts with the ecclesiastical and civil authorities in Malta. That priest was the Rev. Spiridione Cilia, who had been born in Corfu of Maltese parents and became the parish priest of the Maltese community.

The Corfiot Maltese community currently numbers 3,500 people in the entire island. They constitute the center of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] community of Corfu, but not one among continues to speaks the [[Maltese language]]. The former mayor of the [[Corfu (city)|city of Corfu]], Sotiris Micalef, is of Maltese descent.

'''Corruption in Luxembourg''' is examined on this page.

== Extent ==
The level of corruption in [[Luxembourg]] is generally very low, and there is a strong legal framework for combating corruption. Anti-corruption laws are effectively implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation Report- Luxembourg 2013|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/evaluations/round4/GrecoEval4%282012%299_Luxembourg_EN.pdf|publisher=GRECO &amp; the European Commission|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, political corruption does surface. According to [[Transparency International]] [[Global Corruption Barometer]] 2013, 53% of the surveyed households consider political parties "corrupt" or "extremely corrupt", and 33% have the same opinion about Parliament. Moreover, a significant number of the surveyed households consider that the government's fight against corruption "ineffective" and corruption has increased over the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 8th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding business and corruption, companies do not consider corruption an obstacle for doing business in Luxembourg, according to World Economic Forum [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several other sources indicate that the overlap between business and politics in Luxembourg gives opportunities for corruption, and there is no code of conduct focusing on corruption, conflict of interest and favouritism for procurement officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Identifying and Reducing Corruption in Public Procurement in the EU|url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/documents/anti-fraud-policy/research-and-studies/identifying_reducing_corruption_in_public_procurement_en.pdf|publisher=PWC &amp; ECORYS|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Luxembourg Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/luxembourg/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6696">The '''Danta people''', historically and commonly known as '''Dubamo''' are an ethnic group in [[Ethiopia]]. The homeland of the Danta is in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region]] (SNNPR), specifically the [[Hadiya Zone]], and less so in the [[Kembata Tembaro Zone]] (KT).

== Origin, Language and Religion ==

The Danta, historically and commonly known as Dubamo are a small ethnic group in Ethiopia. Their symbolic center of settlement is the highland area of Danta, after which they are sometimes named. The Danta originally spoke the Kizinya dialect of [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]]. However, the Danta have made a significant linguistic transition since the [[Hadiya people|Hadiya]] migrated into their homeland at the beginning of the 19th century. A sizable number of Danta living in their original home have so far resisted assimilation by the Hadiya and still speak their original Kizinya dialect.&lt;ref name=B-1973&gt;Braukämper, U., "The correlation of oral traditions and historical records in Southern Ethiopia: a case study of the Hadiya-Sidamo past", ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'' 11 (1973), 29-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B-2005b&gt;Braukämper, U. "Dubamo", in Uhlig, S. (ed.). ''Encyclopedia Aethiopic''a, Volume 2, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Danta is thought to be a "state formed in Kambata about 1550-1570", and the "Dubamo people were known to have slave trade with [[Kingdom of Jimma|Jimma]] even after the anti-slavery proclamation of 1923".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nai.uu.se/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDU.pdf Local History of Ethiopia]&lt;/ref&gt; The Danta "were organized in a small kingship whose rulers claim descent from 'King Solomon' of [[Gondar]], i.e. from Amharic nobility".&lt;ref name=B-2005b/&gt; The Danta still maintain "a tradition that they came from Gondar about 15 generations ago" and "conserved an outstanding consciousness as an upper stratum tracing their origin to the North Ethiopian Christian area, a stratum which had at one time superimposed itself upon a Kushitic" substratum of the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=B-1973/&gt; 

To date, it is a common practice for an average Danta to name his or her paternal genealogy going back to more than 20 generations. Braukämper, in one of his other articles on the Danta, suggests that their allusion of their origin to King Solomon and the Amharic nobility may be an astute strategy to legitimization of status and power rather than evidence of an actual hereditary relationship with the north. However, a layman’s analysis of their genealogy (e.g. tribe names and distant ancestral names of individuals) occasionally yields, albeit weakly, names that connote northern connection.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Hawzula is a supra-natural deity worshiped by all Danta in the past and still by some to date. The Hawzula spirit 'speaks' and 'works' through the ''Hawzulmancho'', a hereditary Dubamo man on whom the Hawzula spirit descends and dwells on. Hawzula was the arbitrator, councilor and judge on all matters not only for Danta but also for the neighboring peoples such as the Hadiya, Donga, [[Kambaata people|Kambaata]] and [[Timbaro people|Timbaro]]. Many Danta confessed [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]] after [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II’s]] conquest in the 1880s but [[P'ent'ay|evangelical Christianity]] has become the dominant religion since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=B-2005b/&gt;

== The Danta-Dubamo land ==

The Danta nationality are mainly concentrated in the cool highlands of the [[Soro (woreda)|Soro]], [[Duna (woreda)|Duna]] and [[Misha (woreda)|Misha]] [[woreda]]s of the Hadiya Zone, although a large number of Danta also live in the adjoining [[Doyogena (woreda)|Doyo Gena]] woreda of the KT. Reportedly, relatively small clusters of people of some Danta tribes live in the [[Silt'e Zone|Silt'e]] and [[Wolaita Zone]]s. They are known for their intensive cultivation of [[ensete]] and barley and for breeding of horses.&lt;ref name=B-2005b/&gt; ''Dantich farasho'', literally meaning "the flying horse of Danta", is a phrase that is commonly used for eulogy.

== Current Political Organization and Representation ==

Since the federal rearrangement of the Ethiopian state in the 1990s, "the Dubamo increasingly became aware of their non-Hadiya origin and started demanding an administrative district of their own".&lt;ref name=B-2005a&gt;Braukämper, U. "Controversy over local tradition and national Ethiopian Context: Case study of the Hadiyya", in: ''Afrikas Horn: Akten der Ersten Internationalen Littmann-Konferenz, 2. bis 5. Mai 2002 in München'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), pp. 363-376.&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, the Danta have repeatedly petitioned the government for recognition and representation as an ethnic group. In the 1990s, the Dubamo refused to acknowledge the Hadiya-dominated local administrators as their legitimate rulers and stopped paying taxes as a token of resistance.&lt;ref name=B-2005a/&gt; Ever since the Danta have been making peaceful political struggle for representation at all administrative levels including the councils at the district, zonal and regional levels and the Houses of Peoples Representatives and Federation at the national level. No definitive answer has so far been given and the case is still active and pending. Local media have reported on the demands of the Dubamo at various times and the ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' radio Amharic service has made a lengthy report on the case on 12 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4246589,00.html Copy of ''Deutsche Welle'' Story] (in Amharic)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current political configuration, most Danta are either neutral or affiliated with the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]]. This aside, because of the increasing consciousness of their distinct historical and cultural identity, a few Danta elites living in the area had opted for establishing a legally registered ethnic based political party called the "Danta, Dubamo Kinchichila People Democratic Organization", and named two candidates for the [[Ethiopian general election, 2005|2005 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/nov/ed131199/html/newsitem_3.html "ONC to Participate in Upcoming National Elections"], [[Walta Information Center]], 13 November 1999 (last accessed 22 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.et/Press_Section/Newsletter3/Political%20Parties.pdf Political Parties/Independent Candidates Running for May Elections Parliament Election], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deadmalls.com''' is an independent not-for-profit website best known for featuring [[shopping malls]] in the [[United States]] that have failed or are in the process of failing. The site features nearly 450 listings of [[Dead mall|dead or dying shopping malls]], many with pictures and historical narratives. Created in 2000 by friends Peter Blackbird and Brian Florence as a hobby,&lt;ref name="Local man's Web site tracks fallen malls"&gt;{{cite news | last =Gereau | first =John | coauthors = | title =Local man's Web site tracks fallen malls | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =The Post-Star | date =2001-01-13 | url =http://www.deadmalls.com/news/20011226-post-star/ | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the website has grown, garnering interest from major media outlets due to its unusual content and its comprehensive (sometimes humorous, sometimes wistful) coverage. The creators describe the website as an attempt to retain pieces of history that might otherwise be lost with the destruction of these malls.&lt;ref name="Mauling of the malls brings tear"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hendricks | first =Mike  | coauthors = | title =Mauling of the malls brings tear | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =Kansas City Star | date =2006-11-22 | url =http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/16071019.htm | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site benefits from hundreds of online contributors who supply the website with accounts and photos that might be otherwise difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name="Pair visits dead, dying malls"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lindeman | first =Teresa | coauthors = | title =Pair visits dead, dying malls | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date =2002-05-10 | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20020510deadmalls0510p3.asp | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website has also become increasingly influential in the retail and real estate industries as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25009">[[Eritrea]] has an estimated population of {{UN_Population|Eritrea}}{{UN_Population|ref}} as of {{UN_Population|Year}}. No reliable census data is available, the best available estimates being published by the Population Division of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].
The population has doubled over the past 30 years, with an accelerating growth rate estimated at close to 3.2% p.a. during 2005&amp;ndash;2010. This rate of population growth is sustained despite a high [[emigration rate]]; the [[World Bank]] as of 2010 estimated that close to a million of Eritreans have emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/migrationandremittances Bilateral Estimates of Migrant Stocks in 2010] estimates 942,000 emigrants, of whom 450,000 migrated to [[Sudan]] and 290,000 to [[Ethiopia]]. C.f. the World' Bank's [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation has nine recognized ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html#er|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[SIL Ethnologue]], [[Tigrayans]] make up about 50% of the population; the [[Tigre people|Tigre]], who also speak a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language, constitute around 30% of residents. Most of the rest of the population belong to other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking communities of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch. Additionally, there are a number of [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking ethnic minorities and other smaller groups.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=Miniature empires: a historical dictionary of the newly independent states|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-30610-9|pages=76|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote="The majority of the Eritreans speak Semitic or Cushitic languages of the Afro-Asiatic language group.

A majority of Eritrea's population adheres to [[Abrahamic religions]]. The two most followed religions are [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], which have an almost equal number of followers.

==Ethno-linguistic groups==
{{further|Languages of Eritrea}}
[[File:Ethno-Demography of Eritrea.png|thumb|400px|Ethno-Demography of Eritrea]]
Eritrea's population comprises nine recognized [[ethnic group]]s, most of whom speak languages from the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; The Ethiopian Semitic languages spoken in Eritrea are [[Tigre language|Tigre]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrayan]], and the newly recognized [[Dahlik language|Dahlik]]. Other Afro-Asiatic languages belonging to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch are also widely spoken in the country.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; The latter include [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Beja language|Beja]], [[Blin language|Blin]], and [[Saho language|Saho]].

In addition, languages belonging to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language family ([[Kunama language|Kunama]] and [[Nara language|Nara]]) are spoken as a [[mother tongue]] by the Kunama and Nara Nilotic ethnic minorities that live in the north and northwestern part of the country.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; The [[Rashaida people|Rashaida]] speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]], while there are also a number of [[Italian people|Italians]] who speak their native [[Italian language]].

===Afro-Asiatic communities===

====Semitic speakers====

=====Tigrayans=====
{{main|Tigrayans}}
[[File:Traditional Eritrean dance.jpg|thumb|A [[Tigrayans|Tigrayan]] traditional dance.]]
The majority of the Tigrayans inhabit the highlands of Eritrea; however, migration to other parts of the country has occurred. Their language is called [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]. They are the largest ethnic group in the country, constituting about 55% of the population.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; The predominantly Tigrayan populated urban centers in Eritrea are the capital [[Asmara]], [[Mendefera]], [[Dekemhare]], [[Adi Keyh]], [[Adi Quala]] and [[Senafe]], while there is a significant population of Tigrayans in other cities including [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], and [[Massawa]].

The [[Jeberti people]] in Eritrea trace descent from early Muslim adherents. The term ''Jeberti'' is also locally sometimes used to generically refer to all Islamic inhabitants of the [[Ethiopian Highlands|highlands]].&lt;ref name="Lhrfda"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Abbebe|last=Kifleyesus|journal=L'Homme: revue française d'anthropologie|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-l-homme-2009-1-page-49.htm|title=Jeberti Women Traders' Innumeracy: Its Impact on Commercial Activity in Eritrea|date=January 2009|issue=189|page=59|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeberti in Eritrea speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]].&lt;ref name="Eotpoaatme"&gt;{{cite book|last=Facts On File, Incorporated|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=143812676X|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They account for about 10% of the Tigrinya speakers in the nation. The remaining 90% are Christians, so divided: 73% of the [[Eritrean Orthodox]] faith, 12% [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] (whose mass is held in [[Ge'ez]] as opposed to Latin), and 5% belonging to various [[Protestant]] and other Christian denominations, the majority of which belong to the (Lutheran) Evangelical Church of Eritrea.

=====Tigre=====
{{main|Tigre people}}

The Tigre reside in the western lowlands in Eritrea. Many also migrated to Sudan at the time of the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict and lived there since. They are a nomadic and pastoralist people, related to the [[Tigrayans]] and to the [[Beja people]]. They are a predominantly Muslim nomadic people who inhabit the northern, western, and coastal lowlands of Eritrea, where they constitute 30% of local residents.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; Some also inhabit areas in eastern Sudan. 95% of the Tigre people adhere to the Islamic religion [[Sunni Islam]], but there are a small number of Christians among them as well (often referred to as the Mensaï in Eritrea). Their language is called [[Tigre language|Tigre]].

=====Rashaida=====
{{main|Rashaida people}}
The Rashaida are one of Eritrea's nine recognized ethnic groups. They represent around 2% of the population of Eritrea.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; The Rashaida reside in the northern coastal lowlands of Eritrea and the northern eastern coasts of Sudan. They are predominantly Muslim and are the only ethnic group in Eritrea to have [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as their communal language, specifically the [[Hejazi Arabic|Hejazi dialect]]. The Rashaida first came to Eritrea in the 19th century from the Arabian Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alders|first=Anne|url=http://www.eritreanbeauty.com/r.html|title=the Rashaida|accessdate=2006-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cushitic speakers====

=====Afar=====
{{main|Afar people}}
According to the CIA, the Afar constitute under 5% of the nation's population.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; They live in the [[Debubawi Keyih Bahri Region]] of Eritrea, as well as the [[Afar Region]] in Ethiopia, and [[Djibouti]]. They speak the [[Afar language]] as a mother tongue, and are predominantly Muslim. Afars in Eritrea number about 397,000 individuals, the smallest population out of the countries they reside in. In Djibouti, there are about 780,000 group members, and in Ethiopia, they number approximately 1,300,000.

=====Saho=====
{{main|Saho people}}
[[File:Eritrean Women.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Saho people|Saho]] women in traditional attire.]]
The Saho represent 4% of Eritrea's population.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; They principally reside in the [[Debubawi Keyih Bahri Region]] and the [[Northern Red Sea Region]] of Eritrea. Some also live in adjacent parts of [[Ethiopia]]. Their language is called [[Saho language|Saho]]. They are predominantly Muslim, although a few Christians known as the [[Irob people|Irob]] live in the [[Debub Region]] of Eritrea and the [[Tigray region]] of Ethiopia.

=====Bilen=====
{{main|Bilen people}}
The Bilen in Eritrea represent around 2% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; They are primarily concentrated in the north-central areas, in and around the city of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], and south towards [[Asmara]], the nation's capital. Many of them entered Eritrea from Kush (central Sudan) in the 8th century and settled at Merara, after which they went to Lalibela and Lasta. The Bilen then returned to Axum in Ethiopia's [[Tigray Province]], and battled with the natives; in the resulting aftermath, the Bilen returned to their main base at Merara. The Bilen include adherents of both [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. They speak the [[Bilen language|Bilen]] as a mother tongue. Christian adherents are mainly urban and have intermingled with the Tigrinya who live in the area. Muslim adherents are mainly rural and have interbred with the adjacent Tigre.

=====Beja=====
{{main|Beja people}}
The Beja in Eritrea, or [[Hedareb]], constitute under 5% of local residents.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; They mainly live along the north-western border with Sudan. Group members are predominantly Muslim and communicate in [[Hedareb language|Hedareb]] as a first or second language. The Beja also include the [[Beni-Amer people]], who have retained their native [[Beja language]] alongside Hedareb.

===Nilo-Saharan communities===

====Kunama====

{{main|Kunama people}}
According to the CIA, the Kunama constitute around 2% of Eritrea's population.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; They mainly live in the country's [[Gash Barka Region]], as well as in adjacent parts of Ethiopia's [[Tigray Region]]. Many of them reside in the contested border village of [[Badme]]. Their language is called [[Kunama language|Kunama]]. Although some Kunama still practice traditional beliefs, most are converts to either Christianity (Roman Catholic and Protestant) or Islam.

====Nara====
{{main|Nara people}}
The Nara represent under 5% of the nation's population.&lt;ref name="Ciaethn"/&gt; They principally reside along the south-western border with Sudan and Ethiopia. They are generally Muslim, with a few Christians and some practising their indigenous beliefs. Their language is called [[Nara language|Nara]].

===Other communities===

====Italians====
{{main|Italian Eritreans}}
A few monolingual [[Italian Eritreans]] remain. As of 2008, they were estimated at 900 people, down from around 38,000 residents at the end of World War II.

People in Eritrea practice various religions. According to the [[Pew Research Center]] (2010), 62.9% of the population are [[Christianity|Christian]], mostly followers of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and to a lesser extent, [[Roman Catholicism]], with the second-largest denomination being [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/global-christianity/total-population-percentage.php|title=Table: Christian Population as Percentages of Total Population by Country|date=19 December 2011|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=31 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107191939/http://features.pewforum.org/global-christianity/total-population-percentage.php|archivedate=7 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most local residents who adhere to [[Christianity]] live in the [[Maekel Region|Maekel]] and [[Debub Region|Debub]] regions, whereas those who follow [[Islam]] predominantly inhabit the [[Anseba Region|Anseba]], [[Northern Red Sea Region|Northern Red Sea]], [[Southern Red Sea Region|Southern Red Sea]] and [[Gash-Barka Region|Gash-Barka]] regions. A few adherents of [[Traditional African religion|traditional faiths]] can also be found, particularly in the lowlands.

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}}, the total population of Eritrea was at {{UN_Population|Eritrea}} in {{UN_Population|Year}} (compared to 3.27 million in 1990).
Population growth rate during 2005&amp;ndash;2010 was estimated at 3.2% p.a.

In the 2010s, worsening conditions have fuelled migration pressure, with Eritreans trying to reach Europe illegally in boats reaching desperate proportions in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21587844-eritreans-are-taking-seas-because-worsening-conditions-home-why-they Why they leave --  Eritreans are taking to the seas because of worsening conditions at home] 12 October 2013. 
"Some 30,000 people reached Italy illegally in boats in the first nine months of 2013, three times as many as in the whole of 2012, according to [[Frontex]], [...] the largest batch came from Eritrea, a country that has supposedly been at peace for the past 13 years."

The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.6%, 55.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.5% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=World Population Prospects, the 2012 Revision|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN  medium variant population projections as of 2010 expected a radically reduced growth rate of 2.0% during the 2020s and of 1.8% during the 2030s.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"/&gt;
This was corrected as too optimistic an outlook in the 2012 edition, which now expected a more pessimistic, but still declining growth rate of 2.7% during the 2020s (10.3 million in 2030) and of 2.4% during the 2030s (13 million in 2040).&lt;ref&gt;Based on an a-priori assumption of worldwide "convergence towards low fertility". "World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision"[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm], "[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_Methodology.pdf Methodology]", p. 15: 
"The 2012 Revision drew on new empirical evidence on fertility levels and trends that became available since the publication of the 2010 Revision. The empirical evidence from available surveys and the 2010 round of censuses has provided the basis for a reassessment of fertility levels and trends experienced within the last decade. In a number of countries, particularly in Africa, slower than
expected fertility declines or even stalled fertility was observed. In some cases, increases in total fertility were also recorded. This led to the decision not to apply the additional adjustment that was used in the 2010 Revision for a small number of countries at the very early  stage of their fertility transition (for example, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia) or that had experienced recent fertility stalling (for example, Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). For these countries, the recent fertility decline has been much slower than typically experienced in the past decades by other countries at similar levels of fertility, and the additional adjustment would have delayed any potential future decline, implying even more population growth than already anticipated with the standard assumption."

'''Elur Chetty''' (also called '''Elur Chettu''' or '''Ezhur Chetty''' or '''Ezhoor Chetty''') is a [Tamil/ Malayalam] speaking [[Hindu]] [[community]] in [[South India]].  They are said to have migrated from [[Puhar|Kaveripoompattanam]] in [[Thanjavur]] District and settled in [[Kanyakumari District]].  They come under the common name of Chetty which includes other communities such as Kottar Chetty, Parakka Chetty, Vellalar Chetty, Pathira Chetty, Valayal Chetty, Pudukottai Chetty, Nattukkottai Chetty etc.  They were once a trading community and were distinct from the other Chetty communities.  The name is derived from "Ezhu ooru" meaning "seven towns".  The seven towns were in and around the [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] District in South [[Tamil Nadu]], India,  namely [[Eraniel]], [[Thiruvithancode]], [[Padmanabhapuram]], [[Colachel]], [[Ganapathipuram]], [[Midalam]],  and  [[Parakkai]].  They are called Keezhatheru Chetty.  Later [[Kottar]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Therusanamkoppu]], [[Nagercoil]],  [[Chennai]], Thalakkulam, Eraniel (Melatheru), [[Tiruchchirappalli]], [[Coimbatore]] and [[Madurai]].
 Bangalore were added.

Elur Chetty was classified as Backward Class (OBC) in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in 1993 as per [[Mandal Commission]] considering the social and financial backwardness of the community.

==History==
{{story|date=January 2018}}
Ezhur Chetty community were originally residents of [[Puhar|Kaveripoompattinam]], part of the [[Chola]] empire, and were an affluent community involved in sea trade.  This ancient town was destroyed by tsunami around AD 79 August 23/24 and the community members started migrating to other areas after this event.

The trading community left their properties and wealthy life, took their family deities' (Vinayaka &amp; Nagaramman) idols, left the Chola empire and migrated to the [[Pandiya]] and [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] Empires across the river [[Kaveri River|Cauveri]]. Some of the migrated people settled in around 93 places including Karaikudi, Devakkottai, Thiruppur, Kovilpatti, Thazhayoothu, Valliyur and Kottar. The people who reached [[Kottar]] did pooja for the [[Vinayaka]] idol.  After the pooja, when they tried to remove the idol, they were unsuccessful. People who stayed back in Kottar are called [[Kottar Chetty]]. Later the Kottar [[Pillayar]] Temple was built there.

The rest of them reached Eraniel (formerly Hiranyasimhanallur) near the shore of Valli river.  That day was the last Sunday of Chithirai month of [[Tamil Calendar]] during the day of [[aayilyam]] [[nakshatra]].  They placed the [[Nagaramman]] ([[the snake goddess]]) idol and also idols for '''Thangammai''' and '''Thayammai''' there.  On that night, They made nivedyam (a sweet offering for God) from a mixture of raw rice flour, banana (Matty) fruit, cardomam, dried ginger, coconut and jaggery.  This mixture was pressed to form a solid rectangular shape (like a brick), which was then covered using banana and coconut leaves and tied using Kaithai (a plant which produces a very fragrant flower) root.  This was baked using coconut husk and served to the god. This came to be known as the 'Odupparai Kolukkattai'.  Since then, the Odupparai Nagaramman Temple celebrations are being held to this day and the family and community meet together.
[[image:Thagammai-Thayammai.jpg|thumb|Arulmigu Thangammai-Thayammai]]
The community members then met the Chera King and sought permission to conduct trade.  Trading then commenced, with Eraniel as the base, covering Ganapathipuram (Pazhaya Kadai), Parakkai, Colachel, Midalam, Thiruvithancode and Padmanabhapuram.  Hence they were called Ezhur (meaning '7 towns') Chetty community.

The earliest known people from the community who settled in Eraniel were Umayammai and Pitcha Pillai (descendent of Unnaamalai).  Their offspring are Kolappa Pillai, Subramonia Pillai and Sivathanu Pillai.

==Temples==
Odupparai Nagaramman Temple is the community temple of Elur Chetty community.  The temple is situated nearby Eraniel (''Hiranyasimha nallur''). Monthly [[Puja (Hinduism)|poojas]] are carried out on the last Sunday of the [[Tamil calendar]].

[[Kattalai Temple|Kattalai Nagaramman Temple]] is another temple of the community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11214">'''Family policy in Hungary''' refers to government measures in order to increase the national birthrate and stop the decline of [[Hungary]]'s population. Hungary's family policy seeks to make childcare economically easier for new parents.

==History==
[[File:A_Szabó_család_fortepan_56323.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Szabó family'', the most famous soap opera in Hungary during the second half of the 20th century. It was a typical depiction of a Hungarian family of that time.]]
Hungary's population has been declining since 1980 - when the country’s population peaked at 10.7 million - and with that it is the country in Europe which has been shrinking for the longest time. The main cause of that is that women on average do not have 2.1 or more babies to keep the population stabile (see [[total fertility rate|TFR]]). There were no governments that could change this declining trend since 1980, however, there were several visible alterations during the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hungarianfreepress.com/2017/05/25/hungarian-action-plan-seeks-to-dramatically-increase-birth-rate-by-2030/ Hungarian Free Press - Hungarian action plan seeks to dramatically increase birth rate by 2030 - May 25, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; It fell from 2.17 in 1977 to 1.23 in 2011.&lt;ref name="ksh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xstadat/xstadat_hosszu/h_wdsd001a.html?579 |title=Vital statistics, Hungarian Central Statistical Office|publisher=ksh.hu|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bokros package]], the [[2008 economic crisis]] and the [[European debt crisis]] all accelerated that downward trend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.penzugyiszemle.hu/vitaforum/sikeres-e-a-magyar-csaladpolitika-3 penzugyiszemle.hu - Sikeres e a magyar családpolitika? - István Szilas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
The [[Second Orbán Government]] made saving the nation from the demographic abyss a key aspect and therefore has introduced generous breaks for large families and greatly increased social benefits for all families. Those with three or more children pay virtually no taxes. In just a couple years, Hungary went from being one of the countries that spend the least on families in the [[OECD]] to being one of those that do so the most.&lt;ref&gt;[https://visegradinsight.eu/the-v4s-greatest-existential-threat05082014/ Visegrad Insight - The V4’s greatest existential threat - Demographic decline and an ageing population - Filip Mazurczak - August 5, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is almost 4% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF1_1_Public_spending_on_family_benefits.pdf OECD - Public spending on family benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support in salaries===
{{see also|Child benefit#Hungary}}
The Orbán Government kept the earlier existed ''family allowance'' ({{lang-hu|családi pótlék}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/csaladi-potlek-2 csalad.hu - Családi pótlék]&lt;/ref&gt; and beside that introduced the ''family tax benefit'' ({{lang-hu|családi adókedvezmény}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/csaladi-adokedvezmeny-2 csalad.hu - Családi adókedvezmény]&lt;/ref&gt;. The two could be counted together as a ''child benefit''.

===Marriage support===
The government introduced the ''discount for first married couples'' ({{lang-hu|első házasok kedvezménye}}) which means that newly married couples receive together 5,000 HUF per month during the next 24 months after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/elso-hazasok-kedvezmenye-2 csalad.hu - Első házasok kedvezménye]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing support===
Since 2015 CSOK (''családi otthonteremtési kedvezmény'', {{lang-en|family housing benefit}}) can be required by married couples for used or newly built houses and apartments if they promise that they will have one, two, three or four children. The size of support depends on the number of children the couple plans to have. At least one of the parents has to be under 40 years old. They also have to meet the following requirements: unpunished life, 180 days social security payment before the request (in case of one or two children) or 2 years social security payment (in case of 3 or more children). The children - who could be of blood or adoptee - have to live with the parents to fulfill the criteria. They can get CSOK as fix sum of money or as preferential mortgage rates on housing. It can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/09/24/csaladok-otthonteremtesi-kedvezmenye csalad.hu - Családi Otthonteremtési Kedvezmény]&lt;/ref&gt;

| 2,750,000 HUF
|}

===Maternity benefit===
The amount of the maternity benefit is equal to the 225% of the minimal pension at the time of birth of the child (64,125 HUF in 2017), in case of twin it is 300% (85,500 HUF in 2017). It is a one-off support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/anyasagi-tamogatas-2 csalad.hu - Anyasági támogatás]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child care allowance===
The child care allowance is paid monthly from the birth until the child's age of 2. Its size is equal to 70% of the mother's or father's - since one of them can apply for that - salary, but it cannot be higher than 140% of the current minimal wage. (Minimal wage was 138,000 HUF in 2018.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/gyermekgondozasi-dij-gyed csalad.hu - Gyermekgondozási díj - GYED]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free or reduced cost services for children===
Several measures were introduced since 2010 that made services free or cheaper for families with children. 

The vaccinations against the following diseases were free and obligatory in Hungary: [[tuberculosis]], [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[haemophilus influenzae]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[hepatitis]], [[streptococcus pneumoniae]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.babaszoba.hu/articles/baba/Kotelezo_es_valaszthato_oltasok_gyerekeknek_Oltasi_rend?aid=20170123132507 babaszoba.com - Kötelező és választható oltások gyerekeknek- Oltási rend - January 23, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The government made vaccinations for other diseases free - [[chicken pox]], the two types of [[meningitis]] and [[rotavirus]] - in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.napi.hu/magyar_gazdasag/ot_uj_vedooltas_lehet_ingyenes.648223.html napi.hu - Öt új védőoltás lehet ingyenes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the first nine classes get free textbooks in school since 2017. Those children who are in higher classes but live in disadvantaged conditions, suffer from long-term illness, get child protection benefit, or live in a large family with three or more children are also entitled to free textbooks. However, the government plans to provide free textbooks for every pupils and students until the final exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eduline.hu/kozoktatas/2017/6/29/Kinek_jar_ingyen_a_tankonyv_Itt_a_valasz_3MT2EQ Kinek jár ingyen a tankönyv szeptembertől? - Eduline - June 29, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/tankonyv-tamogatas-2 csalad.hu - Tankönyvtámogatás]&lt;/ref&gt;

Those children who live in disadvantaged conditions, suffer from long-term illness, get child protection benefit, or live in a large family with three or more children get also free or half price meals in nurseries, kindergartens and schools. Meanwhile others get them on reduced prices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://magyaridok.hu/belfold/tovabb-bovulo-csaladtamogatasok-1897276/ Magyar Idők - Tovább bővülő családtámogatások - July 3, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/05/11/etkezesi-teritesi-dijkedvezmeny csalad.hu - Étkezési térítési díjkedvezmény]&lt;/ref&gt;

Those youngsters younger than 20 who are going to achieve to get a [[European driving licence]] in Category B ([[motor vehicles]]) could take a course on ''KRESZ'' (similar to British [[Highway Code]]) for free and try the test for the first time at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2018/06/29/par-nap-es-ingyenes-lesz-a-kresz-vizsga csalad.hu - Pár nap, és ingyenes lesz a KRESZ-vizsga - June 29, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of taking a successful language exam on B2 or C1 level the price of the exam is refunded by the state if the examinee is under 35 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eduline.hu/nyelvtanulas/2018/1/5/igy_kaphatod_vissza_a_nyelvvizsga_dijat_577IYE Megvannak a részletek: így kaphatjátok vissza a sikeres nyelvvizsga díját January 5, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

Children could use public transport free if they are accompanied by an adult and do not attend school yet. Pupils, students and undergraduates can use public transport at half price by showing their student card.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bkk.hu/apps/docs/ertekesites/helyi_kedvezmenyek.pdf BKK - Helyi közlekedés kedvezményei]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for parents===
Parents of one have 2 days extra paid vacation. Parents of two get 4 days and parents of three or more children receive seven days more of paid vacation than the average Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/09/01/gyermekek-utan-jaro-szabadsag-2 csalad.hu - Gyermekek után járó szabadság]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for grandmothers===
The ''Women 40'' ({{lang-hu|Nők 40}}) program makes it possible for women who have worked 40 years to retire in order to get more time to spend with grandchildren or with their own old parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csalad.hu/2018/05/16/nok-40-nagymama-nyugdij csalad.hu - Nők 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support of Hungarians outside of Hungary===
====Maternity benefit (outside of Hungary)====
Maternity benefit is a one-off support to Hungarian mothers living abroad and amounts to 64,125 HUF per child. In case of twins it is 85,500 HUF together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csalad.hu/2017/12/14/a-hataron-tul-elo-magyar-gyermekek-utan-is-jar-csaladtamogatas-januartol csalad.hu - Köldökzsinór Program – a külhoni magyar családok támogatása]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Ireland}}
'''Gaelic Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Éire Ghaelach}}) was the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in [[Ireland]] from the [[Prehistory of Ireland|prehistoric era]] until the early 17th century. Before the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a "patchwork"&lt;ref name="patchwork"/&gt; hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through [[tanistry]]. [[Gaelic warfare|Warfare]] between these territories was common. Occasionally, a powerful ruler was acknowledged as [[High King of Ireland]]. Society was made up of [[Irish clans|clans]] and, like the rest of Europe, was structured hierarchically according to class. Throughout this period, the economy was mainly [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] and [[Barter system|money generally not used]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guesting and Feasting in Gaelic Ireland |first=Katharine |last=Simms |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] |volume=108 |year=1978 |pages=67–100 |jstor=25508737}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Gaelic Irish style of dress, music, dance, sport, architecture, and art can be identified, with Irish art later merging with Anglo-Saxon styles to create [[Insular art]].

Gaelic Ireland was initially [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] and had an [[oral tradition|oral culture]]. [[Ogham inscription|Inscription]] in the [[ogham]] alphabet began in the [[Protohistory of Ireland|protohistoric period]], perhaps as early as the 1st century. The conversion to Christianity accompanied the introduction of [[Early Irish literature|literature]], and much of Ireland's rich pre-Christian [[Irish mythology|mythology]] and sophisticated [[Early Irish law|law code]] were preserved, albeit Christianized. In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Ireland was an important centre of learning. Irish missionaries and scholars were [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|influential in western Europe]], and helped to spread Christianity to much of Britain and parts of mainland Europe.

In the 9th century, [[Vikings]] began raiding and founding settlements along Ireland's coasts and waterways, which became its first large towns. Over time, these settlers were assimilated and became the [[Norse-Gaels]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] of 1169–71, large swathes of Ireland came under the control of [[Normans|Norman]] lords, leading to centuries of conflict with the native Irish. The King of England claimed sovereignty over this territory – the [[Lordship of Ireland]] – and the island as a whole. However, the Gaelic system continued in areas outside [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] control. The territory under English control gradually shrank to an area known as [[the Pale]] and, outside this, many [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords adopted Gaelic culture.

In 1542, [[Henry VIII of England]] declared the Lordship a [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]] and himself King of Ireland. The English then began to [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|conquer (or re-conquer) the island]]. By 1607, Ireland was fully under English control, bringing the old Gaelic political and social order to an end.

== Culture and society ==
Gaelic culture and society was centred around the [[clan]]n or ''fine'', and the landscape and history of Ireland was wrought with inter-clan relationships, marriages, friendships, wars, vendettas, trading, and so on. Gaelic Ireland had a rich oral culture and appreciation of deeper and intellectual pursuits. ''[[Fili|Filí]]'' and ''[[druids|draoithe]]'' (druids) were held in high regard during Pagan times and orally passed down the history and traditions of their people. Later, many of their spiritual and intellectual tasks were passed on to Christian monks, after said religion prevailed from the 5th century onwards. However, the ''filí'' continued to hold a high position. Poetry, music, storytelling, literature and other art forms were highly prized and cultivated in both pagan and Christian Gaelic Ireland. Hospitality, bonds of kinship and the fulfilment of social and ritual responsibilities were highly important.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Like Britain, Gaelic Ireland consisted not of one single unified kingdom, but several. The main kingdoms were [[Ulaid]] (Ulster), [[Kingdom of Meath|Mide]] (Meath), [[Laigin]] (Leinster), [[List of kings of Munster|Muma]] (Munster, consisting of [[Iarmuman]], [[Thomond|Tuadmumain]] and [[Kingdom of Desmond|Desmumain]]), [[Connacht]], [[Kingdom of Breifne|Bréifne]] (Breffny), [[Northern Uí Néill|In Tuaiscert]] (The North), and [[Airgíalla]] (Oriel). Each of these overkingdoms were built upon lordships known as ''[[túath]]a'' (singular: ''túath''). Law tracts from the early 700s describe a hierarchy of kings: kings of ''túath'' subject to kings of several ''túatha'' who again were subject to the regional overkings.&lt;ref name="Jaski"/&gt; Already before the 8th century these overkingdoms had begun to replace the túatha as the basic sociopolitical unit.&lt;ref name="Jaski" /&gt;

===Religion and mythology===

====Paganism====
{{Main article|Irish mythology}}
Before [[Christianization]], the Gaelic Irish were [[polytheistic]] or [[paganism|pagan]]. They had many gods and goddesses, which generally have parallels in the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheons]] of other European nations. Two groups of supernatural beings who appear throughout Irish mythology—the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and [[Fomorians]]—are believed to represent the Gaelic pantheon. They were also [[animism|animists]], believing that all aspects of the natural world contained spirits, and that these spirits could be communicated with.&lt;ref name="GreenAnimals"/&gt; Burial practices—which included burying food, weapons, and ornaments with the dead—suggest a belief in [[Afterlife|life after death]].&lt;ref name="Cunliffe"/&gt; Some have equated this afterlife with the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] realms known as [[Mag Mell|Magh Meall]] and [[Tír na nÓg]] in Irish mythology.&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt; There were four main religious festivals each year, marking the traditional four divisions of the year – [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane|Bealtaine]] and [[Lughnasadh]].&lt;ref name=koch/&gt;

The mythology of Ireland was originally passed down orally, but much of it was eventually written down by Irish monks, who Christianized and modified it to an extent. This large body of work is often split into three overlapping cycles: the [[Mythological Cycle]], the [[Ulster Cycle]], and the [[Fenian Cycle]]. The first cycle is a pseudo-history that describes how Ireland, its people and its society came to be. The second cycle tells of the lives and deaths of [[Ulaid]]h heroes such as [[Cúchulainn]]. The third cycle tells of the exploits of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] and the [[Fianna]]. There are also a number of tales that do not fit into these cycles – this includes the ''[[immrama]]'' and ''[[echtrai]]'', which are tales of voyages to the 'Otherworld'.

====Christianity====
{{see|History of Christianity in Ireland|Celtic Christianity}}
The introduction of Christianity to Ireland dates to sometime before the 5th century, with [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius (later bishop of Ireland)]] sent by [[Pope Celestine I]] in the mid-5th century to minister to Irish "believing in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = An Illustrated History of Ireland | publisher = Irish National Publications |author = Mary Cusack |chapter = Mission of St Palladius | date = 1868 | url = http://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Mission-St-Palladius.php | via = LibraryIreland.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early medieval traditions credit [[Saint Patrick]] as being the first [[Primacy of Ireland|Primate of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Life and Acts of Saint Patrick: The Archbishop, Primate and Apostle of Ireland | publisher = Hibernia Press Company | author = Edmund Lenthal Swifte | date = 1809 | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeandactssain00jocegoog | via = Archive.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity would eventually supplant the existing pagan traditions, with the prologue of the 9th century ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]'' (attributed to author [[Óengus of Tallaght]]) speaking of the last vestiges of paganism in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Calendar of Irish saints, the martyrology of Tallagh, with notices of the patron saints of Ireland, and select poems and hymns | author = Matthew Kelly | publisher = J. Mullany | date = 1857 | url = https://books.google.ie/books?id=wbUCAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=pagan#v=snippet&amp;q=pagan&amp;f=false | via = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and political structure===
[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate03.jpg|thumb|250px|A scene from ''[[The Image of Irelande, with a Discoverie of Woodkarne|The Image of Irelande]]'' (1581) showing a chieftain at a feast being entertained by a fili and a harper]]
In Gaelic Ireland each person belonged to an [[Patrilineality|agnatic]] kin-group known as a ''fine'' (plural: ''finte''). This was a large group of related people supposedly descended from one progenitor through male forebears. It was headed by a male chieftain, known in Old Irish as a ''cennfine'' or ''toísech'' (plural: ''toísig''). Although these groups were primarily based on blood kinship, they also included those who were fostered into the group and those who were accepted into it for other reasons.

Nicholls suggests that they would be better thought of as akin to the modern-day corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Kenneth W. (2003) [1972]. Gaelic and Gaelicised Ireland in the Middle Ages (2nd ed.). Dublin: Lilliput Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Within each ''fine'', the family descended from a common great grandparent was called a ''[[derbfine]]'' (modern form ''dearbhfhine''), lit. "close clan". The ''cland'' (modern form ''clann'') referred to the children of the nuclear family.

[[Order of succession|Succession]] to the chieftainship or kingship was through [[tanistry]]. When a man became chieftain or king, a relative was elected to be his deputy or 'tanist' (Irish: ''tánaiste'', plural ''tanaistí'').&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; When the chieftain or king died, his tanist would automatically succeed him.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; The tanist had to share the same great-grandfather as his predecessor (i.e. was of the same ''derbfine'') and he was elected by freemen who also shared the same great-grandfather. Tanistry meant that the kingship usually went to whichever relative was deemed to be the most fitting.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; Sometimes there would be more than one tanist at a time and they would succeed each other in order of seniority.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; Some Anglo-Norman lordships later adopted tanistry from the Irish.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt;

Gaelic Ireland was divided into a hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs. The smallest territory was the ''[[túath]]'' (plural: ''túatha''), which was typically the territory of a single kin-group. It was ruled by a ''rí túaithe'' (king of a ''túath'') or ''toísech túaithe'' (leader of a ''túath''). Several ''túatha'' formed a ''mór túath'' (overkingdom), which was ruled by a ''rí mór túath'' or ''ruirí'' (overking). Several ''mór túatha'' formed a ''cóiced'' (province), which was ruled by a ''rí cóicid'' or ''rí ruirech'' (provincial king). In the early Middle Ages the ''túatha'' was the main political unit, but over time they were subsumed into bigger conglomerate territories and became much less important politically.&lt;ref name="Jaski"/&gt;&lt;ref name=simms79/&gt;

Gaelic society was structured hierarchically, with those further up the hierarchy generally having more privileges, wealth and power than those further down.

*The top social layer was the ''sóernemed'', which included kings, tanists, chieftains, highly skilled poets (''[[fili]]''), clerics, and their immediate families. The roles of a ''fili'' included reciting traditional lore, eulogizing the king and satirizing injustices within the kingdom.&lt;ref name=duffy11/&gt; Before the Christianization of Ireland, this group also included the [[druid]]s (''druí'') and [[vates]] (''fáith''). The druids combined the roles of priest, judge, scholar, poet, physician, and religious teacher,&lt;ref name="Ginnell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt; while the vates were [[oracle]]s.
*Below that were the ''dóernemed'', which included professionals such as jurists (''brithem''), physicians, skilled craftsmen, skilled musicians, scholars, and so on. A master in a particular profession was known as an ''[[ollam]]'' (modern spelling: ''ollamh''). The various professions—including law, poetry, medicine, history and genealogy—were associated with particular families&lt;ref name="Jefferies"/&gt; and the positions became hereditary. Since the poets, jurists and doctors depended on the [[patronage]] of the ruling families, the end of the Gaelic order brought their demise.&lt;ref name=duffy11/&gt;
*Below that were freemen who owned land and cattle (for example the ''[[bóaire]]'').
*Below that were freemen who did not own land or cattle, or who owned very little.
*Below that were the unfree, which included [[serf]]s and [[slave]]s. Slaves were typically criminals ([[debt bondage|debt slaves]]) or prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=duffy713/&gt; Slavery and serfdom was inherited, though [[slavery in Ireland]] had died out by 1200. 
*The warrior bands known as ''[[fianna]]'' generally lived apart from society. A ''fian'' was typically composed of young men who had not yet come into their [[inheritance]] of land.&lt;ref name=cronin/&gt; A member of a ''fian'' was called a ''fénnid'' and the leader of a ''fian'' was a ''rígfénnid''.&lt;ref name=ria/&gt; [[Geoffrey Keating]], in his 17th-century ''History of Ireland'', says that during the winter the ''fianna'' were quartered and fed by the nobility, during which time they would keep order on their behalf. But during the summer, from [[Beltane|Bealtaine]] to [[Samhain]], they were beholden to live by hunting for food and for hides to sell.&lt;ref name=keating/&gt;

Although distinct, these ranks were not utterly exclusive [[caste]]s like those of India.&lt;ref name="Ginnell5"/&gt; It was possible to rise or sink from one rank to another. Rising upward could be achieved a number of ways, such as by gaining wealth, by gaining skill in some department, by qualifying for a learned profession, by showing conspicuous valour, or by performing some service to the community.&lt;ref name="Ginnell5"/&gt; An example of the latter is a person choosing to become a ''briugu'' (hospitaller). A ''briugu'' had to have his house open to any guests, which included feeding no matter how big the group. For the ''briugu'' to fulfill these duties, he was allowed more land and privileges,&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; but this could be lost if he ever refused guests.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;

A freeman could further himself by becoming the client of one or more lords. The lord made his client a grant of property (i.e. livestock or land) and, in return, the client owed his lord yearly payments of food and fixed amounts of work. The clientship agreement could last until the lord's death. If the client died, his heirs would carry on the agreement. This system of clientship enabled social mobility as a client could increase his wealth until he could afford clients of his own, thus becoming a lord. Clientship was also practised between nobles, which established hierarchies of homage and political support.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt;

===Law===
{{Main article|Early Irish law}}
[[File:Cahermacnaghten O Davoren Law School Burren County Clare 1997 09 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of the [[O'Davoren]] law school at Cahermacnaghten, County Clare]]
Gaelic law was originally passed down orally, but was written down in [[Old Irish]] during the period 600–900 AD. This collection of oral and written laws is known as the ''Fénechas''&lt;ref name="Ginnell1"/&gt; or, in English, as the Brehon Law(s). The [[brehon]]s (Old Irish: ''brithem'', plural ''brithemain'') were the [[jurist]]s in Gaelic Ireland. Becoming a brehon took many years of training and the office was, or became, largely hereditary. Most [[legal cases]] were contested privately between opposing parties, with the brehons acting as arbitrators.&lt;ref name=simms79/&gt;

Offences against people and property were primarily settled by the offender paying compensation to the victims. Although any such offence required compensation, the law made a distinction between intentional and unintentional harm, and between murder and [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="Ginnell7"/&gt; If an offender did not pay outright, his [[Distraint|property was seized]] until he did so. Should the offender be unable to pay, his family would be responsible for doing so. Should the family be unable or unwilling to pay, responsibility would broaden to the wider kin-group. Hence, it has been argued that "the people were their own police".&lt;ref name="Ginnell7"/&gt; Acts of violence were generally settled by payment of compensation known as an ''[[éraic]]'' fine;&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt; the Gaelic equivalent of the Welsh ''[[galanas]]'' and the Germanic ''[[weregild]]''. If a free person was murdered, the ''éraic'' was equal to 21 cows, regardless of the victim's rank in society.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt; Each member of the murder victim's agnatic kin-group received a payment based on their closeness to the victim, their status, and so forth. There were separate payments for the kin-group of the victim's mother, and for the victim's foster-kin.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt;

Execution seems to have been rare and carried out only as a last resort. If a murderer was unable/unwilling to pay ''éraic'' and was handed to his victim's family, they might kill him if they wished should nobody intervene by paying the ''éraic''. Habitual or particularly serious offenders might be expelled from the kin-group and its territory. Such people became outlaws (with no protection from the law) and anyone who sheltered him became liable for his crimes. If he still haunted the territory and continued his crimes there, he was proclaimed in a public assembly and after this anyone might lawfully kill him.&lt;ref name="Ginnell7"/&gt;

Each person had an honour-price, which varied depending on their rank in society. This honour-price was to be paid to them if their honour was violated by certain offences.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt; Those of higher rank had a higher honour-price. However, an offence against the property of a poor man (who could ill afford it), was punished more harshly than a similar offence upon a wealthy man. The clergy were more harshly punished than the [[laity]]. When a layman had paid his fine he would go through a probationary period and then regain his standing, but a clergyman could never regain his standing.&lt;ref name="Ginnell7"/&gt;

Most of the laws are pre-Christian in origin. These secular laws existed in parallel, and sometimes in conflict, with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Church law]]. Although brehons usually dealt with legal cases, kings would have been able to deliver judgments also, but it is unclear how much they would have had to rely on brehons.&lt;ref name=kelly2/&gt; Kings had their own brehons to deal with cases involving the king's own rights and to give him legal advice.&lt;ref name=simms79/&gt; Unlike other kingdoms in Europe, Gaelic kings—by their own authority—could not enact new laws as they wished and could not be "above the law".&lt;ref name=kelly3/&gt; They could, however, enact temporary emergency laws. It was mainly through these emergency powers that the Church attempted to change Gaelic law.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt;

The law texts take great care to define social status, the rights and duties that went with that status, and the relationships between people. For example, chieftains had to take responsibility for members of their ''fine'', acting as a [[surety]] for some of their deeds and making sure debts were paid. He would also be responsible for unmarried women after the death of their fathers.&lt;ref name=kelly4/&gt;

====Marriage, women and children====
[[File:Gaelic clothing Ireland.jpg|thumb|Irish Gaels, c. 1575]]
Ancient Irish culture was [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]]. The [[Brehon]] law excepted women from the ordinary course of the law so that, in general, every woman had to have a male guardian.&lt;ref name="EB_1903"/&gt; However, women had some legal capacity. By the 8th century, the preferred form of marriage was one between social equals, under which a woman was technically legally dependent on her husband and had half his honor price, but could exercise considerable authority in regard to the transfer of property. Such women were called "women of joint dominion".&lt;ref name="EB_1823"/&gt; Thus historian [[Patrick Weston Joyce]] could write that, relative to other European countries of the time, free women in Gaelic Ireland "held a good position" and their social and property rights were "in most respects, quite on a level with men".&lt;ref name=joyce/&gt;

Gaelic Irish society was also [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], with land being primarily owned by men and inherited by the sons. Only when a man had no sons would his land pass to his daughters, and then only for their lifetimes.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt; Upon their deaths, the land was redistributed among their father's male relations.&lt;ref name=duffy72/&gt; Under Brehon law, rather than inheriting land, daughters had assigned to them a certain number of their father's cattle as their marriage-portion.&lt;ref name="EB_1903"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB_1823"/&gt; It seems that, throughout the Middle Ages, the Gaelic Irish kept many of their marriage laws and traditions separate from those of the Church.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; Under Gaelic law, married women could hold property independent of their husbands,&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; a link was maintained between married women and their own families,&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt; couples could easily divorce or separate,&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; and men could have [[concubinage|concubines]] (which could be lawfully bought).&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt; These laws differed from most of contemporary Europe and from Church law.

The lawful [[age of marriage]] was fifteen for girls and eighteen for boys, the respective ages at which [[fosterage]] ended.&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt; Upon marriage, the families of the bride and bridegroom were expected to contribute to the match. It was custom for the bridegroom and his family to pay a ''coibche'' (modern spelling: ''coibhche'') and the bride was allowed a share of it. If the marriage ended owing to a fault of the husband then the ''coibche'' was kept by the wife and her family, but if the fault lay with the wife then the ''coibche'' was to be returned.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; It was custom for the bride to receive a ''spréid'' (modern spelling: ''spréidh'') from her family (or foster family) upon marriage. This was to be returned if the marriage ended through divorce or the death of the husband. Later, the ''spréid'' seems to have been converted into a [[dowry]].&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; Women could seek divorce/separation as easily as men could and, when obtained on her behalf, she kept all the property she had brought her husband during their marriage.&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt; Trial marriages seem to have been popular among the rich and powerful, and thus it has been argued that [[cohabitation]] before marriage must have been acceptable.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; It also seems that the wife of a chieftain was entitled to some share of the chief's authority over his territory. This led to some Gaelic Irish wives wielding a great deal of political power.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;

Before the Norman invasion, it was common for priests and monks to have wives. This remained mostly unchanged after the Norman invasion, despite protests from bishops and archbishops. The authorities classed such women as priests' concubines and there is evidence that a formal contract of concubinage existed between priests and their women. However, unlike other concubines, they seem to have been treated just as wives were.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;

In Gaelic Ireland a kind of [[fosterage]] was common, whereby (for a certain length of time) children would be left in the care of other ''fine'' members, namely their mother's family, preferably her brother.&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt; This may have been used to strengthen family ties or political bonds.&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; Foster parents were beholden to teach their foster children or to have them taught. Foster parents who had properly done their duties were entitled to be supported by their foster children in old age (if they were in need and had no children of their own).&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt; As with divorce, Gaelic law again differed from most of Europe and from Church law in giving legal standing to both [[Legitimacy (family law)|"legitimate" and "illegitimate"]] children.&lt;ref name="Ginnell8"/&gt;

===Settlements and architecture===
[[File:Craggaunowen Project, The Crannog - geograph.org.uk - 793400.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed roundhouse and ráth at Craggaunowen, [[County Clare]]]]
For most of the Gaelic period, dwellings and farm buildings were circular with conical thatched roofs (see [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]). Square and rectangle-shaped buildings gradually became more common, and by the 14th or 15th century they had replaced round buildings completely.&lt;ref name=joyce2/&gt; In some areas, buildings were made mostly of stone. In others, they were built of timber, [[wattle and daub]], or a mix of materials. Most ancient and early medieval stone buildings were of [[dry stone]] construction. Some buildings would have had glass windows.&lt;ref name=joyce16.2/&gt; Among the wealthy, it was common for women to have their own 'apartment' called a ''grianan'' (anglicized "greenan") in the sunniest part of the homestead.&lt;ref name=joyce16.2/&gt;

The dwellings of freemen and their families were often surrounded by a [[circular rampart]] called a "[[ringfort]]".&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; There are two main kinds of ringfort. The ''ráth'' is an earthen ringfort, averaging 30m diameter, with a dry outside ditch.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; The ''cathair'' or ''caiseal'' is a stone ringfort. The ringfort would typically have enclosed the family home, small farm buildings or workshops, and animal pens.&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; Most date to the period 500–1000 CE&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; and there is evidence of large-scale ringfort desertion at the end of the first millennium.&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; The remains of between 30,000 and 40,000 lasted into the 19th century to be mapped by [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; Another kind of native dwelling was the ''[[crannóg]]'', which were roundhouses built on artificial islands in lakes.

There were very few nucleated settlements in Gaelic areas. However, after the 5th century some monasteries became the heart of small "monastic towns".&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; By the 10th century the [[Norse-Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] ports of Dublin, Wexford, Cork and Limerick had grown into substantial settlements.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; It was at this time, perhaps as a response to Viking raids, that many of the [[Irish round tower]]s were built.

In the fifty years before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], the term "castle" ({{lang-sga|caistél/caislén}}) appears in Gaelic writings, although there are no surviving examples of pre-Norman castles.&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; After the invasion, the Normans built [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s in the areas they occupied,&lt;ref name=glasscock/&gt; some of which were converted from ringforts.&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; By 1300 "some mottes, especially in frontier areas, had almost certainly been built by the Gaelic Irish in imitation".&lt;ref name=glasscock/&gt; The Normans gradually replaced wooden motte-and-baileys with stone castles and [[tower house]]s.&lt;ref name=glasscock/&gt; Tower houses are free-standing multi-storey stone towers usually surrounded by a wall (see [[bawn]]) and ancillary buildings.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; Gaelic families had begun to build their own tower houses by the 15th century.&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; As many as 7000 may have been built, but they were rare in areas with little Norman settlement or contact.&lt;ref name="O'Keeffe"/&gt; They are concentrated in counties Limerick and Clare but are lacking in Ulster, except the area around [[Strangford Lough]].&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt;

In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' called a ''maighin digona'' surrounded each person's dwelling. The ''maighin digona's'' size varied according to the owner's rank. In the case of a ''[[bóaire]]'' it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his house, could cast a ''cnairsech'' (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a ''maighin digona'' could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring that person to justice by lawful means.&lt;ref name="Ginnell7"/&gt;

===Economy===
Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. [[Tacitus]], for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] through commerce.&lt;ref name=tacitus/&gt; There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders.&lt;ref name=joyce3/&gt; In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items.&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;

Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a [[pastoralism|pastoral]] one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and [[animal product|their products]].&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; Cattle was "the main element in the Irish pastoral economy" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; They were a "highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble".&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt; Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism.&lt;ref name=nicholls/&gt;

Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen.

[[Transhumance]] was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher [[pasture]]s in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months.&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The summer pasture was called the ''buaile'' (anglicized as ''booley'') and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for ''boy'' (''buachaill'') originally meant a herdsman.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Many [[moorland]] areas were "shared as a [[common land|common summer pasturage]] by the people of a whole parish or barony".&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

[[File:Book Of Kells Horseman.png|thumb|A horse rider from the Book of Kells]]

===Transport===
Gaelic Ireland was well furnished with roads and bridges. Bridges were typically wooden and in some places the roads were laid with wood and stone. There were five main roads leading from [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]: Slíghe Asail, [[Slíghe Chualann]], Slíghe Dála, [[Esker Riada|Slíghe Mór]] and [[Slige Midluachra|Slíghe Midluachra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Weston Joyce|Joyce, Patrick Weston]]. [http://www.libraryireland.com/SocialHistoryAncientIreland/III-XXIV-1.php ''A Smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland'' (1906). Chapter 24 part 1]. Library Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses were one of the main means of long-distance transport. Although [[horseshoe]]s and [[rein]]s were used, the Gaelic Irish did not use [[saddle]]s, [[stirrup]]s or [[spur]]s. Every man was trained to spring from the ground on to the back of his horse (an ''ech-léim'' or "steed-leap") and they urged-on and guided their horses with a rod having a hooked goad at the end.&lt;ref name=joyce4/&gt;

Two-wheeled and four-wheeled [[chariot]]s (singular ''carbad'') were used in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war. They were big enough for two people, made of wickerwork and wood, and often had decorated hoods. The wheels were spoked, shod all round with iron, and were from three to four and a half feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature.&lt;ref name=joyce5/&gt;

Boats used in Gaelic Ireland include [[canoe]]s, [[currach]]s, [[sailboat]]s and [[Irish galley]]s. Ferryboats were used to cross wide rivers and are often mentioned in the Brehon Laws as subject to strict regulations. Sometimes they were owned by individuals and sometimes they were the common property of those living round the ferry. Large boats were used for trade with mainland Europe.&lt;ref name=joyce6/&gt;

===Dress===
[[File:16th-century-Irish.jpg|thumb|right|Irish Gaels in a painting from the 16th century]]
Throughout the Middle Ages, the common clothing amongst the Gaelic Irish consisted of a ''brat'' (a woollen semi circular cloak) worn over a ''léine'' (a loose-fitting, long-sleeved tunic made of linen). For men the ''léine'' reached to their ankles but was hitched up by means of a crios (pronounced 'kriss') which was a type of woven belt. The léine was hitched up to knee level. (Gaelicattire.com) Women wore the léine at full length. Men sometimes wore tight-fitting trews (Gaelic triúbhas) but otherwise went bare-legged.&lt;ref name="Connolly-prologue"/&gt; The ''brat'' was simply thrown over both shoulders or sometimes over only one. Occasionally the brat was fastened with a ''dealg'' ([[Celtic brooch|brooch]]), with men usually wearing the ''dealg'' at their shoulders and women at their chests.&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt; The ''ionar'' (a short, tight-fitting jacket) became popular later on. In ''[[Topographia Hibernica]]'', written during the 1180s, [[Gerald of Wales|Gerald de Barri]] wrote that the Irish commonly wore hoods at that time&lt;ref name="Gerald"/&gt; (perhaps forming part of the ''brat''), while [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote in the 1580s that the ''brat'' was (in general) their main item of clothing. Gaelic clothing does not appear to have been influenced by outside styles.

Women invariably grew their hair long and, as in other European cultures, this custom was also common among the men.&lt;ref name="Connolly-prologue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerald"/&gt;&lt;ref name=joyce18.1/&gt; It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their [[long hair]]—for example, a person could be forced to pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will.&lt;ref name="Ginnell7"/&gt; For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty.&lt;ref name=joyce18.1/&gt; Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids.&lt;ref name=joyce18.1/&gt; Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the ''glib'' (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine.&lt;ref name=joyce18.1/&gt; When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.&lt;ref name = ma/&gt;

Gaelic men typically wore a [[beard]]&lt;ref name="Connolly-prologue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerald"/&gt; and [[mustache]],&lt;ref name=joyce18.1/&gt; and it was often seen as dishonourable for a Gaelic man to have no facial hair. Beard styles varied – the long forked beard and the rectangular Mesopotamian-style beard were fashionable at times.&lt;ref name=joyce18.1/&gt;

===Warfare===
{{Main article|Gaelic warfare}}
[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate02.jpg|thumb|250px|A cattle raid shown in ''The Image of Irelande'' (1581)]]
[[File:Cuinbattle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fantasy painting showing legendary hero [[Cúchulainn]] in battle]]
Warfare was common in Gaelic Ireland, as territories fought for supremacy against each other and (later) against the Anglo-Normans.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt;
[[Champion warfare]] is a common theme in Irish mythology. In the Middle Ages all able-bodied men, apart from the learned and the clergy, were eligible for military service on behalf of the king or chief.&lt;ref name=duffy54/&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages and for some time after, outsiders often wrote that the style of Irish warfare differed greatly from what they deemed to be the norm in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt; The Gaelic Irish preferred [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] [[Raid (military)|raids]] (the ''crech''), which involved catching the enemy unaware. If this worked they would then seize any valuables (mainly livestock) and potentially valuable hostages, burn the crops, and escape.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt; The [[cattle raid]] was often called a ''[[Táin Bó]]'' in Gaelic literature. Although hit-and-run raiding was the preferred tactic in medieval times, there were also [[pitched battle]]s. From at least the 11th century, kings maintained small permanent fighting forces known as "troops of the household", who were often given houses and land on the king's mensal land. These were well-equipped professional soldiers made up of infantry and cavalry.&lt;ref name=duffy54/&gt; By the reign of [[Brian Boru]], Irish kings were taking large armies on [[military campaign|campaign]] over long distances and using naval forces in tandem with land forces.&lt;ref name=duffy54/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

A typical medieval Irish army included [[light infantry]], [[heavy infantry]] and [[cavalry]]. The bulk of the army was made-up of light infantry called ''[[Kern (soldier)|ceithern]]'' (anglicized 'kern'). The ceithern wandered Ireland offering their services for hire and usually wielded swords, skenes (a kind of long knife), short spears, bows and shields.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt; The cavalry was usually made-up of a king or chieftain and his close relatives. They usually rode without saddles but wore armour and iron helmets and wielded swords, skenes and long spears or [[lance]]s.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt; One kind of Irish cavalry was the [[hobelar]]. After the Norman invasion there emerged a kind of heavy infantry called ''[[Gallowglass|gallóglaigh]]'' (anglicized 'gallo[w]glass'). They were originally Scottish mercenaries who appeared in the 13th century, but by the 15th century most large ''túatha'' had their own hereditary force of Irish ''gallóglaigh''.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt; Some Anglo-Norman lordships also began using ''gallóglaigh'' in imitation of the Irish.&lt;ref name=duffy54/&gt; They usually wore [[Mail (armour)|mail]] and iron helmets and wielded [[pole weapon|sparth axes]], [[claymore]]s, and sometimes spears or lances. The ''gallóglaigh'' furnished the retreating plunderers with a "moving line of defence from which the horsemen could make short, sharp charges, and behind which they could retreat when pursued".&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt; As their armour made them less nimble, they were sometimes planted at strategic spots along the line of retreat. The kern, horsemen and ''gallóglaigh'' had lightly-armed servants to carry their weapons into battle.&lt;ref name="Cormac"/&gt;

Warriors were sometimes rallied into battle by [[blowing horn]]s and [[Great Irish Warpipes|warpipes]]. According to Gerald de Barri (in the 12th century), they did not wear armour, as they deemed it burdensome to wear and "brave and honourable" to fight without it.&lt;ref name="Gerald"/&gt; Instead, most ordinary soldiers fought semi-naked and carried only their weapons and a small round shield—Spenser wrote that these shields were covered with leather and painted in bright colours.&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt; Kings and chiefs sometimes went into battle wearing helmets adorned with eagle feathers. For ordinary soldiers, their thick hair often served as a helmet, but they sometimes wore simple helmets made from animal hides.&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;

===Arts===

====Visual art====
{{Main article|Celtic art|Insular art}}
Artwork from Ireland's Gaelic period is found on [[pottery]], [[jewellery]], [[weapon]]s, [[drinkware]], [[tableware]], [[stone carving]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s. Like other kinds of ''[[Celtic art]]'', Irish art from about 300 BCE is part of the wider style, which developed in west central Europe. By about 600 CE, after the Christianization of Ireland had begun, a style melding Irish, Mediterranean and Germanic [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] elements emerged, and was spread to Britain and mainland Europe by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]. This is known as ''[[Insular art]]'' or ''Hiberno-Saxon'' art, which continued in some form in Ireland until the 12th century, although the Viking invasions ended its "Golden Age". Most surviving works of Insular art were either made by monks or made for monasteries, with the exception of [[brooch]]es, which were likely made and used by both clergy and laity. Examples of Insular art from Ireland include the ''[[Book of Kells]]'', [[Muiredach's High Cross]], the [[Tara Brooch]], the [[Ardagh Hoard]] the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], and the late [[Cross of Cong]], which also uses Viking styles.

====Music and dance====

{{See also|Sean-nós song|Sean-nós dance}}
Although Gerald de Barri had a negative view of the Irish, in ''Topographia Hibernica'' (1188) he conceded that they were more skilled at playing music than any other nation he had seen. He claimed that the two main instruments were the "[[harp]]" and "[[Tabor (instrument)|tabor]]" (see also [[bodhrán]]), that their music was fast and lively, and that their songs always began and ended with [[B♭ (musical note)|B-flat]].&lt;ref name="Gerald"/&gt; In ''A History of Irish Music'' (1905), [[W. H. Grattan Flood]] wrote that there were at least ten instruments in general use by the Gaelic Irish. These were the ''cruit'' (a small harp) and ''[[Clàrsach|clairseach]]'' (a bigger harp with typically 30 strings), the ''timpan'' (a small [[string instrument]] played with a [[Bow (music)|bow]] or [[plectrum]]), the ''feadan'' (a [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]]), the ''buinne'' (an [[oboe]] or [[flute]]), the ''guthbuinne'' (a [[bassoon]]-type [[French horn|horn]]), the ''bennbuabhal'' and ''corn'' ([[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|hornpipes]]), the ''cuislenna'' ([[bagpipes]] – see [[Great Irish Warpipes]]), the ''stoc'' and ''sturgan'' ([[Clarion (instrument)|clarion]]s or trumpets), and the ''cnamha'' ([[castanets]]).&lt;ref name="Flood3"/&gt; He also mentions the [[fiddle]] as being used in the 8th century.&lt;ref name="Flood3"/&gt;

===Assemblies===
[[File:Collinaditara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The summit of the [[Hill of Tara]]]]
As mentioned before, Gaelic Ireland was split into many clann territories and kingdoms called ''túath'' (plural: ''túatha'').&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; Although there was no central 'government' or 'parliament', a number of local, regional and national gatherings were held. These combined features of [[popular assembly|assemblies]] and [[fair]]s.&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt;

In Ireland the highest of these was the ''[[feis]]'' at [[Hill of Tara|Teamhair na Rí]] (Tara), which was held every third [[Samhain]].&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; This was a gathering of the leading men of the whole island – kings, lords, chieftains, druids, judges etc.&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; Below this was the ''[[óenach]]'' (modern spelling: ''aonach''). These were regional or provincial gatherings open to everyone.&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; Examples include that held at [[Taillten Fair|Tailtin]] each [[Lughnasadh]], and that held at [[Hill of Uisneach|Uisneach]] each [[Beltane|Bealtaine]]. The main purpose of these gatherings was to promulgate and reaffirm the laws – they were read aloud in public that they might not be forgotten, and any changes in them carefully explained to those present.&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt;

Each túath or clann had two assemblies of its own. These were the ''cuirmtig'', which was open to all clann members, and the ''dal'' (a term later adopted for the Irish parliament – see [[Dáil Éireann]]), which was open only to clann chiefs.&lt;ref name="Ginnell4"/&gt; Each clann had a further assembly called a ''tocomra'', in which the clann chief (''toísech'', modern [[taoiseach]]) and his deputy/successor (''[[tanaiste]]'') were elected.

{{Main article|Norman invasion of Ireland}}
Ireland became [[Christianization|Christianized]] between the 5th and 7th centuries. Pope [[Adrian IV]], the only English pope, had already issued a [[Papal Bull]] in 1155 giving [[Henry II of England]] authority to invade Ireland as a means of curbing Irish refusal to recognize Roman law. Importantly, for later English monarchs, the Bull, ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', maintained papal [[suzerainty]] over the island:

{{cquote|There is indeed no doubt, as thy Highness doth also acknowledge, that Ireland and all other islands which Christ the Sun of Righteousness has illumined, and which have received the doctrines of the Christian faith, belong to the jurisdiction of St. Peter and of the holy Roman Church.}}

In 1166, after losing the protection of [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]], King [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] was forcibly exiled by a confederation of Irish forces under King [[Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]]. Fleeing first to [[Bristol]] and then to [[Normandy]], Diarmait obtained permission from [[Henry II of England]] to use his subjects to regain his kingdom. By the following year, he had obtained these services and in 1169 the main body of Norman, Welsh and [[Flanders|Flemish]] forces landed in Ireland and quickly retook Leinster and the cities of [[Waterford]] and [[Dublin]] on behalf of Diarmait. The leader of the Norman force, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], more commonly known as Strongbow, married Diarmait's daughter, [[Eva MacMurrough|Aoife]], and was named [[Tanistry|tánaiste]] to the Kingdom of Leinster. This caused consternation to Henry II, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to visit Leinster to establish his authority.

Henry landed in 1171, proclaiming [[Waterford]] and [[Dublin]] as [[Royal Cities]]. Adrian's successor, [[Pope Alexander III]], ratified the grant of Ireland to Henry in 1172. The 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] between Henry and Ruaidhrí maintained Ruaidhrí as High King of Ireland&lt;ref name=mccourt/&gt; but codified Henry's control of Leinster, Meath and Waterford. However, with Diarmuid and Strongbow dead, Henry back in England, and Ruaidhrí unable to curb his vassals, the high kingship rapidly lost control of the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Henry, in 1185, awarded his younger son, John, the title ''Dominus Hiberniae'', [[Lordship of Ireland|"Lord of Ireland"]]. This kept the newly created title and the Kingdom of England personally and legally separate. However, when John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as King of England in 1199, the Lordship of Ireland fell back into personal union with the Kingdom of England.

====Gaelic resurgence====
[[File:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|right|200px|Ireland in 1450 showing lands held by native Irish (green), the Anglo-Irish (blue) and the English king (dark grey).]]
By 1261, the weakening of the Anglo-Norman Lordship had become manifest following a string of military defeats. In the chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land. The invasion by [[Edward Bruce]] in 1315–18 at a time of famine weakened the Norman economy. The [[Black Death]] arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to [[the Pale]], a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]], and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]."

The authorities in the Pale worried about the [[Gaelicisation]] of Norman Ireland, and passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the [[Irish language]], wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. The government in Dublin had little real authority. By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453) and then by the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1450–85). Around the country, local Gaelic and Gaelicised lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin.

====Gaelic kingdoms during the period====
{{see also|List of Irish kingdoms}}
Following the failed attempt by the Scottish King [[Edward Bruce]] (see [[Irish Bruce Wars 1315–1318]]) to drive the Normans out of Ireland, there emerged a number of important Gaelic kingdoms and Gaelic-controlled lordships.

*'''[[Connacht]]'''. The Ó Conchobhair dynasty, despite their setback during the Bruce wars, had regrouped and ensured that the title [[Kings of Connacht|King of Connacht]] was not yet an empty one. Their stronghold was in their homeland of Sil Muirdeag, from where they dominated much of northern and northeastern Connacht. However, after the death of [[Ruaidri mac Tairdelbach Ua Conchobair]] in 1384, the dynasty split into two factions, [[O'Conor Don|Ó Conchobhair Don]] and Ó Conchobhair Ruadh. By the late 15th century, internecine warfare between the two branches had weakened them to the point where they themselves became vassals of more powerful lords such as [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell|Ó Domhnaill of Tír Chonaill]] and the [[Clan Burke]] of [[Clanricarde]]. The Mac Diarmata [[Kings of Moylurg]] retained their status and kingdom during this era, up to the death of Tadhg Mac Diarmata in 1585 (last ''de facto'' King of Moylurg). Their cousins, the Mac Donnacha of Tír Ailella, found their fortunes bound to the Ó Conchobhair Ruadh. The kingdom of [[Uí Maine]] had lost much of its southern and western lands to the Clanricardes, but managed to flourish until repeated raids by Ó Domhnaill in the early 16th century weakened it. Other territories such as [[O'Flaherty|Ó Flaithbeheraigh]] of [[Iar Connacht]], [[O'Shaughnessy|Ó Seachnasaigh]] of [[Aidhne]], [[Ó Dubhda|O'Dowd]] of Tireagh, [[Ó hEaghra|O'Hara]], [[Ó Gadhra (disambiguation)|Ó Gadhra]] and [[Ó Maddan]], either survived in isolation or were vassals for greater men.
*'''[[Ulster]]''': The [[Ulaid]] proper were in a sorry state all during this era, being squeezed between the emergent [[Uí Néill|Ó Neill]] [[Kings of Tír Eógain|of Tír Eógain]] in the west, the MacDonnells, Clann Aodha Buidhe, and the Anglo-Normans from the east. Only Mag Aonghusa managed to retain a portion of their former kingdom with expansion into Iveagh. The two great success stories of this era were Ó Domhnaill of Tír Chonaill and Ó Neill of Tír Eógain. Ó Domhnaill was able to dominate much of northern Connacht to the detriment of its native lords, both [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] and Gaelic, though it took time to suborn the likes of [[O Connor Sligo|Ó Conchobhair Sligigh]] and Ó Raghallaigh of [[East Breifne|Iar Breifne]]. Expansion southwards brought the hegemony of Tír Eógain, and by extension Ó Neill influence, well into the border lordships of [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[kingdom of Mide|Meath]]. Mag Uidir of [[Fermanagh|Fear Manach]] would slightly later be able to build his lordship up to that of third most powerful in the province, at the expense of the Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne and the MacMahons of [[Airgíalla]].
*'''[[Leinster]]''': Likewise, despite the adverse (and unforeseen) effects of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]]'s efforts to regain his kingdom, the fact of the matter was that, of his twenty successors up to 1632, most of them had regained much of the ground they had lost to the Normans, and exacted yearly tribute from the towns. His most dynamic successor was the celebrated [[Art mac Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh]]. The [[O'Byrne Clan|Ó Broin]] and [[O'Toole (family)|Ó Tuathail]] largely contented themselves with raids on Dublin (which, incredibly, continued into the 18th century). The Ó Mordha of [[Laois]] and Ó Conchobhair Falaighe of [[Offaly]] – the latter's capital was [[Daingean]] – were two self-contained territories that had earned the right to be called kingdoms due to their near-invincibility against successive generations of Anglo-Irish. The great losers were the Ó Melaghlins of Meath: their kingdom collapsed despite attempts by [[Cormac mac Art O Melaghlain]] to restore it. The royal family was reduced to vassal status, confined to the east shores of the [[River Shannon]]. The kingdom was substantially incorporated into the [[Lordship of Meath]] which was granted to [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] in 1172.[[File:Códice-De-Trajes-Biblioteca-Nacional-de-España-c.1529.jpg|thumb|240px|Irish Gaels, c. 1529]]
*'''[[Munster]]''':

Their spheres of interest often met with conflict with Anglo-Normans such as the [[Earl of Desmond|Earls of Desmond]] and [[Earl of Ormond (Irish)|Earls of Ormond]], yet they ruled right up to the end of Gaelic Ireland, and beyond, by expedient of becoming the O'Brien [[Earl of Thomond|Earls of Thomond]].

===Tudor conquest and aftermath===
{{main article|Tudor conquest of Ireland}}
From 1536, [[Henry VIII of England]] decided to conquer Ireland and bring it under English control. The [[FitzGerald dynasty]] of [[Kildare]], who had become the effective rulers of the Lordship of Ireland ([[The Pale]]) in the 15th century, had become unreliable allies and Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. To involve the [[Irish nobility|Gaelic nobility]] and allow them to retain their lands under English law the policy of [[surrender and regrant]] was applied.

In 1541, Henry upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full [[Kingdom of Ireland|kingdom]], partly in response to changing relationships with the papacy, which still had suzerainty over Ireland, following Henry's break with the church. Henry was proclaimed King of Ireland at a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year. This was the first meeting of the Irish Parliament to be attended by the Gaelic Irish princes as well as the [[Hiberno-Norman]] aristocracy.

With the technical institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations in the process either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The conquest was completed during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and [[James I of England|James I]], after several bloody conflicts.

The flight into exile in 1607 of [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone]] and  [[Red Hugh O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Hugh Roe O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] following their defeat at the [[Battle of Kinsale]] in 1601 and the suppression of their [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|rebellion]] in [[Ulster]] in 1603 is seen as the watershed of Gaelic Ireland. It marked the destruction of Ireland's ancient [[Irish nobility|Gaelic nobility]] following the Tudor conquest and cleared the way for the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. After this point, the English authorities in Dublin established greater control over Ireland, establishing - or, at least, attempting to establish - a centralised government for the entire island, and successfully disarmed the Gaelic lordships.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} O'Donnell - often known as Red Hugh O'Donnell - died in the famous archive castle of Simancas, Valladolid, in September 1602, when petitioning Philip II of Spain (1598-1621) for further assistance. His son, Rory, succeeded him as the Earl of Tyrconnell and was active in armies fighting for Madrid in the Low Countries and Spain. He died at the Battle of Barcelona in 1642, a naval engagement against the French fleet.

England and Scotland [[Acts of Union 1707|merged politically in 1707]] after the [[Union of the Crowns|crowns of both counties were united]] in 1603, but the crown of Ireland did not [[Acts of Union 1800|merge with the Union]] until 1800. Part of the attraction of the Union for many Irish Catholics was the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]], allowing [[Roman Catholic]] MPs, who had not been allowed in the Irish Parliament. This was however blocked by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] who argued that emancipating Roman Catholics would breach his [[Coronation of the British monarch#Recognition and oath|Coronation Oath]], and was not realised until 1829.

The Gaelic roots that defined early Irish history still persisted, despite this Anglicisation of Irish culture and politics, as Christianity became the prominent expression of [[Ireland#Culture|Irish identity in Ireland]]. In the time leading up to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s, many priests believed that parishioner spirituality was paramount, resulting in a localised [[Celtic Christianity|morphing of Gaelic and Catholic traditions]].&lt;ref name=larkin/&gt;

[[File:Gaucho1868b.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Gaucho from [[Argentina]], photographed in [[Peru]], 1868]]
A '''gaucho''' ({{IPA-es|ˈɡautʃo|lang}}) or '''gaúcho''' ({{IPA-pt|ɡaˈuʃu|lang}}) is a skilled horseman, reputed to be brave and unruly. The gaucho is a national symbol in Argentina and Uruguay, but is also a strong culture in the far south region of Brazil. Gauchos became greatly admired and renowned in legends, folklore and literature and became an important part of their regional cultural tradition. Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, they were celebrated by South American writers.

The gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural, horse-based cultures such as the North American [[cowboy]] (''[[vaquero]]'' in Spanish), the Chilean ''[[huaso]]'', the Peruvian ''chalan'' or ''[[morochuco]]'', the [[Venezuela]]n or [[Colombia]]n ''[[llanero]]'', the Hawaiian ''[[paniolo]]'',{{sfn|Slatta, Auld and Melrose}} the Mexican ''[[charro]]'' or the Portuguese ''[[campino]]''.

According to the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'', in its historical sense a gaucho was "a [[mestizo]] who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work"&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy'', Tri-Centennial Edition, ''Gaucho'', sense 5.  ("Mestizo que, en los siglos XVIII y XIX, habitaba la Argentina, Uruguay y Río Grande del Sur, en Brasil, era jinete transhumante y diestro en los trabajos ganaderos.") [http://dle.rae.es/?id=J0i39JT] accessed 4 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply "A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy'', ''Gaucho'', sense 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean "Noble, brave and generous",&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy'', ''Gaucho'', sense 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but also "One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy'', ''Gaucho'', sense 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese the word ''gaúcho'' (note the accent) means "An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses";&lt;ref&gt;''Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa'', ''Gaúcho''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Brazil ''gaúcho'' has also acquired a [[metonym]]ic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who  is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliven|first=Ruben George|year=2000|title="The Largest Popular Culture Movement in the Western World": Intellectuals and Gaúcho Traditionalism in Brazil|journal=American Ethnologist|publisher=Wiley for the American Anthropological Association|volume=27|issue=1|jstor=647129|pp=128–146|doi=10.1525/ae.2000.27.1.128}}, p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; In its purest sense, ''gaucho'' referred to the nomadic, often outlaw inhabitants of the great plains of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

==Etymology==
[[File:Estantia (farm) on the River San Pedro - Emeric Essex Vidal - Picturesque illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video (1820).JPG|thumb|'''The earliest securely dated depiction of an Uruguayan gaucho'''.  From "Picturesque Illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video" by [[Emeric Essex Vidal]] (1820)]]
[[File:Argolla.jpg|thumb|250px|Gaucho in ring lancing contest, [[Buenos Aires Province]].]]
There are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the term. It may derive from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''chaucho'', in turn derived from a Turkish low-rank military term [[Chiaus]], through [[Arabic]] ''Shawsh'' which became broadly applied to any guard/watcher or aide.&lt;ref name="etymolgy note"&gt;This is rather an implausible origin given that in Spanish loanwords from Arabic, the "Gau" is often a transformation from the Arabic letter "Waw" (W).&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of the term dates to [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Argentine independence]] in 1816. Another scenario indicates the word may derive from the Portuguese ''gaudério'', which was designated to the inhabitants of the vast regions of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Río de la Plata]] in the 18th century or the Portuguese ''garrucho'' that points to an instrument used by the gauchos to trap and hamstring cattle. The 18th century chronicler [[Alonso Carrió de la Vandera]] speaks of "Gauderios" when it mentions the Gauchos or "Huasos" as poorly dressed men.&lt;br&gt;

Another plausible origin is from a South American indigenous language, such as [[Mapudungun]] ''cauchu'' ("vagrant", "wanderer"), ''kauču'' ("friend"), or [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''wahcha'' ("vagabond", "poor person"). It could also derive from Arabic {{lang|ar|وحشة}} ''wahcha'', which means the state of being lonely in the wilderness.

==Essential attribute: The horse==
An essential attribute of a gaucho was that he was a skilled horseman. "He has taken his first lessons in riding before he is well able to walk".{{sfn|Christison|p=39}}   Without a horse the gaucho felt himself unmanned.  The naturalist [[William Henry Hudson]] (who was born on the [[pampas]] of [[Buenos Aires province]]) recorded that the gauchos of his childhood used to say that a man without a horse was a man without legs.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=23}} He described meeting a blind gaucho who was obliged to beg for his food yet behaved with dignity and went about on horseback.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=24}}  Richard W. Slatta, the author of a scholarly work about gauchos,{{efn|The work has been peer-reviewed by Adelman, 1993; Collier, 1988; Lynch, 1984; Reber, 1984.}} notes that the gaucho used horses to collect, mark, drive or tame cattle, to draw fishing nets, to hunt ostriches, to snare partridges, to draw well water, and even − with the help of his friends − to ride to his own burial.{{sfn|Slatta|pp=25-27}}

By reputation the quintessential gaucho [[caudillo]] [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] could throw his hat on the ground and scoop it up while galloping his horse, without touching the saddle with his hand.{{sfn|Cunninghame Graham, 1914|p=5}} For the gaucho, the horse was absolutely essential to his survival for, said Hudson: "he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils".{{sfn|Hudson, 1895|p=356}}

A popular [[Copla (meter)|''copla'']] was:

:::Mi caballo y mi mujer
:::viajaron para Salta,
:::el caballo que se vuelva,
:::mi mujer que no me hace falta.{{sfn|Arnoldi and Hernández|p=177}}

:::("My horse and my woman / Went off to Salta / May the horse return / For I don't need my woman.")

It was the gaucho's passion to own all his steeds in matching colours. Hudson recalled: &lt;blockquote&gt;The gaucho, from the poorest worker on horseback to the largest owner of lands and cattle, has, or had in those days, a fancy for having all his riding-horses of one colour. Every man as a rule had his tropilla — his own half a dozen or a dozen or more saddle-horses, and he would have them all as nearly alike as possible, so that one man had chestnuts, another browns, bays, silver- or iron-greys, duns, fawns, cream-noses, or blacks, or whites, or piebalds.{{sfn|Hudson, 1918|p=160}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The caudillo El Chacho Peñalosa described the low point of his life as "In Chile − and on foot!" (''En Chile y a pie''.){{sfn|Sarmiento|p=14}}

[[File:Segundo ramirez 1927.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Segundo Ramírez, who inspired [[Ricardo Güiraldes]] to write ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]''.]]
The gaucho plays an important symbolic role in the nationalist feelings of this region, especially that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The [[epic poem]] ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' by [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]] (considered by some&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopoldo Lugones]] [http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/l/lugones.htm 1] in "El Payador" (1916)[http://www.libroos.es/libros-de-narrativa/fantastica/15225-lugones-leopoldo-el-payador-pdf.html 2] and Ricardo Rojas [http://www.folkloredelnorte.com.ar/creadores/rojas.htm 3] established the canonical view regarding the Martín Fierro as the National Epic of Argentina. The consequences of these considerations are discussed by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his essay "El Martín Fierro". An assessment of the years-long discussion [http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/espanhol/cuadernos/recienvenido10.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306012640/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/espanhol/cuadernos/recienvenido10.pdf |date=2007-03-06 }}, since p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; the [[national epic]] of Argentina) used the gaucho as a symbol against corruption and of Argentine national tradition, pitted against Europeanising tendencies. Martín Fierro, the hero of the poem, is drafted into the Argentine military for a border war, deserts, and becomes an outlaw and fugitive. The image of the free gaucho is often contrasted to the slaves who worked the northern Brazilian lands. Further literary descriptions are found in [[Ricardo Güiraldes]]' ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]''.
Like the North American cowboys, as discussed in Richard W. Slatta, ''Cowboys of the Americas'', gauchos were generally reputed to be strong, honest, silent types, but proud and capable of violence when provoked. The gaucho tendency to violence over petty matters is also recognized as a typical trait. Gauchos' use of the famous "[[facón]]" (large knife generally tucked into the rear of the gaucho sash) is legendary, often associated with considerable bloodletting. Historically, the facón was typically the only eating instrument that a gaucho carried.

Also like the cowboy, as shown in Richard W. Slatta, ''Cowboys of the Americas'', gauchos were and remain proud and great horseriders. Typically, a gaucho's [[horse]] constituted most of what he owned in the world. During the wars of the 19th century in the [[Southern Cone]], the [[cavalry|cavalries]] on all sides were composed almost entirely of gauchos. In Argentina, gaucho armies such as that of [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]], slowed Spanish advances. Furthermore, many [[caudillos]] relied on gaucho armies to control the Argentine provinces.

The gaucho diet was composed almost entirely of beef while on the range, supplemented by ''[[yerba mate]]'' (''[[erva-mate]]'' in Portuguese), an herbal infusion made from the leaves of a South American tree, a type of [[holly]] rich in caffeine and nutrients.

Gauchos&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.south-images.com/photos-argentina.htm South-images.com] Photos: gauchos in Argentina, [[Photo library]] South-Images&lt;/ref&gt; dressed quite distinctly from North American cowboys, and used ''[[bolas]]'' or ''boleadoras'' - in Portuguese ''boleadeiras'' - (three leather bound rocks tied together with approximately three feet long leather straps) in addition to the familiar "North American" [[lasso|lariat]] or riata. The typical gaucho outfit would include a ''[[poncho]]'' (which doubled as a saddle blanket and as sleeping gear), a ''[[facón]]'' (large knife), a ''[[rebenque]]'' (leather whip), and loose-fitting trousers called ''bombachas'', belted with a ''tirador'', or a ''chiripá'', a [[loincloth]]. During winters, gauchos wore heavy wool ponchos to protect against cold.

==Modern influences==
Gaúcho is also the common denomination of the current inhabitants of the Brazilian State of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].

''Gauchito'' (a boy in the Argentine colors and a gaucho hat) was the [[FIFA World Cup mascot|mascot]] for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].

{{Legend inline|#E2DAFF|Jauer}}]]
[[File:EuInVallader.jpg|thumb|upright 1.5|Pronunciation of ''eu'' ('I') in the dialects of the Lower Engadine and the Val Müstair, as attested in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Peer (1962). ''Dicziunari rumantsch. Ladin - tudais-ch''. Chur.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Jauer''' ([{{IPA|ˈjawər}}]) is a dialect of [[Romansh language|Romansh]] that is spoken in the [[Val Müstair]]. It is closely related to the neighboring dialect of the [[Lower Engadine]], [[Vallader]] as well as [[Putèr]] spoken the [[Upper Engadine]]. The name of the dialect is derived from a nickname based on the personal pronoun ''jau''  [{{IPA|ˈjaw}}] 'I', and can be translated as 'the ''jau''-sayers',&lt;ref&gt;Curdin &amp; Schläpfer (1984). p. 261, 265&lt;/ref&gt; as this contrasts with Vallader ''eu'', pronounced [{{IPA|ˈɛː}}], [{{IPA|ˈɛw}}], [{{IPA|ˈjɛ}}], [{{IPA|ˈjɐ}}], or [{{IPA|ˈjow}}] in the Lower Engadine.&lt;ref&gt;Ricarda Liver (2010). ''Rätoromanisch. Eine Einführung in das Bündnerromanische.'' Narr, Tübingen. S. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features distinguishing Jauer from Vallader include the placement of stress on the penultimate syllable of certain verbs, as well as the infinitive verb ending -er as opposed to Vallader -ar. In addition, stressed /a/ is diphthongized in Jauer. All three traits can be seen in the verb 'to sing', which is ''chantàr'' in Vallader but ''chàunter'' in Jauer.

== Sociolinguistics ==
According to the Swiss census of 2000, 86.4% in the Val Müstair report to speak Romansh habitually, and 74.1% declare it as their language of best command.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Manfred (2004), ''Romanisch – Facts &amp; Figures'' (in German), Chur&lt;/ref&gt; This amounts to around 1,400 speakers in absolute numbers in the year 2000.

Jauer is usually not written; the written standard in Val Müstair is traditionally [[Vallader]]. Jauer is occasionally written regardless, and in 2007, a collection of short stories written in Jauer (''Dschon Uein id atras istorias grischunas'') was published&lt;ref&gt;Plinio Meyer (2007). ''Dschon Uein id atras istorias grischunas'', 978-385637-342-9. Uniun dals Grischs, Celerina&lt;/ref&gt;

In official use and as the language of school, Vallader has traditionally been used in the Val Müstair. In 2007, the valley was one of the first municipalities of the canton to introduce the pan-regional Romansh variety [[Rumantsch Grischun]] as the language of schooling and official use. In 2012 however, a municipal assembly voted to return to the use of Vallader in schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suedostschweiz.ch/politik/aus-fuer-rumantsch-grischun-muenstertaler-schulen&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other Romansh speakers, virtually all speakers of Jauer with the exception of children below school-age are also proficient in both [[Swiss German]] and [[Swiss Standard German]]. Additionally, many people in [[Val Müstair]] also speak [[Bavarian German]] as a second language due to contacts with neighboring [[South Tyrol]]&lt;ref&gt;Cathomas (2008). ''Sprachgebrauch im Alltag – Die Verwendung des Rätoromanischen in verschiedenen Domänen: Wechselwirkungen und Einflussfaktoren'' (in German), Chur: Institut für Kulturforschung Graubünden&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lungu people''' (also known as '''Rungu''' or '''Tabwa''') are an ethnic and linguistic group living primarily on the southwestern shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], on the [[Marungu massif]] in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and in southwestern [[Tanzania]] and northeastern [[Zambia]]. They speak dialects of the [[Mambwe-Lungu language]], a [[Bantu language]] closely related to that of the nearby [[Bemba people]] and [[Luba people]].

Lungu people comprise several clans and many subclans based on matrilineal descent, some with their own dialects, which are depicted as separate tribes on older ethnographic maps. PeopleGroups.org reports a population of 851,359 Lungu in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 1999. In 1987 the Rungu population in Tanzania was estimated to number 34,000. The number of Rungu in Zambia has not been independently estimated, though the combined number of [[Mambwe people|Mambwe]] and Rungu in Zambia was estimated to be 262,800 in 1993 [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mgr].

'''Maxim Lieber''' (October 15, 1897 – April 10, 1993) was a prominent American [[literary agent]] in [[New York City]] during the 1930s and 1940s. The Soviet spy [[Whittaker Chambers]] named him as an accomplice in 1949, and Lieber fled first to [[Mexico]] and then [[Poland]] not long after [[Alger Hiss]]'s conviction in 1950.

Young Maxim attended public schools, including [[Townsend Harris High School|Townsend Harris Hall]] (then part of [[New York City College]]) and [[Morris High School (Bronx, New York)]].&lt;ref name="HUAC" /&gt;

In 1918, Lieber joined the West Ontario Regiment of the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force]]. In 1919, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]]. In 1920, he received an honorable discharge as a Sergeant.&lt;ref name=Maxim /&gt; (In 1951, Lieber testified that he had served in [[World War I]], stationed at [[Camp Meade]] in the replacement battalion in medical service, that he received U.

Returning to the States in 1926, he worked for [[Brentano's]] as head of publishing through 1930. At that point, Brentano's went into involuntary bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="HUAC" /&gt;

In many ways our relationship was freer than mine with the Hisses. Paul was engaged in less hazardous activities than Hiss. He had a lively sense of humor which Hiss lacked. We shared a common intense love of music and books. And Paul knew my real name and had known and respected me as a [[Communist]] writer before either of us went underground.&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;

According to Chambers in his 1952 memoir ''Witness'', Lieber helped the underground network in New York City.  Initially, Chambers secured Lieber's cooperation in setting up a branch of his agency in London, which Chambers would run under the name of "David Breen."  Then, he secured Lieber's support for operations in East Asia.  During the summer of 1935, the Chambers family lived with the Liebers in [[Smithtown, Pennsylvania]].  After Chambers' defection in 1938, Peters used "Paul" (Lieber) to contact him.  Later, when Chambers wanted to let Peters &amp; Co. know about his life preserver (see [[Pumpkin papers|Pumpkin Papers]]), he contacted Lieber to relay his message.&lt;ref name=Sakmyster /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witness /&gt;
While the London operation was getting under way (it would eventually fall through), Chambers asked Lieber to cooperate with fellow underground operator [[John Loomis Sherman]] (under the alias "Charles Francis Chase" and Chambers as "Lloyd Cantwell") in establishing the [[American Feature Writers' Syndicate]].&lt;ref name="Goodbye" /&gt;
&lt;ref name=Witness /&gt; Together, these three filed a registration of trade in New York City and opened a bank account at the [[Chemical Bank]]. (Chambers also mentioned that [[Charles Angoff]] was involved, though conspiratorially or otherwise remained unclear.  He also mentions Japanese artist [[Hideo Noda]]/[[:ja:野田英夫|野田英夫]].&lt;ref name=Witness /&gt;) Sherman was to go to Tokyo and set up a network separate from that of [[Richard Sorge]]. According to Chambers' testimony: &lt;blockquote&gt;Lieber went among various feature syndicates and various newspapers and tried to get various interests or sales… and Sherman went to work in Lieber's office, had a desk there, and his name was written on the door and I think some stationery was got out and deposits were made, I think, in the Chemical Bank in New York in the name of the syndicate. These deposits were to finance the operation in Japan. Then Peters, who was in on most of this operation, supplied a birth certificate in the name of Charles Chase [for Sherman] and, on the basis of that certificate, which was a perfectly legal document procured in the way I have described in earlier testimony, John Sherman took out a passport and on that passport he traveled to Tokyo.&lt;ref name="HUAC" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Testimony, flight, and later years ===
In 1949, J. Peters left the United States at his own volition (ahead of near-certain deportation) for [[Hungary]], where he lived for the rest of his life. Shortly thereafter, [[Noel Field]] (like Hiss not only as an employee of the [[U.S. Department of State]], but one named by Chambers as part of his spy ring) fled from [[Switzerland]] to Poland (behind the [[Iron Curtain]]).&lt;ref name=ams&gt;{{cite book | last = Schlesinger| first = Arthur Meier | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = A Life in the Twentieth Century | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Books | year = 2000 | location = | pages = 499–500 | url = | doi = | id =| isbn = 0-618-21925-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left [[House Un-American Committee]] (HUAC) with few people who had not yet pleaded the Fifth to corroborate Chambers' story. On February 27 and March 1, 1950, Sherman appeared before HUAC without counsel and pleaded the Fifth to nearly every question asked him.

On June 13, 1950, Lieber appeared with lawyer [[Milton H. Friedman]] (brother-in-law of New York State Justice Philip Halpern&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

As with Sherman, HUAC read out excerpts from Chambers' testimony that mentioned their names or aliases. They also asked Lieber (as Sherman) whether he knew either Alger Hiss or J. Peters. (Chambers had recounted a meeting between, Lieber, himself, and Hiss on Lieber's farm: Lieber confirmed only ownership of 103-acre farm in [[Ferndale, Pennsylvania]], in [[Bucks County]] from about 1935-1945.) They asked whether his clients included [[Louis Adamic]], [[Howard Fast]], [[V. J. Jerome]], or [[Paul Robeson]]. They asked whether he knew Otto Katz (reputed to be involved in the death of [[Walter Krivitsky]] and in Soviet attempts to seize Chambers after defection) or Katz's associate Erwin Kisch. They asked whether he knew [[Osmond K. Fraenkel]] or whether he had ever contributed to a publication (probably ''Freies Deutschland'') by [[Anna Seghers]] in Mexico. 
To all such questions, Lieber pleaded the Fifth on the grounds of self-incrimination. As he explained, he had also testified twice already in 1948 before the [[grand jury]] in New York City, which then indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury. During testimony, Lieber listed three by name of some 30 clients: Erskine Caldwell, Carey McWilliams, and Robert Coates.&lt;ref name="HUAC" /&gt;

Lieber left the U. S. for Mexico in 1951 with his wife Minna and their two children.&lt;ref name="Goodbye" /&gt;

After one year in [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico, they moved to Mexico City, where they resided another two years. Following his departure from the US, Lieber was stripped of his US citizenship. He resided in Mexico as a stateless person. The US authorities returned his citizenship in 1964.

In late 1954, on instructions from Moscow, Lieber moved with his family to Warsaw, Poland. They spent the next 14 years in Poland.  Professor [[Erwin Marquit]] knew the Liebers in Poland and recollects:  &lt;blockquote&gt;A few weeks after our arrival in Poland, we began to encounter in the Hotel Bristol a number of U.S. Communist emigres.  Although Esther and I had not known any of them personally in the United States, they quickly accepted us into what was to become a community of some dozen U.S. Communists in Poland...  Max, a naturalized U.S. citizen, had been a literary agent, whose clients included, among others, Whittaker Chambers, of Pumpkin Papers fame...  The Liebers said that they had left the United States because Max had been stripped of the possibility of earning a livelihood...  Although I had some sporadic contact with them, the Liebers rarely attended gatherings of the American group.&lt;ref&gt;

The Liebers then returned to the States. There, Lieber lived out the rest of his life quietly in East Hartford, Ct. Soon after his return to the US he was interviewed by the FBI. In the late 1970s, Lieber gave a series of interviews to historian Allen Weinstein, who then was working on his book, "Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case." Lieber died in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]] on April 10, 1993.

== Impact on McCarthy era ==
Lieber's flight abroad in 1951, following Peters, Field, and others, left the U. S. Government with few witnesses to corroborate Chambers' testimony about Hiss. A second trial had found Hiss guilty of two counts of perjury a few months earlier, in January 1950. Witnesses included [[Hede Massing]] and a former housemaid.&lt;ref&gt;

(In 1952, [[Nathaniel Weyl]] would testify further about Hiss.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20171">[[File:Nevrev 043.jpg|thumb|''Moral Suasion'', by [[Nikolai Nevrev]] (1893).]]
'''Moral suasion''' is an appeal to [[morality]] in order to influence or change [[behavior]]. A famous example is the attempt by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and his [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] to end [[slavery in the United States]] by using moral suasion.&lt;ref&gt;Tunde Adeleke, "Afro-Americans and moral suasion: the debate in the 1830's," The Journal of Negro History, 1998: 127-142.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], moral suasion is more specifically defined as "the attempt to coerce private economic activity via governmental exhortation in directions not already defined or dictated by existing statute law."&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  The 'moral' aspect comes from the pressure for 'moral responsibility' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the good of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia, What does moral suasion mean, http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moralsuasion.asp (accessed June 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Moral suasion in this narrower sense is also sometimes known as [[jawboning]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Verkuil, "Jawboning administrative agencies: Ex Parte Contracts by the White House," Columbia Law Review, 1980: 943-989.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of moral suasion:
* "Pure" moral suasion is an appeal for [[altruism|altruistic]] behaviour&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  and is rarely used in economic policy
* "Impure" moral suasion, which is the usual meaning of "moral suasion" in economics, is backed by explicit or implicit threats by authorities in order to provide incentives to comply with the authorities' wishes&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

==Pure moral suasion==
[[File:William_Lloyd_Garrison_by_Southworth_and_Hawes,_c1850.png|thumb|[[William Lloyd Garrison]], who attempted to end slavery through moral suasion.]]
[[File:Shimer College Assembly Nov 15 2009.jpg|thumb|The Assembly of [[Shimer College]], which "governs by virtue of the moral suasion established by communal deliberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/256-constitution-of-the-assembly-9-2014pdf|date=2014-09-04|accessdate=2015-01-15|title=Constitution of the Assembly|publisher=Shimer College}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Moral suasion has been applied in many different fields.  In early [[education]]al thought, it was often paired against [[corporal punishment]] as a means of achieving [[school discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America|first=Randall M.|last=Miller|chapter=Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7bkGF4DytgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA251|page=251|volume=4|isbn=9780313065361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in [[parenting]], writers from the 19th century through [[Benjamin Spock]] have advocated the use of moral suasion with children as an alternative to physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYf8QfXPNWkC&amp;pg=PT30&amp;|page=30|first=Philip J.|last=Greven|year=2010|title=Spare the Rod: The Religious Roots of Punishment and the Psychological Impact of Physical Abuse|chapter=Moral Suasion and Nonviolence|isbn=9780307773005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[politics]], moral suasion has frequently been employed by movements for [[social change]], but its effectiveness has varied widely.

=== Examples ===

==== Temperance movement ====

In the [[temperance movement]] of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Britain and North America, moral suasion was initially a key part of the strategy for reducing the prevalence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in society.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXHYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA472|page=472|title= Alcohol and Drugs in North America: A Historical Encyclopedia|chapter=Moral Suasion}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the movement began to face the limitations of this strategy in the late 19th century, its members turned to legal coercion, leading to the rise of [[prohibitionism]].&lt;ref name="alcohol"/&gt;

==== United States civil rights movement ====
In the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] of the twentieth century, moral suasion was one of three major prongs of the movement, the others being legal action and collective [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jajYn4iXLBoC&amp;pg=PT72|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 24: Race|chapter=Civil Rights, African American|first=Waldo|last=Martin|ref=harv|page=72|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial victories, this nonviolent strategy began to struggle in the 1960s, and largely ended with the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Martin|2013|p=78}}

==== Promoting religious tolerance ====

Moral suasion has sometimes been effective in resolving religious disharmony, especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has been effective in [[Singapore]] in the creation of religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Times, "Govt will step in when efforts fail," Straits Times, March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protecting the environment ====

Usage of moral suasion in environment regulation consists in making polluters feel responsible for the negative [[externalities]] that they cause.&lt;ref name="zekri"&gt;S. Zekri, "Analyse comparative d'instruments de lutte contre la pollution," in Séminaire de l'Association Tunisienne des Anciens de l'Institut Agronomique Méditerranéen de Zaragoza (Tunis: CIHEAM-IAMZ, 1993), 61-73&lt;/ref&gt; Moral suasion can be very efficient from an economic standpoint since economic agents are free to use any cost-minimising solution deal with their negative externalities instead of having to rely on a government-prescribed regulation or tax.  Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low.&lt;ref name="zekri"/&gt;

A study of [[marine debris]] regulations in the United States from 1989 to 1993 revealed that moral suasion can be an effective tool to limit the discharge of trash into water in spite the offenders' low probability of being detected.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; The evidence on the effectiveness of moral suasion methods to induce environmentally desirable behaviour however is not strong&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;James M. Coe and Donald B. Rogers, Marine Debris, Sources, Impacts, and solutions (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  unless it is coupled with other instruments. For example, Canadian policy makers advocates for moral suasion in their endeavour to achieve environmental and wildlife policy objectives, a course of action likely to fail if little regard is placed on the accompanying incentives.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.van Kooten &amp; Andrew Schmitz, "Preserving Waterfowl Habitat on the Canadian Prairies: Economic Incentives versus Moral Suasion," American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1992: 79-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impure moral suasion==
[[File:Ottawa - ON - Bank of Canada.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Bank of Canada, a [[central bank]]. Central banks often use impure moral suasion to control the [[credit supply]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NjWGbq7JMwC&amp;pg=PA426|page=426|title=Essentials of Macroeconomic Management|edition=1st|isbn=9788125928584|year=|first=M.C.|last=Vaish|publisher=Vikas Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As a policy tool, impure moral suasion differs from direct suasion using laws and regulations in that penalties for non-compliance are not systematically assessed on non-compliers.&lt;ref name="romans"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.T.|last=Romans|title=Moral Suasion as an Instrument of Economic Policy|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=56|issue=5| date=December 1996 |pages=1220–1226|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led some authors to criticise moral suasion as immoral, since compliers get penalised for cooperating with the stated government agenda (thus incurring extra costs) while non-compliers are not punished.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;  Other objections to the use of moral suasion include the fact that it constitutes extra-legal coercion by the government, that it adds uncertainty to the regulatory process, and that it can undermine or delay the implementation of effective legislation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

=== Effectiveness ===

Moral suasion will be "an effective economic policy whenever the expected costs of noncompliance is made to exceed the cost of compliance".{{sfn|Romans|1996|p=1223}}

There are 2 necessary conditions for this to happen.
* First, citizens must support the Government's policy,{{sfn|Romans|1996|p=1223}} thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion and the target whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange in violation of the country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt;
* Second, the population of economic agent to be persuaded must be small.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt; Fewness entails the easy identification of economic agents to persuade, and increase the perceived likelihood that non-compliers will be identified and punished.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

Even when those two necessary conditions are not fully met, moral suasion, if only partially effective, can be a valid choice of policy instruments if the alternatives are doing nothing or taking actions with high opportunity or administrative costs.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

Although neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition, a low level of competition amongst suppliers in the economy contributes to increased effectiveness of moral suasion.  Indeed, companies that have been "persuaded" to adopt morally superior but more costly behaviour, will be less competitive and could be driven out of the market by competitors who are not fettered by such constraints if competition is too fierce.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Shleifer, "Does Competition Destroy Ethical Behavior?," The American Economic Review (American Economic Association) 94, no. 2 (May 2004): 414-418&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== Regulating the financial sector ====
The [[Bank of Canada]] defines moral suasion in central banking as "a wide range of possible initiatives by the central bank designed to enlist the co-operation of commercial banks or of other financial organisations in pursuit of some objective of financial policy".&lt;ref name="chant"&gt;John F. Chant &amp; Keith Acheson, "The Choice of Monetary Instruments and the Theory of Bureaucracy," Public Choice Vol. 12 (Spring, 1972), 1972: 13-33&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be defined more generally as "a process whereby commercial banks co-operate with the central bank either for altruistic reasons or out of fear of administrative or legislative sanctions".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Breton and Ronald Wintrobe, "A theory of 'moral' suasion," The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue canadienne d'Economique, 1978: 210-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal moral suasion is characterised by explicit (though non-contractual) commitments to "refrain from activities judged to be in conflict with policies of the central bank".&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt; Informal moral suasion is more difficult to define and is carried though various conversations and interactions between the central bank and the commercial finance institutions, during which commercial institutions can be made to understand the central bank's policy objectives on various matters.

The oligopolistic competition in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive.&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt; Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified and held up for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

==== Curbing inflation ====

Moral suasion has been effectively used in the management of inflation in a number of countries and is also referred to as "open mouth operations" in the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Brash, "Inflation targeting 14 years on," Speech to the American Economics Association by the chairman of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Atlanta, January 5, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The common factor for the success of moral suasion is the trust that stakeholders have on the Central Bank.  For example, New Zealand has experienced high inflation in the early and mid eighties which however drastically reduced as the bank managed to anchor stakeholder inflation expectation through moral suasion. Monetary policy to a great extent is the management of expectations,&lt;ref&gt;Lars E. O. Svensson, http://people.su.se/~leosven/, January 26–27, 2004, (accessed May 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; influencing inflation expectations of business and labour. Researchers have found that inflation expectations greatly influence future inflation, hence the use of moral suasion to anchor inflation expectations has been an important instrument in reducing New Zealand's inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;Editor in Chief Hama Saburi Financial Gazette, "http://www.newzimbabwe.com," http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-2111-Interview+Gono+on+Indigenisation/opinion.aspx, March 26, 2010, (accessed May 28, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral suasion has also been widely and successfully used to curb moderate price increases in countries as Great Britain and Sweden where a principle of "democratic socialism" has been in place for some time.&lt;ref name="madden"&gt;Carl H. Madden, "Government Control versus Market Discipline," Academy of Political Science, 1979: 203-218&lt;/ref&gt; Wage and price increases were agreed upon by the Government, Labour and businesses. The public ownership of the whole exercise enhanced compliance.&lt;ref name="madden"/&gt;

=== In different political regimes ===

Although moral suasion can theoretically be used in any political regime, it has a higher chance of being effective in cases where the political authority is centralised and effective.

Centralisation of authority contributes to the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy tool since it makes the government's positions clearer and more consistent.  Attempts by governments to influence the behaviour of companies and citizens can therefore be understood more clearly.

Effectiveness of authority refers to the ease in which the intentions of the political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply.

As fewness of economic agents to be persuaded is a necessary condition for moral suasion to be effective, this policy instrument is more adapted to countries with higher concentration of suppliers, both in terms of number and of geography  .

Studies suggest that moral suasion is usually not effective in environmental matters in  advanced economies.  It can, however, still be used for developing countries since there are still easy environmental gains that could be made without heavy-handed regulation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt;

=== Interaction with other policy instruments ===

Moral suasion is rarely used in isolation.&lt;ref name="romans"/&gt; Governments can use moral suasion in conjunction with a variety of other policy instruments to reach its objectives.

==== Regulation ====

Firms may alter their behaviour in order to reduce the probability that they will be subject to additional regulations.  In fact, they may respond more to the threat of being regulated than to the actual imposition of regulations, as illustrated by the fact that US oil companies froze wholesale petrol prices when the 1991 Iraq war started, even without being prompted to do so.&lt;ref name="glazer"&gt;Amihai Glazer and Henry McMillan, "Pricing by the Firm Under Regulatory Threat," ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 1992: 1089-1099&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Price cap ====

Governments can also implicitly or explicitly threaten to establish price caps to make moral suasion more likely to succeed.  This was illustrated in 1979 when the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, [[Paul Volcker]], warned banks against raising prime rates above a certain level,&lt;ref name="glazer"/&gt; and in the 1960s when US President John F. Kennedy caused U.S. Steel to reverse its decision to increase prices by sharply criticizing the company.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Vernon and Carmelo Giaccotto, "The impact of indirect government controls on U.S. drug prices and R&amp;D," Cato Journal, 2006: 143-158&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional taxation ====

Moral suasion, in the form of public exhortation, was used to curb the bonuses paid to certain employees in the financial sector, without much success.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, "Moral outrage," The Economist, October 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The threat of additional, specific taxes&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, "House Passes Bonus Tax Bill" Wall Street Journal, March 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was later used in conjunction with moral suasion to make compliance more likely.

==== Open market transactions and other interventions by central banks ====

Central banks and governments who let markets know what they consider ranges of "appropriate" values for its currency has impacts on the trading of the currency, even if intervention never occurs.&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;John Williamson, "The case for Roughly Stabilizing the Real Value of the Dollar," The American Economic Review, 1989: 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Central banks can buy or sell various securities if the currency value falls outside its desired range.

==== Information provision ====

Governments can choose to publish information in order to "shame" certain market participants into altering their behaviour.  The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging "excessive" prices in the eyes of the US government, was used by the Clinton administration to curb increases in drug prices.&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt;  The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.&lt;ref&gt;Kai Hong Phua, "Privatization and restructuring of health services in Singapore," IPS occasional paper series (Singapore: Institute of Policy Studies, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Service provision ====

The threat of a [[public option]], i.e. direct government provision of goods and services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced, can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market.

==== Privatisation and deregulation ====

Large monopolies, sometimes deemed unresponsive to citizens or consumer wishes, can be threatened with privatisation or with deregulation depending on whether the monopoly is government-owned or not.

}}'''Murad Subay''' (born July 3, 1987 in [[Dhamar Governorate|Dhamar]]) is a Yemeni [[contemporary art]]ist, [[street artist]] and a political activist who has launched several [[street art]] campaigns of which society engagement marked one of their important elements. He first started to paint on the streets after [[Yemeni Revolution|the revolution of 2011]], in a campaign he called "Color the Walls of Your Street".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revolutionartnow.altervista.org/murad-subay-street-art-yemen/|title=Murad Subay ~ Street Art in Yemen {{!}} •• REVOLUTION ART ••|last=|first=|date=2015-01-21|website=|publisher=|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shabab.assafir.com/Article/11494|title=مراد سبيع.. يمنيّ يحلم|last=ترحيني|first=زينب|date=1013-12-24|website=السفير العربي|publisher=|language=ar-AR|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/7225425/_The_politics_of_painting_in_public_spaces_Yemeni_street_art_as_a_device_for_political_action_presented_at_the_PARGC_Symposium_The_revolutionary_Public_Sphere_Aesthetics_Poetics_and_Politics_University_of_Pennsylvania_Philadelphia_April_9-10_2014|title=The politics of painting in public spaces: Yemeni street art as a device for political action|last=Alviso-Marino|first=Anahi|publisher=|date=April 2014|isbn=|location=Symposium "The Revolutionary Public Sphere: Aesthetics, Poetics &amp; Politics" University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia|pages=3, 4, 5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2014/11/11/art-for-peace-murad-subay_n_6140566.html|title=La storia dello Yemen in graffiti (FOTO)|last=Barus|first=Donatella|date=2014-11-13|website=L'Huffington Post|publisher=|language=it-IT|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became widely known as an [[Activism|activist]] after launching several [[street art]] campaigns that criticized the political situation in his country and the conflicts which broke out in 2015 in [[Yemen]]. Unlike many graffiti artists, Murad does not hide his identity; rather he always paints in the light of day and invites people to join him paint openly in the streets. People from different backgrounds and ages have joined him in his campaigns to express their own views around the political scene in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/essays/100|title=Making Stories Visible: A Yemeni Art History|last=Alviso-Marino|first=Anahi|date=2014-09-09|website=Ibraaz|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2016/4/18/the-street-artist-exposing-worlds-dirty-legacy-in-yemen|title=The street artist exposing world's 'dirty legacy' in Yemen|last=Searle|first=Fred|date=2016-04-08|website=The New Arab|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/qa-painting-tribute-victims-yemen-war-150623115228023.html|title=Q&amp;A: Painting tribute to the victims of Yemen's war|last=Hu|first=Zoe|date=2015-06-25|website=Aljazeera|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.good.is/articles/yemens-banksy-uses-street-art-to-fight-sectarian-violence|title=Yemen's Banksy Uses Street Art to Fight Sectarian Violence|last=Feinstein|first=Laura|date=2015-03-23|website=GOOD Magazine|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/murad-subay-the-banksy-of-yemen/32863|title=Murad Subay: The Banksy of Yemen|last=Palet|first=Laura Secorun|date=2014-07-24|website=Ozy|publisher=|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these campaigns spread to other cities such as [[Sana'a]], [[Taiz]], [[Aden]], [[Ibb]] and [[Al Hudaydah|Alhudaydah]] where similar campaigns were launched soon after.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalyemen.com/2015/03/22/graffiti-campaigns-reflect-yemenis-hopes/|title=Graffiti Campaigns Reflect Yemenis' Hopes|last=Al-Arashi|first=Fakhri|date=2015|website=National Yemen|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/page-files/Alles_EP_No34.pdf|title=Voicing  Grievances  and  Hope  through  Art: Yemen's  Youth Empower Themselves|last=Alles|first=Larissa|publisher=|date=April 2015|isbn=|location=University of St. Andrews|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/youth-yemen-graffiti-art-campaigns-criticize-politics.html#|title=Graffiti Gets Political in Yemen|last=al-Absi|first=Mohammad|date=2014-09-12|website=al-Monitor|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Murad Subay was born in [[Dhamar Governorate|Dhamar]], [[Yemen]] on July 3, 1987. He was raised there until the age of 6, before his family moved to live in the capital [[Sana'a]]. He lived in [[Sana'a]] with his mother and six siblings. Murad used to draw at school, but he only became interested in art in the age of 14 when he painted his first sketch and received encouragements from his family. He studied English Literature  from 2007 to  2011 at [[Sana'a University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the spring of 2011, specifically with the start of [[Yemeni Revolution|the peaceful Yemeni revolution]], Murad was one of earliest to join the protestors in their demand of a just, civil state. He used to spend most of his time inside the change square, inspecting the entrants for weapons and joining the peaceful rallies. When the political parties seized control of the course of the revolution, he left the change square disappointed.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yemen-street-artist_us_57193277e4b0d0042da8a374|title=Yemeni Street Artist Covers The Ruins Of War In Color And Memories|last=Alfred|first=Charlotte|last2=|first2=|date=2016-04-22|website=The World Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/7225425/_The_politics_of_painting_in_public_spaces_Yemeni_street_art_as_a_device_for_political_action_presented_at_the_PARGC_Symposium_The_revolutionary_Public_Sphere_Aesthetics_Poetics_and_Politics_University_of_Pennsylvania_Philadelphia_April_9-10_2014|title=The politics of painting in public spaces: Yemeni street art as a device for political action|last=Alviso-Marino|first=Anahi|publisher=|date=April 2014|isbn=|location=Symposium "The Revolutionary Public Sphere: Aesthetics, Poetics &amp; Politics", University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The campaigns==
=== Color The Walls of Your Streets ===
Subay drew his inspiration to launch his first campaign "Color the Walls of Your Street" from the damaged walls of the streets. He went down alone to the streets with his tools on March 15, 2012 to paint contemporary murals on the walls. He then posted a public invitation for people through his Facebook page to join him in painting openly. A week later, many people showed up to paint with him on March 22, 2012. He then invited people every Thursday morning to join him in painting murals openly, and often painted alone in other days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/photoblogs/yemen-color-me-wall|title=Yemen: Color Me a Wall|last=Alwazir|first=Atiaf|date=|website=Al-Akhbar English|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/page-files/Alles_EP_No34.pdf|title=Voicing Grievances and Hope through Art: Yemen's Youth Empower Themselves|last=Alles|first=Larissa|publisher=|date=April 2015|isbn=|location=University of St. Andrews|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This campaign lasted for three months of which artists, passers-by, elders, children, men, women and even soldiers painted alongside him in different areas in [[Sana'a]] city. The idea of this campaign spread between people and similar campaigns were launched soon after in other cities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== The Walls Remember Their Faces ===
Soon after finishing his first campaign, Subay launched his second campaign which marked the transition to political art. He called the campaign "The Walls Remember Their Faces" on September 8, 2012 to highlight the forcibly disappearance of political activists and journalists from the late 1960s and until 2011. He used [[Stencil graffiti|stencil]] technique to paint the faces of the [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]] on the walls of the cities and invited their families and people in general to join him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-disappeared-idUSBRE88O0YG20120925|title=Yemenis paint disappeared activists on Sanaa streets|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|date=2012-09-25|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-08-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/yemeni-street-artist-disappeared-sanaa-walls?CMP=twt_gu|title=Yemeni street artist uses Sana'a walls to remember the disappeared|last=al-Shamahi|first=Abubakr|date=2013-10-31|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For seven months, Subay asked people on different media to supplement him with information around the [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]]. Many families responded to him and provided him with pictures, stories and sometimes belongings of the victims. They also joined in painting their disappeared relatives and friends and they held several protests during the campaign.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2013/street_art_yemen|title=From Street Politics to Street Art in Yemen|last=Alviso-Marino|first=Anahi|date=July 2013|website=Nafas Art Magazine|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the consequences of this campaign were the creation of a special committee to investigate the cases of enforced disappearance, the discussion over the elaboration of a transitional justice law and the UN pressure on the Yemeni government to sign a convention against enforced disappearance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Subay and his friends painted the pictures of 102 [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]] victims in many areas in the cities [[Sana'a]], [[Taiz]], [[Al Hudaydah|Alhudayda]] and [[Ibb]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoriacfontan.com/blog/the-cowards-war-the-artist|title=The Coward's War: the artist|last=Fontan|first=Victoria|date=2014-01-20|website=Victoria C. Fontan|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these murals were defaced by unidentified people; however, this act did not discourage Subay and his friends from making dozens of duplicates across the city.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== 12 Hours ===
On July 4, 2013, Subay launched the third campaign "12 Hours" to discuss 12 political and social issues affecting the Yemeni society and led it off with a mural about spread of weapons. Fellow artists started to join him during the second activity of the campaign which was about [[sectarianism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/art/12th-hour-yemeni-street-art-campaign-surfaces-political-concerns/|title=12th hour graffiti campaign in yemen surfaces political concern|last=|first=|date=2013-08-27|website=Designboom|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a whole year, Subay and fellow artists painted murals about a certain subject each month in the streets of [[Sana'a]] city. The 12 topics they discussed were spread of weapons, [[sectarianism]], kidnappings, tempering with homeland, [[US Drone attacks in Yemen|US drones]], [[Poverty in Yemen|poverty]], [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|civil war]], [[Terrorism in Yemen|terrorism]], [[Military use of children|children recruitment]], [[treason]], [[corruption]] and an open topic in the 12th activity of the campaign.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201308261924-0023002|title=Painting politics in Yemen|last=|first=|date=2013-08-26|website=Al-Jazeera|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/30/yemen-street-art_n_3838742.html|title=12 Hour Graffiti Campaign Addresses Future Of Yemen|date=2013-08-30|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/30/yemens-new-ways-of-protesting-drone-strikes-graffiti-and-poetry|title=Yemen's New Ways of Protesting Drone Strikes: Graffiti and Poetry|last=Root|first=Tik|date=2013-11-30|work=|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-08-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long enough after "12 Hours" campaign ended, unknown actors vandalized some murals discussing different political issues by covering the original murals with white paint or slogans. The vandalized murals belonged to the tenth hour "treason" that mostly discussed USA, Saudi Arabia and Iran's influence and involvement in the mounting conflicts, and the eleventh hour "corruption" that discussed different forms of corruption in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/22825488/The_Affect_of_the_Drone_Strike_Subays_12_Hours_and_the_Environmental_Resistance_of_Street_Art|title=The Affect of the Drone Strike: Subay's 12 Hours and the Environmental Resistance of Street Art|last=Hoyt|first=Kate|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/page-files/Alles_EP_No34.pdf|title=Voicing  Grievances  and  Hope  through  Art: Yemen's Youth Empower Themselves|last=Alles|first=Larissa|publisher=|date=April 2015|isbn=|location=University of St. Andrews|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dawn Sculptures ===
In early 2015, specifically on January 15, 2015, Subay launched a forth campaign that he called "Dawn Sculptures". He led it off with an installation about "Elmuqah", an ancient Yemeni symbol that represents the unity of Yemenis and their state 3000 years ago. Subay was meaning to continue working on this campaign, had it not for the power outages and lack of funding that forced him to postpone the activity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalyemen.com/2015/01/18/artist-murad-subaia-launches-new-campaign/|title=Artist Murad Subai'a Launches New Campaign|last=Al-Arashi|first=Fakhri|date=2015|website=National Yemen|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ruins ===
[[File:Flowers Bouquet Mural.jpg|alt=Flowers Bouquet Mural|thumb|A mural by artist Murad Subay in the first activity of Ruins campaign, painted in Bani Hawat area, Sana'a, on May 18, 2015.]]
After the regional and internal conflicts broke out in [[Yemen]] in 2015, Subay launched the fifth campaign "Ruins" on May 18, 2015, to commemorate the victims of the conflicts and to highlight the catastrophic situation of the country. He often paints in the areas ruined due to the conflicts. Subay painted his first mural in the campaign in an area called "[[Bani Hawat]]" located in the suburbs of [[Sana'a]], where an airstrike killed almost 27 civilians, including 15 children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/afrah-nasser/yemeni-graffiti-artist-ca_b_8742878.html|title=Yemeni Graffiti Artist Capturing War Imprints|last=Nasser|first=Afrah|last2=|date=2015-12-08|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-15|last3=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alyamanalaraby.com/2051|title=بالصور..

His friends began to join him during the second activity of the campaign, in an area called "Faj Attan", a heavily populated area inside the capital [[Sana'a]] where a heavy air strike on a weapons storage facility nearby left behind tens of killed and injured civilians and destroyed the homes of hundreds of people.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-idUSKBN0NB0R820150420|title=Air strike on missile base in Yemen capital kills 25, wounds hundreds|last=Browning|first=Noah|date=2015-04-20|work=|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-08-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spicee.com/fr/program/le-banksy-du-yemen-version-courte-552|title=Le Banksy du Yémen (version courte)|last=Lepetit|first=Sylvain|last2=Fouchet|first2=Julien|date=2015-10-02|website=Spicee|publisher=|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third activity of the campaign, he painted a mural in [[Taiz]] city, a city that is witnessing a great losses due to the internal and regional [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|conflicts in Yemen]]. He  painted the mural in the outer parts of the city because he was banned to go further inside the city by one of the conflict parties.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

For The fourth activity of this campaign, he was planning to paint mural in [[Aden]] city, another city torn by the internal and regional [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|conflicts in Yemen]]. However, because of the dangerous security situation, he could not travel there, so he and his friends painted their murals in Sawan area in [[Sana'a]], yet another area that was targeted by an air strike, leaving tens of killed and injured civilians.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The fifth activity discussed another important issue, and that is limiting the journalistic freedoms. Subay and his friends painted the murals inside the Syndicate of Yemeni Journalists, to highlight the systematic detention of journalists and the violations committed against the journalistic freedoms.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

After that, in the sixth activity of the campaign, they discussed the issue of the siege on [[Yemen]], whether it was placed by the regional conflict parties or the internal ones, limiting the access of food, medicine, water and humanitarian assistance to those who need it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Subay painted the seventh mural in [[London]], where he discussed the ignoring of [[international community]] and media of the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|conflicts in Yemen]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In the eighth activity of "Ruins" campaign, Subay and fellow artists painted about the economy collapse in [[Yemen]]. They painted the murals in front of [[Central Bank of Yemen|Yemen Central Bank]] after the value of [[Yemeni rial|Yemeni Rial]] against the [[United States dollar|US Dollar]] dropped significantly, adding another misfortune to the already impoverished nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2016/07/19/yemen-it%25E2%2580%2599s-economy-stupid|title=Yemen: It's the economy, stupid!|last=Kalfood|first=Mohammed|date=2016-07-19|work=|last2=Slemrod|first2=Annie|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Painting Days ==
Aside from painting in the streets through campaigns that each have a special theme, Subay invited people to paint openly in the streets on the third and forth anniversaries of his first [[street art]] campaign "Color the Wall of Your Street" on March 15.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arabi.assafir.com/Article/4385|title=الفنون المدينية: رسائل على جدران مدن عربية|last=جلّول|first=صباح|date=2016-03-24|website=السفير العربي|publisher=|language=ar-AR|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== March 15, 2015 ===
Through his Facebook page, Subay invited people to paint openly along with him in the streets on the third anniversary of his first [[street art]] campaign "Color the Walls of Your Streets" on March 15, 2015, an event which he called "Humans and Art Day". He invited people to the event to express their love for life, beauty, homeland, and their fear of an expected civil war. They painted on one of the walls of Hadda street in Central [[Sana'a]] city.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== (March 15 – March 17), 2016 ===
Due to the many requests Murad received from people next year, he extended the duration of the open painting day event to become three days instead of one, so that many people could have the chance to join in. Murad chose a wall in front of a police station, and from the first day of the event, soldiers and police officers joined them in painting the walls.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

[[File:Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835.png|380px|thumb|Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835]]

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) that was responsible for trading and colonising of South African land in what is described as “founding” several urban areas like towns and cities in already populated areas of the west of South Africa. The organisation continually changed the boundaries in the [[Cape Colony]] due to European invasion and migration, establishing the Great Fish River as the eastern frontier in 1778.&lt;ref name="Invasion"/&gt;

In colonial times, the Ngqika lands were known as [[British Kaffraria]]. Later the Apartheid government gave them a form of independence as the former "[[Ciskei]]" homeland.

The clan were referred to as “Gaika” people by the Europeans.

==Origins==
=== Birth of a nation ===
{{Main|History of South Africa}}

Ngqika ka Mlawu was the first chief of the Ngqika and the third paramount chief of the [[Rharhabe]] people. He had nine wives. The clan was named after him when his grandfather ([[Rarabe kaPhalo|Rharhabe]], the founder of the tribe) and father (Mlawu, who was to be the next chief) both died in 1782. Ngqika, at only four years old, was too young to rule. Ndlambe (who would eventually establish the [[AmaNdlambe]] people) was Rharhabe’s other son and Ngqika’s uncle who became [[regent]] until the boy matured – in the tradition of the Xhosas. Ndlambe was responsible for the expansion of his tribe’s territory and influence.&lt;ref name="Geni"/&gt; He absorbed smaller clans (like the imiDange people) into the Ngqikas or expelled them to far lands. They were eventually invaded by European settlers from the Cape Colony who fought with them over their prime grazing land, west of the [[Great Kei River]].&lt;ref name="Geni" /&gt;

The occupation by white settlers ([[Dutch Cape Colony|Dutch]] and [[Cape Colony|British]]) resulted in the century of [[Xhosa Wars]] (commonly known as the Frontier Wars) from 1779 to 1879 involving Xhosa tribes (including the Ngqika), [[Khoikhoi]] and [[San people]]. Relations between the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] invaders were fluid throughout this period with the varying indigenous people and Europeans working for or against one another to secure land, resources and cattle. These groups changed allies depending on who would help advance their objectives over the years. In 1793, in collaboration with other Xhosa clans, the Ngqikas fought against white settlers during the Second Frontier War.&lt;ref name="Geni" /&gt;

In 1796, Ngqika turned 18 and was ready to assume his rightful place on the throne, but his uncle was reluctant to give up power. Ndlambe appealed to the tribe to retain his power but this failed. His nephew imprisoned him a year later in an attempt to stifle his power. When he escaped across the Great Fish River in 1799 with his supporters, he attempted to collude with the Cape Colony’s white government to overthrow Ngqika, but the colony continued to recognise his nephew as the paramount chief.&lt;ref name="Geni" /&gt;

Ngqika ka Mlawu died in November 1829 after a chest illness and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name="Family tree"/&gt;

[[File:Mgolombane Sandile - Xhosa Chief.jpg|thumb|left|Mgolombane Sandile - Xhosa Chief]]

=== List of chiefs during Xhosa Wars ===
{{Main|Xhosa Wars}}

Mgolombane Sandile the rightful heir of Ngqika, was only nine years old when his father died. Mnqoma, born to Ngqika and Nomvakalisa Nothontho of the Ngqosini, was the chief’s eldest son but because Sandile’s mother was a descendent of abaThembu (a royal lineage).&lt;ref name="Family tree" /&gt; Her first son was thus considered the “Great Son”. Mnqoma became regent until Sandile was ready to rule. The following is a list of chiefs of the Ngqika that ruled during the [[Xhosa Wars]] starting with Sandile’s great grandfather, Rharhabe:

*Rharhabe: lived 1778 (as the leader of the [[Rharhabe]] people) – 1782, ruled 1796 - 1782
*Ngqika: lived 1778 – 1829, ruled 1796 - 1829
*Mgolombane Sandile: lived 1820 – 1878, ruled 1841 - 1878&lt;ref name="Family tree" /&gt;

The native groups lost most of their land and were absorbed into the British empire during this century. The Xhosa eventually lost access to the fertile land between the [[Great Kei River]] and [[Great Fish River]] to British colonists.&lt;ref name="Amalinde"&gt;[http://www.bctourism.co.za/itemdetail.php?id=566&amp;category=15  2017.

The '''Nyanga language''' (native name ''Kinyanga'') is a language spoken by the [[Nyanga people]] in [[Kivu]] province, north-eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Speaker estimates range from 27,000 (Biebuyck &amp; Matheene 1970) to 150,000 (1994 census). Many of the Nyanga speak [[Congo Swahili]], the dominant regional lingua franca, as a second language. Nyanga is a [[Bantu language]]. Most of the (scarce) linguistic research conducted on Nyanga has been based on the materials published by Biebuyck and Mateene.

Nyanga literature is best known for the tales recorded by Daniel Biebuyck in 1956 and published in 1969 and 1970, including the [[Mwindo epic]]. This epic is titled after the main hero, ''Mwindo'', a miraculously born Pygmy-like human being who possesses not only a magical sceptre but also the power of the word. It centers around Mwindo's travels and encounters during the search for his father.
In other Nyanga tales, the [[dog]] often plays an important role as a mythical animal, reflecting the importance of hunting dogs in Nyanga society.

The '''Putian people''', ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 莆田人, [[pinyin]]: ''Pútiánrén''; [[Puxian Min]]: 莆仙儂, [[Hinghwa Romanized]]: {{lang|cpx|Pó-sing-náng}}) also known as '''Henghua''' or '''Hinghwa''' are [[Han Chinese]] people from [[Putian]], part of [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], [[China]]. They speak [[Puxian Min]], a [[Min Nan|Min language]]. Min is one of the [[Sinitic languages]].

They may also be referred to as ''Xinghua''. Hing Hua district was carved out from [[Quanzhou]] district during the Song dynasty and was given the name HingHua. Putianese people originated from [[Xinyang]] in what is now [[Henan province]] and migrated to the present day area of Putian many centuries ago. Putianese people were said to be mostly in charge of religious affair during that era, and migrated to Fujian after the [[civil war]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

They are referred to as ''Henghua'' in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Overseas: Comparative Cultural Issues |authorlink= Chee Beng Tan |year= |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, there are significantly large Henghua [[diaspora]] communities throughout [[Southeast Asia]], especially in [[Malaysia]] where they can be found in cities such as [[Kuala Terengganu]] and [[Kuching]]. In [[Indonesia]], most Henghua live in [[Java]] and since long have been known for their businesses that mainly related with [[bicycle]] and [[transportation]] vehicles.

The '''Qimant''' language is a highly [[endangered language]] spoken by a small and elderly fraction of the [[Qemant]] people in northern [[Ethiopia]], mainly in the [[Chilga]] [[Districts of Ethiopia|woreda]] in [[Semien Gondar Zone]] between [[Gondar]] and [[Metemma]].

==Classification==
The language belongs to the western branch of the Agaw or [[Central Cushitic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Other (extinct) members of this branch are [[Qwara language|Qwara]] and [[Kayla language|Kayla]]. Along with all other [[Cushitic languages]], Qimant belongs to the [[Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]].

==Geographic distribution and sociolinguistic situation==
Qimant is the original language of the [[Qemant]] people of [[Semien Gondar Zone]] and [[Ethiopia]]. Although the ethnic population of the Qemant was 172,327 at the 1994 census, only a very small fraction of these speak the language nowadays. All speakers live either in [[Chilga]] woreda or in [[Lay Armachiho]] woreda.&lt;ref&gt;see map in Zelealem 2003, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The number of first-language speakers is 1625, the number of second language speakers 3450.&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; All speakers of the language are older than 30 years, and more than 75% are older than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The language is no longer passed on to the next generation of speakers. Most ethnic Qemant people speak [[Amharic language|Amharic]]. Qimant is not spoken in public or even at house as a means of day communication any more, but is reduced to a secret code.&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects/Varieties===

It is not clear to what extent [[Kayla language|Kayla]], [[Qwara language|Qwara]] and Qimant have been dialects of the same Western Agaw language, or were languages distinct from each other.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

[[Continuant]]s can be geminated word-medially.

| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|a}}
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

===Phonotactics===
The maximum [[Syllable#Structure|syllable structure]] in Qimant is CVC, which implies that [[consonant cluster]]s are only allowed word-medially.&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 160f&lt;/ref&gt; In loanwords from Amharic there may also be consonant-clusters within a syllable. Vowel clusters are not allowed.

===Phonological processes===
[[Consonant cluster]]s with more than two consonants are broken up by inserting the [[epenthetic vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. Other phonological processes are [[nasal assimilation]] and [[devoicing]] of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} at word boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 164ff&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosody===
The prosodic features of Qimant have not been studied yet.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
The personal marking system distinguishes between first person singular and plural, second person singular, polite, and plural, and third person masculine, feminine and plural. On the verb, all inflectional categories are marked by suffixes. Zelealem (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;192) identifies three different aspect forms in Qimant: Perfective, Imperfective and Progressive. Like in other [[Central Cushitic languages]], the numbers one to nine go back to an ancient [[quinary]] system, where the suffix {{IPA|/-ta/}} added to the numbers two to four results in the numbers six to nine {{clarify|date=July 2013}} (2-4 are three numbers, 6-9 are four numbers).&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntax&lt;ref&gt;Zelealem 2003, p. 252-262&lt;/ref&gt;===
The basic constituent order in Qimant, like in all other Afro-Asiatic languages of Ethiopia, is SOV. The presence of a [[grammatical case|case]] marking system allows for other, more marked orders. In the [[noun phrase]] the [[phrase|head]] [[noun]] follows its modifiers. Numbers, however, can also follow the head noun. All kind of [[subordinate clause]]s precede the [[main verb]] of the sentence.

==Vocabulary/Lexis==
As a consequence of the looming language death, many items of the vocabulary are already replaced by [[Amharic]] words.

'''Robert Russell Garwood''' (born April 1, 1946) is a controversial former [[Vietnam War]] [[prisoner of war]] (POW). Garwood was a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Private First Class]]&lt;ref name="FOIA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Defense Intelligence Agency |url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Personnel_and_Personnel_Readiness/POW_MIA/659.pdf|title=The Case of Pvt. Robert R. Garwood, USMC |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |date= June 1993 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was captured on September 28, 1965 near [[Da Nang]], [[Quang Nam Province]].

Often cited as the last verified American POW from the Vietnam War, Garwood was taken to [[North Vietnam]] in 1969, and reportedly was released in 1973 along with the other American POWs. The North Vietnam government may have kept him as a POW until June 4, 1975 for propaganda reasons until the war ended. After June 4, 1975 he would have no propaganda value as the United States ceased fighting in the Vietnam combat area.   However, he did not return to the United States until March 22, 1979.&lt;ref name="FOIA"/&gt;

Garwood was judged by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) to have acted as a [[collaboration|collaborator]] with the enemy.&lt;ref name="FOIA" /&gt; In 1998, the DoD changed Garwood's status from RETURNEE to [[AWOL]]/[[Deserter]]/[[Collaborationism|Collaborator]].&lt;ref name="Bio, Garwood, Robert R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/g/g047.htm | title=Bio, Garwood, Robert R |publisher=pownetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garwood has repeatedly denied all charges of collaboration. He also accuses the DoD of trying to rewrite history to make him seem a liar to downplay his 1984 claims about POWs left behind. Garwood's claims were investigated but found to have no factual basis.

==Military service and capture==
Garwood was assigned to the Marine Corps base at Da Nang in the [[Republic of Vietnam]] as a [[Fleet vehicle|motor pool]] driver. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance are in dispute. Garwood claims he was ambushed when he got lost when driving alone in a jeep to pick up an officer. He says his jeep was torched and he was stripped naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3rdmarines.net/Garwood_intro.htm |title=The Case of Robert Garwood PFC 1965 |publisher=3rdmarines.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine Corps records show on 28 September 1965, Garwood was absent at the 2300 bed check. No unauthorized absence (UA) was reported, since he was thought to have had a "late run." He was reported UA when he failed to appear at formation the next morning.&lt;ref name="FOIA" /&gt;

On 29 September, the Division [[Provost Marshal]] was notified of Garwood's absence and an all points bulletin issued for him and his vehicle. This was repeated for three days with no results. Motor pool personnel searched the areas of Da Nang that Garwood was known to frequent, but nothing was found. On 2 October, the division's Provost Marshal notified the Republic of Vietnam's Military Security Services. Their search efforts also produced no information. Garwood's commanding officer reported to the Commandant, USMC, that in view of Garwood's past record of UA, he believed he had gone UA again and had possibly been taken POW. However, he recommended there be no change in Garwood's status and that he remain UA until evidence proved otherwise. 
 
Two separate South Vietnamese agents eventually reported that the [[Viet Cong]] claimed a U.S. serviceman and his jeep had been picked up in the Cam Hai region, about 11.5 miles from the Da Nang Marine Corps base, when the serviceman had become lost. The American had been captured and the jeep burned. However, a ground and aerial search for the burned vehicle produced no results, nor did four platoon search operations on 1 October. Two additional infantry platoons swept the area near [[Marble Mountains (Vietnam)|Marble Mountain]] the next morning but also found nothing. On 12 October, the 704th ITC Det (CI) authorized a 100,000 [[South Vietnamese đồng|VND]] reward for information leading to the recovery of the missing serviceman and additional 2,500 VND for the recovery of the vehicle.

On 3 December 1965, Company I, [[3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines#Search and Destroy Near Da Nang (1965–1966)|3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines]] found a document titled ''Fellow Soldier's Appeal'' with Garwood's name on it, on a gate near Da Nang. The document recommended that U.S. troops stop fighting in Vietnam and return home. The signature (B. Garwood) may well have been made by a rubber stamp and the English usage suggests it was not written by a native English speaker. A second version of this document was found on 18 July 1966 in the Da Nang area, but it appeared to be on better quality paper and the signature was at a different angle. Based on these, on 17 December 1965 Garwood's status was changed from "missing" to "presumed captured".&lt;ref name="FOIA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3rdmarines.net/Garwood_intro.htm |title=The Strange Case of PFC Robert Garwood |publisher=3rdmarines.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 1968, a Marine Corps reconnaissance team named ''Dublin City'' operating in the vicinity of Troui Mountain near [[Phu Bai Combat Base|Phu Bai]] engaged a Viet Cong unit. According to contemporaneous debriefing notes, now declassified, four members of Dublin City reported that the one of the VC fighters was a Caucasian, who was shot during the action and yelled to his VC comrades "Help me!!" in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Commanding Officer J.V. Sullivan, First Force Recon|url=http://media.nara.gov/usmc/014/00000829.pdf |title=Command Chronology, July1968|publisher=First Marine Division, FMF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "white VC" was described as 20–25 years old, with brown hair, 5' 6" tall, "round eyes", and speaking very distinct English. Because they were outnumbered, ''Dublin City'' broke off contact with the enemy but were followed. In a subsequent firefight a few minutes later, PFC C.G. Brown was killed. In September, 2011, 43 years later, President Obama awarded one team-member of ''Dublin City'', James Wilkins, a [[Silver Star]] for heroism on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jody Wynnemer|url=http://www.newrichlandstar.com/jnews/index.php?page=&amp;view=article&amp;id=626:courage-under-fire|title=Courage Under Fire|publisher=The Star Eagle|date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following receipt of the Silver Star, he recalled the white VC incident and stated "Myself and three other Marines looked at about 200 photos of guys who were missing in action. All of us were positive it was Bob Garwood, who apparently had defected and was helping the VC."

==1973-1979==
Garwood is listed either as having volunteered or been forced into a work group repairing a generator at Lien Trai I, one of the [[Yên Bái Province|Yen Bai]] reeducation camps near Hoang Lien San Mountain in northern Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Defense Intelligence Agency |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/pwmia/53/20771.pdf |title=Sighting of Robert Garwood |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports describe him as working at an unnamed "island fortress" in [[Thác Bà Lake]], North Vietnam,&lt;ref name="FOIA"/&gt; or having been kept behind in mainland labor camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Schlatter |url=http://www.miafacts.org/islefort.htm |title=Smith &amp; Garwood, 1993 |publisher=Miafacts.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a driver and vehicle mechanic.&lt;ref name="aiipowmia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter/inantonres3998.html |title=InterNetwork |publisher=Aii Pow-Mia |date=1998-03-08 |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509174926/http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter/inantonres3998.html |archivedate=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court-martial==
Over a period of eleven months, Garwood faced a general [[court-martial]] at [[Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina.  He was found not guilty of desertion, solicitation of U.S. troops in the field to refuse to fight and to defect, and of maltreatment. However, he was convicted on February 5, 1981, of communicating with the enemy, and of the assault on an American prisoner of war interned in a POW camp, in violation of Articles 104 and 128, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. The court-martial sentenced Garwood to reduction to private, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. He was not sentenced to confinement. His conviction was upheld on appeal. ''United States v. Robert R. Garwood'', 16 M.J. 863 (N.C.M.R. 1983), aff'd, 20 M.J. 148 (C.M.A. 1985). Garwood's record of trial covered 16 volumes and 3,833 pages of trial record. As a result, Garwood forfeited all back pay and veterans' benefits.

==Post-war POW claim investigation==
Garwood insists he saw other American prisoners of war after 1973 and insists he himself had been held prisoner for 14 years,&lt;ref name="Bio, Garwood, Robert R"/&gt; though there are inconsistencies in his story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miafacts.org/thachba.htm |title=Thach Ba |publisher=Miafacts.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many former POWs claim to have seen Garwood apparently collaborating with the enemy,&lt;ref name="aiipowmia.com"/&gt; though some feel he should not have been court-martialed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920202,00.html |title=Nation: The Last P.O.W. |publisher=TIME |date=1979-04-09 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992, a U.S. task force examined the sites where Garwood claimed to have seen live U.S. prisoners. They interviewed nearby residents and met with Vietnamese officials. However, the task force reported that "no evidence could be found to suggest that there are, or ever were, any live U.S. POWs" in those areas.&lt;ref name="FOIA" /&gt;

The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), which called Garwood a "[[stay-behind]],"&lt;ref name="FOIA"/&gt; investigated Garwood's claim that he saw live American POWs after 1973 at a "motel-shaped masonry building" in North Vietnam. The DIA reported it could not locate any masonry structures at the indicated location. Senator [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]] requested that the DIA search again. After a second search produced no results, Smith initiated a personal search with [[ABC News]], Garwood, and Bill Hendon. The group traveled to Vietnam in 1993. Following Garwood's directions, they reported they did find a building exactly as Garwood had described it. The Vietnamese government and a former head of the DIA POW/MIA office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Schlatter |url=http://www.miafacts.org/islefort.htm |title=Smith &amp; Garwood, 1993 |publisher=Miafacts.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; angrily disputed the finding, insisting the structure had not existed when Garwood was a POW.

==Media==
===Film===
The made-for-TV film ''The Last P.O.W.? The Bobby Garwood Story,'' starring [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[Martin Sheen]], was released in 1992. Garwood, played by Macchio, was a consultant on the film. The film's [[Film producer|producers]] claimed that Garwood had received orders to survive from another higher ranking POW. However, there is no substantiation for this claim.

Garwood was also interviewed in 2006 by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3890677/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Sean Clifford] for a [[Yale University]] [[senior thesis]] project. The project involved a [[documentary film]] component and Garwood participated in more than eight hours of videotaped interviews. The film included interviews with Garwood's [[court-martial]] attorney, Vaughan Taylor, and fellow former POW David Harker. The interviews with Garwood were the first in more than a decade and they represented his most complete account to date of the events surrounding his capture and eventual return to the United States.

===Books===
*''BOHICA : Operation Grand Eagle-Official USA/ISA POW/MIA Rescue Mission Gone Awry,'' published 1987 written by Scott T. Barnes, Mission Specialist. Debriefing of Robert Garwood in 1986 with LTG Tighe Jr-DIA.

Colonel McKenny's commando teams to kill Garwood in a North Vietnamese jungle camp for allegedly collaborating with the enemy. It then tells of McKenney's conversion from a would-be assassin into someone who now believes in Garwood's innocence.
*''Why Didn't You Get Me Out?'' published 1997, written by [[Frank Anton]] with Tommy Denton, gives a detailed account of Frank's five years as a POW. He offers extensive eye-witness accounts of Garwood and his collaboration with the NVA, claiming he even saw Garwood using a rifle to guard American POWs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">The use of a '''royal motto''' ({{lang-da|valgsprog}}) is an old tradition among [[Denmark|Danish]] monarchs, dating back at least 500 years. The use of such a motto was a way for a monarch to emphasize values or beliefs he / she held dear. In earlier times, these mottos were often shown on Danish coinage, often in a [[Latin]] form.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Royal mottos'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Gold diggers ==
On 24 October 2006, their reserve in Venezuela was invaded by miners who destroyed some of their villages. In retaliation the Venezuelan army killed 10 miners. This incident led to mass protests by non-Indians in Southern Venezuela.

[[Image:Secret-swing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The '''Secret Swing''' replacement]]
[[Image:Sophie on the secret swing.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Secret Swing from the alley]]
'''''Swingsite''''' was an [[Installation art|art installation]] that consisted of a [[Swing (seat)|playground swing]] hanging in the narrow space between two buildings in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The swing was accessed by way of the alley behind [[Queen Street West]], which is known as one of Toronto’s best graffiti galleries. Toronto artist [[Corwyn Lund]] erected the swing in September 2003 as part of a group show called 'Psychotopes' at YYZ Artists Outlet.

Nicknamed the Secret Swing, its location became more widely known when Toronto [[wikt:Blogger|blogger]]s began posting pictures of it online and a number of articles appeared in local newspapers. It has since become a [[cult following|cult icon]] among street artists and the youth of Toronto.  It was located in the alley behind the store fronts on the south side of Queen Street, about a block west of [[Spadina Avenue]].

In November, 2005, the swing's seat and 2 feet of the swing's chains were removed. This was supposedly the work of [[vandal]]s. Two people named Vince and Kai replaced it on December 13 of the same year. The new swing seat bore a date, signatures, and has writing on it: “The Secret Swing belongs to the people of Toronto.”

The swing installation came to an end in March 2006 when both the swing and the bar holding it up were removed and a fence installed to block the entrance to the space where the swing was installed. This may have been done to thwart any future attempts to replace the swing, as well as deter homeless people from sleeping in the space between buildings.

The '''Serious Fraud Office''' ('''SFO''') is a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] that investigates and prosecutes serious or complex [[fraud]] and [[corruption]] in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The SFO is accountable to the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], and was established by the Criminal Justice Act 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/38 Criminal Justice Act 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 grants the SFO special compulsory powers to require any person (or business/bank) to provide any relevant documents (including confidential ones) and answer any relevant questions including ones about confidential matters. The SFO is the principal enforcer of the [[Bribery Act 2010]], which has been designed to encourage good corporate governance and enhance the reputation of the [[City of London]] and the UK as a safe place to do business. Its jurisdiction does not extend to [[Scotland]] where fraud and corruption are investigated by [[Police Scotland]] through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]].

==History==
===Formation of the unit===
During the 1970s and early 1980s a series of financial scandals in the City of London destroyed the public's trust in the way serious or complex frauds were handled. In response to this the Government established the Fraud Trials Committee in 1983. This independent committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Roskill, considered how changes to the law and criminal proceedings could lead to more effective ways of fighting fraud. The committee report, commonly known as 'the Roskill Report'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfo.gov.uk/about-us/our-views/sfo-blog/the-roskill-report-25-years-on.aspx The Roskill Report 25 years on] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119225833/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/about-us/our-views/sfo-blog/the-roskill-report-25-years-on.aspx |date=19 January 2012 }} SFO blog 13 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1986. Its main recommendation was to set up a new, unified organisation responsible for detecting, investigating and prosecuting serious fraud cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfo.gov.uk/publications/corporate-information/sfo-historical-background-powers/|title=SFO historical background and powers|website=Serious Fraud Office|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and its unique powers were created by the Criminal Justice Act 1987. It opened for business in April 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/about-us/history--legislation/section-2--and-legislative-tools.aspx |title=Section 2 and legislative tools |publisher=Sfo.gov.uk |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509044757/http://sfo.gov.uk/about-us/history--legislation/section-2--and-legislative-tools.aspx |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFO also enforces the UK Bribery Act 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfo.gov.uk/publications/guidance-policy-and-protocols/bribery-act-guidance/|title=Bribery Act guidance|website=Serious Fraud Office|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Yamamah investigation===
The [[Al-Yamamah arms deal]] during the 1980s was a large scale aircraft and weapons deal between the UK and [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was extended throughout the 1990s and saw thousands of UK citizens living and working in Saudi Arabia representing £40bn worth of business. BAE Systems Plc was the primary contractor.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A: The BAE-Saudi allegations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6729489.stm|title=Business - Q&amp;: The BAE-Saudi allegations|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the SFO began to investigate the contracts within the al-Yamamah deal on the grounds of suspected false accounting, but the investigation was controversially dropped in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2004/investigation-into-service-contracts-with-bae.aspx|title=Page not found|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926140918/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2004/investigation-into-service-contracts-with-bae.aspx|archivedate=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made following concerns about national security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61214-0014.htm|title=Lords Hansard text for 14 Dec 200614 Dec 2006 (pt 0014)|publisher=Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2006/bae-systems-plcsaudi-arabia.aspx BAE Systems Plc/Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121249/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2006/bae-systems-plcsaudi-arabia.aspx |date=2 April 2012 }} SFO 14 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; amidst reports that the Saudi Government would stop sharing counterterrorist information with the UK if the investigation continued.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A: The BAE-Saudi allegations"/&gt; This drew criticism from number of sources, not least from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/15/freedomofinformation.saudiarabia|title=OECD rebukes Britain for dropping Saudi arms deal bribery inquiry|author=Rob Evans|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[High Court]] review in 2008 ruled that the SFO had acted unlawfully by dropping the corruption investigation&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7339231.stm UK wrong to halt Saudi arms probe] SFO 10 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but was later overturned on appeal by the SFO to the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fraud-office-wins-appeal-over-bae-saudi-arms-deal-880665.html|title=Fraud office wins appeal over BAE Saudi arms deal|website=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to New York===
In 2008, an official internal "Review of the Serious Fraud Office", which was conducted by a former senior New York City prosecutor, compared the SFO unfavourably with two of its counterparts in [[New York City]]: the offices of the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] and the [[New York County District Attorney]]. It found that the American prosecutors obtained higher conviction rates in a shorter amount of time with fewer resources.&lt;ref name="degrazia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/press-release-archive/press-releases-2008/sfo-press-statement-re-review-of-the-serious-fraud-office-by-jessica-de-grazia.aspx|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20130423052401/http://www.sfo.gov.uk//press-room/press-release-archive/press-releases-2008/sfo-press-statement-re-review-of-the-serious-fraud-office-by-jessica-de-grazia.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 April 2013|title=SFO press statement re Review of the Serious Fraud Office by Jessica de Grazia|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the SFO had significantly lower conviction rates than elite divisions of the UK [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref name="degrazia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Crime in the 21st Century: Law and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iRP4el9yPcUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Ryder|first=Nicholas|publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]]|pages=128–9|date=2011|isbn=9780857931832}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attributed the SFO's relatively poor performance to, among other things, failure to keep all court advocacy "in-house", failure to assign each case a single lawyer who managed it "from cradle to grave", failure to interview witnesses at an early stage, and failure to co-operate closely with the police.&lt;ref name="degrazia" /&gt;

===2010s===
While [[Home Secretary]], [[Theresa May]] expressed that she wanted the [[National Crime Agency]] (NCA) to absorb the SFO. While the SFO is supervised by the [[Attorney General's Office (United Kingdom)|Attorney General’s Office]], the NCA is overseen by [[Home Office]]. From around 2005 to 2017, the SFO underwent a series of budget cuts. On May 18, 2017, the [[Tories]] released a [[manifesto]] pledging to dismantle the Serious Fraud Office and roll it into the NCA if they won the general elections in June 2017. The manifesto claimed that the incorporation would "strengthen Britain’s response to white collar crime by... improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime."&lt;ref name=ft-manifesto&gt;{{cite news |last=Binham |first=Caroline |last2=Croft |first2=Jane|date=May 18, 2017 |title=Tories pledge to abolish Serious Fraud Office – manifesto |url=https://www.ft.com/content/43a14e59-96f5-3e95-89c3-792906e2440a | work=[[Financial Times]] |location=United Kingdom  |access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
===Guinness share-trading fraud===
{{main|Guinness share-trading fraud}}
In 1986 there were rumours that the [[Guinness Brewery]] takeover of the [[Distillers Company]] was tainted by an unlawful share support operation which involved Guinness offering secret indemnities (from its own funds) against losses to people ‘supporting’ the bid which resulted in a dramatic rise in the price of Guinness shares.

Having examined the bid, the SFO opened an investigation which led to the conviction in 1990 of the then chief executive of Guinness and three other defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/our-work/our-cases/historic-cases/the-guinness-case.aspx |title=The Guinness case |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015055333/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/our-work/our-cases/historic-cases/the-guinness-case.aspx |archivedate=15 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BAE Systems weapons sales to Saudi Arabia===
{{main|Al-Yamamah arms deal}}
Al Yamamah is the name of a series of a record arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. In 2006, An investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office into the deal was discontinued after political pressure from the Saudi and British governments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/court-condemns-blair-for-halting-saudi-arms-inquiry-807793.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===BAE Systems radar sale to Tanzania===
{{see also|BAE Systems#Corruption investigations}}
In 1999 [[BAE Systems|British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd]] agreed a contract with the Government of [[Tanzania]] for the supply of a radar defence system. A local businessman in Tanzania was recruited to advise BAE on its negotiations with the Government on the radar contract.

Between January 2000 and December 2005 around [[United States dollar|$]]12.4 million was paid to the local businessman's two companies. BAE has accepted that there was a high probability that part of this sum would be used to favour it in the contract negotiations with the Tanzanian Government.

The payments were not subject to proper and adequate scrutiny or review and BAE Systems Plc was subsequently fined £500,000 after admitting that it had failed to keep adequate accounting records of the defence contract with the Government of Tanzania. This outcome followed a settlement by BAE, as part of a global agreement reached in 2010 with the Serious Fraud Office and the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]], concerning contracts in a number of countries. The settlement with the SFO relates to the Tanzanian contract.  The terms of the settlement include an agreement by BAE to pay an ''[[ex-gratia]]'' sum (£30 million less any fine imposed by the Crown Court) for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. BAE was also ordered to pay [[Pound sterling|£]]225,000 costs to the SFO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/bae-fined-in-tanzania-defence-contract-case.aspx|title=BAE fined in Tanzania defence contract case|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726000049/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/bae-fined-in-tanzania-defence-contract-case.aspx|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barclays emergency fundraising=== 
In June 2017, [[John Varley (banker)|John Varley]], Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath were charged with offences regarding [[Barclays]]'s raising of £11.8 billion in emergency funds. The fraud was alleged to have taken place around the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Treanor |first=Jill |date=June 20, 2017 |title=Senior Barclays bankers charged with fraud over credit crunch fundraising |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/sfo-charges-barclays-bank-executives-ceo-2008-qatar-fundraising#img-1 | work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, the United Kingdom |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbas Gokal &amp; the BCCI===
{{main|Abbas Gokal}}
The [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI Bank]] was a [[Luxembourg]]-registered bank that collapsed in 1992. It was discovered by the bank's auditors, that the bank was running on loss for many years. It was reported that the bank was involved in drug-trafficking, money-laundering and phony loans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/07/28/bcci-scandal-behind-the-bank-of-crooks-and-criminals/563f2216-1180-4094-a13d-fd4955d59435/?utm_term=.1579c693c948&lt;/ref&gt; The key player in the collapse was [[Pakistani]] shipping magnate [[Abbas Gokal]]. It was discovered that [[Abbas Gokal|Gokal's]] company, Gulf Shipping Lines, had gotten a US$1.2 billion unsecured loan from the bank. When the bank collapsed and the scandal emerged, [[Abbas Gokal|Gokal]] escaped to [[Pakistan]]. It was hard to get him because the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Pakistan]] had no extradition treaty. [[Abbas Gokal|Gokal]] was making a trip to America in 1994. When his plane stopped for re-fueling in [[Frankfurt]], [[Federal Police (Germany)|German police]] arrested him and extradited him to the [[United Kingdom]]. He was handed a 14-year sentence as a result of the SFO prosecution, the longest sentence handed out in a British court for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/behind-the-collapse-of-a-behemoth-1265124.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/12bn-bcci-fraudster-faces-17-years-1265123.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As one of the Law Officers' Departments, the SFO reports to the Attorney General of the UK.&lt;ref name=ft-manifesto/&gt; The SFO is unique in that its role is to both investigate and prosecute. Its case teams are therefore made up of [[Detective|investigators]], [[lawyers]], [[law clerks]] and forensic accountants.&lt;ref name="The SFO's performance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/our-work/our-performance.aspx |title=The SFO's performance |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118074620/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/our-work/our-performance.aspx |archivedate=18 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFO employs around 500 people.

==Activities and responsibilities==
The SFO is a specialist organisation that investigates only the most serious types of economic crime.  As a result, a potential case must meet certain criteria before it is taken on.  In deciding, the Director will take into account all the circumstances of the case and consider:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/sfo-confidential---giving-us-information-in-confidence/serious-fraud-office-sfo-case-selection.aspx|title=Page not found|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073322/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/sfo-confidential---giving-us-information-in-confidence/serious-fraud-office-sfo-case-selection.aspx|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* cases which undermine UK commercial/financial PLC in general and the City of London in particular;
* cases where the actual or potential loss involved are high;
* cases where actual or potential harm is significant;
* cases where there is a very significant public interest element; and
* new species of fraud

The Serious Fraud Office's jurisdiction does not extend to [[Scotland]] where fraud and corruption are investigated by [[Police Scotland]] through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]].&lt;ref name="fraudfacts_17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stocker|first=Tom|last2=Bolton|first2=Barbara|date=March 2014|title=Fraud in Scotland|url=https://www.fraudadvisorypanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fraud-Facts-17B-Fraud-in-Scotland-Revised-March14.pdf|journal=Fraud Facts|series=|edition=3rd|volume=|issue=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud===
The SFO investigates and prosecutes [[fraud]]. The SFO prosecutes different types of fraud, including [[investment fraud]]. Among the types of investment fraud prosecuted are [[Boiler room (business)|boiler room]] fraud ([[share scam]]s), which is an operation, usually run from abroad, where scammers typically cold-call people and use hard-sell tactics to sell shares that prove worthless, are inflated in price, or don't exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/investment-fraud/share-scams-(boiler-roomfraud).aspx |title=Share scams (boiler room fraud) |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006004650/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/investment-fraud/share-scams-(boiler-roomfraud).aspx |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFO cites Vintage Wines of St Albans as an example of a successful boiler room fraud prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2008/vintage-wines-of-st-albans--four-sentenced.aspx|title=Page not found|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121036/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2008/vintage-wines-of-st-albans--four-sentenced.aspx|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFO also prosecutes the investment schemes called [[Ponzi scheme|'Ponzi']] or [[pyramid scheme]]s, which typically involves an investment offer which promises to provide an abnormally higher rate of return. In a Ponzi scheme, a single operator benefits, while in a pyramid scheme, many investors benefit from recruiting other investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/investment-fraud/other-investment-fraud.aspx |title=Other types of investment fraud |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314144222/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/investment-fraud/other-investment-fraud.aspx |archivedate=14 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFO has cited the KF  Concept case as an example of one of its successful ponzi scheme prosecutions, where a banker was jailed for 10 years for running an unauthorized investment business and defrauding investors of amounts over £17 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/ponzi-schemer-jailed-for-ten-years.aspx|title=Page not found|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121049/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/ponzi-schemer-jailed-for-ten-years.aspx|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFO also prosecutes multiple types of [[corporate fraud]]. The SFO website as of 2013 outlined several types of fraud it classified as corporate, including [[asset stripping]], which involved company directors taking company funds or assets of value while leaving behind the debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |title=Asset stripping |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030194421/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of persecuted corporate fraud include [[fraudulent trading]], where a company carries on a business for any fraudulent purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/fraudulent-trading.aspx|title=Fraudulent trading|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121059/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/fraudulent-trading.aspx|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a successful SFO prosecution for fraudulent trading is the [[InterGB]] group, the collective name for a number of companies that, between 1996 and 2000, extracted more than £85 million from three financial institutions by submitting false invoices. The chairman of the group was jailed for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/press-release-archive/press-releases-2007/four-jailed-over-multi-million-pound-fraud.aspx |title=Fraudulent trading |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072202/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/press-release-archive/press-releases-2007/four-jailed-over-multi-million-pound-fraud.aspx |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also persecuted are [[share ramping]]. Also known as 'pump and dump' or 'book ramping', is where criminals influence the share price of a company and then take advantage of the price fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/share-ramping.aspx |title=Share ramping |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405203617/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/share-ramping.aspx |archivedate=5 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishing false information]] is also persecuted as corporate crime. According to the SFO, this is usually done to mislead investors and creditors and to keep a failing company trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/publishing-false-information.aspx |title=Publishing false information |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703111055/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/publishing-false-information.aspx |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery and corruption===
According to the SFO, corruption is where the integrity of a person, Government, or company is manipulated and compromised for personal gain. SFO classifies and prosecutes two main types of corruption. It defines [[political corruption]] as the dysfunction of a political system or institution in which government officials, political officials or employees look for illegitimate personal gain through actions such as bribery, extortion, cronyism, patronage and embezzlement. It defines [[corporate corruption]] as where, for example, bribes are offered to agencies/ institutions/individuals in order to win a contract.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It brought up [[Innospec]] Limited, manufacturers of a fuel additive, as an example of a successful prosecution for corporate corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/innospec-limited-prosecuted-for-corruption-by-the-sfo.aspx|title=Page not found|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906081638/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/innospec-limited-prosecuted-for-corruption-by-the-sfo.aspx|archivedate=6 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overseas assistance===
The SFO has a dedicated International Assistance team which regularly assists law enforcement agencies worldwide with their investigations. In 2010–11 the SFO assisted over 30 different jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="The SFO's performance" /&gt;

===Victim support===
According to the SFO, victims are at the core of its strategy. They include any person, organisation, or Government both in the UK and abroad, which has suffered direct financial loss from the most serious and complex fraud, or corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/about-us/our-policies-and-publications/our-commitment-to-you.aspx |title=SFO commitment to victims |publisher=Serious Fraud Office |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502065731/http://sfo.gov.uk/about-us/our-policies-and-publications/our-commitment-to-you.aspx |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFO tries to get justice for victims by recovering as much recompense as possible for victims. In April 2011, £64 million of funds were, or were due to be returned to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fHo2DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=64m#v=snippet&amp;q=64m&amp;f=false|title=The Financial Crisis and White Collar Crime - Legislative and Policy Responses: A Critical Assessment|last=Ryder|first=Nicholas|last2=Turksen|first2=Umut|last3=Tucker|first3=Jon|date=2017-09-19|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317311737|location=|pages=|at=13.1.2.1 Fraud|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average jail sentence handed out in SFO cases was 56 months in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|title=The Work of the Serious Fraud Office|date=13  February  2013|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmjust/740/m1.htm|last=Justice Committee|work=Commons Select Committee Publications|access-date=14 October 2018|first=|volume=|pages=|at=Written evidence from the Serious Fraud Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2011 three fraudsters running the online [[Xclusive]] ticket fraud (that failed to deliver tickets to the Beijing Olympics and various music festivals) each received prison sentences of up to eight years.  The SFO started confiscation proceedings to recover money for victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2011/three-jailed-for-on-line-olympic-ticket-fraud.aspx|title=Page not found|publisher=Serious Fraud Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926104456/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2011/three-jailed-for-on-line-olympic-ticket-fraud.aspx|archivedate=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seychellois Creole people''' are residents who are native to [[Seychelles]], irrespective of ancestry.&lt;ref name="chaudenson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Chaudenson |title=Creolization of Language and Culture |isbn=978-0-203-44029-2|publisher=CRC press |page=11 |year=2001(of translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the people living in the Seychelles are referred to as [[creole people|creole]]. They are mainly of East African and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] origin. However, some  are also of mixed East African, Malagasy, Indian, Chinese and French origins.

==Origins==
Originally, Africans and Austronesian people migrated to Seychelles to work on sugar and coffee plantations. Some were slaves that last to be introduced to the [[Indian Ocean]]. Their origins lie in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent, [[Madagascar]].

==Distribution==
Today, Creoles are dispersed throughout Seychelles. They number roughly 76,000, which is more than 70% of the entire Seychellois population. Creoles are the dominant group in politics.

The Seychellois music genre of [[Sega music|Sega]] is known as ''Moutia''.

Seychellois Creoles are proud of their [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] heritage and set up a Creole institute in [[Mahé, Puducherry|Mahé]] to help promote their culture and to help others understand it. Unlike Mauritius, where Creole has no official status, the Seychelles have made Creole one of their three official languages, along with French and English.

==Demographical factors==
Like most of the country's population, the majority of the Creoles identify as [[Christian|Christians]]. Most of them are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], with [[Protestant]], [[Anglican]], [[Adventism|Adventist]] and other [[Christian denomination|Christian denominations]] in the minority. The remainder of the population are either Hindu or Islamic. [[Seychellois Creole]] is the commonly spoken language, but French and English are also widely understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7746">'''Johnny Robinson''' (1947–1963) was a young [[African Americans|African-American]] man who, at age 16, was shot and killed by a police officer in the unrest following the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|16th Street Church Bombing]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Robinson and several others were allegedly throwing rocks at a car draped with a [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]]. A Birmingham police officer, Jack Parker, who was riding in the back seat of a police car, shot and killed Robinson. Parker was never indicted for the killing and claimed that he had only fired a warning shot, and that a stray pellet must have killed Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eskew|first1=Glenn T|title=But for Birmingham: The Local and National Movements in the Civil Rights Struggle|date=1997|publisher=the University of North carolina Press|pages=320–321|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and early years== 
Johnny Robinson was born in 1947 and had a difficult upbringing in Birmingham, as the city had seen 50 racially driven bombings from 1945 to 1963. He was the oldest of three children and attended the [[Alberta Shields School]]. A few years prior to his death, Robinson's father was murdered by a neighbor, leaving his mother alone to raise her children in a city fraught with racial violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/johnny-robinson-21443815|title=Johnny Robinson|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson had juvenile record. At 13 years old he was arrested on suspicion of [[burglary]] and [[grand larceny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129856740|title=Johnny's Death: The Untold Tragedy In Birmingham|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
{{see also|16th Street Baptist Church bombing}}
Early on Sunday morning, September 15, 1963, a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member placed a bomb with a timing device under the side steps of the [[16th Street Baptist Church]], which had served as the headquarters for the [[Children's Crusade (1963)|Birmingham Children's Crusade]] during April and early May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/news/black-history-birmingham-childrens-crusade-1963-video|title=The Birmingham Children's Crusade of 1963|work=Biography.com|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hundred worshipers were expected in the church that day and after the bomb detonated in the late morning, three 14-year-old girls and an 11-year-old girl were found killed, with twenty-two wounded. The incident prompted civil unrest that was further provoked by the shooting deaths of two young black men that day: 16-year-old Johnny Robinson, and 13-year-old Virgil Ware.

Ware had been riding on the handlebars of his brother's bicycle when he was shot twice with a revolver by Larry Joe Sims, a white 16-year-old who supported the segregationist movement. Earlier that day, Sims had joined a fellow teenager, Michael Lee Farley, at the headquarters for the [[National States' Rights Party]] and set out to cruise the neighborhood together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9p6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=National+States'+Rights+Party+sims&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZQT28h5KbS&amp;sig=H9qZfs7yf3E2VT0qBjLFjT5ohqM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf4Jyy2fTTAhVP3GMKHe6uDEMQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20States'%20Rights%20Party%20sims&amp;f=false|title=Unsolved Civil Rights Murder Cases, 1934–1970|last=Newton|first=Michael|date=2016-01-08|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9781476623627|location=|pages=50|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sims was later charged with [[Murder|first-degree murder]] but was convicted of [[Manslaughter (United States law)|second-degree manslaughter]], while Farley pled guilty to second-degree manslaughter. Both teens were sentenced to seven months in jail, which was changed to two years probation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{relevance inline|date=September 2017}}

Robinson was about to join his sister for [[Sunday dinner]], but had accompanied his friends to a gas station that was not far from the 16th Street Baptist Church. Several [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] men drove by, yelling racial slurs, waving Confederate flags, and throwing bottles. Robinson and his friends allegedly retaliated by throwing rocks at the cars. A police car then arrived on the scene; a police officer named Jack Parker was in the back seat, pointing a shotgun out the window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny's Death: The Untold Tragedy In Birmingham|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129856740|website=NPR.org|accessdate=27 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker later gave two differing accounts of the event, as he both claimed to have fired a [[warning shot]] and that the gun went off accidentally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/johnny-robinson-21443815|title=Johnny Robinson|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses claimed to have heard two shots.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Parker was white, as were all Birmingham Police officers at that time.&lt;ref&gt;"New Bomb Blast Hits Birmingham". The Miami News. 1963-09-25.&lt;/ref&gt; He had joined the police force in 1951 and was 48 years old when he shot Robinson. At the time he was also the head of a [[Fraternal Order of Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dividing Lines: Municipal Politics and the Struggle for Civil Rights in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma|last=Thronton|first=J|publisher=University of Alabama Press, 2002|year=|isbn=081731170X|location=|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

After a week of funerals related to the bombing, co-founder of the [[Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights]] Nelson Smith remarked that their people would be hard to restrain when they were still under active threat of bombings.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XC7DlNowvSkC&amp;pg=PA346|title=Dividing Lines: Municipal Politics and the Struggle for Civil Rights in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma|last=Thornton|first=J.

Two grand juries refused to indict Parker, claiming that there were no reliable witness accounts. Not long after the shooting, he signed a newspaper advertisement advocating against integrating the police department of Birmingham. He resigned 10&amp;nbsp;years after the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Student Voice. 1960-1965|date=1990|page=212|edition=Clayborne Carson|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/officer-jack-parker-deceased-birmingham-police-dept-birmingham-alabama-subject|title=Johnnie Robinson - Notice to Close File {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timothy Hughes newspaper|url=http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/604242|website=Rare and Early News|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A family tent would be made of ten or more ''ugjuit''.

==Fabrication and use==
After the bearded seal is killed, its fat is scraped off, then the skin is stretched to dry. Finally, women will sew it together to make a tent.

The tupiq was used on the land not on the sea ice. It was portable for travel and lasted several years. When stored over the winter, the tupiq had to be kept away from dogs. In the summer the tupiq was used as shelter, then in the fall when it got colder, the Inuit moved into [[sod house]]s (''qammaq'') and the tupiq was used for the roof. In winter, the Inuit lived in ''[[igloo|igluit]]'' when the snow was good enough to build them. Then in the spring when the iglu melted, they moved back into the tupiq.

The tupiq was important traditionally, but is rarely used in modern times. Today most Inuit use canvas tents called ''tupikhaq''.&lt;ref name=inudict/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

A '''turncoat''' is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another, betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party. In political and social history, this is distinct from being a [[traitor]], as the switch mostly takes place under the following circumstances:
*In groups, often driven by one or more leaders.
*When the goal that formerly motivated and benefited the person becomes (or is perceived as having become) either [[Unwinnable|no longer feasible]] or [[Pyrrhic victory|too costly even if success is achieved]].

From a military perspective, opposing armies generally wear uniforms of contrasting colors to prevent incidents of [[Friendly fire]].  Thus the term "turn-coat" indicates that an individual has changed sides and his uniform coat to one matching the color of his former enemy.  For example, in the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century, [[Oliver Cromwell's]] soldiers turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the Royal army (see '''Examples''' below).

==Historical context==
Even in a modern historical context "turncoat" is often synonymous with the term "[[wikt:renegade|renegade]]", a term of religious origins having its origins in the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''"renegare"'' (to deny). Historical currents of great magnitude have periodically caught masses of people, along with their leaders, in their wake. In such a dire situation new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal treason becomes muddled. One example would be the situation that led to the [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'', signed on July 26, 1581 in the Netherlands, an instance where changing sides was given a positive meaning.

The first written use of the term meaning  was by J. Foxe in ''Actes &amp; Monumentes'' in 1570: "One who changes his principles or party; a renegade; an apostate." Cited 1571*&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] "turncoat, n. and adj." cites "John Foxe · The first volume of the ecclesiasticall history contaynyng the actes and monumentes of thynges passed..in this realme · Rev. ed., 1570 (2 vols.)."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Turncoat" could also have a more literal origin. According to the Rotuli Chartarum 1199–1216 two barons changed fealty from [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]],&lt;ref&gt;David Crouch. 2002. William Marshal. Knighthood, War and Chivalry, 1147–1219. Longman. London&lt;/ref&gt; to [[John, King of England|King John]]. In other words, they turned their coats (of arms) from one lord to another, hence turncoat.

==Process==
A mass-shift in allegiance by a population may take place during [[military occupation]], after a nation has been defeated in [[war]] or after a major social upheaval, such as a [[revolution]]. Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the area in question quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system. This shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one. In the face of fear and insecurity, the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival.

Often the leaders are the first to change loyalties, for they have had access to [[Secrecy (sociology)|privileged information]] and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in [[dictatorships]] and [[authoritarian]] states when most of the population has been fed [[propaganda]] and [[triumphalism]] and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.

==Aftermath==
As time goes by, along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of [[Deception|burying and rewriting]] the past by [[Cover-up|concealing evidence]]. The fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat. The past is rewritten and [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashed]] to cover former deeds. When successful, this activity results in the distortion and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|falsification]] of historical events.

Even after the death of a turncoat his family and friends may wish to keep uncomfortable secrets from the past out of the light. There is a fear of loss of prestige as well as a wish to honor the memory of a family member from the part of those who have experienced the positive side of the person.

In certain countries, individuals and organizations have actively investigated the past to bring turncoats to justice to face their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html Jean-Paul Cointet, ''Epuration légale: 400 000 dossiers, moins de 800 morts''; Historia (fr)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910175241/http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/693/69306801.html |date=2004-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
There were many turncoats in:

*The [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century.  The siege of [[Corfe Castle]] was won by [[Oliver Cromwell's]] soldiers when they turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the Royal army.&lt;ref&gt;[S03E10 Great British Railway Journeys]&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the revolution of the British American colonies when U.S. Continental Army Major General [[Benedict Arnold]] defected to the side of the British in May 1779.
*Canada during the [[War of 1812]]. Some Canadians felt [[republican democracy]] was a better system of government than the [[British Monarchy]] and fought on the side of the invading Americans. Conversely the [[United Empire Loyalists]] left what was to be the United States and moved North to remain under British rule.
*Germany and Austria after World War II when many former enthusiastic members of the [[Nazi Party]] embraced the newly created nations of [[West Germany]] or [[East Germany]] and sought to erase or at least minimize their former role as Nazis. During the  decades that followed many former Nazis regained prestige and held high posts in the new republics. [[Kurt Waldheim]], an Austrian Nazi, even held the highest post at the [[UN]] for a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1934744.ece ''Kurt Waldheim, Austrian head of the UN who as president of his country was later tainted by charges of complicity in Nazi atrocities'', Timesonline&lt;/ref&gt;
*France after the downfall of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], when many [[collaborationists]], whether home-grown [[fascists]] or Nazi sympathizers, played down their role in the former government and its institutions.
*Iran after the overthrow of the last [[Shah]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s regime. At that time many persons who had formerly led a life based on [[secular]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] values and who had fervently supported the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iranian monarchy]] suddenly embraced the stern religious values imposed by Ayatollah [[Khomeini]]'s regime with unbridled fervor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realtruth.org/articles/071108-001-middle.html|title=Iran…The Untold Story – Desire for Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Russia and the former [[Warsaw Pact|Communist Eastern European countries]] after the fall of the [[USSR]], where many former [[CPSU|communists]] suddenly became fervent [[supporters]] of [[capitalism]]. As a result, many former [[apparatchik]]s abandoned the [[Communist Party]] in favor of positions in the new government structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VGF-3V72R71-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp; md5=eb40bafdd6bb71ad4ba378a73be2eb27 Daniel F.

'''Ukrainian Red Cross Society''' ({{lang-uk|Товариство Червоного Хреста України, Tovarystvo Chervonoho Khresta Ukrayiny}}) is a [[non-profit]] humanitarian and charitable association of [[Ukraine]]. It operates in disaster management, health and care, [[Restoring Family Links|tracing]] service,&lt;ref&gt;''Searching for Lost Relatives, General information, Consulate General of Ukraine in San Francisco''&lt;/ref&gt; youth activities/volunteers, protection of human dignity.

==Early history==
The Ukrainian Red Cross Society was established on April 17-18, 1918 in [[Kiev]] as an independent humanitarian society of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Its immediate tasks were to help [[refugees]] and prisoners of war, care of handicapped people, [[orphan]]ed children, fighting famine and epidemics, support and organize sick quarters, [[hospital]]s and public canteens.

From the 1920s, when Ukrainian territory was integrated part of the Soviet Union, and until 1992, the Ukrainian Red Cross functioned as a part of the Soviet Red Cross.

==During World War II==

When the structure of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] was unified in 1943, the Ukrainian Red Cross was re-established as a separate body from the Soviet Red Cross. The service provided care for the sick and wounded UPA soldiers, attracted well-qualified doctors, prepared the supply and manufacture of medicine, equipped underground hospitals and conducted training classes for new physicians and soldiers of the UPA and prepared special medical manuals. Doctors worked in regional military hospitals which treated the wounded who had suffered from the attacks of German, Soviet or Polish punitive groups.

==Present time==
[[File:Ukrainian Red Cross Society volunteers administering first aid to a wounded Euromaidan protester. Events of Jan 19, 2014-5.jpg|thumb|Volunteers administering first aid to a wounded [[Euromaidan]] protester.]]
The Red Cross law was passed by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] in 1999.

In 2001, the Ukrainian Red Cross involved more than 6.3 million of supporters and activists. Its Visiting Nurses Service has 3200 qualified [[nurse]]s. The organization takes part in more than 40 humanitarian programmes all over [[Ukraine]], which are mostly funded by public donation and corporate partnerships. By its own estimations, the Society annually provides services to more than 105 000 of lonely elderly people, about 23 000 of people disabled during the Second World War and handicapped workers, more than 25 000 of war veterans, and more than 8 000 of adults handicapped since childhood. The assistance for [[orphan]]ed and disabled children is also rendered.&lt;ref&gt;''"Червоний Хрест допоміг дітям-сиротам", by Zoryan Onyshkevych, Ukrainewstand, February 2001, in Ukrainian''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian Red Cross Society (since 1993) is a member of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies]].

The '''Upper Aulaqi Sheikhdom''' ({{Lang-ar|مشيخة العوالق العليا}} ''{{transl|ar|Mashyakhat al-‘Awālaq al-‘Ulyā}}'') was a state in the [[British Empire|British]] [[Aden Protectorate]], the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]], and its successor, the [[Federation of South Arabia]]. Its capital was [[Sa'id, Yemen|Sa'id]]. The area of the former state is now central part of the [[Shabwah Governorate]] of the Republic of [[Yemen]].

==History==
The [[Lower Aulaqi]] sultans separated from the Upper Aulaqi in the 18th century and the Upper Aulaqi [[sheikh]]s of Said made themselves gradually independent from the [[Upper Aulaqi Sultanate]] of [[Nisab]] during the same period. In the late 19th century, the area came under British influence and eventually the Upper Aulaqi Sheikhdom became a constituent of the Aden Protectorate. It was a founding member of the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South in 1959 and its successor, the Federation of South Arabia, in 1963.

The last sheikh, Amir Abd Allah ibn Muhsin al Yaslami Al Aulaqi, was deposed on 28 August 1967 and his state was abolished in November 1967 upon the founding of the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch. ''A History of Modern Yemen.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rulers===
The rulers of the Upper Aulaqi Sheikhdom bore the title ''Shaykh al-Mashyakha al-`Awlaqiyya al-`Ulya''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yemen_protectorate.html States of the Aden Protectorates]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Iran''' discusses the history, contribution, aspects, and roles of women in Iran. Women have always played fundamental, crucial, and representative roles in the long history of [[Iran]].

==History==

===Ancient Iran===
{{see also|Women in the Sasanian Empire}}
Archeological excavations at [[Shahr-e Sookhteh]] "Burnt City," a prehistoric settlement in the [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan-Baluchistan]] province of southeastern Iran, have revealed that the women of the 4th–3rd millennium BCE community maintained a high level of socio-economic status. Of the seals discovered in graves there, 90% were in the possession of women,&lt;ref name="CHN_2_4402"&gt;{{cite web|author=CHN Press|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=4402|title=Women Held Power In Burnt City|accessdate=2007-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192451/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=4402|archive-date=September 27, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn made up over 60% of the population.&lt;ref name="CHN_2_5068"&gt;{{cite web|author=CHN Press|title=Female population predominant in 5000-year-old Burnt City|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=5068|accessdate=2007-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192557/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=5068|archive-date=September 27, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of the seals, which as instruments of trade and government represented economic and administrative control, reveals that these women were the more powerful group in their prehistoric society.&lt;ref name="CHN_2_4402" /&gt;

The early [[Achaemenid]]-era [[Persepolis]] [[Persepolis Administrative Archives|fortification and treasury tablets]] refers to women in three different terms: ''mutu'', ''irti'' and ''duksis''.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; The first refers to ordinary (non-royal) women; the second to unmarried members of the royal family; and the last ''duksis'' to married women of royalty. Such differentiated terminology shows the significance of marital status and of a woman's relationship to the king. The tablets also reveal that women of the royal household traveled extensively and often personally administered their own estates.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt; The queen and her ladies-in-waiting are known to have played [[polo]] against the emperor and his courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harrison, Frances|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4272210.stm|title=Polo comes back home to Iran|publisher=BBC News | date=September 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only limits on the extent of the authority exercised by the king's mother were set by the monarch himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cotterell, Arthur|title=From Aristotle to Zoroaster|year=1998|isbn=0-684-85596-8|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|oclc=39269485|page=434|quote="exercised by the Persian king's mother were set by the monarch himself"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tablets, "non-royals and the ordinary workers are mentioned by their rank in the specific work group or workshops they were employed. The rations they received are based on skill and the level of responsibility they assumed in the workplace. The professions are divided by gender and listed according to the amount of ration. Records indicate that some professions were undertaken by both sexes while others were restricted to either male or female workers. There are male and female supervisors at the mixed workshops as evident by the higher rations they have received with little difference in the amount of rations between the two sexes. There are also occasions where women listed in the same category as men received less rations and vice versa. Female managers have different titles presumably reflecting their level of skill and rank. The highest-ranking female workers in the texts are called ''arashshara'' (great chief). They appear repeatedly in the texts, were employed at different locations and managed large groups of women, children and sometimes men working in their units. They usually receive high rations of wine and grains exceeding all the other workers in the unit including the males."&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite web|author=Price, Massoume|url=http://www.parstimes.com/women/women_ancient_persia.html|title=Women's Lives in Ancient Persia|accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Cyrus the Great]], who twelve centuries before Islam, established the custom of covering women to protect their chastity. According to their theory, the veil passed from the [[Achaemenid]]s to the Hellenistic [[Seleucid]]s. They, in turn, handed it to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], from whom the Arab conquerors inherited it as [[hijab]], transmitting it over the vast reaches of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Iranians: Persia, Islam and the Soul of a Nation|author1=Mackey, Sandra  |author2=Harrop, Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Penguin|year=1996|isbn=0-452-27563-6|oclc=38995082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sassanid]] princess [[Purandokht]], daughter of [[Khosrau II]], ruled the Persian empire for almost two years before resigning. Also, during the Sassanian dynasty many of the Iranian soldiers who were captured by Romans were women who were fighting along with the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dodgeon M.

Persian women are depicted in many masterpieces of [[Persian miniature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward an aesthetic of Persian painting. Early Islamic Art, 650–1100''.

===Islamic periods===

====Qajar Dynasty====
During the [[Qajar dynasty]] (1789–1925), [[Malek Jahan Khanom, Mahd-e Olia|Malek Jahan Khanom]]  as [[queen mother]] exerted serious political influence during the reign of her son, from 1848 until her death in 1873.

====Pahlavi Dynasty====
[[File:Atomic women Iran.JPG|thumb|left|Female Iranian PhDs in front of [[Tehran University]]'s reactor, 1968. Text: "A quarter of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's Nuclear Energy]] scientists are women"]]
The Pahlavi Shahs were the rulers of Iran between 1925 and 1979 and they introduced many reforms concerning [[Women's rights in Iran|women's rights.]] An example of an early reform introduced by [[Reza Shah]] was the 'forced unveiling of women by a special decree on January 8, 1936 which, as the name suggests, involved the police force pulling the hijab away even from religious women, by force.'&lt;ref name="pappe 2005 237"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Middle East |authorlink=Ilan Pappé |first=Ilan |last=Pappé |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=237 |ISBN=0-415-21408-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under Reza Shah's successor [[Mohammad Reza Shah]] many more significant reforms were introduced. For example, in 1963, the Shah granted female suffrage and soon after women were elected to the Majlis (the parliament) and the upper house, and appointed as judges and ministers in the cabinet.'.&lt;ref name="pappe 2005 237"/&gt; In 1967 Iranian family law was also reformed which improved the position of women in Iranian society. It was included in the civil code and was designed to protect wives, children and female divorcees. The general thrust of the reforms were to promote equality between men and women in society.

The Family Protection Laws of 1967 and 1973 required a husband to go to court to divorce rather than simply proclaim the [[triple talaq]] of "I divorce thee" three times, as stipulated by traditional [[sharia]] law. It allowed a wife to initiate divorce and required the first wife's permission for a husband to take a second wife. Child custody was left to new family protection courts rather than automatically granted to the father. The minimum age at which a female could marry was raised from 13 to 15 in 1967 and to 18 in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin B. |last=Wright |title=The Last Great Revolution |ISBN=978-0-375-40639-3 |year=2000 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] Iran became an [[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]]. One of the striking features of the revolution was the large scale participation of women from traditional backgrounds in demonstrations leading up to the overthrow of the monarchy. The Iranian women who had gained confidence and higher education under Pahlavi era participated in demonstrations against Shah to topple the Monarchial government. The culture of education for women was established by the time of the revolution so that even after the revolution, large numbers of women entered civil service and higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungei.org/infobycountry/iran_550.html |title=Adult education offers new opportunities and options to Iranian women |publisher=Ungei.org |date=2006-03-06 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; I

In 1996, 14 women were elected to the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]].

By 1999, Iran had 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of books and magazines published by women.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c. 2000, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in Iran were granted the right to vote in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation |url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/cp/iran.htm |title=Reuters Foundation Alertnet.org Iran |publisher=Alertnet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first admitted to Iranian universities in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz، J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995. {{ISBN|0-8108-2994-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several women have held high-ranking posts in the government or parliament. Before and after the [[1979 revolution]], several women were appointed ministers or ambassadors. [[Farrokhroo Parsa]] was the first woman to be appointed Minister of Education in 1968 and [[Mahnaz Afkhami]] was appointed Minister for Women's Affairs in 1976.

Some, such as [[Tahereh Saffarzadeh]], [[Masumeh Ebtekar]], [[Azam Taleghani]], [[Fatemeh Haghighatjou]], [[Elaheh Koulaei]], [[Fatemeh Javadi]], [[Marzieh Dabbaq]] and [[Zahra Rahnavard]] came after the revolution. Other Iranian women, including [[Goli Ameri]] and [[Farah Karimi]] hold positions in Western countries.

There are currently 17 women in parliament, of a total of 290 parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.irna.ir/fa/News/82075165/ |title=رکورد جدید حضور زنان در مجلس ایران، پیام بزرگی دارد/ خواستار توسعه روابط با ایران هستیم |language=Persian |publisher=[[Islamic Republic News Agency|IRNA]] |date=15 May 2016 |access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was up from nine in the previous elections.

==Education==

[[File:Female alumni of Isfahan University of Technology.jpg|thumb|right|Female alumnae of [[Isfahan University of Technology]].

Formal education for women in Iran began in 1907 with the establishment of the first primary school for girls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esfahani|first=Kouhi|date=2014|title=Iranian Women: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back|url=|journal=Middle Eastern Studies / Ortadogu Etütleri|volume=5|issue=2|pages=36, 38, 39, 40|doi=|pmid=|ref=kouhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education held an important role in Iranian society, especially as the nation began a period of modernization under the authority of [[Reza Shah|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in the early 20th century when the number of women's schools began to grow. By mid-century, legal reforms granting women the right to vote and raising the minimum age for marriage offered more opportunities for women to pursue education outside the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After periods of imposed restrictions, women's educational attainment continued its rise through the Islamification of education following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, peaking in the years following radical changes in the curriculum and composition of classrooms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehran|first=Golnar|date=2003-08-01|title=The Paradox of Tradition and Modernity in Female Education in the Islamic Republic of Iran|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/378248|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=47|issue=3|pages=269–286|doi=10.1086/378248|issn=0010-4086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, women dominated the entrance examinations for college attendance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shavarini|first=Mitra K.|date=2005-01-01|title=The Feminisation of Iranian Higher Education|jstor=25054545|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=51|issue=4|pages=329–347, 331, 333, 334, 335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's participation in education has not slowed despite efforts to impose restrictions on the increasingly female-dominated educational sphere. The changes in women's education have split into increased usage and dominance of the opportunities available to women, and the imposition of strict requirements governing their role in education, including gender-segregated classes, Islamic dress, and the channeling of women into "feminine" majors that prevent the pursuit of certain careers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Illiteracy among women has been on a decrease since 1970 when it was 54 percent to the year 2000 when it was 17.30 percent.&lt;ref name="Iran 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bahramitash | first = Roksana | title = Market fundamentalism versus religious fundamentalism: women's employment in Iran | journal = [[Middle East Critique|Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies]] | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–46 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/1066992042000189706 | date = Spring 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1066992042000189706 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian female education went from a 46 percent literacy rate, to 83 percent.&lt;ref name="Iran 2004"/&gt; Iran ranked 10th in terms of female literacy in the 1970s, and still holds this position today.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt;

==Role in Economy==

[[File:Lahijan tea harvest.jpg|thumb|left|Tea harvest in [[Lahijan]]]]
Since the 1970s Iran has experienced significant economic and social changes. Women's workforce participation rate went from 9.1 percent in 1996 to 14 percent in 2004 to 31.9 in 2009.&lt;ref name="Afshar, Haleh 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Afshar | first = Haleh | title = Women And work in Iran | journal = [[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]] | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 755–767 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9248.00110 | date = September 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.00110 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme&lt;/ref&gt; That is a 22.8 percent increase in 13 years. Women make up over half of the Iranian population, yet they make up a small percentage of the work force. Official statistics reported by the Census Bureau suggest that women's labor force participation remains quite low.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; Women make up almost 30 percent of the Iranian labor force, and the percentage of all Iranian women who are economically active has more than doubled from 6.1 percent in 1986 to 13.7 percent in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol28/halper.pdf |title=Law and women's agency in post-revolutionary Iran |format=Pdf |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/feb/1110.html |title=Where are Iran's working women? |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, there were 18&amp;nbsp;million people employed in Iran, Women made up only 12.9 percent (or roughly 2,160,000) of the employed population. Men on the other hand made up 64 percent, or roughly 11,520,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mollahosseini | first = Ali | title = Gender and employment in Iran | journal = [[Indian Journal of Gender Studies]] | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–162 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/097152150701500110 | date = January 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/097152150701500110 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO data, however, suggest that female unemployment has been consistently higher than men's in recent years (Olmsted). Women are concentrated in the typically female jobs of teaching and caring. 82.7 percent of female civil servants work in teaching and education followed by administrative, financial, clerical, health and medical professions.&lt;ref name="Afshar, Haleh 1997"/&gt; However, according to the International Labour Organization, the top three areas of female employment are agriculture, manufacturing, and education. A factor in the increase in women's employment is an increase in their literacy rates. The illiteracy among women has been on a decrease since 1970 when it was 54 percent to the year 2000 when it was 17.30 percent.&lt;ref name="Iran 2004"/&gt; Iranian female education went form a 46 percent literacy rate, to 83 percent.&lt;ref name="Iran 2004"/&gt; Iran ranked 10th in terms of female literacy in the 1970s, and still holds this position today.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; Women's labor force participation rate and literacy rate has been on the rise. Yet the unemployment rate for women compared to that of men is still considerably higher. Take, for example, that in 1996, the unemployment rate for women was 13.4 percent whereas for men, the unemployment rate was 8.4 percent.&lt;ref name="Iran 2004"/&gt; The unemployment rate for both men and women has increased since 1996, with the gender gap in unemployment still present. In 2008 for example, [[male unemployment]] was 9.1 percent and female was 16.7 percent&lt;ref&gt;(International Labour Organization).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iranian surgical technologist with hijab 09.jpg|thumb|175px|Iranian surgical technologists]]
Studies concerning female labor force participation vary. One factor to this is the difference between measurements. The Iranian Census provides one measurement for labor force participation, and the Labor Force survey provides another.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; The Iranian census for example, used different ages for the cut off age, 10 for the 1976 census, and used 6 for the 1986 census (Olmsted)  While the International Labour Organization uses 15.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last = Olmsted | first = Jennifer C. | contribution = Gender and globalization: the Iranian experience | editor-last1 = Bahramitash | editor-first1 = Roksana | editor-last2 = Salehi Esfahani | editor-first2 = Hadi | title = Veiled employment: Islamism and the political economy of women's employment in Iran | publisher = Syracuse University Press | pages = 25–52 | location = Syracuse, New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780815632139 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank and International Labour Organization have different data on recent female employment; the ILO reports an employment rate of 17.1 percent which is considerably higher than that of the World Bank.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; Overall, there seems to be a common upward trend in employment over time.

Women in Iran had previously been restricted to the private sphere, which includes the care of the home and the children, they have been restricted from mobility, and they needed their husband's permission in order to obtain a job.&lt;ref name=Moghadam&gt;{{cite web| last = Moghadam | first = Valentine M. | title = Women in the Islamic Republic of Iran: legal status, social positions, and collective action | date = 2004 | format = pdf |accessdate = 20 September 2012 | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ValentineMoghadamFinal.pdf | publisher = Wilsoncenter.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers depict women as less reliable in the workforce as opposed to men.&lt;ref name="Ghorayshi-paid-work"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ghorayshi | first = Parvin | title = Women, paid-work and the family: in the Islamic Republic of Iran | journal = Journal of Comparative Family Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 453–466 | publisher = University of Calgary via JSTOR | date = Autumn 1996 | jstor = 41603457 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Islamic Revolution had some influence in changing this perception.&lt;ref name="Bahramitash_Brown"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bahramitash | first = Roksana | title = Revolution, Islamization, and women's employment in Iran | journal = [[Brown Journal of World Affairs]] | volume = IX | issue = 2 | pages = 229–241 | publisher = [[Brown University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://www.brown.edu/initiatives/journal-world-affairs/92/revolution-islamization-and-womens-employment-iran | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/9.2/Iran/Bahramitash.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913023304/http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/9.2/Iran/Bahramitash.pdf |date=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular feminists and the elite were not happy with the revolution, while other feminists such as Roksana Bahramitash argue that the revolution did bring women into the public sphere.&lt;ref name=Bahramitash_Brown /&gt; The 1979 Revolution had gained widespread support from women who were eager to earn rights for themselves. A woman's responsibility and obligation was in the home, which was the underlying basis of the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref name="Afshar, Haleh 1997"/&gt; Olmsted adds to this by stating that women have this "double burden."&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; In addition, men had the right to inhibit their wives from entering the labor force. Ali Akbar Mahdi is in agreement with Parvin Ghorayshi in that through the domestication of women and confinement to the private sphere, they were being exploited in non-wage activities.&lt;ref name="Mahdi"&gt;{{citation | first = Mahdi | last = Ali Akbar | contribution = Iranian women: between Islamicization and globalization | editor-last = Mohammadi | editor-first = Ali | title = Iran encountering globalization: problems and prospects | pages = 47–71 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780415391788 | ref = harv | postscript = .|url=http://go.owu.edu/~aamahdi/women%20and%20globalization-final.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Karimi's viewpoint, after the revolution, even though it had been accepted on paper that women had an equal right to employment, she believed that this did not show in practice.&lt;ref name="Karimi, Zahra 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Karimi | first = Zahra | title = International trade and employment in labour-intensive sectors in Iran: the case of carpet-weavers | journal = Iranian Economic Review | volume = 13 | issue = 22 | pages = 41–68 | publisher = [[EconLit]] | date = Autumn 2008 | url = https://ier.ut.ac.ir/article_32665_4355.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing the pre-revolution and post-revolution era, between 1976 and 1986, the labor force participation of women had declined immensely from 12.9 percent down to 8.2 percent.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; In addition, during the 1990s, women were being compensated for their housework due to the domestic wage law which allowed women to demand compensation from their husbands for their housework in the event of a divorce.&lt;ref name=Bahramitash_Brown /&gt;
[[File:Firefighting training in Mashhad (2).jpg|thumb|left|Female firefighters in [[Mashhad]]]]
In 1979 the United States imposed an economic boycott on Iran.&lt;ref name="Karimi, Zahra 2008"/&gt; In particular, the boycott affected the carpet industry. As a result, the boycott influenced women's participation in the labor force.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt;  Weaving is a common occupation for women, as it can be done inside the family home.&lt;ref name="Karimi, Zahra 2008"/&gt; If the market is volatile, merchants can simply remove or add looms to the worker's home in response to demand. Therefore, women who have children to take care of can be inside the home while tending to their work.&lt;ref name="Karimi, Zahra 2008"/&gt; Carpet weaving was very common among women from rural areas. Thus, carpet weaving was a valuable method of increasing the economic involvement of women in rural neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Moafian, Abdolhamid, comp. Human Development Report of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 1999. Rep. no. 185. Trans. Ghodratollah Memarzadeh. N.p.: Plan and Budget Organization, n.d. UNDP. Web. 20 Sept. 2012. [http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/national/asiathepacific/iran/iran_1999_en.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, over 91 percent of the female industrial employees were in the textile industry which consisted largely of carpet weaving.&lt;ref name="Karimi, Zahra 2008"/&gt; Nonetheless, this all changed due to sanctions. Before the Islamic Revolution, Iranian firms were combined with firms in the United States where Iranians produced rugs for the United States market. However, due to the United States inflicting sanctions on Iran, Iranian imports were banned from the country. The demand for Iranian carpets was still high. In response, Americans bought carpets with Iranian designs from other countries that produced the same carpets, such as China and India.&lt;ref name="Karimi, Zahra 2008"/&gt; Again, from 1994 to 2005 the export of carpets had declined drastically. In 1994 they were selling over $2&amp;nbsp;million worth of carpets and then in 2005 it went down to under $500 in carpet exports. In other words, the total share of carpet in non-oil exports had declined from 44.2 percent to 4.2 percent; a drastic decrease.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt; Olmsted concurs with Moghadam this would drastically affect women in the labor market, since the majority of carpet weavers consisted of less educated women.&lt;ref name="Syracuse UP 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moghadam /&gt;

According to the 2012 ''Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report'', the rate of entrepreneurship in Iran for women between the ages 18 to 64 fluctuated from 4 to 6 percent between 2008 and 2012 while their overall economic participation makes up only 13 percent of the entire economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/iran-startups/women-and-entrepreneurship-in-iran-5b14daa4d44c|title=Women and Entrepreneurship in Iran — Iran Startups|author=Leila Piran|work=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcrunch.com/business-finance/female-entrepreneurs-fuel-a-changing-iran/entrepreneurship-private-sector-economy-women-nuclear-deal/c2s19320/#.VbZArKPLcif|title=Female Entrepreneurs Fuel A Changing Iran|work=worldcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian women's movement==
{{Main|Iranian women's movement|Women's rights in Iran}}

The movement for women's rights in Iran is particularly complex within the scope of the political history of the country. Women have consistently pushed boundaries of societal mores and were continually gaining more political and economic rights. Women heavily participated at every level of the revolution. Within months of the formation of the Islamic republic by [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] many important rights were repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2267/is_2_67/ai_63787337 |title= Nikki R.

In 2003, [[Shirin Ebadi]], Iran's first female judge in the Pahlavi era, won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in promoting human rights.&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Shirin Ebadi|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3181992.stm|work=article|publisher=BBC News|date=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few decades, Iranian women have had significant presence in Iran's [[Science in Iran|scientific movement]], [[Iranian modern and contemporary art|art movement]], [[Persian literature|literary new wave]] and the new wave of [[Iranian cinema]]. According to the research ministry of Iran, about 6 percent of full professors, 8 percent of associate professors, and 14 percent of assistant professors were women in the 1998–99 academic year. However, women accounted for 56 percent of all students in the natural sciences, including one in five PhD students.&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/290/5496/1485|title= IRANIAN SCIENCE: Iranian Women Hear the Call of Science|accessdate=2014-09-23|doi=10.1126/science.290.5496.1485|volume=290|journal=Science|page=1485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total 49.8 percent of the university students in Iran are women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factfish.com/statistic/enrolement%2C%20tertiary%2C%20female%20of%20total%20enrolment Enrolment, tertiary, female (percent of total enrolment) - for all countries (FactFish per Worldbank)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian women's day==
Every year, people in Iran commemorate the national Women's Day and Mother's Day on the 20 [[Jumada al-Thani]], which marks the birthday anniversary of [[Fatima Zahra]] (often referred to as a role model), [[Muhammad]]'s daughter and the wife of [[Imam Ali]]. Many Iranians take the occasion of this holiday to thank and honor their mothers, grandmothers, wives and sisters and to spend more time with them. They pay tribute to them by giving them gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/03/30/458213/Iran-Womens-Day-Mothers-Day-Hazrat-Fatemeh-Zahra |title=Iranians celebrate national Women's Day |publisher=Press TV |date=30 March 2016 |access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's clothing==
[[File:75 Chardin Zarathushti women's clothing in Safavid Persia.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] clothing in [[Safavid Iran]]]]
For many centuries, since ancient [[History of Iran|pre-Islamic times]], female headscarf was a normative [[dress code]] in the [[Greater Iran]]. First veils in region are historically attested in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] as a complementary garment,&lt;ref name="El Guindi"&gt;El Guindi, Fadwa (1999).

Veil was a status symbol enjoyed by upper-class and royal women, while law prohibited peasant women, slaves and prostitutes from wearing the veil, and violators were punished.&lt;ref name="Hoodfar"&gt;[[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar, Homa]] (fall 1993).

==Women in Iranian culture==

===Persian literature===
{{See also|Persian literature}}

Over the past two centuries, women have played a prominent role in Persian literature. Contemporary Iranian poets include [[Simin Behbahani]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Parvin Etesami]]. Simin Behbahani has written passionate love poems as well as narrative poetry enriched by a motherly affection for all humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranianstudies.ca/behbahani/molavi.htm |title=The international symposium on Simin Behbahani |publisher=Iranianstudies.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behbahani is president of The Iranian Writers' Association and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature in 1997.

Contemporary authors include [[Simin Daneshvar]], [[Mahshid Amirshahi]], Shahrnush Pârsipur, Moniru Ravânipur and [[Zoya Pirzad]] to name a few. Daneshvar's work spans pre-Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Iranian literature. Her first collection of short stories, ''Âtash-e khâmush'' (Fire Quenched), was published in 1948. It was the first collection of short stories published by a woman in Iran. In 1969, she published ''Savushun'' (Mourners of [[Siyâvash]]), a novel that reflected the Iranian experience of modernity during the 20th century. It was the first novel published by a woman in Iran. Daneshvar was the first president of the Iranian Writers' Association. Shahrnush Pârsipur became popular in the 1980s following the publication of her short stories. Her 1990 novel, ''Zanân bedûn-e Mardân'' (Women Without Men), addressed issues of sexuality and identity. It was banned by the Islamic Republic. Moniru Ravânipur's work includes a collection of short stories, ''Kanizu'' (The Female Slave), and her novel ''Ahl-e gharq'' (The People of Gharq). Ravânipur is known for her focus on rituals, customs and traditions of coastal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranian.com/Bashi/2005/November/Prose/index |title=Feminist Ink |accessdate=2007-11-18 |author=Golbarg Bashi |date=November 25, 2005 |work=Feminist Ink |publisher=iranian.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111171013/http://www.iranian.com/Bashi/2005/November/Prose/index &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian music===
{{See also|Persian women musicians|Iranian women and Persian music}}

Perhaps [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] was the first female master of Persian music who introduced a new style of music and was praised by other masters of Persian music of the time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Several years later, Mahmoud Karimi trained women students—Arfa Atrai, Soosan Matloobi, Fatemeh Vaezi, Masoomeh Mehr-Ali and Soosan Aslani—who later became masters of Persian traditional music. [[Soodabeh Salem]] and [[Sima Bina]] developed Iranian children's music and [[Iranian folk music]] respectively.

Innovations made by Iranian women are not restricted to Persian music. For instance, [[Lily Afshar]] is working on a combination of Persian and Western classical music.

[[Googoosh]] is one of the most famous Iranian singers. Her legacy dates back to pre-Revolutionary times in Iran, where her fame in Iran reached heights equivalent to [[Elvis Presley]] or [[Barbra Streisand]]. She became iconic when, after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], she lived unheard of for more than 20 years. In 2000, she emerged from Iran with an international tour.

===Modern art===
{{See also|Modern and contemporary art in Iran}}

Iranian women have played an important role in gaining international recognition for Iranian art and in particular Iranian cinema.

Since the rise of the Iranian [[Iranian New Wave (Cinema)|''New Wave'']] of Persian cinema, Iran has produced record numbers of film school graduates; each year more than 20 new directors, many of them women, make their debut films. In the last two decades, the percentage of Iranian film directors who are women has exceeded the percentage of women film directors in most Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiv.hkw.de/en/dossiers/iran_dossierroseissa/kapitel2.html |title=Haus der Kulturen der Welt |publisher=Archiv.hkw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the pioneering director [[Rakhshan Bani-Etemad]] suggests that many women directors in Iran were working hard on films long before director [[Samira Makhmalbaf]] made the headlines. Internationally recognized figures in [[Women's cinema|Persian women's cinema]] are [[Tahmineh Milani]], [[Rakhshan Bani-Etemad]], [[Zahra Dowlatabadi]], [[Niki Karimi]], [[Samira Makhmalbaf]], Mahin Oskouei, [[Pari Saberi]], [[Hana Makhmalbaf]], Pouran Rakhshandeh, Shirin Neshat, Sepideh Farsi, [[Maryam Keshavarz]], [[Yassamin Maleknasr]], and Sara Rastegar.

Iranian writer-director Rakhshan Bani-Etemad is probably Iran's best known and certainly most prolific female filmmaker. She has established herself as the elder stateswoman of Iranian cinema with documentaries and films about social pathology. One of the best-known female film directors in the country today is [[Samira Makhmalbaf]], who directed her first film, ''The Apple'', when she was only 17 years old. Samira Makhmalbaf won the 2000 [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] Jury Prize for ''Blackboards'', a film about the trials of two traveling teachers in [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|Kurdistan]].

In [[Persian literature]] one can find references to women as far back as Pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;Brosius, Maria. Women in Ancient Persia, 559–331&amp;nbsp;B.C. Oxford Classical Monographs. Oxford University Press (UK), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

And many creators of classical verse and prose were women themselves as well. One can mention [[Qatran Tabrizi]], [[Rabia Balkhi]], [[Táhirih]], [[Simin Behbahani]], [[Simin Daneshvar]], [[Parvin E'tesami]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Mahsati]] and [[Mina Assadi]] in this group to name nine of them.

==Western perceptions of Iranian women==
In [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] there is a pervasive [[stereotype]] about women in Iran and the [[Islamic World]] in general. They are perceived as helpless victims of a [[patriarchal system]] that oppresses and enslaves them. This image is reinforced through observations of female dress, and stories of female treatment in Islamic nations.&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Such distorted perspective was criticized by [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], who argued:

{{Quote|text=People say that for instance in Islam women have to go inside the house and lock themselves in. This is a false accusation. In the early years of Islam women were in the army, they even went to battlefields. Islam is no opposed to universities. It opposes corruption in the universities; it opposes backwardness in the universities; it opposes colonial universities. Islam has nothing against universities. Islam empowers women. It puts them next to men. They are equals.|author=Ruhollah Khomeini&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;{{rp|37}}}}

No place in the Islamic World today has been more stigmatized for its alleged poor treatment of women than Iran. However, stereotypes of Iranian women promulgated in the West are hopelessly out of date. They ignore the extraordinary efforts that women have made on their own behalf to improve their lives. These efforts range from simple choices in clothing to more dramatic life choices in family composition, education, and career.&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt;{{rp|149–150}} According to [[William O. Beeman]]:

{{Quote|text=The most surprising development for me was the clear impression that, contrary to American belief, women in the Islamic Republic were better off in many respects than they were under the Pahlavi regime. Moreover, their condition has continued to improve. Women have always had a strong role in Iranian life. Their prominent and often decisive participation in public political movements has been especially noteworthy. Brave and often ruthlessly pragmatic, women have been more than willing to take to the streets in a good public cause throughout modern Iranian history. The Islamic Republic has made a special point of emphasizing women's equality in education, employment, and politics as a matter of national pride. Although women have served in the Iranian legislature and as government ministers since the 1950s, there are more women in the current parliament than ever served under the Pahlavi regime. Iranian women may actually be in the vanguard in the Islamic World. As their progress becomes better known, they are sure to inspire others to pursue their dreams. The New Islamic Woman is a reality, and will undoubtedly be a force to reckon with in the future.|author=William O. Beeman (2005)&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt;{{rp|151–152}}}}

Distorted perceptions about foreign women are also common inside Iran itself, where American and Western women are frequently seen as commodified objects of male desire. Although both Iranian and Western views are inaccurate, these images that frequently give the two peoples one of the most potent views of the other.&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

'''Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din''' (or '''Imam Yahya''') (18 June 1869 – 17 February 1948)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Yemen/yemen3.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt; became [[Imam]] of the [[Zaiddiyah|Zaydis]] in 1904 after the death of his father, [[Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din|Muhammad Al-Mansur]],&lt;ref&gt;''Western Arabia and the Red Sea'', Naval Intelligence Division, London 2005, p. 287 {{ISBN|0-7103-1034-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Imam of [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom Of Yemen|Yemen]] in 1918. His name and title in full was '''His majesty Amir al-Mumenin al-Mutawakkil 'Ala Allah Rab ul-Alamin Imam Yahya bin al-Mansur Bi'llah Muhammad Hamidaddin, Imam and Commander of the Faithful''' (the prince of the believers, he who relies on God, the Lord of the Universe).

Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din was born on Friday 18 June 1869 in Sanaa into the Hamidaddin branch of the [[Rassids|al-Qasimi dynasty]] who ruled most of Yemen proper and South Saudi Arabia today for over 900 years. Upon the death of his father in 1904, Yahya became [[Imam]], effectively ruler over the mountainous areas of the future [[North Yemen]]. However, the [[Ottomans]] who made claim on the area did not recognize the rule of the Imams of Yemen since their entry into Yemen.

==Impressions==
Sir [[Gilbert Clayton]], who visited King Yahya in Sana'a in an earnest attempt to win him over in 1925 and during his short stay in the capital, was impressed by this ruler's administration, his military preparedness, and organization.

Lt Col. Harold Jacob, C.S.I. describing him said; "Imam Yahya is a strong ruler. His sanctity as High Priest of the Zaidi sect and his descent from the Prophet's family adds to the prestige which his benign rule has won. His methods are patriarchal and humane. His one hobby is the Yemen"

Jewish chronicles lavish praise upon him and depict him as the champion of justice and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Shalom 'Uzayri, ''Galei-Or'', Tel-Aviv 1974 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This is, however, not surprising. Imam Yahia managed to put an end to the state of anarchy,  lawlessness and violence which had lacerated the country and inflicted immense suffering upon its inhabitants, including the [[Yemenite Jews|Jews]]. During his long reign the Jews enjoyed relatively favorable conditions and were generally in favour of the Imam.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tudor (2000) 'The Jewish Image of the Imam: Paradox or Paradigm?' In: Parfitt, Tudor, (ed.), Israel and Ishmael: Studies in Muslim-Jewish relations. London: Curzon-SOAS Near and Middle East Publications, pp. 207–225.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Image:Dar al hajar.jpg|thumb|The residence of Imam Yahya in the Wadi Dhar near [[Sana'a]]]]

==World War I==
In 1911 Imam Yahya signed the [[Treaty of Daan]] with the Ottomans which recognised his rule over the Zaydi-controlled portions of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burrowes, Historical Dictionary of Yemen (Lanham: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1995), xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the demise of the Ottoman Empire reached Yemen on Thursday 14 November 1918. Imam Yahya went to Sana'a three days later on Sunday 17 November 1918 to meet with tribal leaders from Hashid, Arhab, Nihm, and Khowlan. He arrived at the residence of the judge and scholar [[Hussein bin Ali Al Amri]] and received dignitaries, scholars, Turkish princes, judges, and a flood of subjects who proclaimed him the supreme ruler of all of Yemen.

His first order was to forbid entering the capital Sana'a with arms, and appointed sentries at the gates to start a reign of peace and justice unparalleled during the years of his rule. City after city accepted the rule and authority of Imam Yahya; the port of Mocha, and the city of Taiz were among the first most important cities. He took steps to create a modern state, and maintained all Ottoman officials who would stay to support the development of government.

He created a regular army in 1919 that enlisted soldiers from the surrounding tribes to Sana'a; from the tribes of Sanhan, Bani Harthi, and Bani Hushaish. He signed many treaties which recognised Yemen as a sovereign state, the first of which was the [[Italo-Yemeni Treaty]] in 1926.

Due to conflicting tribes in the border areas between Saudi Arabia and Yemen that escalated into a war ensued that was ended in 1934 with the signing of the Taif Treaty between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The treaty was the basis for the final territorial agreement between both countries concluded during the reign of [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd bin Abdulaziz]] and [[Ali Abdullah Saleh|President Ali Abdullah Saleh]].

==Internal policy==
From 1934 until his assassination in 1948, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, control of the hinterland was strengthened by the establishment of a standing army and the naming of his sons as governors of key provinces. Tighter control over affairs in San'a, the capital, was assured by expanding the scope of administrative functions and appointing other sons as supervisors of old and new political institutions . The regime sent Yemen's first students abroad : military cadets to Iraq in the 1930s and civilian students, the "Famous Forty," to Lebanon in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;''see'' {{cite journal|last1=Burrowes|first1=Robert D.|title=The Famous Forty and Their Companions: North Yemen's First-Generation Modernists and Educational Emigrants|journal=Middle East Journal|date=Winter 2005|volume=59|issue=1|pages=81–97|jstor=4330098}}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early attempt was made to introduce some direction to the nascent national economy by the establishment of a Yemen trading company.&lt;ref&gt;Legitimacy and political change in Yemen and Oman, J. E. Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with these changes, Yahya's Yemen was a semi-feudal state in which even the most basic measures required his personal approval.
===Relations with his Jewish subjects===
Imam Yahya was largely admired by the Jews of Yemen, who saw him as their patron and protector.&lt;ref&gt;Bat-Zion Eraqi Korman, "Yemeni Jews En Route to Palestine by Way of Aden during the Mandate Period 1920–1948", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 309 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 1906, the Jews of [[Sana'a]] had come out in full-force to welcome the Imam who returned to the city after the Turks had temporarily left it. However, by 1922, in response to outside pressure, Imam Yahya promulgated an edict that prohibited Yemeni Jewish emigration. Although the ban on emigration remained the official policy of the state until 1949, Jews were able to bypass its policy by secretly going into the [[British Protectorate of Aden]]. Throughout the early 1940s, Imam Yahya turned a blind eye to Jewish emigration, neither prohibiting it nor officially permitting it, but rather giving his unspoken consent to the departure of Jews from Sana'a and other central Yemeni settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Bat-Zion Eraqi Korman, "Yemeni Jews En Route to Palestine by Way of Aden during the Mandate Period 1920–1948", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, pp. 310–313 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Imam's assassination in 1948, this policy continued under his son [[Ahmad bin Yahya|Ahmad]].

==Assassination==
Imam Yahya was shot with his grandson by an assassin on 17 February 1948 in the [[Alwaziri coup]]. The assassin, known as Al-Qardaei, was from the Bani Murad tribe.

Upon the knowledge of the murder of Imam Yahya, Yemeni tribes rallied behind Sayf-ul-Islam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] and accepted him as the new Imam of Yemen.  The armies surrounded Sanaa under the leadership of Seif Ul Islam Alhassan and Seif Ul Islam Alabbass, both sons of the late Imam, supported by their brother Seif Ul Islam Yahya from within the city walls.

The news shocked both the Arab League, and all Muslim governments.  King Abdullah of Jordan compared his death to that of the third Khalifah Othman.

Both King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, and himself supported Imam Ahmad, and were first to declare him as the new Head of State.

Yemen was a founding member of the Arab League in 1945, and later joined the United Nations in 1947.

In 1946 British opposition to Imam Yahya was led from Aden-based political parties.

He had 14 sons:

*1. Imam Ahmed
*2. Mohammed Albader
*3. Alhassan
*4. Alhussein
*5. Ali
*6. Al-Motahar
*7. Al-Qassim

'''Zabbix''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[network monitoring|monitoring]] software tool for diverse IT components, including [[computer network|networks]], [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[virtual machine]]s (VMs) and [[cloud service]]s. Zabbix provides monitoring metrics, among others network utilization, CPU load and disk space consumption. Zabbix monitoring configuration can be done using XML based templates which contains elements to monitor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/config/templates&lt;/ref&gt; The software monitors operations on Linux, Hewlett Packard Unix (HP-UX), Mac OS X, Solaris and other operating systems (OSes); however, Windows monitoring is only possible through agents.
Zabbix can use [[MySQL]], [[MariaDB]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[SQLite]], [[Oracle database|Oracle]] or [[IBM DB2]] to store data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.4/manual/installation/requirements#software List of supported databases in the manual]&lt;/ref&gt; Its backend is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and the web frontend is written in [[PHP]]. Zabbix offers several monitoring options: 
*Simple checks can verify the availability and responsiveness of standard services such as SMTP or HTTP without installing any software on the monitored host. 
*A Zabbix [[Software agent|agent]] can also be installed on UNIX and Windows hosts to monitor statistics such as CPU load, network utilization, disk space, etc. 
*As an alternative to installing an agent on hosts, Zabbix includes support for monitoring via [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]], [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] checks, as well as over [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface|IPMI]], [[Java Management Extensions|JMX]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and using custom parameters. Zabbix supports a variety of near-real-time notification mechanisms, including [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]].

Released under the terms of [[GNU General Public License version 2]], Zabbix is [[free software]].

==History==
Zabbix started as an internal software project in 1998. After three years, in 2001, it was released to the public under GPL,&lt;ref name="presentation for netways" /&gt; three years later until the first stable version, 1.0, was released in 2004.

==Development==

Zabbix is primarily developed by a Zabbix LLC company.

===Source code===
Zabbix consists of several separate modules:
* Zabbix Server, not supported in Windows,&lt;ref name="zabbix.com"&gt;https://www.zabbix.com/requirements&lt;/ref&gt; performs the polling and trapping of data, calculates triggers and sends notifications to users, needs a database to store configurations and data.
* Zabbix Agents, installed on the system that is to be monitored to reach out values like CPU/memory usage that can only be accessed from within the OS
* Zabbix Frontend,  web front-end used for setup, configuration and data browsing.
* Zabbix Proxy,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/concepts/proxy&lt;/ref&gt; not supported in Windows, allows to access to systems that can't be reached directly and reduce load on Zabbix Server.&lt;ref name="zabbix.com"/&gt;

While the server, proxy and agents are written in [[C (programming language)|C]], the front-end is implemented in [[PHP]] and [[Javascript]]. A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] gateway is also available since Zabbix 2.0.

===Releases===

Since the first stable version was released as 1.0, Zabbix versioning has used minor version numbers to denote major releases. Each minor release actually implements many new features, while change level releases mostly introduce bugfixes.

Zabbix version numbering scheme has changed over time. While the first two stable branches were 1.0 and 1.1, after 1.1 it was decided to use odd numbers for development versions and even numbers for stable versions. As a result, 1.3 followed 1.1 as a development release to be released as 1.4.
