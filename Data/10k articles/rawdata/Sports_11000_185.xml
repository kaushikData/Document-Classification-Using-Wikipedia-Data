* 1769 — Tom Lyons defeated many minor opponents in street fights and in turn-ups in London.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lyons-tom.htm |title=Tom Lyons |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1769 — Lyons received challenges from Darts and Peter Corcoran. He declined both and is believed to have retired.&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt; Darts reclaimed the English title.&lt;ref name=Darts/&gt;

Some other sources say Bill Turner had won the fight.&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/corcoran.htm |title=Peter Corcoran |publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone |accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 25 March 1770 — Darts defeated Stephen "Death" Oliver in [[Putney]] after 27 minutes.&lt;ref name=Darts/&gt;

'''Events'''
* c.19 June 1766 — an inter-county match between [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] and [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] was won by Hampshire; evidence exists that teams raised by the [[Hambledon Club]] were representative of both these counties.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1767 — the earliest known [[century (cricket)|century partnership]] recorded as two [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] players score 192 for the first wicket against [[Caterham Cricket Club|Caterham]]; the sources do not name the players but they are believed to have been [[Tom Sueter]] and either [[George Leer]] or [[Edward "Curry" Aburrow]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

* 1769 — [[Tom Sueter]] and [[George Leer]] shared a partnership of 128 for [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] v [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] at [[Broadhalfpenny Down]], the second known century partnership in cricket's history.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1770 — in the year of the so-called "[[Boston Massacre]]", which occurred on Monday, 5 March, there is a report in the ''Middlesex Journal'' on Thursday, 16 August that: "about three days before the meeting of Parliament, a grand Cricket Match will be played by 11 of the Ministry against 11 of the Patriots, when great sport is expected".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1989 Norwegian Football Cup Final''' was the 84th final of the [[Norwegian Football Cup]]. The final took place at [[Ullevaal Stadion]] in [[Oslo]] on 22 October 1989.&lt;ref name="Sportsboken" /&gt; [[Viking FK|Viking]] were in their 8th final (3 wins and 4 runners-up), while [[Molde FK|Molde]] were in their second final after losing the 1982 final against [[SK Brann|Brann]] and therefore had the chance to win the first trophy in the club's history. 

The first final between the two teams ended with a 2–2 draw. A replay was played on the following Sunday on 29 October and ended with a 2–1 win for Viking who became Norwegian Champions for the fourth time.

'''Alumni Arena''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. The arena is home to the [[State University of New York at Buffalo]] men's and women's [[basketball]] teams, the women's [[volleyball]] team, and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] team.&lt;ref name=Arena&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubbulls.com/facilities/alumni_arena|title=State University of New York at Buffalo: Facilities: Alumni Arena|publisher=University at Buffalo Athletics|date=2014|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility currently seats 6,100 people.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;

==Description==

"The Recreation and Athletics Complex (RAC) on the University's [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York#North Campus|North Campus]] includes Alumni Arena, a $12.5 million Phase II Building and a $1.5 million outdoor playing fields complex."&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;

"Alumni Arena's main gymnasium is home to the Bulls men's and women's [[Buffalo Bulls#Men's basketball|basketball]] teams, [[Buffalo Bulls#Other men's sports|wrestling]] team and the women's [[Buffalo Bulls#Women's sports|volleyball]] team."&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt; "The largest "free-floating" hardwood floor in the United States at the time it was built, it features basketball, volleyball and badminton courts circled by a 200-meter track and seating for 6,100 spectators following renovations during the summer of 2004."&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;

The arena used to seat more than 8,000 people, but a renovation project funded by the Blue &amp; White club reduced the seating to 6,100 by eliminating bleachers and adding chairbacks.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt; The [[student section]] was relocated with the renovations. Before the renovations, the students used to generally sit behind the scorer's table, from baseline to baseline, except immediately behind the players' benches. [[Syracuse University|Syracuse's]] [[Carrier Dome]] is the only on-campus college basketball facility in the state that is larger.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt; The volleyball court was constructed for the [[Universiade|World University Games]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;

"The building includes three levels of offices, locker rooms, equipment and training-therapy rooms, seminar rooms, and racquetball courts."&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt; "The Phase II Building on the north side of Alumni Arena has an Olympic-sized swimming pool and a separate diving well, a triple gymnasium, and dance studio."&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt; "Other areas are a wrestling practice room, two weight-training rooms (a fitness center and a varsity weight room), additional racquetball and squash courts, an erg room, and an aerobics room."&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;

Behind Alumni Arena, a playing fields complex provides lighted outdoor space for several sports, including soccer, field hockey, softball, tennis, basketball, handball and archery.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;

In 2011, the lighting and sound systems in the arena were upgraded to state-of-the-art quality.&lt;ref name=Upgrades&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubbulls.com/general/releases/2011-12/Alumni_Arena_Upgrades|title=UB Athletics announces upgrades to Alumni Arena|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|date=31 October 2011|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new video and scoring system was also installed.&lt;ref name=Upgrades /&gt;

On February 3, 2012, the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] played on the Bulls court.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} On August 22, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] spoke to a sold-out crowd at Alumni Arena about the rising costs of college tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/obama-to-speak-at-ub-alumni-arena-next-thursday-20130815|title=White House confirms Obama visit to UB: Will speak at Alumni Arena in the morning|publisher=The Buffalo News|date=15 August 2013|author=Zremski, Jerry|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by the President on College Affordability -- Buffalo, NY|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/22/remarks-president-college-affordability-buffalo-ny|publisher=White House|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As President Obama talks college affordability, Buffalo's program looks to be a model|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/as-president-obama-talks-college-affordability-buffalos-program-looks-to-be-a-model/2013/08/22/bcd166b8-0af4-11e3-89fe-abb4a5067014_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822143916/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/as-president-obama-talks-college-affordability-buffalos-program-looks-to-be-a-model/2013/08/22/bcd166b8-0af4-11e3-89fe-abb4a5067014_story.html|archive-date=22 August 2013|accessdate=27 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=22 August 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Athletics (sport)|athletics competition]]''' at the '''[[Africa Military Games]]''' was held from 24–26 April 2002 at the [[Moi International Sports Centre]] in [[Nairobi]], Kenya.

A total of twenty-six events were contested, eighteen by men and eight by women. A near full [[track and field]] programme was held for men, with all regular track events being held and only the [[pole vault]] and [[hammer throw]] missing from the field events. The women's programme had limited entries so was mostly track running events, plus the [[long jump]] and [[high jump]]. No road or combined events were contested. All performances were affected by the high altitude of Nairobi.&lt;ref name=GBR&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/afmg.htm Africa Military Games]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hosts, Kenya, were dominant at the competition, winning seventeen of the 26 gold medals on offer, including all but three of the track titles. The next most successful nation was Morocco, which won three gold medals and four silvers, having particular success in the women's section. Botswana took three golds in the men's events and also had the third largest medal haul at five. Military athletes from thirteen nations reached the podium.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

Kenya provided the foremost international athletes at the meeting. The [[Athletics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] champion [[Noah Ngeny]] took the [[800 metres]] title. Olympic medallist and former world champion [[Wilson Boit Kipketer]] easily won the [[3000 metres steeplechase]]. Multiple world cross country medallist [[Paul Malakwen Kosgei]] was beaten  to the [[10,000 metres]] gold by [[John Cheruiyot Korir]] – a situation that was reversed at the [[2002 African Championships in Athletics]] later that year. The [[5000 metres]] winner [[Sammy Kipketer]] later established himself globally with another win at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Njenga, Peter (2002-04-27).

Retrieved on 2015-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's competition was of a lower standard, with the most prominent international athlete being 1500&amp;nbsp;m winner [[Naomi Mugo]], who formerly won a middle-distance double at the [[African Championships in Athletics]]. The reigning 800&amp;nbsp;m [[Mediterranean Games]] champion [[Seltana Aït Hammou]] was also present and won her speciality. [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]] participants [[Restituta Joseph]], [[Anna Ndege]] and Olympian [[Nebiat Habtemariam]] were other globally established athletes to medal at the Africa Military Games.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

The most successful athletes in the competition were [[Jacinta Wambui]] and [[David Kirui]], both of Kenya and both winners of a [[200 metres]]/[[400 metres]] sprint double.&lt;ref name=GBR/&gt;

'''Braves Field''' was a [[baseball park]] in the [[Northeastern United States]], located in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Today the site is home to [[Nickerson Field]] on the campus of [[Boston University]]. The stadium was home of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] of the [[National League]] from [[1915 Boston Braves season|1915]]–[[1952 Boston Braves season|1952]], prior to the Braves' move to [[Milwaukee]] in [[1953 Milwaukee Braves season|1953]]. The stadium hosted the [[1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] and Braves home games during the [[1948 World Series]]. The [[Boston Red Sox]] used Braves Field for their home games in the [[1915 World Series|1915]] and [[1916 World Series]] since the stadium had a larger seating capacity than [[Fenway Park]]. Braves Field was the site of [[Babe Ruth]]'s final season, playing for the Braves in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BSN/1948.shtml|title=1948 Boston Braves Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ruthba01.shtml|title=Babe Ruth Stats  - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1929 to 1932, the Boston Red Sox played select regular season games periodically at Braves Field.&lt;ref name="thisgreatgame.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisgreatgame.com/ballparks-braves-field.html|title=The Ballparks: Braves Field, Boston, Massachusetts|author=|date=|website=www.thisgreatgame.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1920, Braves Field hosted the longest major league baseball game in history – 26 innings, which eventually ended in a 1–1 tie.&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BSN/BSN192005010.shtml|title=Brooklyn Robins at Boston Braves Box Score, May  1, 1920 - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braves Field was also home to multiple professional [[American football|football]] teams between 1929 and 1948, including the first home of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise that became the [[Washington Redskins]]. The pro football Braves played at the ballpark in their inaugural season of [[1932 Boston Braves (NFL) season|1932]], then were at Fenway Park for four seasons as the [[1933 Boston Redskins season|Boston Redskins]] before the move south in [[1937 Washington Redskins season|1937]] to [[Griffith Stadium]] in Washington, D.C.

Located on Commonwealth Avenue at Babcock Street, the baseball field was aligned northeast, much as Fenway Park has been since it opened in April 1912. Most of the stadium was demolished in 1955, but significant portions of the original structure still stand and make up part of the [[Nickerson Field]] sports complex on the campus of [[Boston University]].

==Professional football==
While built for baseball and having a rich baseball history, Braves Field briefly served as host for football teams. Braves Field was one of two homes (with [[Fenway Park]]) of the [[Boston Bulldogs (AFL)|Boston Bulldogs]] of the [[American Football League (1926)|first American Football League]] (in [[1926 American Football League season|1926]]) and the [[Boston Shamrocks (AFL)|Boston Shamrocks]] of the [[American Football League (1936)|second AFL]] (in 1936 and 1937). The [[National Football League]]'s [[Pottsville Maroons]] were sold and relocated to Braves Field in 1929 as the [[Boston Bulldogs (NFL)|Boston Bulldogs]]. In 1932, Braves Field became home of the football Boston Braves, a [[National Football League]] expansion franchise, owned by [[George Preston Marshall]]. The next year, after a 4–4–2 season, the Boston Braves Football franchise moved to [[Fenway Park]] and changed its name to the Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=Boston Redskins (1932-1936)|author=|date=|website=www.sportsecyclopedia.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the franchise relocated and become today's [[Washington Redskins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/was/1932.htm|title=1932 Boston Braves Statistics &amp; Players - Pro-Football-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Boston Yanks]] played a few games at Braves Field when [[Fenway Park]] was unavailable. The team was also the home of the [[Portland_Breakers#Boston_Breakers|USFL's Boston Breakers]] in the early 80's.

==Baseball history==
[[File:Crowds at Braves Field Loop, opening day, 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Crowds at the streetcar loop outside the field on August 13, 1915, the first day of baseball in the new park]]
Before the Braves became the first modern-era franchise to relocate, in 1952, the Boston Braves franchise had been in Boston since 1871. Before Braves Field, the franchise had played at [[South End Grounds]], with play at [[Congress Street Grounds]] in 1894 while [[South End Grounds]] was rebuilt following the May 15, 1894 Roxbury Fire .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballparks.com/baseball/national/sthend.htm|title=South End Grounds|author=|date=|website=ballparks.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Boston Red Sox]] opened [[Fenway Park]] in 1912, Braves owner [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]] purchased the former Allston Golf Club, one mile west of [[Fenway Park]] to build a new park for the Braves. Construction of the $600,000 Braves Field began on March 20, 1915 and was completed before the end of the 1915 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/past/BravesField.htm|title=Braves Field - History, Photos and more of the Boston Braves former ballpark|author=|date=|website=ballparksofbaseball.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahistory.org/BravesField.html|title=Braves Field|author=|date=|website=www.bahistory.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was constructed entirely of steel (approx 750 tons) and an estimated 8 million pounds of concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/research/braves-field-imperfect-history-perfect-ballpark|title=Braves Field: An Imperfect History of the Perfect Ballpark - Society for American Baseball Research|author=|date=|website=sabr.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braves Field officially opened on August 18, 1915 with 46,000 in attendance to see the Braves defeat the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] 3-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BSN/BSN191508180.shtml|title=St. Louis Cardinals at Boston Braves Box Score, August 18, 1915 - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braves Park was the largest stadium built in that era, with 40,000 capacity and a trolley system leading to the park.&lt;ref name="thisgreatgame.com" /&gt;

Braves Field was nicknamed ''The Wigwam'' by fans. Later it was nicknamed ''The Bee Hive'' and the name changed to '''National League Park''', from 1936–1941, a period during which the owners changed the nickname of the team to the Boston Bees. The renaming of the team and stadium were both eventually dropped. During this span, it hosted the fourth [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] in [[1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1936]]. With its capacity to hold more fans than [[Fenway Park]], Braves Field was used by the Red Sox in the [[1915 World Series|1915]] and [[1916 World Series]]; with Braves Field still under construction, the Braves had used Fenway Park for their World Series Title in [[1914 World Series|1914]].
[[File:Boston Braves field postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard showing the lights shortly after installation in 1946/47.]]

Looking at design, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]] wanted to see the game played in a wide open field conducive to allowing numerous inside-the-park home runs. Thus, the stadium was built in what was, at the time, the outskirts of Boston, in a large rectangular plot, contrasting with the cozy and lopsided block containing Fenway Park. The stands were almost entirely in foul territory, leaving little in the outfield to which players could hit a home run into – with the fences over {{convert|400|ft|-1}} away down the lines and nearly {{convert|500|ft|-1}} to dead center, hitting the ball over the outer fences was all but impossible during the [[dead-ball era]]. A stiff breeze coming in from center field across the [[Charles River]] further lessened any chances of seeing home runs fly out of the park.&lt;ref name="Diamonds Are Rough All Over"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ji4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=baseball+digest+shanty+hogan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1GlHT8_nJoW58gOIv4WQDg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Diamonds Are Rough All Over |author=Frank, Stanley |publisher=|date=July 1947 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only possible target in the outfield was a small [[bleacher]] section, which came to be known as ''The Jury Box'' after a sportswriter noticed during one slow mid-week game that there were only twelve individuals sitting in the 2,000-seat stand. [[Ty Cobb]] visited the park and commented, "Nobody will ever hit a ball out of this park."&lt;ref name="Diamonds Are Rough All Over" /&gt; The large foul ground area further favored the pitchers.

It took seven years and a livelier ball before a batter hit a home run that cleared the outer wall on the fly. [[1922 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] catcher [[Frank Snyder (baseball)|Frank Snyder]] hit the first major league home run in the history of Braves Field in {{Baseball year|1922}} when he cleared the [[left field]] foul pole.&lt;ref name="Diamonds Are Rough All Over" /&gt; Meanwhile, it remained a pitchers' park, perhaps never more so than on May 1, 1920, when [[1920 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher [[Leon Cadore]] and Braves pitcher [[Joe Oeschger]] locked horns for a pair of complete-game performances that went on for a still-record 26 innings. After all that work, the game ended in a 1–1 tie, called on account of darkness.

At the advent of the lively ball era, it became clear that the fans were unhappy with Gaffney's vision of how baseball should be played, and inner fences were built, and regularly moved, being moved in and out based on whims. Later, the ownership of the team even went so far as to shift the entire field in a clockwise direction (towards right field) at one point. One year after opening Braves Field, Gaffney had sold the Braves, but kept Braves Field. Gaffney and his heirs then leased the stadium out to Braves owners until 1949, when his heirs sold it back to the Braves for approx. $750,000.&lt;ref name="thisgreatgame.com" /&gt;

On Sunday, September 21, 1952, the Brooklyn Dodgers defeated the Braves, 8–2, before 8,822 fans in the final Major League game at Braves Field. [[Roy Campanella]] hit the last home run to help [[Joe Black]] defeat a Braves team with 20 year-old rookie [[Eddie Mathews]] hitting 3rd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BSN/BSN195209210.shtml|title=Brooklyn Dodgers at Boston Braves Box Score, September 21, 1952 - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closing and renovation==
After purchasing the Braves from [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]] in 1945, owner [[Lou Perini]], citing low attendance, moved the Braves to [[Milwaukee]] just prior to the 1953 season, leaving Braves Field vacant. The Braves had drawn fewer than 300,000 fans in 1952, after drawing over 1 million in 1947,1948 and 1949. Milwaukee had been the site of the Braves' Minor League team, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and the Braves had earlier blocked an attempt by the [[St. Louis Browns]] to move to Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1953/march_3_1953_114332.html|title=Boston Braves, who own Milwaukee minor league...

The old ballpark was used as-is until 1955, when [[Boston University]] reconfigured the stands and the grounds. The remodel replaced all but the pavilion grandstand at the end of the right field line, which was retained as the seating core of a football, soccer, field hockey, and track-and-field stadium. The stadium was initially called "Boston University Field" and later renamed [[Nickerson Field]]. Along with the pavilion, the original outer wall was retained, though a portion of that wall along what is now Harry Agganis Way was replaced with wrought iron fencing in 2008. The stadium's ticket office was converted into the [[Boston University]] police station. The rest of the stadium structure was replaced by dormitories covering the former main grandstand; and the Case Physical Education Center, which houses [[Walter Brown Arena]] and [[Case Gym]] in the vicinity of what was the left field pavilion along [[Babcock Street]]. Of the demolished [[Baseball park#Jewel box ballparks|Jewel Box ballparks]], Braves Field has the largest proportion of visible remnants still standing, as no other former ballpark has any portion of its seating still in use.

==World Series games==

[[File:Boston Braves Baseball Team of 1948 (78732).jpg|thumb|Boston Braves baseball team of 1948]]

[[World Series]] games were played at Braves Field in 1915, 1916, and 1948. The [[Boston Red Sox]] played their home games in the [[1915 World Series|1915]] and [[1916 World Series]] at the new Braves Field, as its capacity at the time was larger than [[Fenway Park]], while the Braves hosted three games of the [[1948 World Series]].

The Red Sox defeated the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] 4 games to 1 to win the 1915 World Series. On Monday, October 11, the Red Sox won Game 3 at Braves Field, 2–1, in front of 42,300. The next day, the Red Sox won Game 4 in front of 41,096, also 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1915_WS.shtml|title=1915 World Series - Boston Red Sox over Philadelphia Phillies (4-1) - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young pitcher on the Red Sox, [[Babe Ruth]] only appeared in the series once, as a pinch hitter, going 0–1 in Game 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/playerpost.php?p=ruthba01&amp;ps=ws|title=Babe Ruth World Series Stats by Baseball Almanac|first=Baseball Almanac,|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Red Sox played the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]] in the 1916 World Series. In Game 1, the Red Sox defeated Brooklyn, 6–5, at Braves Field in front of 36,117. On Monday, October 9, Boston left-hander Babe Ruth pitched against [[Sherry Smith]] in front of 47,373.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS191610090.shtml|title=1916 World Series Game 2, Brooklyn Robins at Boston Red Sox, October  9, 1916 - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth and Smith dueled for 14 innings, before Ruth and the Red Sox won in the bottom of the 14th, 2–1.

In 1948, the Boston Braves captured the National League pennant with 91 wins. The Braves then played the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the World Series, losing 4 games to 2. Two future Hall-of-Famers led their teams as Managers, [[Lou Boudreau]] of Indians and [[Billy Southworth]] leading the Braves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1948_WS.shtml|title=1948 World Series - Cleveland Indians over Boston Braves (4-2) - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 Braves were led by pitchers [[Johnny Sain]] and Hall-of-Famer [[Warren Spahn]]. In Game 1, on October 6, Sain beat [[Bob Feller]] of the Indians, 1–0, at Braves Field in front of 40,135. The Indians took Game 2, 4–1, the next day at Braves Field, with [[Bob Lemon]] beating Spahn with 39,633 in attendance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Game 2 also made television history when a live broadcast of the game was shown to passengers of the B&amp;O Railroad's train traveling between Washington, D.C. and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Train Television Shows Ball Game |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 8, 1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves and Indians returned to Boston for Game 6 on Monday October 11, 1948.

==1936 All-Star Game==
On July 7, 1936 the [[1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] was played at Braves Field, with 25,566 in attendance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/allstar/1936-allstar-game.shtml|title=1936 All-Star Game Box Score, July  7 - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National League defeated the American League, 4–3, in the 4th All-Star game, featuring over 20 future [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame]] members.

[[Lefty Grove]] and [[Dizzy Dean]] were the starting pitchers for managers [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] of the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Charlie Grimm]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/allstar/|title=All-Star Game History and Leaders - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Gehrig]] hit a home run for the American League, batting behind rookie [[Joe DiMaggio]] in the lineup.

==Longest Major League game==
On Saturday, May 1, 1920, at Braves Field, the Braves and [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]] played 26 complete innings in a game that ended in a 1–1 tie, called due to darkness by home plate umpire [[Barry McCormick]].&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="todayifoundout.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/11/the-longest-game-in-baseball-history/|title=The Longest Game by Innings in Major League Baseball History|author=|date=20 November 2012|website=todayifoundout.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1920/B05010BSN1920.htm |title=Boston Braves 1, Brooklyn Robins 1 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=May 1, 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest game, by innings, in Major League history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_gmlg.shtml |title=Game Length Records |website=[[Baseball Almanac]] |accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting pitchers [[Leon Cadore]] (Brooklyn) and [[Joe Oeschger]] (Boston) both pitched the entire game in front of 4,500 fans.

'''Campbell Field''', officially '''Marv Kay Stadium at Harry D. Campbell Field''', is an American college football stadium located in [[Golden, Colorado]]. The stadium serves as the home field of the [[Colorado Mines Orediggers]] football team representing the [[Colorado School of Mines]]. Campbell Field is one of the oldest [[American football|football]] fields in existence, the oldest west of the [[Mississippi River]] and the oldest in [[NCAA Division II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marv Kay Stadium at Harry D. Campbell Field|url=http://csmorediggers.com/Facilities/Campbell_Field|website=Colorado School of Mines athletics|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally it was a dirt surface all-purpose athletic field in exactly its current configuration, built within a clay pit, a fitting mined-out home for the Orediggers.  Its first athletic contest, held on May 20, 1893, was the first annual Colorado Inter-Collegiate Athletic Association Field Day, featuring many athletic contests between the [[University of Colorado]], [[Colorado State University|Colorado A&amp;M]], [[Colorado School of Mines]], and the [[University of Denver]], in which Mines claimed the most medals.  Its first football game took place on October 7, 1893, a 6-0 Mines victory over the University of Denver.  It has been home to the football Orediggers through all but the first five seasons of their existence (their previous home were the now-destroyed grounds at the southeast corner of 19th and Illinois streets in Golden), and has been renovated several times throughout its existence.  The field was originally called Athletic Park, renamed Brooks Field after Mines trustee and benefactor Ralph D. Brooks in 1922, and renamed Campbell Field after 1939 undefeated team member and benefactor Harry D. Campbell in 2010. Harry D. Campbell also was a football teammate of the legendary Jackie Robinson at Pasadena Junior College.   Campbell Field is the oldest football field in the west, the oldest in [[NCAA Division II]] football and the 5th oldest college football field in the nation.

==Renovations==
Historic photographs show Brooks Field as a dirt surface, without grandstands and surrounded by a board fence.  Despite such conditions it is known to have hosted crowds of spectators, who could have used nearby slopes to view games from.  Later early wooden grandstands were added to the park.  In 1922 and 1924 the current grandstands were built by noted local builder William "Cement Bill" Williams.  This featured wooden bench seats upon a steel superstructure, with home and visiting locker rooms, public restrooms and refreshment stand beneath.  In 1922 the dirt surface was converted to natural grass, part of which was scraped back to dirt surface for a [[baseball diamond]] during season each year.  Originally home also to the CSM [[baseball]] team, it became a primarily football facility in 1937 after baseball was moved to [[Darden Field]] just to the west.  During the 1930s a [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] project scooped out the slopes at the west side of Brooks Field to make room to construct a track around the surface, and it has hosted track and field events since.  Around the 1980s the grandstands were renovated to cover most wooden benches with metal surfaces and create a central concourse, along with steps down to the field level.  In 2010, the field was converted to its third surface, synthetic turf.  Plans are underway to replace the 90-year-old grandstands and update the historic field to a state-of-the-art Division II athletic facility, expanding its capacity to 5,000, to be rechristened Marv Kay Stadium at Campbell Field.

==Notable Events==
Campbell Field has hosted many notable athletes and teams over its many years of play.  Although missing out on the legendary 103-0 victory of the Orediggers over the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in 1890 as well as their first Colorado Football Association championship in 1891, it has hosted 14 championship football teams and more:

* Campbell Field hosted the latter part of the Orediggers' 18-game football winning streak against collegiate teams that spanned from 1888–1894.
* The 3rd perfect and 4th unbeaten season of the football Orediggers took place here in its inaugural season in 1893 (5-0-0, CFA Champions).
* Campbell Field hosted the latter half of the football Orediggers' streak of 6 winning seasons from 1888–1894.
* CSM's earliest known football loss at Campbell Field took place in 1894 to the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] (a 20-0 shutout).
* The first live televised football game in the Rocky Mountain region took place here on November 1, 1952, a game between the Orediggers and [[Idaho State University]].
* The first live nationally televised football game in the Rocky Mountain region took place here on November 15, 1952, a game between the Orediggers and [[Colorado College]].
* The only football playoff game at Campbell Field took place on November 13, 2004 as the Orediggers beat [[Midwestern State University]].

'''Futbol Club Casa Estrella del Benfica''' was an Andorran football club from [[La Massana]].

They have been playing in the top flight of Andorra twice in the 2008/09 and 2010/11 season. In 2014 the club was not registered in the Second Division for the 2014/15 season being out of competition and dissolved the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bondia.ad/esports/lentrada-del-ce-sant-julia-la-lliga-es-en-mans-de-la-decisio-de-la-fifa|title=L’entrada del CE Sant Julià a la Lliga és en mans de la decisió de la FIFA|author=|date=|website=bondia.ad|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goldene Peitsche''' is a [[Conditions races|Group 3]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[Germany]] open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged three years or older. It is run at [[Baden-Baden]] over a distance of 1,200 metres (about 6 furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late August or early September.

==History==
The event was established in 1867, and the inaugural running was won by Cobweb. It was initially held at [[Tempelhof]], and was transferred to [[Hoppegarten]] in 1868.

The race was switched to [[Grunewald]] in 1918, and it returned to Hoppegarten in 1923. It was not run from 1945 to 1947, and for brief spells thereafter it was staged at [[Cologne]] (1948) and [[Mülheim]] (1949, 1950 and 1952).

The Goldene Peitsche moved to Baden-Baden in 1953. It was given Group 3 status in 1973, and was promoted to Group 2 level in 1991. It was downgraded to Group 3 in 2014 only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upgrades / downgrades for 2014 |url=http://www.britishhorseracing.presscentre.com/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=262 |website=britishhorseracing.presscentre.com |accessdate=30 June 2014 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; But returned Group 2 in 2015, during Sprint Races programme update.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishhorseracing.com/press_releases/british-racing-welcomes-addition-two-group-1-races-boost-sprint-programme/ European Pattern Committee announce major changes to sprint programme from 2015 / 13 Aug 14]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Raven's Lady from England won the 148th Casino Baden-Baden Golden Whip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/baden-wuerttemberg/article181315136/Favoritin-Raven-s-Lady-gewinnt-Goldene-Peitsche-in-Iffezheim.html|title=Favoritin Raven's Lady gewinnt Goldene Peitsche in Iffezheim|last=WELT|date=2018-08-26|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.focus.de/sport/mehrsport/reiten-national-galopp-ravens-lady-gewinnt-goldene-peitsche_id_9477396.html|title=Galopp: Raven's Lady gewinnt Goldene Peitsche|last=Online|first=FOCUS|work=FOCUS Online|access-date=2018-10-16|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hang Yuen Football Club''' ({{zh|c=航源足球俱樂部|p=Háng Yuán Zúqiú Jùlèbù}}) is a football club from [[Taiwan]]. It is one of the main [[association football]] clubs in Taiwan. It was previously known as '''Air Source Development''' and is currently affiliated with [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. They will be the first Taiwanese team to take part in the [[AFC Cup]] Group Stage.

==History==
===Intercity Football League era===
The club formed as '''Air Source Development FC''' and first entered the [[Intercity Football League]] in [[2013 Intercity Football League|2013]]. The club struggled in its early years, regularly having to play in qualification rounds in order to preserve its top flight status. In 2013, the club finished 7th of 8 teams, picking up only 7 points. Though it won the next season's qualification tournament, it still finished with the same points tally next season, albeit at an improved 6th place due to [[Chiayi County FC|Chiayi County]] finishing rock bottom with 0 points. They avoided the preliminary round for the [[2015–16 Intercity Football League|2015–16 season]], but it proved to be their least successful season yet, as they followed Chiayi County in finishing bottom of the table with 0 points.
===Taiwan Premier Football League===
For the newly revamped [[2017 Taiwan Football Premier League]], Air Source Development changed their name to '''Hang Yuen FC''' and enlisted the help of [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] to improve the team's standard. This saw an immediate improvement, as Hang Yuen finished 4th in the league phase of the new top-flight structure in Taiwan. This finish allowed them to compete in the 3rd place play-off against [[Hasus TSU F.C.|Hasus TSU]]. Over two legs, Hang Yuen ran out 5-2 aggregate winners to finish 3rd in the inaugural TFPL season.

Due to the failures of [[Taipower F.C.|Taipower]] and [[Tatung F.C.|Tatung]] to obtain [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] Club Licences, Hang Yuen were granted Taiwan's place in the [[2018 AFC Cup]] Group Stage, the first club from the country to do so. Signing [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] international and former [[Major League Soccer]] midfielder [[Jean-Marc Alexandre]], the team entered into a group with [[Benfica de Macau]], and North Korean clubs [[April 25 Sports Club]] and [[Hwaebul Sports Club|Hwaebul]]. A close fought 3-2 defeat to Benfica de Macau was swiftly followed by a heave 5-1 loss to April 25.

'''Home Park''' is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Plymouth]], [[England]]. The ground, nicknamed the Theatre of Greens, has been the home of [[Football League One]] club [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] since 1901.&lt;ref name="Home Park Story"&gt;[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/sv-homeparkstory.asp The Home Park Story] Greens on Screen.

After undergoing considerable development in the 1920s and 1930s, the ground suffered heavy damage in [[World War II]]. It reopened in time for the resumption of the [[Football League]] in 1945, and underwent further improvements in the 1950s, including the installation of [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] and a new double-decker [[grandstand]]. The ground remained relatively unchanged until 2001, when construction of three new all-seater stands began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/homepark1.asp 2001 Redevelopment] Greens on Screen.

The Mayflower stand, known as the Grandstand, is currently closed for redevelopment. The other three stands are very similar in design and are linked together at the corners, having been built in 2001.

The Devonport End houses the more vocal of the club's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/FamilyAreaIndex/0,,10364,00.html Family Area] Plymouth Argyle FC.

The corner towards the East side of the ground is now the dedicated family corner. The Barn Park End is where the away supporters are housed. It holds about 3,000 spectators. The standard allocation given to visiting clubs had previously been 1,300, and this had been increased in the past whenever demand required it. although only 1,300 tickets were issued to away fans for the upcoming 2018-19 season. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballgroundguide.com/plymouth_argyle/#What%20Is%20It%20Like%20For%20Visiting%20Supporters?

Retrieved 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

All three stands have good views and standard facilities for a football stadium, including [[concourse]]s, merchandise stands and food and drink outlets. The pitch measures about 100&amp;nbsp;metres (109&amp;nbsp;yards) long by 66&amp;nbsp;metres (72&amp;nbsp;yards) wide, with a few metres of run-off space on each side. The ground also has two pitch covers, rain and frost, to protect the pitch against adverse winter weather.

==History==

===Construction and early years===
Home Park was originally used by the now defunct Devonport Albion rugby team from 1893 to 1898. Following a dispute with the ground's owners over rent, Albion left and the ground was not used for three years. In 1901 the Argyle Athletic Club obtained a lease on the ground, then an oval-shaped bowl and [[cinder]] track surrounded by [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] and farmland.&lt;ref name="100 Grounds"&gt;[http://100groundsclub.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-matchday-239-home-park.html The 100 Football Grounds] 100 Grounds Club. Retrieved 16 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The new owners staged their first event, an athletics meeting, on [[Whit Monday]] in 1901, however, leaseholder Clarence Spooner was keen for it to stage football. Following a series of successful trial matches involving Argyle Football Club, which attracted healthy crowds, Spooner made the decision to focus on establishing the first professional football club in [[Devon]].&lt;ref name="Home Park Story"/&gt; The club, formed in 1886, changed its name to Plymouth Argyle in 1903 and became professional that same year. Home Park played host to its first competitive match, against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], on 5 September 1903 in front of a crowd of 4,438. At the time the ground had one wooden grandstand which could accommodate 2,000 people, while the other three sides of the ground were surrounded by [[Tailings|slag heap]] [[Bank (geography)|banking]] with a waist-high fence.  When Argyle joined the [[Football League]] in 1920 several improvements were required to meet safety requirements.&lt;ref name="Home Park Story"/&gt;

The wooden grandstand was demolished and replaced by a much larger and more modern structure at a cost of £12,000, while concrete terracing with crush barriers were added around the other three sides of the ground. A pitched roof was erected along the main entrance at the Devonport End of the ground, to provide cover for supporters using that terrace. The new grandstand incorporated players changing rooms and club offices. Many of these facilities were built with funds provided by the official supporters club.&lt;ref name="Home Park Story"/&gt; By the 1930s the ground was regularly hosting crowds in excess of 20,000 and on 10 October 1936 the record attendance was set. A crowd of 43,596 were in attendance to watch the club play out a 2–2 draw with [[Aston Villa]] in the [[Football League Second Division]]. The ground continued to host Second Division football until the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouthdata.info/Second%20World%20War-1941-Blitz.htm The Plymouth Blitz] Plymouth Data.

===Wartime bombing===
The city of [[Plymouth]] was hit hard during the [[World War II|Second World War]] due to its strength as a military base: [[HMNB Devonport]] was the largest naval base in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/establishments/naval-bases-and-air-stations/hmnb-devonport/ HMNB Devonport] Royal Navy. Retrieved 16 January 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414144639/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/establishments/naval-bases-and-air-stations/hmnb-devonport/ |date=14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ground was so close to the city centre and [[Plymouth Sound]], it was unlikely that it would escape unharmed. The [[Football League]] was abandoned three games into the [[1939–40 in English football|1939–40 season]], but Home Park continued to host matches until summer 1940 in the hastily organised [[1939–40 in English football#League South-West|South West Regional League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/gosdb-season.asp?years=1939-1940 1939–40 Season] Greens on Screen. Retrieved 16 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1941 there was a series of [[Luftwaffe]] bombing raids on the city, known as the [[Plymouth Blitz]]; Home Park did not escape. The Grandstand was all but destroyed after sustaining multiple hits and the pitch was littered with impact craters, which left the club facing a major rebuilding operation when the war ended in 1945.

===Post-War===
[[Image:Home Park 1996.jpg|right|thumb|Home Park in 1996.]]
Several drastic measures were required to be ready for the resumption of a regionalised [[Football League]] in 1945. Disused [[Nissen hut|army huts]] were used as changing rooms, buses and trams were used as offices, and [[railway sleeper]]s were used for terracing.&lt;ref name="Home Park Story"/&gt; The Football League was still split into [[Football League North and South|North and South]] divisions, having been created four years earlier in order for the League to continue whilst limiting the amount of travel by teams during the war. The [[1945–46 in English football|1945–46 season]] was its only full campaign. Records from this time tend not to be included in official records. Plymouth Argyle's first official match back at the ground for six years was played on 31 August 1946. 25,659 spectators watched a 3–1 victory against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the Second Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/gosdb-season.asp?years=1946-1947 1946–47 Season] Greens on Screen. Retrieved 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new double-decker Grandstand was built in 1952, one of the last to be based on the template made popular during the 1920s and 30s by prolific football stadium architect [[Archibald Leitch]], with [[floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] installed in October 1953.&lt;ref name="100 Grounds"/&gt; Running the length of the pitch, it had standing room in the first tier, known as the Mayflower Terrace, and wooden seating in the second tier.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://100groundsclub.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-matchday-239-home-park.html Home Park] 100 Grounds. Retrieved 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When a roof was erected on the Lyndhurst side of the ground in 1964, three quarters of the ground were under cover, with all but the second tier of the Grandstand being standing room. In the [[1969–70 in English football|1969–70 season]] seats were added at the back of the Mayflower Terrace, which took the [[seating capacity]] to 4,100 and the overall capacity to 40,000.&lt;ref name="100 Grounds"/&gt; In the late 1970s the pitched roof at the Devonport End of the ground had to be removed for safety reasons.&lt;ref name="Home Park Story"/&gt; It was replaced in 1984 by a non-pitched structure, leaving just the Barn Park End uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stadiums.football.co.uk/Images/Photos/Large/39-1.jpg Home Park Pre-2001] Football Stadiums. Retrieved 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground remained relatively unchanged throughout the 1990s, aside from the Lyndhurst Stand being made all-seater. However, its future seemed unclear when the club outlined plans to move to a new site in [[Central Park, Plymouth|Central Park]] in 1996. The Plymouth Tradium, designed by [[Alfred McAlpine]], would have seated 25,000, and also incorporated community sports and leisure facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/1997-start-planned-for-tradium/949682.article Plymouth Tradium] CN Plus. Retrieved 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end nothing came of it and the club instead focused on redeveloping Home Park, with many parts of the old ground showing their age by the start of the 21st century.

===2001-02 redevelopment===
[[Image:Home Park before Plymouth v Burnley.jpg|left|thumb|225px|alt=A panorama of a semi-full football stadium with green seats on a sunny day.|Devonport End in 2009.]]
A new plan, based on wholesale redevelopment of the existing ground, was announced in 2000 which at the time would cost an estimated £9m. The stadium would be built in two phases, with the first phase seeing the complete redevelopment of the Devonport End, Lyndhurst Stand, and Barn Park End. The second phase involved the Mayflower Grandstand which would be replaced by a new three-tiered structure to complete an 18,500 capacity all-seater bowl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/groundtastic.htm Groundtastic] Greens on Screen. Retrieved 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The green light came in June 2001 when the club and [[Plymouth#City Council|Plymouth City Council]] agreed a new long-term lease for the ground. The building firm [[Barr Construction Ltd|Barr Construction]] moved onto the site two months later.

During the first six months of the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–2002 season]] supporters watched the club's matches from one touchline before the first phase was completed in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/season0102.asp 2001–02 Season] Greens on Screen.

The former chairman of Plymouth Argyle, [[Paul Stapleton]], declared that not completing the project was the biggest disappointment of his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1711815,00.html Passing On The Baton] Plymouth Argyle FC.

===Freehold purchase and conversion to all seater===
The club purchased the freehold of the ground from [[Plymouth#City Council|Plymouth City Council]] to become sole owners in December 2006 for £2.7m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2006/12/20/home_park_purchase_feature.shtml Argyle Complete Buy-Out] BBC News.

Retrieved 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, planning permission was finally given to revamp and rebuild the Mayflower Grandstand. No work however was carried out until 2018 when the redevelopment of the Grandstand and the surrounding area began.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Home Park development given go-ahead by Plymouth City Council|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42358054 |date=14 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main redevelopment would include the fitting of new seats in the top tier, replacing the antiquated wooden ones, fitting new seats on the terrace, and replacing the roof. For players, there would be a new changing room block and a new tunnel to the East side of the ground in the corner of the Grandstand and the Barn Park End.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Signed and Sealed|url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/2018/august/signed-and-sealed/ |date=8 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grandstand was subsequently shut to spectators for the entirety of the [[2018-19 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season|2018-19 season]], severely reducing Home Park's capacity. To each side of the stand there used to stand two separate buildings, to the east was the Chisholm Lounge which was used for hospitality, as a press area and was home to the Argyle [[disc jockey]] until its demolition in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=The Chisholm Lounge is next to be demolished at Home Park |url=https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/chisholm-lounge-next-demolished-plymouth-1638233 |date=4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the Chisholm Lounge was the supporter's bar, known as the 'Far Post Club'. This was also demolished to make way for a new supporter's bar, to be funded by fan group 'The Green Taverners'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=The Best Bar None|url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/2018/january/gts-bar/ |date=29 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of the Grandstand was a disabled enclosure, which too was demolished to make way for new buildings, this time for a new club shop.

[[File:Rockefeller-ice.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Center]] ice rink]]
An '''ice rink''' (or '''ice skating rink''') is a frozen body of water and/or hardened chemicals where people can [[ice skate]] or play [[winter sport]]s. Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include [[ice hockey]], [[bandy]], [[rink bandy]], [[ringette]], [[broomball]], [[speed skating]], [[figure skating]], [[ice stock sport]] and [[curling]] as well as exhibitions, contests and ice shows. There are two types of rinks in prevalent use today: natural, where [[ice|freezing]] occurs from cold ambient temperatures, and artificial (or mechanically frozen), where a [[coolant]] produces cold temperatures in the surface below the water, causing the water to freeze. There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics.

==Etymology==
''Rink'', a [[Scottish English|Scottish]] word meaning 'course', was used as the name of a place where [[curling]] was played. The name has been retained for the construction of ice areas for other sports and uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The sporting Scots of nineteenth-century Canada |author=Redmond, Gerald |year=1982 |publisher=Associated University Presses Inc. |location=Toronto, Ontario |page=271 |isbn=0-8386-3069-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Glaciarium Ice Rink.jpg|thumb|230x230px|right|Interior of the ''[[Glaciarium]]'' in 1876]]
Early attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were first made in the 'rink mania' of 1841–44. As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog's [[lard]] and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of [[Eliakim Littell]]'s ''Living Age'' headed "The Glaciarium" reported that "This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' [[Tottenham Court Road]], was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
 
By 1844, these venues fell out of fashion, as customers grew tired of the 'smelly' ice substitute, and it was only thirty years later, that refrigeration technology developed to the point that natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink. The world's first mechanically frozen ice rink was the ''[[Glaciarium]]'', opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the [[Kings Road]] in [[Chelsea, London]], on 7 January 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusholmearchive.org/ice-skating-in-rusholme|title='The Manchester Real Ice Skating rink Company'|publisher=Rusholme and Victoria Park Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring {{convert|40|by|24|ft}} was established.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ul7PAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Martin+C.+Harris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7SOKUoznHpKg7AbTqYGIDA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA|title=Homes of British Ice Hockey|author=Martin C. Harris|year=2005|publisher=History Press Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rink was based on a concrete surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and timber planks. Atop these were laid oval [[copper]] pipes carrying a solution of [[glycerine]] with [[ether]], [[nitrogen peroxide]] and [[water]]. The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into [[ice]]. Gamgee discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and [[patented]] it as early as 1870.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

[[File:Museumplein, IJsclub. Uitgave N.J. Boon, Amsterdam (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ice rink in [[Amsterdam]] c. 1900, from the [[Amsterdam City Archives]]]]
Gamgee operated the rink on a membership-only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele, experienced in open-air [[ice skating]] during winters in the [[Alps]].  He installed an [[orchestra]] gallery, which could also be used by spectators, and decorated the walls with views of the [[Swiss Alps]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

The rink initially proved a success, and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year: at [[Rusholme]] in [[Manchester]] and the "Floating Glaciarium" at [[Charing Cross]] in London, this last significantly larger at {{convert|115|by|25|ft}}. The Southport Glaciarium opened in 1879, using Gamgee's method.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

In Germany, the first ice skating rink opened in 1882 in [[Frankfurt]] during a patent exhibition. It covered 520m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and operated for two months; the refrigeration system was designed by Linde,&lt;ref&gt;Linde AG: "75 Jahre Linde", 1954, S. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and it was probably the first skating rink where [[Ammonia]] was used as a refrigerant. Ten years later, a larger rink was permanently installed on the same site.

The oldest indoor artificial ice rink still in existence (built 1909-10) and in use is the one in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]'s [[Matthews Arena]], on the campus of [[Northeastern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonu.com/sports/2010/1/28/matthewsarena.aspx?id=204 |title=Northeastern University Athletics Official Website |publisher=Gonu.com |date= |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Katy Fitzpatrick |url=http://www.uscho.com/news/college-hockey/id,17170/NUHuskieslookingforwardtorenovatedArenanewseason.html |title="New Season Brings Renovated Arena for Northeastern," '&amp;#39;USCHO.com'&amp;#39;, October 2, 2009 |publisher=Uscho.com |date=October 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109213027/http://www.uscho.com/news/college-hockey/id%2C17170/NUHuskieslookingforwardtorenovatedArenanewseason.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Natural ice===
[[File:Rideau Canal Skateway Ottawa - 2.jpeg|thumb|A portion of the [[Rideau Canal]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, the world's largest naturally frozen ice rink]]
[[File:Backyard hockey.jpg|thumb|Children playing ice hockey on a backyard rink in Canada]]
Many ice rinks consist of, or are found on, open bodies of [[water]] such as lakes, ponds, canals, and sometimes rivers; these can only be used in the [[winter]] in climates where the surface would freeze thickly enough to support human weight. Rinks can also be made in cold climates by enclosing a level area of ground, filling it with water, and letting it freeze. [[Snow]] may even be packed to use as a containment material.

A famous example of this type of rink is the [[Rideau Canal]] Skateway in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, estimated at {{Convert|1782000|sqft}} and {{Convert|7.8|km}} long, which is equivalent to 90 Olympic size skating rinks.&lt;ref name="For the record"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-4000/largest-naturally-frozen-icerink/|publisher=www.guinnessworldrecords.com
 |title=For the record|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rink is prepared by lowering the canal's water level and letting the canal water freeze. The rink is then resurfaced nightly by cleaning the ice of snow and flooding it with water from below the ice. The rink is recognized as the "world's largest naturally frozen ice rink" by the Guinness Book of World Records because "''its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length''".&lt;ref name="For the record"/&gt;

The longest ice skating trail can be found in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, on Lake Windermere Whiteway.  The naturally frozen trail measures {{Convert|29.98|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/5000/longest-ice-skating-trail|publisher=www.guinnessworldrecords.com
 |title=For the record|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial ice===
[[File:Pista de hielo móvil.jpg|thumb|left|A typical mobile ice skating rink near the Spanish Costa Brava]]
[[File:SM Ice Rink at Manila's Megamall.jpg|thumb|[[SM Supermalls|SM]] Skating Rink at [[SM Megamall|Metro Manila's Megamall]] located in [[Ortigas Center|Ortigas]]]]

In any climate, an arena ice surface can be installed in a properly built space. This consists of a bed of sand or occasionally a slab of [[concrete]], through (or on top of) which pipes run. The pipes carry a chilled fluid (usually either a salt brine or water with [[antifreeze]], or in the case of smaller rinks, [[refrigerant]]) which can lower the temperature of the slab so that water placed atop will freeze. This method is known as 'artificial ice' to differentiate from ice rinks made by simply freezing water in a cold climate, indoors or outdoors, although both types are of frozen water. A more proper technical term is 'mechanically frozen' ice.

A famous example of this type of rink is the outdoor rink at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York city|New York]].

====Construction====
[[File:WWIP Componentes pista de hielo móvil.jpg|thumb|Simple drawing of the main components of an ice skating rink]]

Modern rinks have a specific procedure for preparing the surface. With the pipes cold, a thin layer of water is sprayed on the sand or concrete to seal and level it (or in the case of concrete, to keep it from being marked). This thin layer is painted white or pale blue for better contrast; markings necessary for hockey or curling are also placed, along with logos or other decorations. Another thin layer of water is sprayed on top of this. The ice is built up to a thickness of 3/4ths an inch to 1 1/2 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetice.com/faq2|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Jet Ice|author=|date=|website=www.jetice.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry standard in the NHL is around 1 1/2".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Synthetic===
{{main|Synthetic ice}}
Synthetic rinks are constructed from a solid polymer material designed for skating using normal metal-bladed ice skates. High density polyethelene (HDPE) and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene]] (UHMW) are the only materials that offer reasonable skating characteristics, with UHMW synthetic rinks offering the most ice-like skating but also being the most expensive. A typical synthetic rink will consist of many panels of thin surface material assembled on top of a sturdy, level and smooth sub-floor (anything from concrete to wood or even dirt or grass) to create a large skating area.

==Operation==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Periodically after the ice has been used, it is resurfaced using a machine called an [[ice resurfacer]] (sometimes colloquially referred to as a [[Zamboni Company|Zamboni]] – referring to a major manufacturer of such machinery). For curling, the surface is 'pebbled' by allowing loose drops of cold water to fall onto the ice and freeze into rounded peaks.

Between events, especially if the arena is being used without need for the ice surface, it is either covered with a heavily insulated floor or melted by allowing the fluid in the pipes below the ice to warm.

A highly specialized form of rink is used for [[speed skating]]; this is a large [[Oval (geometry)|oval]] (or ''ring'') much like an athletic track. Because of their limited use, speed skating ovals are far less common than hockey or curling rinks.

Those skilled at preparing arena ice are often in demand for major events where ice quality is critical. The popularity of the sport of hockey in [[Canada]] has led its icemakers to be particularly sought after. One such team of professionals was responsible for placing a [[loonie]] coin under center ice at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]; as both Canadian teams (men's and women's) won their respective hockey gold medals, the coin was christened "lucky" and is now in the possession of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/olypress.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130640/http://www.hhof.com/html/olypress.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after having been retrieved from beneath the ice.

==Standard rink sizes==

===Bandy===
{{main|Bandy field}}
[[File:Bandy in Medeu Kazakhstan.JPG|thumb|[[Bandy]] at [[Medeo]]]]
In [[bandy]], the rink size is {{convert|90|-|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} x {{convert|45|-|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. For internationals, the size must not be smaller than {{convert|100|m}} x {{convert|60|m}}. The variety [[rink bandy]] is played on ice hockey rinks.

===Figure skating===
{{main|Figure skating rink}}
The size of figure skating rinks can be quite variable, but the [[International Skating Union]] prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. These are 60 meters by 30 meters.  The ISU specifies that competition rinks must not be larger than this and not smaller than 56 meters by 26 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-206192-223415-177357-0-file,00.pdf |title= Special Regulations &amp; Technical Rules: Single &amp; Pair Skating and Ice Dance 2012 |publisher= International Skating Union |format= PDF |date= June 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201118/http://www.isu.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0%2C11040%2C4844-206192-223415-177357-0-file%2C00.pdf |archivedate= 29 October 2013 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
{{Main|Ice hockey rink}}
There are basically two rink sizes in use, although there is a great deal of variation in the dimensions of actual ice rinks. Historically, earlier ice rinks were smaller than today.

Official [[National Hockey League]] rinks are {{convert|26|x|61|m|abbr=on}}.  The dimensions originate from the size of the [[Victoria Skating Rink]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.
Official Olympic/[[International Ice Hockey Federation|International]] rinks have dimensions of {{convert|30|x|60|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

===Speed skating===
[[File:Speed skating 2012 olympics.JPG|thumb|[[Speed skating]] at [[OlympiaWorld Innsbruck|Olympia Eisstadion]] in [[Innsbruck]]]]
In [[speed skating]], for [[Short track speed skating|short track]], the official [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] rink size is 30 x 60 meters, with an oval ice track of 111.12 meters in circumference. In [[long track speed skating]] the oval ice track is usually 400 meters in circumference.

      <comment>Revert 66.44.110.10--Not an improvement; "near infield" is an undefined term with or without the Official Baseball Rules</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18675">[[File:Infield fly.jpg|thumb|An umpire calls an infield fly.]]
The '''infield fly rule''' is a [[Sport rule|rule]] of [[baseball]] that treats certain [[Fly ball (baseball)|fly balls]] as though caught, before the ball is caught, even if the [[infielder]] fails to catch it or drops it on purpose. The umpire's declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. The rule exists to prevent the defense from achieving a [[double play]] or [[triple play]] by failing to catch a ball that an infielder could catch with ordinary effort. The rule is limited to apply only in situations where this result is possible.

==Reasoning==
A ball batted into the air subjects baserunners to a dilemma. If the ball is caught, they must return to their original base; if not caught, the batter becomes a runner and certain runners are [[Force play|forced]] to advance to the next base. Baserunners study the fielder and advance only far enough from the base to ensure that they can return safely. If a presumed catch becomes a non-catch, forced runners must run forward instead of back. This creates an advantage for the defense in intentionally failing to execute an easy catch, which the infield fly rule exists to remove.

==Rule==
The infield fly rule is explained in the [[Official Baseball Rules]] in two places:
*Definitions of terms: Infield Fly
*Rule 5.09 (Batter is out)

The rule applies only when there are fewer than two outs, and there is a [[force play]] at third base (i.e., when there are runners at first and second base, or the [[bases loaded|bases are loaded]]).&lt;ref name="MLBdef"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp|work=Official Baseball Rules|title=2.00 Definition of Terms|publisher=Professional Baseball Playing Rules Committee, [[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these situations, if a [[fair ball|fair]] [[Batted ball|fly ball]] is in play, and in the umpire's judgment is catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort, the umpire shall call "infield fly" (or more often, "infield fly, batter is out") and the batter will be out&lt;ref name="MLBrules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp|work=Official Baseball Rules|title=6.00 The Batter|publisher=Professional Baseball Playing Rules Committee, Major League Baseball|date=|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of whether the ball is actually [[catch (baseball)|caught]]. [[Umpire (baseball)|Umpires]] typically raise the right arm straight up, index finger pointing up, to signal the rule is in effect.

If "infield fly" is called and the fly ball is caught, it is treated exactly as an ordinary caught fly ball; the batter is out, there is no force, and the runners must [[tag up]]. On the other hand, if "infield fly" is called and the ball lands fair without being caught, the batter is still out, there is still no force, but the runners ''are not'' required to tag up. In either case, the ball is [[live ball|live]], and the runners may advance on the play, at their own peril.

An infield fly may be declared by any umpire on the field.

==="Umpire's judgment"===
The infield fly rule is a judgment call, as the rule states that "The judgment of the umpire must govern".&lt;ref name="MLBdef" /&gt; The rule directs the umpire to declare an infield fly immediately on determining that the play meets the criteria described above, solely based on the umpire's discretion. Since different umpires may have different definitions of what constitutes "ordinary effort," the rule may be applied differently depending on the umpire and game conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closecallsports.com/2012/05/rule-200-infield-fly-and-605e-getting.html|title=Rule 2.00 Infield Fly and 6.05(e): Getting to Know the Rule|work=Close Call Sports|date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Catchable by an infielder"===
Any fair fly ball that could be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort is covered by the rule, whether or not it is in the infield, and whether or not an infielder catches it, or even attempts to catch it. For example, if an infielder retreats to the outfield in an effort to catch a fly ball, the infield fly rule may be invoked because the ball could have been caught by the infielder. Similarly, infield fly may also be called if an ''outfielder'' runs into the infield to catch a fly ball, if it could have been caught by an infielder with ordinary effort. It may be helpful to think of it as the "''infielder'' fly rule". Specifically, the rule states an infield fly call should be determined by "whether the ball could ordinarily have been handled by an infielder, not by some arbitrary limitation such as the grass, or the base lines. The umpire must rule also that a ball is an infield fly, even if handled by an outfielder, if, in the umpire's judgment, the ball could have been as easily handled by an infielder."

==="Ordinary effort"===
The term "ordinary effort" considers all circumstances, including weather, lighting, positioning of the defense, and the abilities of the players involved in the play. A fly ball catchable with ordinary effort in Major League Baseball might not be in a junior high school game, due to the ability of the players involved.

===Foul balls===
If the fly ball is near the foul lines, the umpire is to declare "infield fly, if fair". If the ball is not caught and ends up foul (including if it lands fair and then rolls foul before passing first or third base without being touched by a fielder), the infield fly call is canceled, and the play is treated as an ordinary foul ball. In contrast, if the ball lands foul and then rolls fair before passing first or third base without being touched, the infield fly takes effect and the batter is out.&lt;ref name="MLBdef" /&gt;

===Statistics===
Declarations of the infield fly rule are not included in the statistical summary of a baseball game and are not a separate category in player statistics.

A fielder who misplays an infield fly is not charged with an error because the batter is out through the infield fly rule. In fact, the fielder who should have caught an infield fly earns a putout. But a fielder who fails to touch an infield fly that then rolls foul may be charged with an error for letting the ball roll foul; the batter is not out, and the misplay prolongs the batter's time at bat.

==History==
The rule was first introduced in 1895 by the National League in response to infielders intentionally dropping [[batted ball|pop-up]]s to get multiple outs by forcing out the runners on base, who were pinned near their bases while the ball was in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Marazzi, Rich. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_1_63/ai_111112267 "Baseball rules corner: many players unaware of tag requirements when Infield Fly rule is called"], ''[[Baseball Digest]]'', January 2004. Accessed September 30, 2007. "The batter is automatically declared out, but the runners may attempt to advance at their own risk. The purpose of the rule, instituted in 1895, is to protect runners from deceitful acts by members of the defense."&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the rule only applied with one man out.

The current rule came into effect in 1901. It was amended in 1904 to not apply to [[line drive]]s, and in 1920 to not apply to [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===2008 World Series===
In the fifth game of the [[2008 World Series]] between the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, [[Pedro Feliz]] of the Phillies hit a pop-up to the right side of the infield with runners on first and second and one out, in strong rain and swirling winds, and the infield fly rule was not invoked. Umpiring crew chief [[Tim Tschida]] explained that "The infield fly rule requires the umpires' judgment to determine whether or not a ball can be caught with ordinary effort, and that includes wind" and that the umpires' determination was that in this case there was no infielder who could make the play with "ordinary effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheehan|first1=Joe|title=Unconventional Thinking: MLB makes right decision to cancel|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/10/28/sheehan.cancelled/?bcnn=yes|accessdate=April 19, 2016|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=October 28, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104105241/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/10/28/sheehan.cancelled/?bcnn=yes|archivedate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 National League Wild Card Game===
In the eighth inning of the [[2012 National League Wild Card Game]] between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Andrelton Simmons]] of the Braves hit a pop-up into shallow left field with one out and men on first and second bases.  Cardinals shortstop [[Pete Kozma]], who was playing in normal position, ran out to left field to catch the ball while left fielder [[Matt Holliday]], who was playing very deep in left, ran in to catch it as well. Although Kozma initially called to catch the ball, as the ball came down, he suddenly moved out of the way and the ball fell between him and Holliday. While it initially appeared that Simmons (the batter) had safely reached first base and the Braves had the bases loaded with one out, Simmons was called out because left field umpire [[Sam Holbrook]] had called "infield fly" just before the ball hit the ground, and the Braves now had runners at second and third with two out, instead of bases loaded with one out. The Braves did not score in the inning, and the Cardinals went on to win the game, 6–3, eliminating the Braves from the postseason.

After the call, angry Braves fans began [[2012 National League Wild Card Game#The game|throwing plastic bottles and other debris]] onto the field, causing the game to be delayed for nearly 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="2012wildcard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8467263/st-louis-cardinals-atlanta-braves-nl-wild-card-game-halted-fans-protest-infield-fly-call?ex_cid=Twitter_espn_8467263|title=Wild-card game stopped after call|work=Associated Press/ESPN|date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played by the Braves under an official protest from their manager, but shortly after the game, [[Joe Torre]], MLB executive vice president for baseball operations, denied the protest, citing umpire's judgment.

==Additional details==
===Umpires' signals===
As the infield fly rule is a special case, umpires signal one another at the start of an at-bat to remind one another that the game situation puts the rule into effect. A typical signal is to touch the brim of the cap so as to show the number of outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Second base unoccupied===
The infield fly rule is not in effect if there is no runner on second base. Provided the batter runs to first base, the greatest benefit the defense could achieve by intentionally letting the fly ball drop untouched is to force out the runner at second rather than the batter, resulting in a runner on first base either way. However, if the batter is significantly slower than the runner, the defense may elect to let the ball drop untouched and achieve the force play, replacing the runner at first base with the batter.

Risks for the defense are that the uncaught ball may roll away from the fielder, and any runner on third base can try to score but has the option of remaining on his base.

If the batter gives up on the play, the defense can achieve outs at second base and first base by deliberately letting the ball drop untouched.

===Intentional drop rule===
A related rule called the intentional drop rule (Rule 5.09(a)(12)) applies even when second base is unoccupied (so long as first-base is occupied), and applies even when the batted ball is a [[line drive]] or a [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] that could be caught on the fly. This rule likewise prevents a fielder from deliberately dropping a ball and thereby achieving a double or triple play. If an umpire invokes this rule, the drop is ruled a catch, the ball is dead, and no baserunner may advance. The rule is not invoked when a fielder plays a ball on a bounce that might have been caught on the fly, or a fielder lets the ball fall to the ground without catching the palm of the mitt, or, in the judgment of the umpire, the ball was mishandled and not cleanly caught.

===Runner advancement===
For the runners, an infield fly is little different from an ordinary fly ball. If an infield fly is caught, the runners must retouch their original bases ("tag up") after the catch before attempting to advance. If an infield fly is not caught, no tag up is required and the runners may advance at their own risk. The only difference is that the umpire's declaration that the batter is out removes force plays and gives runners the option of staying on the base.

The infield fly rule states that runners may advance "after the ball is touched". This rule governs the tag up if the infield fly is caught. The runner does not need to wait on base until the fielder achieves full control of the ball. There is no need to tag up at any time if the ball is dropped. There is no concept of tagging up under the intentional drop rule, as base advances are not allowed.

===Hit runners===
A runner hit by an infield fly while standing on a base is also protected from being declared out due to interference, unless this interference is deemed intentional (which appeared in the rules in 1940).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://eteamz.active.com/gcllak/files/InfieldFlyRule.pdf Infield Fly Rule at eteamz.active.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule not declared===
The rulebook definition of Infield Fly&lt;ref name="MLBdef" /&gt; says the umpire "shall immediately declare 'Infield Fly' for the benefit of the runners." However, sometimes they do not. As in the anecdote above from 2008, there may be doubt as to whether the ball was catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort. If not called, the infield fly rule is not in effect. The same definition includes a comment that "The infield fly is in no sense to be considered an appeal play." This suggests that the batter cannot be ruled out retroactively to settle a debate that occurs after the play ends.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/rulebookedge/rule-misconceptions/infield-fly Infield Fly Rule on Rulebook Edge]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Major League Baseball, the umpires are likely to correct their mistake if it leads to an unfair double or triple play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-excellence.com/sbaseballforums/printthread.cfm?Forum=2&amp;Topic=9374 Discussion at baseball-excellence.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Baserunners should learn what options they have, both on a routine fly out and a fly out declared an infield fly. Fielders should understand that declaration of the infield fly rule removes the force play and that a runner is only out if tagged.

==Batter passing another runner==
In adult baseball, a fly ball usually reaches the fielder before the batter can run the 90 feet to first base. However, in youth baseball, the distance between bases is shorter, and in some youth leagues, the infield fly rule is not in effect.

In this case, a baserunning gambit can be used to avoid a double or triple play. A fast batter may reach first base before the pop fly reaches the fielder. If the fielder fails to catch the ball, then the batter runs toward second base while the runner originally on first base remains there. Under Rule 7.08(h), the batter is out for passing a preceding runner, and under Rule 7.08(c), this out removes the force so that other runners are able to remain on their bases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheeptalk.wordpress.com/2009/05/16/minimax-solution-to-the-infield-fly/ "Minimax Solution of the Infield Fly"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The infield fly rule and legal theory==
The infield fly rule was the subject of an article in U.S. legal history. [[William S. Stevens]] was a law student in 1975 when he anonymously published ''[[The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule]]'' in the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5322&amp;context=penn_law_review "Aside, The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule,"] anonymous, 123 Univ. Penn. Law Review 1474 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  The article was humorous but also insightful on how common law related to codified regulation of behavior.  It has been cited in numerous legal decisions and in subsequent literature.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., "The Contribution of the Infield Fly Rule to Western Civilization (and vice versa)," Anthony D'Amato, Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 100, No. 1 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jones AT&amp;T Stadium''', previously known as '''Clifford B. and Audrey Jones Stadium''' and '''Jones SBC Stadium''', is an outdoor athletic [[stadium]] on the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]], United States, built in the style of [[Spanish Renaissance architecture]]. It is the home field of the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football]] team of the [[Big 12 Conference]].

==History==

===Planning and funding===
Clifford B. and Audrey Jones Stadium opened in [[1947 in sports|1947]]. The original [[seating capacity]] was 27,000.

===Expansion===
In 1959 the stadium's first expansion raised the seating to 41,500.  The existing east stands were moved a few feet at a time via steel rollers upon Santa Fe Railroad rails and moved {{convert|150|ft|m}} further east, and the playing surface was lowered 28 feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/sports-red-raiders-football/2015-08-28/texas-tech-1000-defining-moments-growing-jones-stadium|title=Texas Tech at 1,000, defining moments: Growing Jones Stadium|first=Don|last=Williams|date=|website=lubbockonline.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; below street level, to accommodate the new lower bowl.  It was expanded again in 1972 with new red, metal seats on the north side bringing capacity of 48,000.

===Modernization===
[[File:Jones stadium texas tech.jpg|thumb|left|View (looking south) at night in August 2010 with construction of the east side ongoing]]

The largest renovation project to date was the construction of a $51.9&amp;nbsp;million, {{convert|175000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} press box on the stadium's west side that included luxury suites, club seating and decks for television cameras and the [[Mass media|press]]. The project added 2,000 seats and was completed during the [[2003 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|2003 season]].

The stadium name was changed to '''Jones SBC Stadium''' in [[2000 in sports|2000]] due to a [[naming rights]] agreement with [[SBC Communications]],{{ref|SBCArticle}} then being led by Texas Tech alumnus and CEO [[Edward Whitacre, Jr.]]. SBC Communications funded a large part of the stadium's West Stadium Club expansion. On April 6, 2006, the facility officially changed names again, this time to Jones AT&amp;T Stadium as a result of SBC's purchase of [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] and adoption of AT&amp;T as its new corporate name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. Delivered|url=http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/040606aaa.html|publisher=Texas Tech Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|date=April 6, 2006|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]], the stadium was upgraded with a $2 million inner field wall that matches the traditional Texas Tech style brick façade. An inscribing of [[the Matador Song]] at the [[Double T]] in the north and south end zones was also added.

In February 2006, the university announced plans to add $60&amp;nbsp;million worth of upgrades including additional luxury suites, a 1,000-car parking garage, an upper deck, a facade on the east side of the stadium and more seating. The entire project was set to begin following the 2006 season but was cancelled before being re-initiated as a different project in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jones AT&amp;T renovations put on hold|first=Elliott|last=Blackburn|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/072506/col_072506009.shtml|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=July 25, 2006|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Side Building===
[[File:Jones Stadium East Side Building.JPG|thumb|left|The east side building post-completion]]
On August 7, 2008, the Texas Tech Board of Regents announced a $25&amp;nbsp;million expansion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expansion of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium Expected to Bring More Than Appeal|first=Adam|last=Coleman|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2008/08/25/News/Expansion.Of.Jones.Att.Stadium.Expected.To.Bring.More.Than.Appeal-3402150.shtml|newspaper=[[The Daily Toreador]]|location=Texas Tech University|date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned expansion added a [[Spanish Renaissance architecture|Spanish Renaissance]]-themed façade to the east side of the stadium. In addition to the improvements to the exterior of the facility, the expansion added 1,000 general-admission seats, 550 club seats, and 26 suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tech Rallies Funding for Stadium's East Side|first=Don|last=Williams|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/080708/spo_315089828.shtml|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=August 7, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Tech allocated a total of $19&amp;nbsp;million to the expansion and added another $6&amp;nbsp;million through fund-raising initiatives.&lt;ref name=Build&gt;{{cite news |title=New Expansion Plan for Texas Tech Jones AT&amp;T Stadium|url=http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=8808300|work=[[KCBD]]|location=Lubbock|date=August 7, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2008, university officials announced that the project's fundraising goal had been exceeded. Most of the money came from private donations, including a large contribution from AT&amp;T and a $1M matching gift from [[Texas Tech University System|Texas Tech System]] Board of Regents member, Larry Anders. A small amount of the funds was delegated to come from future ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tech Stadium Expansion Set After Funding Goal Met|first=Marlena|last=Hartz|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/112008/loc_357959716.shtml|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061242/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/112008/loc_357959716.shtml|archive-date=2013-09-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking ceremonies for the expansion took place on November 29, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fundraising Goals Reached for Jones AT&amp;T Stadium Expansion|first=David|last=McClure|url=http://today.ttu.edu/2008/11/stadium-expansion-goals-reached/|work=Texas Tech Today|publisher=[[Texas Tech University]]|date=November 19, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began following the [[2008 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|2008 season]], and was completed in 2010, bringing the total amount of suites to 89 and seating capacity to 60,454.&lt;ref name=Build /&gt;&lt;ref name="lubbockonline.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=East Side of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium Is Ready for Today's Kickoff|first=Courtney|last=Lineham|url=http://lubbockonline.com/sports-/-red-raiders-/-football/2010-09-05/east-side-jones-att-stadium-ready-todays-kickoff|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=September 5, 2010|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MediaGuide2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=2010 Media Supplement|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/text/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2010FBmediasupplement.pdf|publisher=Texas Tech Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North end zone===
In May 2009, it was announced an additional 6,100 seats would be added in the northeast and northwest end zones by mid-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jones Takes Next Steps in Expansion|first=Don|last=Williams|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/051009/spo_438241960.shtml|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=May 10, 2009|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The additional general admission seating was opened in the north end of the stadium on October 24, 2009, bringing capacity at that time to 58,930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tickets Available In New North End Zone Seating|url=http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100809aaa.html|publisher=Texas Tech Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|date=November 1, 2009|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, construction began adding another 368 seats in the north end zone, in addition to an observation decks that holds 40. The $16 million project also included a significantly upgraded [[jumbotron]] with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed [[colonnade]], and a new north end zone concourse connecting the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157 feet of ribbon board were added on the north end zone; more than 160 linear feet in the northeast and northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal feet in the south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed in November 2013.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{cite news |title=Expansion on Jones AT&amp;T Stadium to begin Jan. 2013|first=Catherine|last=McKee|url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_f2b5fb50-463b-11e2-af05-001a4bcf6878.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Toreador]]|location=Texas Tech University|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of these renovations, the Double T scoreboard was also updated with new white [[light emitting diode|LED]] panels and many seats in the stadium were repainted red. Additionally, AT&amp;T completed an upgrade to its [[distributed antenna system]] in the stadium, increasing data capacity and call reliability.&lt;ref name=Enhancements&gt;{{cite web |title=Gameday Enhancements Announced for 2013 Football Season|url=http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/090413aaf.html|publisher=Texas Tech Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2016 season, the north end zone was further renovated. What was the ticket office was converted into a club area and premium loge seating was added outside. A remnant of the grass berm that originally encircled the north bowl was converted from grass to artificial turf as well.

===South end zone===

On August 29, 2014, a $185 million fundraising campaign was announced for multiple athletic projects. It is the first solely athletic focused campaign started by the university. The headlining project of the campaign is a renovation of the south end zone athletic offices into a premium seating area with luxury suites. Replacing of stadium seatbacks and FieldTurf is also included in the project's budget.&lt;ref name=SEZ&gt;{{cite web|title=The Campaign For Fearless Champions|url=http://www.texastech.com/genrel/082914aad.html|website=TexasTech.com|publisher=Texas Tech University|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Scoreboard===
[[File:Double T Scoreboard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Double T]] scoreboard]]
The unique [[Double T]] scoreboard modeled in the fashion of Texas Tech's logo is emplaced on the roof of the athletic department offices in the south end zone and was installed prior to the beginning of the [[1978 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|1978 season]]. The scoreboard has remained in place through multiple stadium renovations due to its iconic and symbolic value, and received upgraded white LED panel installations in 2013.&lt;ref name=doubletscoreboard&gt;{{cite news |title=Double-T Scoreboard on Way Out?|first=Doug|last=Hensley|url=http://lubbockonline.com/news/101697/064-7928.htm|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=October 15, 1997|accessdate=April 143, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hocutt1&gt;{{cite news |title=Tech Hopes Next Round of Stadium Improvements Not Far Off|first=Don|last=Williams|url=http://lubbockonline.com/sports-red-raiders-football/2012-01-13/tech-hopes-next-round-stadium-improvements-not-far|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=January 13, 2012|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing surface===
The playing field runs in the traditional north-south configuration and sits 30 feet below grade at an elevation of {{convert|3215|ft|m}} [[AMSL|above sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/|title=Microsoft Research – Emerging Technology, Computer, and Software Research|author=|date=|website=Microsoft Research|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the stadium opened in 1947, the playing field featured a grass playing surface until it was replaced with [[AstroTurf]] in 1970. In 2006, [[FieldTurf]] replaced the AstroTurf playing field.

===Seating===
After numerous renovations and expansions, Jones AT&amp;T Stadium currently seats 60,454. The capacity makes the stadium the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|44th largest college football stadium]] in the United States. Officially, Jones AT&amp;T Stadium has the third-highest seating capacity of any college-specific venue in Texas behind [[Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium]] in Austin and [[Kyle Field]] in College Station, but when referred to by actual seating capacity the stadium drops to fifth behind [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]'s [[Alamodome]] and [[Houston]]'s [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riceowls.com/facilities/rice-stadium.html|title=Rice University Facilities :: Official Athletic Site|author=|date=|website=www.riceowls.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 13,750 seats designated for students between 14 sections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastech.com/manual/graphics/students/student-section-fb.pdf Texas Tech Student Tickets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212808/http://www.texastech.com/manual/graphics/students/student-section-fb.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web |title=Football Season Ticket Sales Break Record|first=Blayne|last=Beal|url=http://today.ttu.edu/2010/08/football-season-ticket-sales-break-record/|work=Texas Tech Today|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional section was allotted to students following record demand during the 2013 season.

===Video board===

Due for completion prior to the commencement of the [[2013 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|2013 season]], the $11 million [[jumbotron]] mounted in the north end zone of the stadium is one of the largest in the country.&lt;ref name=vidyaboard&gt;{{cite news |title=Tech Stadium Project on Track for Summer Completion|first=Don|last=Williams|url=http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2013-03-29/tech-stadium-project-track-summer-completion|newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=March 29, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-definition jumbotron measures 100 feet wide by 38 feet tall with 3,800 square feet of screen space, placing it at a ranking of 16th nationally by square footage in purely NCAA football stadiums, and 8th among HD screens. Additionally, the board ranks 3rd in the [[Big 12 Conference]] in square footage behind only the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s [[Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium]] and the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]].

The entire support structure measures 190 feet wide and 57 feet tall, making it the largest overall in the Big 12. The entire project includes 275 tons of steel above ground and 54 tons below ground, embedded in about 400 cubic yards of concrete. Six piers on each side of the structure plunge to a depth of near 50 feet.&lt;ref name=vidyaboard /&gt; The video board, with a [[dot pitch|pixel pitch]] of 16mm and 4 [[megapixels]], also includes sound banks 38 feet tall and 16 feet wide. The video board supports were covered with a decorative [[Spanish Renaissance architecture]] [[facade]] and feature wells for shooting [[pyrotechnics]].&lt;ref name=vidyaboard /&gt;

==Usage==

===Coaches All-America Game===
{{Main|Coaches All-America Game}}
The [[Coaches All-America Game]], a postseason college football all-star game that served as the concluding game of the college football season, was hosted at Jones AT&amp;T Stadium from 1970–1975. The all-star game was sponsored by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] (AFCA) and profits from ticket sales and television rights went to fund AFCA scholarships. Prior to the Coaches All-America Game relocating to Lubbock, from 1961 to 1965, [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], served as host and prior to relocating to Lubbock due to attendance issues, [[Atlanta Stadium]] hosted the game from 1966 to 1969. Lubbock won the bid to host the game over newer stadiums in larger cities, [[Memphis Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[San Diego Stadium]] in [[San Diego]], after the AFCA was convinced that Lubbock's advantages as a college town without competing entertainment would fill the stands with existing college football fans from [[West Texas]].&lt;ref name="Coffin Corner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford |first=Mark |year=2003 |title=The Coaches' All-America Game |journal=[[The Coffin Corner]] |volume=25 |number=2 |pages=15–18 |publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]] |accessdate=August 27, 2011 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/25-02-978.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817090602/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/25-02-978.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game held at Jones Stadium took place only 47 days after downtown Lubbock was hit by a [[1970 Lubbock tornado|tornado in 1970]]. The stadium's newly installed AstroTurf was unharmed, but some of the light towers on the east side—which had recently been fitted with extra lights for the color telecast of the All-America Game—were bent or snapped off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed|first=William F.|date=April 6, 1970|title=A Tornado With A New Twist|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|volume=33|number=1|pages=16–17|accessdate=August 27, 2011|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1083792/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the surrounding circumstances, the inaugural Jones Stadium game drew 42,150 in attendance, a record attendance that broke set in any prior Coaches All-America Game in Buffalo or Atlanta. The game finally found success by an attendance standard, drawing 285,786 attendees over 7 years. By the time of the final Coaches All-America Game in 1976, more players declined to participate in the all-star game as rookies and NFL owners had little to gain, and much to lose due to injury risks. The AFCA reluctantly dropped the Coaches All-America Game, but continued to bestow All-America honors.&lt;ref name="Coffin Corner"/&gt;

'''''Keeper''''' is a sports novel for [[adolescence|young adults]] by [[Mal Peet]], published by [[Walker Books]] in 2003. It was Peet's first novel and the first of three (as of 2012) [[association football|football]] stories featuring South American [[sports journalist]] Paul Faustino. Cast as an interview with Faustino, the world's best goalkeeper, El Gato ("The Cat"), tells his life story. Peet won the [[Branford Boase Award]], recognising the year's best [[debut novel]] for children.

Walker's North American division [[Candlewick Press]] published the first US edition in 2005.&lt;ref name=LCC2/&gt; Danish and Hungarian-language translations were also published that year and followed by German, Italian, and Spanish-language editions.&lt;ref name=worldcat&gt;
[http://www.worldcat.org/title/keeper/oclc/61116688/editions?start_edition=1&amp;sd=asc&amp;se=yr&amp;referer=di&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq= "Formats and Editions of Keeper"]. [[WorldCat]]. Retrieved 8 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

''Keeper'' was Peet's first novel, undertaken at age 52 and completed three years later.

When he won the 2009 [[Guardian Prize]] for his third Paul Faustino football novel, ''[[Exposure (Peet novel)|Exposure]]'', he told the sponsoring newspaper he had felt that 'football books for children were "pretty much hey"'. Also, "I used to play all the time. I would play football when it was light and read when it was dark. Now I get to play football vicariously."&lt;ref name=flood/&gt;

Peet described his creative occupation thus: "I come up here in the morning to a pleasant room in the roof of my house and imagine I'm a black South American football superstar, then I have to imagine I'm a female pop celebrity who's pregnant. It's a completely mad way to spend your time. If I did it in public I would be sectioned. Writing is a form of licensed madness."&lt;ref name=flood/&gt;

==Synopsis==

Paul Faustino, a journalist for ''[[La Nación]]'', is interviewing El Gato about his recent [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] win. During the interview, El Gato tells Faustino about his teenage years and his entry into soccer. When El Gato tells Faustino that he is coached by a ghost known to El Gato as "the Keeper,"&lt;ref&gt;Peet, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Faustino thinks El Gato is lying to him. However, El Gato seems honest and looks like he is telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Peet, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

El Gato continues to tell the interviewer his story. As a teenager, he secretly trains with the Keeper in an abandoned soccer field hidden in the rainforest. The young El Gato convinces his parents his time in the rainforest is the result of his fascination with nature. His family takes him for a naturalist, buying him collection materials and calling him "Professor."&lt;ref&gt;Peet, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The charade continues until El Gato turns 15, when he is expected to start working in the [[logging|logging industry]] with his father. He does not tell the Keeper that he will no longer come to practice.

His first Saturday at work he finds out that his co-workers play a game of soccer after work. His co-workers invite him to play as the goalkeeper and, in his first game since his training with the Keeper, he helps his team win. The next Saturday, he plays with a new player who the others call "El Ladron", meaning "the thief." In reality, El Ladron is a director for a soccer camp named DSJ. He also brings the owners of the team, Mr. and Mrs. DaSilva to the games. They want to sign El Gato for a two-year contract and give him 10,000 dollars. This begins his professional football career.

Finally, El Gato reveals to Paul Faustino that he cheated in the second last penalty shot of the World Cup.

El Gato tells Faustino that he wants the interview to be a book. Faustino hesitates because he has to give this interview to his boss. However, he changes his mind and helps El Gato turn his interview into a book. El Gato eventually quits soccer and becomes a naturalist, just as his parents had always imagined. At the end of the novel, El Gato explains the Keeper's history as a real player.

==Characters==

In ''Keeper'' there are three main characters. The first character that will be written about is El Gato, the protagonist of the story. El Gato is actually just a nickname. He is a huge man who normally is very quiet. He is a world cup winning goal keeper, and throughout the story he is telling a soccer reporter his past in an interview. El Gato's mentor was a mysterious man referred to 'The Keeper' and nothing more. The Keeper's actual name is never mentioned at all in the book. The Keeper was somewhat of a phantom, and one doesn't learn much about him until the end of the story. The last character was a reporter, whose name is Paul Faustino. He wants to do the interview to receive a big bonus from his boss, because Paul is obsessed with money.  NB: Actually the reporter, Paul Faustino, was the first character mentioned in the story. El Gato was the second, and the Keeper was the third.

==Awards==

Beside winning the Branford Boase Award, ''Keeper'' was bronze runner up for the [[Smarties Prize]] in ages category 9–11 years and made the [[Hampshire Book Award]] shortlist.&lt;!--

'''Marty Ball''' is a [[philosophy]] of [[American football|football]] associated with and named after former [[NFL]] and [[United Football League (2009&amp;ndash;)|UFL]] head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]]. In simple terms, it means a focus on the running game, with passing used only to further the running game.

Schottenheimer emphasizes offensive attacks that work as follows:
*First down: a rushing play
*Second down: another rushing play
*Third down: a pass attempt
*Fourth down: punt (or field goal, if within range)

Fans (and critics) refer to this scheme as "run, run, pass, punt". Schottenheimer is considered to be a conservatively minded coach with the majority of his focus on defense. The term "Marty Ball" is generally considered a pejorative because, at times, Schottenheimer would steadfastly continue to emphasize this form of offensive attack while attempting to hold onto a small lead or when playing from behind—always without success.

In terms of regular season play in the NFL, Schottenheimer often ran Marty Ball successfully. During his coaching career with the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Washington Redskins]] and [[San Diego Chargers]], Schottenheimer compiled a 200-126-1 record. His teams won eight division titles, made 13 trips to the [[NFL playoffs]], and reached the [[AFC Championship Game]] three times. He failed to successfully execute Marty Ball in the postseason, where he has a 6-13 record and never reached the [[Super Bowl]]. Schottenheimer is the only head coach in NFL history with at least 200 wins to have a losing playoff record.

Fellow NFL coach [[Herm Edwards]] said that it "probably detracts [from his legacy] in the minds of some people, but I know it doesn’t in the minds of people who have coached against him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cjonline.com/index.php?entry%3D819 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708162302/http://blogs.cjonline.com/index.php?entry=819 |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite never reaching the Super Bowl in the NFL, Schottenheimer has won a pro football title of sorts as a head coach. In 2011, he guided the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]]’s [[Virginia Destroyers]] to the league championship, defeating the [[Las Vegas Locomotives]] in the title game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/united-football-league/story/_/id/7133522/virginia-destroyers-ufl-give-marty-Schottenheimer-first-pro-title|title=Marty Schottenheimer gets first pro title|date=2011-10-23|accessdate=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schottenheimer’s Destroyers were powered offensively by running back [[Dominic Rhodes]], who was also the UFL Offensive Player of the Year in 2011.

==Other coaches==
Although Schottenheimer's assistants have gone on to successful head coaching careers--[[Bill Cowher]], [[Tony Dungy]], and [[Herm Edwards]] have also employed similar strategies of running the football and having a strong defense (also known as "[[Smashmouth offense|smash mouth football]]") -- none have adopted the Marty Ball approach. Edwards in particular is likely the closest to using the Marty Ball strategy than any other Schottenheimer protégé.

Tony Dungy, in particular, employed a run-first offense during his tenure as coach of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] from 1996-2001. He abandoned his conservative philosophy during his coaching tenure with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] from 2002–2008, however. Dungy's Colts teams normally passed the ball more on offense due to [[Peyton Manning]]'s presence on the team. In addition, Bill Cowher had been known to take more risks (such as attempting fourth down conversions) than his mentor during his tenure with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] from 1992-2006, and himself had successful passing offenses with [[Neil O'Donnell]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], and to a lesser extent [[Tommy Maddox]] without abandoning the running game. Unlike Schottenheimer, both Cowher and Dungy have each won a Super Bowl. In 2016, Dungy earned induction into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] for his work as a head coach. [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], who is also one of Schottenheimer's former assistants, employs a pass-oriented offense as well, as the current head coach of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. With the help of quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], McCarthy was able to guide the Packers to a Super Bowl win in 2010.

During the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], it hosted six [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|football]] matches. In 1967, it hosted the [[1967 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup final]] between [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. Bayern won 1–0.

The stadium hosted five games of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], including the famous match between [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], consequently known as the [[Battle of Nuremberg (2006 FIFA World Cup)|Battle of Nuremberg]].

==Name==
Originally it was known as the '''Städtisches Stadion''' {{IPA-de|ˈʃtɛtɪʃəs ˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn|}} ({{lang-en|Municipal Stadium}}) until 1945, when it was renamed '''Victory Stadium'''. In 1961, it returned to its original name until 1991, when it received the name '''Frankenstadion''' {{IPA-de|ˈfʁaŋkn̩ˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn|}}.

On 14 March 2006, the stadium was renamed '''easyCredit-Stadion''' {{IPA-de|ʔiːziˈkʁɛdɪtˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn|}} for a period of five years, after a sponsorship deal with the German bank [[DZ Bank]]. Many fans of the 1. FC Nuremberg, led by the "Ultras Nuremberg" introduced on 1 April 2006, held demonstration against the name and symbolically renamed the stadium with its current name, in honour of one of the best players in the club's history, [[Max Morlock]]. On 14 February 2013, the stadium was renamed '''Grundig Stadion''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʁʊndɪç ˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn|pron}} or {{IPA-de|ˈɡʁʊndɪɡ-|}}), after a sponsorship deal with [[Grundig]].&lt;ref&gt;stern.de: [http://www.stern.de/sport/fussball/nuernberger-arena-heisst-kuenftig-grundig-stadion-1971633.html ''Nürnberger Arena heißt künftig Grundig-Stadion''] (Nuremberg Arena will be known as Grundig Stadium.) February 14th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the stadium's name changed back to '''Stadion Nürnberg''' after the city of Nuremberg could not find a new sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infranken.de/regional/nuernberg/Nuernberg-scheitert-bei-Suche-nach-Stadion-Sponsor;art88523,1985916 |title=Nürnberg scheitert bei Suche nach Stadion-Sponsor |date=3 July 2016 |publisher=inFranken.de |access-date=1 August 2016 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 July 2017, the stadium's name officially became Max-Morlock-Stadion.

== Facilities ==
The available facilities at the stadium include two changing rooms for players, changing rooms for coaches, referees. Also physician and treatment rooms are available. A 300 m² press area, an area for press conferences, and three TV studios make the stadium a truly modern one. 1200 m² makes up the VIP area with room for 800 guests. To compensate for the large number of seats there are 15,000 parking spaces with 205 for VIPs.

The stadium also has track and field facilities that follow international regulation. A full sprinkler system, that feeds the grass with rain water. The pitch is also heated, and lit with a floodlight system. There are two 60 m² video walls that provide video to the fans. There is also a full power back up system, powered by diesel generators.

== History ==
Beginning in 1933, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]] began to use the stadium as a marching area for the [[Hitler Youth]]. The fourth ''Deutsche Kampfspiele'', one of the biggest events organized by the [[NSRL|Nazi Sports Body]], took place in this stadium from  23–29 July 1934.

Following 1963, the stadium was reconditioned multiple times, so that it could meet the requirements for football in the Bundesliga.

== Renovations ==
Max-Morlock-Stadion has been renovated two times, once in 1988 to 1991, and then again renovation began again in 2002, to be ready in time for the 2006 World Cup. The 2002 renovation cost €56.2 million; the cost is split between the city of Nürnberg, the State of [[Bavaria]] and the building society, which managed the stadium. The stadium has had its capacity increased to 48,548. this modernisation was designed and realized by HPP Architects. This was achieved by extending the southwest and northwest grandstand. The playing field was lowered by 1.30 metres in order to provide all seats an unrestricted view of the field. The [[Max Morlock]] place was developed as a place for fans to meet and enjoy something to eat; the total area of this place is 1,000 metres. In the summer of 2012, the capacity was increased to 50,000.

==Concerts==
The [[Monsters of Rock Festival 1984]], originally planned on the Zeppelinfield, took place in the Städtisches Stadion.

[[P!nk]] performed at the stadium on July 15, 2010 during [[The Funhouse Summer Carnival]].

== Transportation ==
The stadium and the adjacent [[Nuremberg Arena]] are well serviced by [[public transportation]] to facilitate transport of fans from and to the various sports and musical events taking place there:

* Bus stop ''[[Max Morlock|Max-Morlock-Platz]]'', right in front of the stadium. Serviced by Bus line 55
* ''Frankenstadion'' station, about 400 Meters (1300&amp;nbsp;ft) or a 5-minute walk from the stadium. Serviced by [[Nuremberg S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] line S2
* ''Dutzendteich'' station and [[tram]]way stop, about 1300&amp;nbsp;m (4000&amp;nbsp;ft) or a 10-minute walk from the stadium. Services by Bus lines 55 and 65, Tramway line 6 and S-Bahn line S2

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">[[File:Wally_Moon_1961.png|right|150|thumb|[[Wally Moon]], for whom the term "moonshot" was named]]
In baseball, a '''moonshot''' is referred to as a [[home run]] that travels a great distance vertically. The term "Moonshot" was coined by [[MLB Hall of Fame]] former [[Dodgers]] broadcaster [[Vin Scully]], describing high home runs by [[Wally Moon]]. &lt;ref &gt;https:// youtu.be/p7l-As7c5hM&lt;/ref &gt; The term would later be referenced in newspapers as "Moon Shots".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-moon23mar23,0,4261963.story#axzz2lalysUWD&lt;/ref&gt; Moon's home runs at the [[L.A. Coliseum]] gained (perhaps overstated&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hardballtimes.com/moon-shots/&lt;/ref&gt;) recognition for being to the [[opposite field]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hardballtimes.com/moon-shots/&lt;/ref&gt; where the distance of the fence was merely {{convert|251|ft}} from home plate, but towered {{convert|42|ft}} high - for comparison, Fenway Park's famous [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|37|ft}} tall.


&lt;!-- Nearly all of these are based on a misunderstood definition of "moonshot" (perhaps originally used ironically - similar to calling a devastating body check in hockey a "love nudge"), which seems to be solely traced to the single bleacherreport.com article, which - in conjunction with this very article - may be the only source which uses the "long = moon" definition. 

==Notable examples==
* [[Adam Dunn]] hit a {{convert|535|ft|m|adj=on}} moonshot in center field against [[Jose Lima]] at the [[Great American Ball Park]] on August 8, 2004, the longest one in the stadium's history.&lt;ref&gt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/13&lt;/ref&gt; The home run is a popular highlight on home run reels.
* [[Giancarlo Stanton]] hit a {{convert|494|ft|m|adj=on}} tape-measure blast at [[Coors Field]] off of [[Josh Roenicke]] on August 17, 2012. Although not the longest home run hit at Coors Field, it is a very popular baseball highlight and was the longest home run of the 2012 season. It was the longest home run hit since 2009.
* [[Jose Canseco]] hit a home run into the 5th deck at the [[SkyDome]] during Game 5 of the [[1989 ALCS]], which many people estimated it to be from {{convert|480|to|540|m}}, but according to Hittrackeronline.com, the baseball would have only traveled {{convert|443|ft}} had it come back to field-level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hittrackeronline.com/historic.php?id=1989_13&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the home run is still considered one of the most famous moonshots ever.
*[[Albert Pujols]] hit a {{convert|455|ft|m|adj=on}} three run homerun off closer [[Brad Lidge]] on October 17, 2005 at [[Minute Maid Park]]. The ball soared well over the train tracks and ricocheted off the support structures in left field. The [[Houston Astros]] were one out away from securing the pennant victory until this monumental blast. Despite the Cardinals' victory in this game, the Astros would in fact go on to win the pennant that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hittrackeronline.com/historic.php?id=2005_6&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[C. J. Cron]] hit his first major league home run at [[Rogers Center]] off of [[J.A. Happ]] on May 10, 2014, which traveled an estimated {{convert|468|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hittrackeronline.com/hrdetail.php?id=2014_947&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Sports Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Ulan Bator|Ulaanbaatar]], [[Mongolia]].  It is used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and has a capacity 12,500. The [[Naadam]] festival, which celebrates Mongolian independence, is held there every July. The land owned by the stadium company is about 27 [[hectares]], of which the stadium takes about 8 [[hectares]] of land. The National Sport Stadium in Mongolia hosted the 2016 World University Archery Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisu.net/en/FISU-Archery-3556.html The History of Archery in FISU]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium was established in 1958 by [[Russia]]n construction in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  Since then, it has not been majorly renovated, although it gets a little painting and touch up once a year.  Even though the stadium was built for multi-use such as football and festivals, the only mandatory event is the Naadam festival held on July 11 of each year which commemorates the independence day of 1921. Other events are usually held under a contract except those organized by the government.

==Owners==
The stadium is part private owned and part government owned, with a 51%/49% split. The reason for its split ownership is that there is only one stadium that can hold 12,500 people in Mongolia. If the stadium was wholly private the government would have to fund the entire Naadam festive, 70% of the costs of which are taken from ticket sales and the leasing of surrounding land.

== Events ==

A '''night game''', also called a '''nighter''', is a [[sport]]ing event that takes place, completely or partially, after the local sunset. Depending on the sport, this can be done either with [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] or with the usual low-light conditions. The term "night game" is typically used only in reference to sports traditionally held outdoors. Although indoor sporting events often take place after local sunset, these events are artificially lighted regardless of the time of day they take place.

==Baseball==
[[File:Night game fenway park.jpg|thumb|A night game at [[Fenway Park]], a U.S. [[baseball park]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].]]
A baseball game was played under electric lighting in 1880, the year after Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.  It was an experimental game between two department store teams, and it would take another fifty years before organized baseball would sanction night baseball.  There were a couple of exhibition night baseball games in the early 1900s between organized baseball teams.  One of them was in 1909, and the other was in 1927, but the games did not count in league standings.  Even though the games were between professional teams, they were unofficial experiments and did not count as the "nocturnal first".  In 1929, the president of the Des Moines, Iowa baseball club announced to the National Association convention he was going to play night baseball in 1930.  However, the first official minor league night game actually took place in [[Independence, Kansas]] on April 28, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddleton|first1=Oscar|title=Under the Lights|journal=Baseball Research Journal|date=1980|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the April 1931 edition of Baseball Magazine stated that Independence was the first team in America to play a league night baseball game.  After the game in Independence, night baseball "spread like wildfire" across the minor leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloodgood|first1=Clifford|title=1931 a Test for Night Baseball|publisher=Baseball magazine|date=April 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to that, in 1935, The Sporting News pointed out that Des Moines, Iowa was not the first to install permanent lights, but it was in fact Independence that did so.  By the end of the 1934 season there were sixty-five minor league teams with permanent lights installed on their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Light Rush Staged in 1930 After Two Tests|issue=January 24, 1935|publisher=The Sporting News|date=January 24, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The light towers installed in Independence in 1930 were removed and scrapped in June 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reporter Living|publisher=Independence Daily Reporter|date=June 24, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mickey Mantle]], an Independence Yankee in 1949, played under the historic lights.

Lighting technology had significantly improved since the 1927 night game exhibition.  After fifty years of experiments, a new era in professional baseball was about to start. The [[Independence Producers]] of Independence, Kansas were a Class C minor league baseball team that played in a stadium known now as [[Shulthis Stadium Grandstand|Shulthis Stadium]].  They purchased lights from the Giant Manufacturing Company and installed permanent lights on their field. When Independence played the night game on April 28, 1930, it made Independence the birthplace of professional night baseball.  By the end of the 1930 season there were thirty-eight minor league teams with lights installed on their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowman|first1=Larry|title=I Think it is Pretty Ritzy, Myself|url=https://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/1995winter_bowman.pdf|website=Kansas State Historical Society|publisher=Kansas History, Winter 1995/1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence played the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball on April 28, 1930.  The term Organized Baseball refers to Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball games. Organized Baseball games must follow specific rules in order to be Organized Baseball games. The Commissioner of Baseball has authority over Organized Baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Jonathan|title=The Cultural Encyclopedia of Baseball|date=1957|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-7864-2087-1|pages=670|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Independence lost the league game to the Muskogee Chiefs by a score of 13-3.  Independence had previously played an exhibition game against the House of David, a professional baseball team, but the game did not qualify as an Organized Baseball game.  Independence did however defeat the House of David with a score of 9-1.&lt;ref name="JSumner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sumner|first1=Jan|title=Independence, Mantle, and Miss Able|date=2015|publisher=Jadan Publishing|isbn=978-0-9703197-1-5|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Independence had played a night baseball game before any Major League teams did so, the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball took place in Independence, Kansas.  Numerous references, photos, and media clippings discussing the first night Organized Baseball game are available can be found on websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Gallery|url=https://sites.google.com/site/nightbaseball/products-services|website=Night Baseball|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old News Clips|url=https://sites.google.com/site/shulthisstadium/gallery/old-news-clips|website=Shulthis Stadium|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metcalf|first1=Mark|title=Producers Park Grandstand|url=http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/HSBR/008montgomery_shulthisgrandstand_NRdraft_06012015shpo.pdf|website=Kansas State Historical Society|publisher=Kansas State Historical Society|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1930 game in Independence, night baseball did spread to other countries.  The first night game baseball game in Canada took place in Vancouver, Canada in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/jgbennie/nightbaseball.htm|title=Night Baseball is Well Received by Vancouver Fandom|date=|website=|publisher=Vancouver Sun|last1=Lytle|first1=Andy|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933 Japan played their first night baseball game, and Cuba did so in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuban Sports Timeline|url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/time/sports-1.htm|website=History of Cuba|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Japanese Baseball|url=http://english.baseball-museum.or.jp/showcase/storage/history.html|website=The Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=The Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first big-league team to play games at night was the 1930 [[Kansas City Monarchs]] of the Negro Leagues, who often played against the [[Cuban House of David|House of David]] baseball team, who carried portable lights mounted on trucks along with their team bus.

''The Kansas City Monarchs: Champions of Black Baseball''. 1985, University Press of Kansas, {{ISBN|0-7006-0343-3}}, p. 69-71&lt;/ref&gt; The Monarchs first night baseball game was on April 28, 1930.  It was an exhibition game in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] against [[Phillips University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rives|first1=Bob|title=Baseball in Wichita|date=2004|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-3316-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first night game in Major League Baseball history occurred on May 24, 1935 when the [[Cincinnati Reds]] beat the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] 2–1 at [[Crosley Field]].&lt;ref name="crosleyfieldcom"&gt;{{cite web | title = Night Baseball Comes to the Majors | work = CrosleyField.com | url = http://www.crosley-field.com/FNG/index.html | accessdate = 2006-12-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316053810/http://www.crosley-field.com/FNG/index.html | archivedate = 2009-03-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan was that the Reds would play seven night games each season, one against each visiting club.&lt;ref&gt;Hy Hurwitz, "Cronin Urges More Clubs to Put Player Names on Uniforms" ''The Sporting News'', May 3, 1963, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Night baseball quickly found acceptance in other Major League cities and eventually became the norm; the term "day game" was subsequently coined to designate the increasingly rarer afternoon contests.

The last non-expansion/non-relocated team to play all their home games in the daytime were the [[Chicago Cubs]]; they played their first official night game in [[Wrigley Field]] on August 9, 1988 and beat the [[New York Mets]] 6–4, one night after their initial attempt at night baseball (against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]) was rained out before it became official.&lt;ref name="wrigleyfieldhistory"&gt;{{cite web| title = Wrigley Field History | work=MLB.com | url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/chc/ballpark/index.jsp | accessdate = 2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs still play the fewest home night games of any major league club (35 per season, as of 2014).

The first night [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] was held at Philadelphia's [[Shibe Park]] in [[1943 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1943]], while the first [[World Series]] night game was Game 4 of the [[1971 World Series|1971 Series]] at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in Pittsburgh. All All-Star Games since [[1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1969]], and all World Series games since Game 6 of the [[1987 World Series|1987 Series]], have been played at night.

==Cricket==
[[File:Trent Bridge at Night.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Day/Night match at [[Trent Bridge]]]]
The use of floodlights in [[cricket]] matches has helped to bring much investment into the game both at a national and an international level since it began in 1977. Today floodlit (day/night) cricket is played in most of the test playing nations although some nations have only started hosting day/night matches in the last 10 to 12 years. Many important tournaments like [[Indian Premier League]] and [[Champions League Twenty20]] have become success due to night games.

[[Cricket]] was first played under floodlights on Monday, August 11, 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/240292.html First D/N Cricket match by Cricinfo]&lt;/ref&gt; in England which was watched by several [[million]] people on their [[television]] sets. Since then every test playing country has installed floodlights in their [[stadiums]]. Traditional Cricket floodlights have a long pole on which lights are fixed. This is done because many times the ball travels too high when a [[batsman]] hits it and high lights are needed to keep the ball in sight. But many cricket stadiums have different types of floodlights like [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] in [[Australia]], stadiums in [[New Zealand]] etc. The [[DSC Cricket Stadium]] in [[Dubai]] recently installed Ring of Fire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dubaisportscity.ae/NewsDetails.asp?id=160&amp;txt=ring |title=Dubai Sports City |publisher=Dubaisportscity.ae |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531150925/http://www.dubaisportscity.ae/NewsDetails.asp?id=160&amp;txt=ring |archivedate=2011-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; system of floodlights which is latest and smartest system of floodlight in the world.

==Gridiron football==
The term has also been adopted by other outdoor stadium sports such as [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. The first [[1892 Wyoming Seminary vs. Mansfield State Normal football game|night football game]] was played in [[Mansfield, Pennsylvania]] on September 28, 1892 between [[Mansfield University of Pennsylvania|Mansfield State Normal]] and [[Wyoming Seminary]]. It ended bitterly at halftime in a 0–0 tie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joycetice.com/articles/1892foot.htm Mansfield, Pennsylvania - It happened one night - First Football under lights - Mansfield PA 1892]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago's World Fair]], the Chicago A. A. played a night football game against [[Army Black Knights football|West Point]]. Chicago won the 40-minute game 14–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chicago Lights Up Football World| journal=LA 4 Foundation |volume=XVIII |issue=II |year=2005 |pages=7–10 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv18/CFHSNv18n2c.pdf| authors=Pruter, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 1902, the [[Philadelphia Athletics (NFL)|Philadelphia Athletics]] of the [[National Football League (1902)|first National Football League]] defeated the [[Kanaweola Athletic Club]], 39–0, at [[Dunn Field (Elmira)|Maple Avenue Driving Park]] in the first professional football night game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorkhistoryreview.com/football.html|title=History sometimes happens unnoticed: First Ever Night Football Game |last=Janowski |first=Diane|work=New York History History|publisher=New York State History Books and Music|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first night football game west of the [[Mississippi River]] was played in [[Wichita, Kansas]] in [[1905 Cooper vs. Fairmount football game|1905]] between Cooper College (now [[Sterling College (Kansas)|Sterling College]] of [[Sterling, Kansas]]) and Fairmount College (now [[Wichita State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coleman.com/FirstLight/|title=FIRST LIGHT (1900&amp;nbsp;– 1929)|publisher=[[Coleman Company]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first NFL game played at night was in 1929 when the [[Chicago Cardinals]] played the [[Providence Steam Roller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL's First Night Game|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/nfl-s-first-night-game/|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=October 7, 2016|date=January 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automobile races at night can take on two different forms. [[Sports car racing|Sports car]] races such as the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] and rally races such as [[Monte Carlo Rally]] manage to continue running through the night by having the competing cars utilize [[headlights]].

The alternate possibility involves installing a system of [[flood light]]s along the circuit to illuminate it for cars that do not have headlights. The lights must be designed to diffuse light over a large space to reduce glare on both [[windshield]]s and a driver's visor. Systems such as this have been common in [[short track motor racing]] for many years. The [[Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race|night NASCAR race]] at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]]'s half-mile track in [[Tennessee]] is among the most popular events of the season. The first modern [[Oval track racing|oval track]] over 1 mile (1.609 kilometers) long to install a lighting system was [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowesmotorspeedway.com/speedway/history/ lowesmotorspeedway.com] "History" Retrieved 8/30/08&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASCAR]] sanctioned races have been held at night for many years due to systems like these. [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] held its first night race at [[Losail International Circuit]] in [[2008 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|2008]]. [[Formula One]] held its first night race at the [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]].

'''Palembang Sport and Convention Center''' or simply '''PSCC''' (formerly known as the Sport Hall) is a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] located in the downtown of [[Palembang]], [[South Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], in one of the city's well-known business area, Centre Point. Established in 2011 for the [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]], it is praised for its modern and chic design, and its [[volleyball]] field is the best in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.ghiboo.com/pscc-arena-indoor-terbaik-di-tanah-air|title=PSCC the country's best indoor arena|publisher=www.ghiboo.com|date=|accessdate=2013-08-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130808154010/http://sport.ghiboo.com/pscc-arena-indoor-terbaik-di-tanah-air|archivedate=2013-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PSCC was built in 1971, and inaugurated by the President [[Soeharto]]. It was built for the National Scholar Games (or POMNAS in Indonesian) in the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.detik.com/travel/read/2011/12/15/114203/1791810/1025/palembang-sport-and-convention-center--pscc--saksi-bisu-sea-games-2011|title=Saksi bisu SEA Games|publisher=www.detik.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in October 2010, the government renovated the building massively for the [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]], as [[Palembang]] was chosen as the host city.

In October 2011, the building was established with the new contemporary and modern design. The field and the facilities were also renovated nicely.

Before the [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]], the [[2011 Asian Men's Club Volleyball Championship]] was held in the occasion to welcoming the [[Southeast Asian Games|SEA Games]]. The [[Paykan Tehran]] of [[Iran]] ranked 1 in the final standing, followed by Almaty of [[Kazakhstan]] and Shanghai Tang Dynasty of [[China]].

'''Team Seattle''' is an [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] [[auto racing]] team and [[charitable organization]] founded by racing driver Don Kitch, Jr. in 1997 to raise funds for the [[Seattle Children's Hospital]].  Team Seattle's drivers and other supporting teams who compete in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] gain pledges from donors based on the number of laps their cars can complete over the event.  Since first entering Daytona in 1997, Team Seattle has raised over $3.3 million for Seattle Children's.  A new endeavor for 2009 will have Team Seattle participate in another endurance event, the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in [[France]], and also raise funds for the Mecenat Chirurgie Cardiaque Enfants du Monde.  The team's driving squad will include American actor [[Patrick Dempsey]].

==History==
[[File:Team Seattle Porsche.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Team Seattle [[Porsche]] at the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona]]
Team Seattle debuted at the 1997 24 Hours of Daytona, backing a [[Porsche]] from the [[Alex Job Racing]] team, before expanding to two cars in 1998.  The two car effort was boosted in 1999 by the addition of professional drivers [[Kelly Collins]], [[Anthony Lazzaro (race car driver)|Anthony Lazzaro]], and [[Cort Wagner]] who led one of two Team Seattle-backed Alex Job Porsches to victory in their class.  In 2000 Team Seattle began a partnership with [[The Racer's Group]], another Porsche squad, before switching to the faster GTS category in 2002 with Park Place Racing's [[Saleen]]s.  

Team Seattle made their first entry into the [[sports prototype]] categories by joining with Essex Racing in 2003, where they finished first and second within their class in a [[Lola Cars|Lola]]-[[Nissan Motors|Nissan]].  Essex Racing switched to Multimatic-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]s in 2004, but were not able to repeat their success in the new [[Daytona Prototype]] category.  The team returned to Porsches in the lower categories in 2005 with a two-car effort with Synergy Racing, joined by corporate backing from [[Microsoft]] in 2006.  Team Seattle made another partnership in 2008, joining Farnbacher-Loles Racing.

'''Tent pegging''' (sometimes spelled '''tent-pegging''' or '''tentpegging''') is a [[cavalry]] sport of ancient origin, and is one of only ten [[equestrianism|equestrian]] disciplines officially recognised by the [[International Equestrian Federation]]. Used narrowly, the term refers to a specific mounted game with ground targets. More broadly, it refers to the entire class of mounted cavalry games involving edged weapons on horseback, for which the term "equestrian skill-at-arms" is also used.

==Origins==
[[Cavalry|Cavaliers]] have practised the specific game of tent pegging since at least the 4th century BC, and Asian and later European empires spread the game around the world. As a result, the game's date and location of origin are ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;"Tent pegging at Hurlingham", ''Illustrated London News'', Summer 1875&lt;/ref&gt;

In all accounts, the competitive sport evolved out of cavalry training exercises designed to develop cavaliers' prowess with the sword and lance from horseback. However, whether tent pegging developed cavaliers' generic skills or prepared them for specific combat situations is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Lenox-Conyngham Papers, "Camp on the Raptee River", Cambridge University Centre of South Asian Studies, 16 January 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Equestrian Federation, "most equestrian authorities are of the opinion that tent-pegging originated in India in the middle ages in the battle fields as a tactics used by the horsed cavalry against [[war elephant|elephant mounted troops]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://admin.fei.org/Development/Regional_Disciplines/Pages/Tent_Pegging.aspx "Tent pegging recognised by the FEI"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401014439/https://admin.fei.org/Development/Regional_Disciplines/Pages/Tent_Pegging.aspx |date=1 April 2012 }}, International Equestrian Federation, 2004, retrieved 19 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A cavalier able to precisely stab the highly sensitive flesh behind an elephant's toenail would cause the enemy elephant to rear, unseat his [[mahout]], and possibly run amok, breaking ranks and trampling [[infantry]]. However, other scholarly sources suggest that the sport originated earlier in [[Central Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;Gen Sir Richard Gale, ''Kings at Arms'' London:Hutchinson, 1971, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Middle East]]&lt;ref&gt;Prof Philip K Hitti, ''A History of the Arabs'', London:Macmillan, 1949 ed, pp.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; and was later on popularised in India.

The term "tent pegging" is certainly related to the idea that cavaliers mounting a surprise pre-dawn raid on an enemy camp could use the game's skills to sever or uproot tent pegs, thus collapsing the tents on their sleeping occupants and sowing havoc and terror in the camp.  However, there are few reliable accounts of a cavalry [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] ever employing such [[Military tactics|tactics]].

Because the specific game of tent pegging is the most popular equestrian skill-at-arms game, the entire class of sports became known as tent pegging during the twilight of cavalry in the twentieth century. In the Pakistani region of Balochistan it is the provincial sport.

==Essential rules==
The specific game of tent pegging has a mounted horseman riding at a gallop and using a [[sword]] or a [[lance]] to pierce, pick up, and carry away a small ground target (a symbolic tent peg) or a series of small ground targets.

The broader class of tent pegging games also includes ring [[jousting]] (in which a galloping rider tries to pass the point of his weapon through a suspended ring); lemon sticking (in which the rider tries to stab or slice a lemon suspended from a cord or sitting on a platform); [[quintain (jousting)|quintain]] tilting (in which the rider charges a mannequin mounted on a swivelling or rocking pedestal); and [[horse archer|Parthian (i.e., mounted) archery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharaj.org/tentpegging.shtml "Tent pegging with UNICEF Team Canada"], Akaash Maharaj, 2007, retrieved 14 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A given tent pegging competition's rules specify the size and composition of the target; the number of consecutive targets placed on a course; the dimensions and weight of the sword, lance, or bow; the minimum time in which a course must be covered; and the extent to which a target must be struck, cut, or carried.&lt;ref&gt;Major General RKR Balasubramanian, ''Rules for Tent Pegging (First Edition)'', International Equestrian Federation, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary sport==
Today, tent pegging is practised around the world, but is especially popular in Australia, India, Israel, [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], and the United Kingdom. The [[Olympic Council of Asia]] included tent pegging as an official sport in 1982, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports recognised it as an official equestrian discipline in 2004.

From the results of the 2008 International Tent Pegging Championships, the world's three leading national teams are currently Canada, India, and Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanglaonline.com/index.php?template=headline&amp;newsid=40764&amp;typeid=3 ''Kangla''], 14 January 2008, retrieved 21 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of cavalry regiments and [[mounted police]] forces remain dominant in world-class tent pegging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usef.org/wir/01202005.html "Tent pegging competition cancelled"], United States Equestrian Federation, 20 January 2004, retrieved 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Tent Pegging Federation]] is working on introducing tent pegging on the sidelines of polo in the United States. In late 1990s, many efforts were made mostly solo efforts by individuals like H.E Prince Malik Ata Khan and Maharaja of Dunlod, H.E Raghuvendra Pratap Singh to promote tent pegging in USA. EFI tent pegging pioneers provided much encouragement to export tent pegging to the USA. Also H.E Prince Malik Ata Khan, the icon of modern-day tent pegging supported the idea of formation of a Tent Pegging as an organized sport in the USA. All of their thrust was to establish an organization in the United States so that USA could represent itself on the international front. At present the USTPF, working hard to promote Tent Pegging in the USA. The promotion efforts include two Tent Pegging Training Clinics initiated in October 2014 and June 2015 to compete in the international Arena. The USTPF was recognized by the USEF as Alliance Partner in 2015 and an NGB for Tent Pegging in the USA. The USEF granted the Alliance Partnership to the USTPF with permanent Alliance Partnership number 5347848.

New and emerging national tent pegging associations have helped spread the sport's popularity.  The Australian [[Royal Adelaide Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Arena Program (2013)|url=http://www.theshow.com.au/showground/royal-adelaide-show/plan-your-show-day/programs/main-arena-program.jsp|publisher=The Royal Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Society of SA Inc|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British Tent Pegging Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equestriantoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=116&amp;ArticleID=1114530 "Up in arms to peg back cavalry regiments"], Equestrian Today, 15 August 2005, retrieved 2 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States Cavalry Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscavalry.org/currentevents.html "The National Cavalry Competition"], US Cavalry Association, 2006, retrieved 2 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; now hold annual national championships and demonstrations in their respective countries.

In Pakistan tent pegging is known as Neza Bazi as well. It is played in Punjab, [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and some parts of [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan]], it is the unofficial provincial sport of [[Balochistan, Pakistan]]. There are many clubs who have owned different and unique style of [[Turban]] and [[Waistcoat]] to identify their clubs. People decorate their horses for the competition. Every club arranges a neza bazi competition. All clubs are invited to participate in the competition. There are some specific shows being arranged since many decades. National Horse and Cattle Show is one of them. It is held at the Fortress Stadium [[Lahore]] every year usually in end of February or at first week of March. Tent pegging is a part of this event. Clubs from all the districts of Pakistan  participates there.&lt;ref&gt;'nocadmin', [http://www.pakistanadventures.com/national-horse-and-cattle-show/ "National Horse And Cattle Show"], ''Pakistan Adventures'', June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-eminent tent pegging games remain centred in Asia and the Middle East, with the [http://www.maharaj.org/blog-tentpegging.shtml International Tent Pegging Championships] and the continental [[Asian Games]] traditionally enjoying the highest number of competitors and participating states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss2612/stories/20030322005607700.htm "Indian riders to the fore"], ''The Sportstar'', 22 March 2003, retrieved 2 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing bodies==
The recognised international governing body of Tent Pegging  is [[International Tent Pegging Federation]]. The ITPF headquarters are located in [[Muscat, Oman]]. It was founded as World Tent Pegging Federation in 2013 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, Pakistan, India and others renamed the World 
Tent Pegging Federation in 2014, and took up its current name in the same year. Essentially ITPF is very new and does and does not have full world recognition and not all countries which play tent pegging are its members. Also ITPF is the largest equestrian body in the world that recognizes and governs tent pegging competitions.&lt;ref name="timesofoman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/news/article-30834.aspx|title=Times of Oman &amp;#124; News :: Oman all set for International Tent Pegging Federation|publisher=timesofoman.com|accessdate=2014-08-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213714/http://www.timesofoman.com/news/article-30834.aspx|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtentpegging.com/ ''worldtentpegging.com'' (not in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tent pegging being primarily a foreign game from the Middle East and Indian Subcontinent, and was faded from the equestrian sports map of the USA. However, Tent Pegging was well known prior to the World War II in the continental USA.  As a need of present times, with tent pegging being played in many countries around the world, [http://www.ustpf.org/  USTPF] came into existence as a National Governing Body for Tent Pegging and to promote tent pegging domestically and represent USA internationally. [http://www.ustpf.org/ USTPF ] was formed in 2013 in USA. USTPF participated in many international events the 2016 and USA secured the place in the International Tent Pegging arena.

The [[International Tent Pegging Federation|ITPF]] has 28 members: The ITPF is responsible for the organisation and governance of Tent Pegging's major international tournaments, notably the Tent Pegging World Cup. It also appoints the judges and referees that officiate at all matches and events. Each nation has a national federation which regulates Tent pegging events played in its country.
