'''Abiogenic petroleum origin''' is a term used to describe a number of different hypotheses which propose that [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are formed by inorganic means rather than by the decomposition of organisms. The two principal abiogenic petroleum hypotheses, proposing that all petroleum is abiogenic, the ''deep gas hypothesis''{{explain|date=January 2018}} of [[Thomas Gold]] and the ''deep abiotic petroleum hypothesis'',{{explain|date=January 2018}} have been scientifically reviewed and largely rejected.&lt;ref name=glasby2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=M.|last2=Bardi|first2=U.|last3=Feng|first3=L.|last4=pang|first4=X.|title=Development of oil formation theories and their importance for peak oil|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=2010|volume=27|issue=10|pages=1995–2004|doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2010.06.005|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:338107|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=January 2018}}

Earlier studies of mantle-derived rocks from many places have shown that hydrocarbons from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons in such rocks are extremely low and seem to lack accumulation in concentrations that would render them feasible for exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugisuki|first1=R.|last2=Mimura|first2=K.|title=Mantle hydrocarbons: abiotic or biotic?|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=1994|volume=58|issue=11|pages=2527–2542|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(94)90029-9|bibcode=1994GeCoA..58.2527S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific consensus on the [[Fossil fuel#Origin|origin of oil and gas]] is that all natural oil and gas deposits on Earth are fossil fuels and are, therefore, biogenic. Globally significant amounts of abiotic oil in the crust can even be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Sherwood2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherwood Lollar|first1=B.|last2=Westgate,|first2=T.D.|last3=Ward|first3=J.D.|last4=Slater|first4=G.F.|last5=Lacrampe-Couloume|first5=G.|title=Abiogenic formation of alkanes in the Earth's crust as a minor source for global hydrocarbon reservoirs|journal=Nature|date=2002|volume=446|issue=6880|pages=522–524|doi=10.1038/416522a|bibcode=2002Natur.416..522S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, abiogenesis of small quantities of oil and gas remains an area of ongoing research in limited, mostly just laboratory scale.

==Overview hypotheses==
Some abiogenic hypotheses have proposed that oil and gas did not originate from fossil deposits, but have instead originated from deep carbon deposits, present since the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Earth]].&lt;ref name="gold1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gold, Thomas|date=1999|title=The deep, hot biosphere|publisher=Copernicus Books|isbn=0-387-98546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been suggested that hydrocarbons may have arrived on Earth from solid bodies such as [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s from the [[Late Heavy Bombardment|late formation]] of the [[Solar System]], carrying hydrocarbons with them.&lt;ref name="scott2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stachel"/&gt;

Certain abiogenic hypotheses gained some popularity among geologists over the past several centuries. Scientists in the former [[Soviet Union]] widely held that significant petroleum deposits could be attributed to abiogenic origin, though this view fell out of favor toward the end of the 20th century because they did not make useful predictions for the discovery of oil deposits.&lt;ref name=glasby2006&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Glasby |first=Geoffrey P |date=2006 |title= Abiogenic origin of hydrocarbons: an historical overview |journal= Resource Geology |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=85–98 |url=http://static.scribd.com/docs/j79lhbgbjbqrb.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-29 |doi= 10.1111/j.1751-3928.2006.tb00271.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now been generally accepted that the theory of abiogenic formation of petroleum has insufficient scientific support and that oil and gas fuels on Earth are formed almost exclusively from [[organic material]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1961-64/data/pg/0048/0011/1750/1755.htm Geologic Aspects of Origin of Petroleum], AAPG Bulletin, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abiogenic hypothesis regained some support in 2009 when researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology ([[KTH]]) in Stockholm reported they believed they had proven that fossils from animals and plants are not necessary for crude oil and natural gas to be generated.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fossils From Animals And Plants Are Not Necessary For Crude Oil And Natural Gas, Swedish Researchers Find.|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090910084259.htm|accessdate=9 March 2016|agency=Vetenskapsrådet (The Swedish Research Council)|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolesnikov|first1=Anton|title=Methane-derived hydrocarbons produced under upper-mantle conditions|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=2009|volume=2 |issue=8|page=566|doi=10.1038/ngeo591|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2009NatGe...2..566K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2014 publication ''Chemistry of the Climate System'',&lt;ref name="Climate System p 10"&gt;Chemistry of the Climate System, Detlev Möller,Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, Sep 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; German chemist Detlev Moller documents sufficient reliable evidence to show that both processes can be shown to co-exist, that they're not mutually exclusive.

==History==
An abiogenic hypothesis was first proposed by [[Georgius Agricola]] in the 16th century and various additional abiogenic hypotheses were proposed in the 19th century, most notably by Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]],{{when|date=November 2014}} the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] (1877&lt;ref&gt;''Mendeleev D.'' L’origine du Petrole // La Revue scientifique. 1877. N 18. P. 409—416.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]].{{when|date=November 2014}}&lt;!-- will need to get dates on all of these in order to sort out a better History section for this article --&gt; Abiogenic hypotheses were revived in the last half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by Soviet scientists who had little influence outside the Soviet Union because most of their research was published in Russian. The hypothesis was re-defined and made popular in the West by [[Thomas Gold]] who developed his theories from 1979 to 1998, and published his research in English.&lt;ref name=glasby2006/&gt;

[[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] and the proponents of [[neptunism]] in the 18th century regarded [[basalt]]ic [[Sill (geology)|sills]] as solidified oils or bitumen. While these notions proved unfounded, the basic idea of an association between petroleum and magmatism persisted. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] proposed an inorganic abiogenic hypothesis for petroleum formation after he observed petroleum springs in the Bay of Cumaux ([[Cumaná]]) on the northeast coast of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He is quoted as saying in 1804, "the petroleum is the product of a distillation from great depth and issues from the primitive rocks beneath which the forces of all volcanic action lie".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Other early prominent proponents of what would become the generalized abiogenic hypothesis included [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]&lt;ref&gt;Mendeleev, D., 1877. L'origine du petrole. Revue Scientifique, 2e Ser., VIII, p. 409-416.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcellin Berthelot|Berthelot]].

In 1951, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] geologist [[Nikolai Kudryavtsev|Nikolai Alexandrovitch Kudryavtsev]] proposed the modern abiotic hypothesis of petroleum.&lt;ref name=Kudryavtsev&gt;{{cite journal |title=Considerations About Recent Predictions of Impending Shortages of Petroleum Evaluated from the Perspective of Modern Petroleum Science |journal=Russian Academy of Sciences |last= Kenney |first=J.

F. |work=GasResources.net |accessdate=2014-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of his analysis of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] in [[Alberta, Canada]], he concluded that no [[source rock|"source rocks"]] could form the enormous volume of hydrocarbons, and therefore offered abiotic deep petroleum as the most plausible explanation. (Humic coals have since been proposed for the source rocks.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716145545/http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/documents/2004/stanton/index.htm Origin of the Lower Cretaceous Heavy Oils (“Tar Sands”) of Alberta]", Michael Stanton Search and Discovery Article #10071 (2004) Archived from [http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/documents/2004/stanton/index.htm the original] in July 16, 2011 (Search and Discovery is an online journal published by the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]])&lt;/ref&gt;)  Others who continued Kudryavtsev's work included [[Petr N.

Beskrovny, and [[Victor F. Linetsky]].

A 2006 review article by Geoffrey Glasby presented arguments against the abiogenic origin of petroleum{{clarify|date=November 2014}}&lt;!-- does Glasby's review article review all abiogenic theories?  or is it perhaps args against one particular theory, or some subset of the theories?  (I ask because much of this WP article was formerly written in the singular, as if only a single abiogenic hypothesis had been put forward, and Glasby was prominently cited in the prose used at that time.)  N2e, 2014-11-28 --&gt; on a number of counts;&lt;ref name=glasby2006/&gt; on the other hand several recent studies demonstrate that hydrocarbons heavier than methane can be produced by abiogenic processes&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate System p 10"/&gt;

== Foundations of abiogenic hypotheses ==
Within the mantle, carbon may exist as [[hydrocarbon]]s—chiefly [[methane]]—and as elemental carbon, carbon dioxide, and carbonates.&lt;ref name="kenney2002" /&gt; The abiotic hypothesis is that the full suite of hydrocarbons found in petroleum can either be generated in the mantle by abiogenic processes,&lt;ref name="kenney2002" /&gt; or by biological processing of those abiogenic hydrocarbons, and that the source-hydrocarbons of abiogenic origin can migrate out of the mantle into the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] until they escape to the surface or are trapped by impermeable strata, forming petroleum reservoirs.

Abiogenic hypotheses generally reject the supposition that certain molecules found within petroleum, known as [[Biomarker (petroleum)|biomarkers]], are indicative of the biological origin of petroleum.  They contend that these molecules mostly come from microbes feeding on petroleum in its upward migration through the crust, that some of them are found in meteorites, which have presumably never contacted living material, and that some can be generated abiogenically by plausible reactions in petroleum.&lt;ref name="kenney2001" /&gt;

Some of the evidence used to support abiogenic theories includes: &lt;!-- Comments are noting major theories rather than first sources; work in progress! --&gt;&lt;!-- it is not clear what the preceding hidden comment means, nor who added it, or why.  User:N2e  2014-11-26 --&gt;

{{asof|2009}}, little research is directed towards establishing abiogenic petroleum or [[methane]], although the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] has reported that [[ethane]] and heavier hydrocarbons can be synthesized under conditions of the upper mantle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-07/ci-hit072409.php Hydrocarbons in the deep Earth?] July 2009 news release.&lt;/ref&gt; Research mostly related to [[astrobiology]] and the deep microbial biosphere and [[serpentinite]] reactions, however, continue to provide insight into the contribution of abiogenic hydrocarbons into petroleum accumulations.

===Primordial deposits===
Thomas Gold's work was focused on hydrocarbon deposits of primordial origin.  Meteorites are believed to represent the major composition of material from which the Earth was formed.  Some meteorites, such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, contain carbonaceous material.  If a large amount of this material is still within the Earth, it could have been leaking upward for billions of years.  The thermodynamic conditions within the mantle would allow many hydrocarbon molecules to be at equilibrium under high pressure and high temperature.  Although molecules in these conditions may disassociate, resulting fragments would be reformed due to the pressure.  An average equilibrium of various molecules would exist depending upon conditions and the carbon-hydrogen ratio of the material.&lt;ref name="goldusgs"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomas Gold |title=The Origin of Methane (and Oil) in the Crust of the Earth, U.S.G.S. Professional Paper 1570, The Future of Energy Gases |publisher=USGS |date=1993 |url=//www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/usgs.html |accessdate=2006-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015163818/http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/usgs.html |archivedate=October 15, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation within the mantle===
Russian researchers concluded that hydrocarbon mixes would be created within the mantle.  Experiments under high temperatures and pressures produced many hydrocarbons—including n-[[alkanes]] through C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;—from [[iron oxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], and water.&lt;ref name="kenney2002" /&gt;  Because such materials are in the mantle and in [[Subduction|subducted]] crust, there is no requirement that all hydrocarbons be produced from primordial deposits.

===Hydrogen generation===
Hydrogen gas and water have been found more than {{convert|6000|m|ft}} deep in the upper crust in the [[Siljan Ring]] [[borehole]]s and the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]].  Data from the western United States suggests that [[aquifer]]s from near the surface may extend to depths of {{convert|10000|m|ft}} to {{convert|20000|m|ft}}. Hydrogen gas can be created by water reacting with [[silicate]]s, [[quartz]], and [[feldspar]] at temperatures in the range of {{convert|25|°C|°F}} to {{convert|270|°C|°F}}.  These minerals are common in crustal rocks such as [[granite]]. Hydrogen may react with dissolved carbon compounds in water to form methane and higher carbon compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = G.J. MacDonald  | date = 1988 | title = Major Questions About Deep Continental Structures | booktitle = Deep drilling in crystalline bedrock, v. 1 | editor = A. Bodén | editor2 = K.G.

One reaction not involving silicates which can create hydrogen is:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
:Ferrous oxide + water → magnetite + hydrogen
:3FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The above reaction operates best at low pressures. At pressures greater than {{convert|5|GPa|atm}} almost no hydrogen is created.&lt;ref name="scott2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scott HP |author2=Hemley RJ|author3=Mao HK|author4=Herschbach DR|author5=Fried LE|author6=Howard WM|author7= Bastea S |date=September 2004 | title = Generation of methane in the Earth's mantle: in situ high pressure-temperature measurements of carbonate reduction | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 39 | pages = 14023–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0405930101 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0405930101v1 | accessdate = 2006-08-16 | pmid = 15381767 | pmc = 521091 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..10114023S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Gold reported that hydrocarbons were found in the Siljan Ring borehole and in general increased with depth, although the venture was not a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Thomas. 2001. ''The Deep Hot Biosphere: They Myth of Fossil Fuels.'' Copernicus Books. New York. pp. 111-123. (softcover edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several geologists analysed the results and said that no hydrocarbon was found.&lt;ref name=glasby2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=mello2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kerr /&gt;&lt;ref name=jeffrey /&gt;&lt;ref name=castano /&gt;&lt;ref name=jeffrey2 /&gt;

===Serpentinite mechanism===

In 1967, the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scientist [[Emmanuil B. Chekaliuk]] proposed that petroleum could be formed at high temperatures and pressures from inorganic carbon in the form of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and/or methane.

This mechanism is supported by several lines of evidence which are accepted by modern scientific literature. This involves synthesis of oil within the crust via catalysis by chemically reductive rocks. A proposed mechanism for the formation of inorganic hydrocarbons&lt;ref name="keith2005"&gt;Keith, S., Swan, M. 2005. Hydrothermal Hydrocarbons. ''AAPG Research Conference'', Calgary, Canada, 2005. [http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/documents/abstracts/2005research_calgary/abstracts/extended/keith/keith.htm Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; is via natural analogs of the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] known as the ''serpentinite mechanism'' or the serpentinite process.&lt;ref name="szatmari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="charlou2005"&gt;J. L. Charlou, J. P. Donval, P. Jean-Baptiste, D. Levaché, Y. Fouquet, J. P. Foucher, P. Cochonat, 2005. Abiogenic Petroleum Generated by Serpentinization of Oceanic Mantellic Rocks. ''AAPG Research Conference'', Calgary, Canada, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH_4 + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}O_2 \rarr 2 H_2 + CO}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(2n+1)H_2 + nCO \rarr C_nH_{2n+2} + nH_2O}&lt;/math&gt;

Serpentinites are ideal rocks to host this process as they are formed from [[peridotite]]s and [[dunite]]s, rocks which contain greater than 80% [[olivine]] and usually a percentage of Fe-Ti spinel minerals. Most olivines also contain high nickel concentrations (up to several percent) and may also contain chromite or chromium as a contaminant in olivine, providing the needed transition metals.

However, serpentinite synthesis and spinel cracking reactions require [[hydrothermal alteration]] of pristine peridotite-dunite, which is a finite process intrinsically related to metamorphism, and further, requires significant addition of water. Serpentinite is unstable at mantle temperatures and is readily dehydrated to [[granulite]], [[amphibolite]], [[talc]]&amp;ndash;[[schist]] and even [[eclogite]]. This suggests that methanogenesis in the presence of serpentinites is restricted in space and time to mid-ocean ridges and upper levels of subduction zones.  However, water has been found as deep as {{convert|12000|m|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = S. B. Smithson |author2=F. Wenzel|author3=Y. V. Ganchin|author4=I. B. Morozov | date = 2000-12-31 | title = Seismic results at Kola and KTB deep scientific boreholes: velocities, reflections, fluids, and crustal composition | journal = Tectonophysics | volume = 329 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 301–317 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-1951(00)00200-6 | bibcode=2000Tectp.329..301S}}&lt;/ref&gt; so water-based reactions are dependent upon the local conditions. Oil being created by this process in intracratonic regions is limited by the materials and temperature.

====Serpentinite synthesis====
A chemical basis for the abiotic petroleum process is the [[serpentinite|serpentinization]] of [[peridotite]], beginning with methanogenesis via hydrolysis of olivine into serpentine in the presence of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="charlou2005" /&gt; Olivine, composed of Forsterite and Fayalite metamorphoses into serpentine, magnetite and silica by the following reactions, with silica from fayalite decomposition (reaction 1a) feeding into the forsterite reaction (1b).

'''Reaction 1a''':&lt;br&gt;
''Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{3Fe_2SiO_4 + 2H_2O \rarr 2Fe_3O_4 + 3SiO_2 + 2H_2 }&lt;/math&gt;

'''Reaction 1b''':&lt;br&gt;
''Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentinite''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{3Mg_2SiO_4 + SiO_2 + 4H_2O \rarr 2Mg_3Si_2O_5(OH)_4}&lt;/math&gt;

When this reaction occurs in the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) at temperatures above {{convert|500|°C|°F}} Reaction 2a takes place.

'''Reaction 2a''':&lt;br&gt;
''Olivine + water + carbonic acid → serpentine + magnetite + methane ''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(Fe,Mg)_2SiO_4 + nH_2O + CO_2 \rarr Mg_3Si_2O_5(OH)_4 + Fe_3O_4 + CH_4}&lt;/math&gt;
or, in balanced form: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{18 Mg_2SiO_4 + 6 Fe_2SiO_4 + 26 H_2O + CO_2}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{12 Mg_3Si_2O_5(OH)_4 + 4 Fe_3O_4 + CH_4}&lt;/math&gt;

However, reaction 2(b) is just as likely, and supported by the presence of abundant talc-carbonate schists and magnesite stringer veins in many serpentinised peridotites;

'''Reaction 2b''':&lt;br&gt;
''Olivine + water + carbonic acid → serpentine + magnetite + magnesite + silica ''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(Fe,Mg)_2SiO_4 + nH_2O + CO_2 \rarr Mg_3Si_2O_5(OH)_4 + Fe_3O_4 + MgCO_3 + SiO_2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- nothing is being reduced here to counterbalance Fe being oxidized, so something is obviously missing --&gt;

The upgrading of methane to higher n-alkane hydrocarbons is via [[dehydrogenation]] of methane in the presence of catalyst transition metals (e.g. Fe, Ni). This can be termed spinel hydrolysis.

===Spinel polymerization mechanism===
[[Magnetite]], [[chromite]] and [[ilmenite]] are Fe-spinel group minerals found in many rocks but rarely as a major component in non-[[ultramafic]] rocks. In these rocks, high concentrations of magmatic magnetite, chromite and ilmenite provide a reduced matrix which may allow abiotic cracking of methane to higher hydrocarbons during [[hydrothermal]] events.

Chemically reduced rocks are required to drive this reaction and high temperatures are required to allow methane to be polymerized to ethane. Note that reaction 1a, above, also creates magnetite.

'''Reaction 3''':&lt;br&gt;
''Methane + magnetite → ethane + hematite ''&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nCH_4 + nFe_3O_4 + nH_2O \rarr C_2H_6 + Fe_2O_3 + HCO_3 + H^+}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- nothing is being reduced here to counterbalance the oxidation of both C and Fe, so something is obviously wrong --&gt;

Reaction 3 results in n-alkane hydrocarbons, including linear saturated hydrocarbons, [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[aromatic]]s, and cyclic compounds.&lt;ref name="charlou2005" /&gt;

===Carbonate decomposition===
Calcium carbonate may decompose at around {{convert|500|°C|°F}} through the following reaction:&lt;ref name="scott2004" /&gt;

'''Reaction 5''':&lt;br&gt;
''Hydrogen + calcium carbonate → methane + calcium oxide + water ''&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{4H_2 + CaCO_3 \rarr CH_4 + CaO + 2H_2O}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that CaO (lime) is not a mineral species found within natural rocks. Whilst this reaction is possible, it is not plausible.

===Evidence of abiogenic mechanisms===
* Theoretical calculations by J.F. Kenney using scaled particle theory (a statistical mechanical model) for a simplified perturbed hard-chain predict that methane compressed to {{convert|30000|bar|GPa}} or {{convert|40000|bar|GPa}} kbar at {{convert|1000|°C|°F}} (conditions in the mantle) is relatively unstable in relation to higher hydrocarbons. However, these calculations do not include methane pyrolysis yielding amorphous carbon and hydrogen, which is recognized as the prevalent reaction at high temperatures.&lt;ref name="kenney2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kenney2002" /&gt;
* Experiments in diamond anvil high pressure cells have resulted in partial conversion of methane and inorganic carbonates into light hydrocarbons.,&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sharma, A. |title = In Situ Diamond-Anvil Cell Observations of Methanogenesis at High Pressures and Temperatures|journal = Energy Fuels|pages = 5571–5579|date = 2009|doi= 10.1021/ef9006017|volume = 23|issue = 11|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolesnikov"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Kolesnikov, A. |title = Methane-derived hydrocarbons produced under upper-mantle conditions|journal = Nature Geoscience|pages = 566–570|date = 2009|doi= 10.1038/ngeo591|volume = 2|bibcode = 2009NatGe...2..566K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic (microbial) hydrocarbons==
The "deep biotic petroleum hypothesis", similar to the abiogenic petroleum origin hypothesis, holds that not all [[petroleum]] deposits within the Earth's rocks can be explained purely according to the orthodox view of [[petroleum geology]].  [[Thomas Gold]] used the term ''the deep hot biosphere'' to describe the microbes which live underground.&lt;ref name="gold1999" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas Gold | title = The Deep, Hot Biosphere | journal = PNAS | date = 1992 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/13/6045 | accessdate = 2006-09-27 | volume = 89 | pages = 6045–6049 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.13.6045 | pmid = 1631089 | issue = 13 | pmc = 49434 | bibcode=1992PNAS...89.6045G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/DHB.html | title =  The Deep, Hot Biosphere| accessdate = 2006-09-27| last = Gold| first = Thomas| authorlink = Thomas Gold|date=July 1992 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021004123112/http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/DHB.html |archivedate = 2002-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This hypothesis is different from biogenic oil in that the role of deep-dwelling microbes is a biological source for oil which is not of a sedimentary origin and is not sourced from surface carbon. Deep microbial life is only a contaminant of primordial hydrocarbons. Parts of microbes yield molecules as biomarkers.

Deep biotic oil is considered to be formed as a byproduct of the life cycle of deep microbes.
Shallow biotic oil is considered to be formed as a byproduct of the life cycles of shallow microbes.

===Microbial biomarkers===
[[Thomas Gold]], in a 1999 book, cited the discovery of [[thermophile]] bacteria in the Earth's crust as new support for the postulate that these bacteria could explain the existence of certain [[Biomarker (petroleum)|biomarker]]s in extracted petroleum.&lt;ref name="gold1999"/&gt; A rebuttal of biogenic origins based on biomarkers has been offered by Kenney, et al. (2001).&lt;ref name=glasby2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="kenney2001" /&gt;

====Isotopic evidence====
[[Methane]] is ubiquitous in crustal fluid and gas.&lt;ref name="lollar2006" /&gt; Research continues to attempt to characterise crustal sources of methane as biogenic or abiogenic using carbon isotope fractionation of observed gases (Lollar &amp; Sherwood 2006). There are few clear examples of abiogenic methane-ethane-butane, as the same processes favor enrichment of light isotopes in all chemical reactions, whether organic or inorganic. δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of methane overlaps that of inorganic carbonate and graphite in the crust, which are heavily depleted in &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, and attain this by isotopic fractionation during metamorphic reactions.

One argument for abiogenic oil cites the high carbon depletion of methane as stemming from the observed carbon isotope depletion with depth in the crust. However, diamonds, which are definitively of mantle origin, are not as depleted as methane, which implies that methane carbon isotope fractionation is not controlled by mantle values.&lt;ref name="mello2005"&gt;M. R. Mello and J. M. Moldowan (2005). Petroleum: To Be Or Not To Be Abiogenic. ''AAPG Research Conference'', Calgary, Canada, 2005.

Commercially extractable concentrations of [[helium]] (greater than 0.3%) are present in natural gas from the Panhandle-[[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton]] fields in the USA, as well as from some Algerian and Russian gas fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/helium/330495.pdf "Helium", USGS, Joseph B.

The Chimaera gas seep, near Antalya (SW Turkey), new and thorough molecular and isotopic analyses including methane (~87% v/v; D13C1 from -7.9 to -12.3 ‰; D13D1 from -119 to -124 ‰), light alkanes (C2+C3+C4+C5 = 0.5%; C6+: 0.07%; D13C2 from -24.2 to -26.5 ‰; D13C3 from -25.5 to -27 ‰), hydrogen (7.5 to 11%), carbon dioxide (0.01-0.07%; D13CCO2: -15 ‰), helium (~80 ppmv; R/Ra: 0.41) and nitrogen (2-4.9%; D15N from -2 to -2.8 ‰) converge to indicate that the seep releases a mixture of organic thermogenic gas, related to mature Type III kerogen occurring in Paleozoic and Mesozoic organic rich sedimentary rocks, and abiogenic gas produced by low temperature serpentinization in the Tekirova ophiolitic unit.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez, H. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hoşgörmez, H.|author2= Etiope, G.|author3= Yalçın, M.N. |title= New evidence for a mixed inorganic and organic origin of the Olympic Chimaera fire (Turkey): a large onshore seepage of abiogenic gas |journal= Geofluids |issue= 8 |pages= 263–273 |date= 2008 |doi= 10.1111/j.1468-8123.2008.00226.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomarker chemicals===
Certain chemicals found in naturally occurring petroleum contain chemical and structural similarities to compounds found within many living organisms. These include [[terpenoid]]s, [[terpene]]s, [[pristane]], [[phytane]], [[cholestane]], [[chlorin]]s and [[porphyrin]]s, which are large, [[chelate|chelating]] molecules in the same family as [[heme]] and [[chlorophyll]]. Materials which suggest certain biological processes include {{cns|text=tetracyclic diterpane and oleanane.|date=December 2014}}

The presence of these chemicals in crude oil is a result of the inclusion of biological material in the oil; these chemicals are released by [[kerogen]] during the production of hydrocarbon oils, as these are chemicals highly resistant to degradation and plausible chemical paths have been studied. Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as it gets in touch with ancient fossils. However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria (archaea) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in that environment. For example, hopanoids are just parts of the bacterial cell wall present in oil as contaminant.&lt;ref name="gold1999"/&gt;

===Trace metals===
[[Nickel]] (Ni), [[vanadium]] (V), [[lead]] (Pb), [[arsenic]] (As), [[cadmium]] (Cd), [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and others metals frequently occur in oils. Some heavy crude oils, such as Venezuelan heavy crude have up to 45% [[vanadium]] pentoxide content in their ash, high enough that it is a commercial source for vanadium. Abiotic supporters argue that these metals are common in Earth's mantle, but relatively high contents of nickel, vanadium, lead and arsenic can be usually found in almost all marine sediments.

Analysis of 22 trace elements in oils correlate significantly better with [[chondrite]], serpentinized fertile mantle peridotite, and the primitive mantle than with oceanic or continental crust, and shows no correlation with seawater.&lt;ref name="szatmari" /&gt;

===Reduced carbon===
Sir [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]] studied the chemical makeup of natural petroleum oils in great detail, and concluded that they were mostly far too hydrogen-rich to be a likely product of the decay of plant debris, assuming a dual origin for Earth hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="goldusgs" /&gt;   However, several processes which generate hydrogen could supply kerogen hydrogenation which is compatible with the conventional explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhijun Jin |author2=Liuping Zhang|author3=Lei Yang|author4=Wenxuan Hu   |date=January 2004 | title = A preliminary study of mantle-derived fluids and their effects on oil/gas generation in sedimentary basins | journal = Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering | volume = 41 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 45–55 | doi = 10.1016/S0920-4105(03)00142-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olefin]]s, the unsaturated hydrocarbons, would have been expected to predominate by far in any material that was derived in that way. He also wrote: "Petroleum ... [seems to be] a primordial hydrocarbon mixture into which bio-products have been added."

This has however been demonstrated later to be a misunderstanding by Robinson, related to the fact that only short duration experiments were available to him.  Olefins are thermally very unstable (that is why natural petroleum normally does not contain such compounds) and in laboratory experiments that last more than a few hours, the olefins are no longer present.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The presence of low-oxygen and hydroxyl-poor hydrocarbons in natural living media is supported by the presence of natural waxes (n=30+), oils (n=20+) and lipids in both plant matter and animal matter, for instance fats in phytoplankton, zooplankton and so on. These oils and waxes, however, occur in quantities too small to significantly affect the overall hydrogen/carbon ratio of biological materials.
However, after the discovery of highly aliphatic biopolymers in algae, and that oil generating kerogen essentially represent concentrates of such materials, no theoretical problem exists anymore.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Also, the millions of source rock samples that have been analyzed for petroleum yield by the petroleum industry have confirmed the large quantities of petroleum found in sedimentary basins.

==Empirical evidence==
Occurrences of abiotic petroleum in commercial amounts in the oil wells in offshore Vietnam are sometimes cited, as well as in the [[Eugene Island block 330 oil field]], and the Dnieper-Donets Basin.  However, the origins of all these wells can also be explained with the biotic theory.&lt;ref name="glasby2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook" /&gt; Modern geologists think that commercially profitable deposits of abiotic petroleum ''could'' be found, but no current deposit has convincing evidence that it originated from abiotic sources.&lt;ref name="Hook"/&gt;

The Soviet school saw evidence of their{{clarify|date=December 2014}} hypothesis in the fact that some oil reservoirs exist in non-sedimentary rocks such as granite, metamorphic or porous volcanic rocks. However, opponents noted that non-sedimentary rocks served as reservoirs for biologically originated oil expelled from nearby sedimentary source rock through common migration or re-migration mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Hook"/&gt;

The following observations have been commonly used to argue for the abiogenic hypothesis, however each observation of actual petroleum can also be fully explained by biotic origin:&lt;ref name="Hook"/&gt;

===Lost City hydrothermal vent field===
The [[Lost City (hydrothermal field)|Lost City]] hydrothermal field was determined to have abiogenic hydrocarbon production.  Proskurowski et al. wrote, "Radiocarbon evidence rules out seawater bicarbonate as the carbon source for [[Fisher-Tropsch process|FTT reactions]], suggesting that a mantle-derived inorganic carbon source is leached from the host rocks. Our findings illustrate that the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks, water, and moderate amounts of heat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Proskurowski Giora | date = 2008 | title = Abiogenic Hydrocarbon Production at Lost City Hydrothermal Field | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/319/5863/604 | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5863| pages = 604–607 | doi = 10.1126/science.1151194 | pmid = 18239121 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siljan Ring crater===
The [[Siljan Ring]] meteorite crater, Sweden, was proposed by [[Thomas Gold]] as the most likely place to test the hypothesis because it was one of the few places in the world where the granite basement was cracked sufficiently (by meteorite impact) to allow oil to seep up from the mantle; furthermore it is infilled with a relatively thin veneer of sediment, which was sufficient to trap any abiogenic oil, but was modelled as not having been subjected to the heat and pressure conditions (known as the "oil window") normally required to create biogenic oil.  However, some geochemists concluded by geochemical analysis that the oil in the seeps came from the organic-rich [[Ordovician]] Tretaspis shale, where it was heated by the meteorite impact.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Shirley, "Siljan project stays in cross fire", ''AAPG Explorer'', January 1987, p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986–1990 The Gravberg-1 borehole was drilled through the deepest rock in the Siljan Ring in which proponents had hoped to find hydrocarbon reservoirs. It stopped at the depth of {{convert|6800|m|ft}} due to drilling problems, after private investors spent $40 million.&lt;ref name=kerr /&gt; Some eighty barrels of magnetite paste and hydrocarbon-bearing sludge were recovered from the well; Gold maintained that the hydrocarbons were chemically different from, and not derived from, those added to the borehole, but analyses showed that the hydrocarbons were derived from the diesel fuel-based drilling fluid used in the drilling.&lt;ref name=kerr /&gt;&lt;ref name=jeffrey /&gt;&lt;ref name=castano /&gt;&lt;ref name=jeffrey2&gt;Alan Jeffrey and Isaac Kaplan, [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=00019898&amp;soc=SPE "Asphaltene-like material in Siljan Ring well suggests mineralized altered drilling fluid"], ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'', December 1989, p.1262&amp;ndash;1263, 1310&amp;ndash;1313. The authors conclude: "No evidence for an indigenous or deep source for the hydrocarbons could be justified."&lt;/ref&gt; This well also sampled over {{convert|13000|ft|m}} of methane-bearing inclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~pbrown/fi/pac6/mikesmith.html Fluid Inclusion Volatile Well Logs of the Gravberg#1 Well, Siljan Ring, Sweden] Michael P. Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991–1992, a second borehole, Stenberg-1, was drilled a few miles away to a depth of {{convert|6500|m|ft}}, finding similar results. Again, no abiotic hydrocarbons were found.&lt;ref name=glasby2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=mello2005 /&gt;

===Bacterial mats===
Direct observation of bacterial mats and fracture-fill carbonate and humin of bacterial origin in deep boreholes in Australia are also taken as evidence for the abiogenic origin of petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bons P. | date = 2004 | title = Fossil microbes in late proterozoic fibrous calcite veins from Arkaroola, South Australia | journal = Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs | volume = 36 | issue = 5| page = 475 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bạch Hổ oil field]] in [[Vietnam]] has been proposed as an example of abiogenic oil because it is 4,000 m of fractured basement granite, at a depth of 5,000 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anirbid Sircar  | date = 2004-07-25 | title = Hydrocarbon production from fractured basement formations | journal = Current Science | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–151 | url = http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul252004/147.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that it contains biogenic oil which leaked into the basement horst from conventional source rocks within the [[Cuu Long]] basin.&lt;ref name="brown2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White Tiger oilfield, Vietnam.

The Chimaera gas seep, near [[Çıralı]], [[Antalya Province|Antalya]] (southwest Turkey), has been continuously active for millennia and it is known to be the source of the first Olympic fire in the Hellenistic period. On the basis of chemical composition and isotopic analysis, the Chimaera gas is said to be about half biogenic and half abiogenic gas, the largest emission of biogenic methane discovered; deep and pressurized gas accumulations necessary to sustain the gas flow for millennia, posited to be from an inorganic source, may be present.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez, H. 2008"/&gt; Local geology of Chimaera flames, at exact position of flames, reveals contact between serpentinized ophiolite and carbonate rocks.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Geological arguments ==

===Incidental arguments for abiogenic oil===

Given the known occurrence of methane and the probable catalysis of methane into higher atomic weight hydrocarbon molecules, various abiogenic theories consider the following to be key observations in support of abiogenic hypotheses:
* the serpentinite synthesis, graphite synthesis and spinel catalysation models prove the process is viable&lt;ref name="szatmari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="charlou2005" /&gt;
* the likelihood that abiogenic oil seeping up from the mantle is trapped beneath sediments which effectively seal mantle-tapping faults&lt;ref name="keith2005" /&gt;
* outdated{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} mass-balance calculations{{when|date=December 2014}} for supergiant oilfields which argued that the calculated source rock could not have supplied the reservoir with the known accumulation of oil, implying deep recharge.&lt;ref name=Kudryavtsev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kudryavtsev2/&gt;
* the presence of hydrocarbons encapsulated in diamonds &lt;ref name="Leung et al.,2005" &gt;Leung, I.; Tsao, C.; Taj-Eddin, I. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUSM.V51A..12L Hydrocarbons Encapsulated in Diamonds From China and India] // American Geophysical Union, Spring Meeting 2005, abstract #V51A-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of abiogenic oil also use several arguments which draw on a variety of natural phenomena in order to support the hypothesis:

* the modeling of some researchers shows the Earth was accreted at relatively low temperature, thereby perhaps preserving primordial carbon deposits within the mantle, to drive abiogenic hydrocarbon production{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* the presence of methane within the gases and fluids of mid-ocean ridge spreading centre [[hydrothermal]] fields{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* the presence of diamond within [[kimberlite]]s and [[lamproite]]s which sample the mantle depths proposed as being the source region of mantle methane (by Gold et al.).&lt;ref name="goldusgs" /&gt;

===Incidental arguments against abiogenic oil===
[[Image:USGS world oil endowment.png|thumb|Oil deposits are not directly associated with tectonic structures.]]
Arguments against chemical reactions, such as the serpentinite mechanism, being a source of hydrocarbon deposits within the crust include:

* the lack of any hydrocarbon within the crystalline shield{{clarify|date=November 2014}} areas of the major [[craton]]s, especially around key deep seated structures which are predicted to host oil by the abiogenic hypothesis.&lt;ref name="mello2005" /&gt; See [[Siljan (lake)#Deep drilling project|Siljan Lake]].

* [[Kudryavtsev's Rule]] has been explained for oil and gas (not coal)—gas deposits which are below oil deposits can be created from that oil or its source rocks.  Because natural gas is less dense than oil, as kerogen and hydrocarbons are generating gas the gas fills the top of the available space.  Oil is forced down, and can reach the spill point where oil leaks around the edge(s) of the formation and flows upward.  If the original formation becomes completely filled with gas then all the oil will have leaked above the original location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Price  | first = Leigh C.  | title = Origins, Characteristics, Evidence For, and Economic Viabilities of Conventional and Unconventional Gas Resource Bases  | journal = Geologic controls of deep natural gas resources in the United States (USGS Bulletin 2146)  | pages = 181–207  | publisher = USGS  | date = 1997  | url = https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/b/b2146  | accessdate = 2006-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome." &lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions|[weasel ]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B.

== Workplace bullying ==

{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workplace deviance ==

{{Main|Workplace deviance}}
Workplace deviance is closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = M. | last2 = Ambrose | first2 = M.L. | year = 2007 | title = Abusive Supervision and Workplace Deviance and the Moderating Effects of Negative Reciprocity Beliefs | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 4| pages = 1159–1168 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.4.1159 | pmid=17638473}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bolin | first1 = A. | last2 = Heatherly | first2 =  | year = 2001 | title = Predictors of Employee Deviance: The Relationship between Bad Attitudes and Bad Behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Business and Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| page = 405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".&lt;ref&gt;The past, present, and future of workplace deviance research.
Bennett, Rebecca J.; Robinson, Sandra L.Greenberg, Jerald (Ed), (2003). Organizational behavior: The state of the science (2nd ed.), (pp. 247-281).&lt;/ref&gt; Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

== Social undermining ==

{{Main|Social undermining}}
Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S. H. | last2 = John | first2 = O. P. | year = 1997 | title = A hostility scale for the California Psychological Inventory: MMPI, observer Q-sort, and Big-five correlates | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 408–424 | doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6902_11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 452–471 | doi=10.5465/amr.1999.2202131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person’s] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref&gt;8. Hoobler, J. M., &amp; Brass, D. J. (2006). Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 91(5), 1125-1133. {{DOI|10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Machiavellianism ==

{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
In research, the presence of ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Kohyar Kiazada, Simon Lloyd D. Restubog, Thomas J. Zagenczyk, Christian Kiewitz, Robert L. Tang In pursuit of power: The role of authoritarian leadership in the relationship between supervisors’ Machiavellianism and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervisory behavior&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to information''' is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. This sometimes includes "scientific, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and [[Educational technology|e-learning]]; diffusion of new media and information [[literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/access.html|title=Access to information.|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While “access to information”, “right to information”, “[[right to know]]” and “freedom of information” are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
There has been a signiﬁcant increase in access to the [[Internet]], which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world’s population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But the [[digital divide]] continues to exclude over half of the world’s population, particularly women and girls, and especially in Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/ﬁleadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/ofﬁcial_documents/Eng%20-%20Recommendation%20concerning%20the%20Promotion%20and%20Use%20of%20Multilingualism%20and%20Universal%20Access%20to%20Cyberspace.pdf|title=Recommendation s concerning the promotion and use of multilinguisme and universal access to cyberspace|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]] as well as several [[Small Island Developing States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001878/187832e.pdf|title=Towards Inclusive Knowledge Societies: A Review of UNESCO Action in Implementing the WSIS Outcomes.|last=Souter|first=David|date=2010|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, individuals with disabilities can either be advantaged or further disadvantaged by the design of technologies or through the presence or absence of [[Information and media literacy|training and education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002272/227229e.pdf|title=Photos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
=== The Digital Divide ===
{{Main|Digital divide}}
Access to information faces great difficulties because of the global digital divide. A digital divide is an [[Economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html|title=FALLING THROUGH THE NET:   A Survey of the "Have Nots" in Rural and Urban America {{!}} National Telecommunications and Information Administration|website=www.ntia.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divide within countries (such as the [[digital divide in the United States]]) may refer to inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] levels or other demographic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wfNPdyiwbYQC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=9780521002233&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Digital Divide: Civic Engagement, Information Poverty, and the Internet Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|last2=Norris|first2=McGuire Lecturer in Comparative Politics Pippa|date=2001-09-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00223-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the [[global digital divide]], examining this technological gap between developing and developed countries on an international scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-L8frgEACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Robert+W.+Fairlie%22|title=The Determinants of the Global Digital Divide: A Cross-country Analysis of Computer and Internet Penetration|last=Lee|first=Jaewoo|last2=Andreoni|first2=James|last3=Bagwell|first3=Kyle|last4=Cripps|first4=Martin W.|last5=Chinn|first5=Menzie David|last6=Durlauf|first6=Steven N.|last7=Brock|first7=William A.|last8=Che|first8=Yeon-Koo|last9=Cohen-Cole|first9=Ethan|date=2004|publisher=Social Systems Research Institute, University of Wisconsin|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender Divide ===
Women's [[freedom of information]] and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting [[mobile phone]] use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/|title=‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India|website=genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the [[LGBT]]QI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/statefree-expression-online-southeast-asia|title=Deeplinks Blog|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as [[YouTube]]’s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Elle. 2017. LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible. The Guardian. Available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-communityanger-over-youtube-restrictions-whichmake-their-videos-invisible&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The security argument ===
With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of [[freedom of speech]] and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Wolfgang|first=Schultz|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100185-7|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Access ==

=== Media and Information Literacy ===
According to Kuzmin and Parshakova, access to information entails learning in formal and informal education settings. It also entails fostering the competencies of [[Information and media literacy|Media and Information Literacy]] (MIL) that enable users to be empowered and make full use of access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Kuzmin, E., and Parshakova, A. (2013), Media and Information Literacy for Knowledge Societies. Translated by Butkova, T., Kuptsov, Y., and Parshakova, A. Moscow: Interregional Library Cooperation Centre for UNESCO. http://www.ifapcom.ru/ﬁles/News/Images/2013/mil_eng_web.pdf#page=24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2013a), UNESCO Communication and Information Sector with UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Global Media and Information Literacy Assessment Framework: Country Readiness and Competencies. Paris: UNESCO. Available online at http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002246/224655e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO's support for [[journalism education]] is an example of how UNESCO seeks to contribute to the provision of independent and veriﬁable information accessible in [[cyberspace]]. Promoting access for disabled persons has been strengthened by the UNESCO-convened conference in 2014, which adopted the “New Delhi Declaration on Inclusive ICTs for Persons with Disabilities: Making Empowerment a Reality”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), ""Open Standards" are standards made available to the general public and developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. "Open Standards" facilitate [[interoperability]] and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption." A UNESCO study considers that adopting open standards has the potential to contribute to the vision of a ‘digital commons’ in which citizens can freely ﬁnd, share, and re-use information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Promoting open source software, which is both free of cost and freely modiﬁable could help meet the particular needs of marginalized users advocacy on behalf of minority groups, such as targeted outreach, better provision of Internet access, tax incentives for private companies and organizations working to enhance access, and solving underlying issues of social and economic inequalities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Privacy protections ==

=== Privacy, surveillance and encryption ===
The increasing access to and reliance on [[digital media]] to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals’ behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of Europe, new [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] have enabled a greater degree of [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens’ data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights, the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== International framework ====
The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] has taken a number of steps to highlight the importance of the universal right to privacy online. In 2015, in a resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age, it established a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council. 2016. The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet. A/HRC/32/13. Available at http://www.un.org/en/ga/71/meetings/. Accessed 23 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Human Rights Council emphasized that the ‘unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/ or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference’.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council. 2017. The right to privacy in the digital age. A/HRC/34/L.7/ Rev.1. Available at http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/34/L.7/Rev.1. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional framework ====
Number of regional efforts, particularly through the courts, to establish regulations that deal with data protection, privacy and surveillance, and which affect their relationship to journalistic uses. The [[Council of Europe]]’s Convention 108, the [[Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data|Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]], has undergone a modernization process to address new challenges to privacy. Since 2012, four new countries belonging to the Council of Europe have signed or ratified the Convention, as well as three countries that do not belong to the Council, from [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2017. Chart of signatures and ratifications of Treaty 108. Council of Europe Treaty Office. Available at http://www.coe.int/web/conventions/full-list. Accessed 7 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional courts are also playing a noteworthy role in the development of online privacy regulations. In 2015 the European Court of Justice found that the so-called ‘Safe Harbour Agreement’, which allowed private companies to ‘legally transmit personal data from their European subscribers to the US’,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. n.d. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. Justice. Available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en&lt;/ref&gt;  was not valid under [[European Union law|European law]] in that it did not offer sufficient protections for the data of European citizens or protect them from arbitrary surveillance. In 2016, the [[European Commission]] and [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] reached an agreement to replace Safe Harbour, the [[EU–US Privacy Shield|EU-U.S. Privacy Shield]], which includes data protection obligations on companies receiving personal data from the European Union, safeguards on United States government access to data, protection and redress for individuals, and an annual joint review to monitor implementation.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. n.d. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. Justice. Available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Justice]]’s 2014 decision in the Google Spain case allowed people to claim a ‘[[right to be forgotten]]’ or ‘right to be de-listed’ in a much-debated approach to the balance between privacy, free expression and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Cannataci, Joseph A., Bo Zhao, Gemma Torres Vives, Shara Monteleone, Jeanne Mifsud Bonnici, and Evgeni Moyakine. 2016. Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age. Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Google Spain decision the ‘right to be forgotten’ or ‘right to be de-listed’ has been recognized in a number of countries across the world, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Daphne. 2017.

Available at http://www.privacyregulation.eu/en/r153.htm. Accessed 7 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; states "Member States law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information, including journalistic…with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes…should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, Wolfgang, and Joris van Hoboken. 2016a.

==== National framework ====
The number of countries around the world with data protection laws has also continued to grow. According to the World Trends Report 2017/2018, between 2012 and 2016, 20 UNESCO Member States adopted data protection laws for first time, bringing the global total to 101.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2017. Global Tables of Data Privacy Laws and Bills (5th ed.). Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these new adoptions, nine were in Africa, four in Asia and the Pacific, three in Latin America and the Caribbean, two in the Arab region and one in Western Europe and North America. During the same period, 23 countries revised their data protection laws, reflecting the new challenges to data protection in the digital era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Global Partners Digital, only four States have secured in national legislation a general right to encryption, and 31 have enacted national legislation that grants law enforcement agencies the power [[Human rights and encryption|to intercept or decrypt encrypted communications]].&lt;ref&gt;Global Partners Digital. n.d.

=== Protection of confidential sources and whistle-blowing ===
Rapid changes in the [[digital environment]], coupled with contemporary journalist practice that increasingly relies on digital communication technologies, pose new risks for the protection of journalism sources. Leading contemporary threats include [[mass surveillance]] technologies, mandatory data retention policies, and disclosure of personal digital activities by third party intermediaries. Without a thorough understanding of how to shield their digital communications and traces, journalists and sources can unwittingly reveal identifying information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Open Society Justice Initiative. 2013. The Global Principles on National Security and the Right to Information (Tshwane Principles). New York: Open Society Foundations.&lt;/ref&gt; Employment of national security legislation, such as [[counter-terrorism laws]], to override existing legal protections for source protection is also becoming a common practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In many regions, persistent secrecy laws or new cybersecurity laws threaten the protection of sources, such as when they give governments the right to intercept online communications in the interest of overly broad definitions of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Posetti, Julie. 2017a. Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age. UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom. Paris, France: UNESCO Publishing. Available at http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/protecting_journalism_sources_in_digital_age.pdf. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in regards to source protection laws have occurred between 2007 and mid-2015 in 84 (69 per cent) of the 121 countries surveyed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Posetti, Julie. 2017b.

International Programme for the Development of Communication, Paris, France: UNESCO Publishing. Available at http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002593/259399e.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab region had the most notable developments, where 86 per cent of States had demonstrated shifts, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (85 per cent), Asia and the Pacific (75 per cent), Western Europe and North America (66 per cent) and finally Africa, where 56 per cent of States examined had revised their source protection laws.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As of 2015, at least 60 States had adopted some form of whistle-blower protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, David. 2015a. Promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. United Nations General Assembly.

== Media Pluralism ==
According to the [[World Trends Report]], access to a variety of media increased between 2012 and 2016. The internet has registered the highest growth in users supported by massive investments in infrastructure and significant uptake in mobile usage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B054385_2_76&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet mobile ===
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the work of the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]], co-chaired by UNESCO, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]]’s intersessional work on ‘Connecting the Next Billion' are proof of the international commitments towards providing Internet access for all. According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017a. Key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries and the world (totals and penetration rates). World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators database. Available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/wtid.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b. Status of the transition to Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting: Figures. ITU Telecommunication Development Sector. Available at http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Spectrum-Broadcasting/Pages/DSO/figures.aspx .&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020.  As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;GSMA. 2017. The Mobile Economy 2017. Available at https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the internet. [[Zero-rating]], the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017.

=== Broadcast media ===
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of [[television]] as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than [[radio]], which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 [[Reuters]] Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A. L. Levy, and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen. 2017. Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Digital%20News%20Report%202017%20 web_0.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is reversed when it comes to online media, chosen by 64 per cent of users between 18 and 24 as their primary source, but only by 28 per cent of users 55 and older.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  According to the Arab Youth Survey, in 2016, 45 per cent of the young people interviewed considered social media as a major source of news.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller. 2016. Arab Youth Survey Middle East – Findings. Available at http://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language [[EFE|Agencia EFE]], have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences. Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, [[China]] [[Global Television Network]] (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by [[China Central Television]], changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017. After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], [[Amharic]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pidgin]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. 2016.

Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as online streaming is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, Netflix experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the United States, where the company began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Tom. 2017. Netflix Has More U.S. Subscribers Than Cable TV. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/15/netflix-more-subscribersthan-cable/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper industry ===
The [[Internet]] has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt; As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

{{Main|International Programme for the Development of Communication}}
The International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) is a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) programme aimed at strengthening the development of [[mass media]] in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. Its mandate since 2003 is “... to contribute to sustainable development, democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.&lt;ref&gt;Amendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32,  adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] is responsible for the follow-up of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2. Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them. The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/powering-sustainable-development-access-information/about-ipdctalks|title=About the IPDCtalks|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] global report on follow-up to SDGs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 28 September 2015, UNESCO adopted the [[Access to Information Day|International Day for the Universal Access to Information]] during its 38th session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235297e.pdf |title=Images |website=unesdoc.unesco.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the International Day, the IPDC organized the “IPDC Talks: Powering Sustainable Development with Access to Information” event, which gathered high-level participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/iduai2017|title=International Day for Universal Access to Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual event aims on highlighting the “importance of access to information” for sustainable development.

==== The Internet Universality framework ====
{{Main|Internet Universality}}
Internet Universality is the concept that "the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and [[Social relation|social interactions]] and relationships, which has the potential to enable [[human rights]], empower individuals and communities, and facilitate [[sustainable development]]. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on [[Multistakeholder governance model|Multistakeholder]] participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of [[Internet governance|Internet development]], concerned with technology and [[public policy]], rights and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality/about|title=Internet Universality|date=10 July 2017|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights access to information as a key to assess a better Internet environment. There is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming [[digital divide]]s, [[digital inequality|digital inequalities]], and [[Social exclusion|exclusions]] based on skills, [[literacy]], language, [[gender]] or disability. It also points to the need for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[business model]]s for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the ROAM principles, UNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators to help governments and other stakeholders assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality, such as access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet|title=Freedom of Expression on the Internet|date=25 October 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The World Bank initiatives ===
In 2010, the [[World Bank]] launched the World Bank policy on access to information, which constitutes a major shift in the World Bank's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/access-to-information/overview#1|title=Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle binds the World Bank to disclose any requested information, unless it is on a "list of exception":

# "[[Personal information management|Personal information]]
# Communications of Governors and/or Executive Directors’ Offices
# [[Ethics]] Committee
# [[Attorney–client privilege|Attorney-Client Privilege]]
# Security and Safety Information
# Separate Disclosure Regimes
# Confidential Client/Third Party Information
# Corporate Administrative
# Deliberative Information*
# Financial Information"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/740621437416268169/AI-Brochure-English-2015.pdf |title=Brochure |website=pubdocs.worldbank.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank is prone to Open Developments with its [[Open data]], Open Finance and [[Open knowledge]] repository.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The World Summit on the Information Societies ===
{{Main|World Summit on the Information Society}}
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was a two-phase United Nations-sponsored summit on information, communication and, in broad terms, the [[information society]] that took place in 2003 in [[Geneva]] and in 2005 in [[Tunis]]. One of its chief aims was to bridge the [[global digital divide]] separating rich countries from poor countries by spreading access to the Internet in the [[Developing country|developing world]]. The conferences established 17 May as [[World Information Society Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2018/Pages/About|title=About – WSIS Forum 2018|website=www.itu.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional framework ==
The results from UNESCO monitoring of [[Sustainable Development Goal 16|SDG 16]].10.2 show that 112 countries have now adopted freedom of information legislation or similar administrative regulations.&lt;ref&gt;freedominfo.org 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Of these, 22 adopted new legislation since 2012. At the regional level, [[Africa]] has seen the highest growth, with 10 countries adopting freedom of information legislation in the last five years, more than doubling the number of countries in the region to have such legislation from nine to 19. A similarly high growth rate has occurred in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, where seven countries adopted freedom of information laws in the last five years, bringing the total to 22. In addition, during the reporting period, two countries in the [[Arab world|Arab region]], two countries in [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas|Latin America and the Caribbean]], and one country in [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] adopted freedom of information legislation. The vast majority of the world’s population now lives in a country with a freedom of information law, and several countries currently have freedom of information bills under consideration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National framework ==
[[File:Member States by region with a freedom of information law or policy.png|thumb|504x504px|UNESCO Member States by region with a freedom of information law or policy]]

=== Freedom of information laws ===
{{See also|Freedom of information laws by country}}
While there has been an increase in countries with freedom of information laws, their implementation and effectiveness vary considerably across the world. The Global Right to Information Rating is a programme providing [[advocate]]s, [[legislator]]s, reformers with tools to assess the strength of a legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rti-rating.org/|title=Global Right to Information Rating|website=Global Right to Information Rating}}&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring the strength and legal framework of each country’s freedom of information law using the Right to Information Rating, one notable trend appears.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Law and Democracy &amp; Access Info. 2017b. Global Right to Information Rating Map. Global Right to Information Rating. Available at http://www.rti-rating.org/. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Largely regardless of [[Geography|geographic]] location, top scoring countries tend to have younger laws.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Law and Democracy &amp; Access Info. 2017a. About. Global Right to Information Rating. Available at http://www.rti-rating.org/about/. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]]’s 2017 report on the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to which UNESCO contributed freedom of information-related information, of the 109 countries with available data on implementation of freedom of information laws, 43 per cent do not sufficiently provide for public outreach and 43 per cent have overly-wide definitions of exceptions to disclosure, which run counter to the aim of increased [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. 2017. Sustainable Development Goals Report 2017. Available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the adoption of freedom of information laws; officials are often unfamiliar with the norms of transparency at the core of freedom of information or are unwilling to recognize them in practice. [[Journalist]]s often do not make effective use of freedom of information laws for a multitude of reasons: official failure to respond to information requests, extensive delays, receipt of heavily redacted documents, arbitrarily steep fees for certain types of requests, and a lack of professional training.&lt;ref&gt;Trapnell, Stephanie (editor). 2014. Right to Information: Case Studies on Implementation. Washington D. C.: World Bank Group. Available at http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/462751468000583408/pdf/98720-WPP118353-Box393176B-PUBLIC-RTI-CaseStudies-Implementation-WEBfinal.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates around public access to information have also focused on further developments in encouraging [[open data]] approaches to [[Open government|government transparency]]. In 2009, the data.gov portal was launched in the United States, collecting in one place most of the government open data; in the years following, there was a wave of government data opening around the world. As part of the [[Open Government Partnership]], a multilateral network established in 2011, some 70 countries have now issued National Action Plans, the majority of which contain strong open data commitments designed to foster greater transparency, generate economic growth, empower citizens, fight corruption and more generally enhance governance. In 2015 the Open Data Charter was founded in a multistakeholder process in order to establish principles for ‘how governments should be publishing information’.&lt;ref&gt;Open Data Charter. 2017b. Who we are. Open Data Charter. Available at https://opendatacharter.net/who-we-are/. Accessed 24 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter has been adopted by 17 national governments half of which were from [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas|Latin America and the Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;Open Data Charter. 2017a. Adopted By. Open Data Charter. Available at https://opendatacharter.net/adopted-by-countries-and-cities/. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Open Data Barometer, conducted by the [[World Wide Web Foundation]], shows that while 79 out of the 115 countries surveyed have open government data portals, in most cases ‘the right [[Policy|policies]] are not in place, nor is the breadth and quality of the data-sets released sufficient’. In general, the Open Data Barometer found that government data is usually ‘incomplete, out of date, of low quality, and fragmented’.&lt;ref&gt;World Wide Web Foundation. 2017. Open Data Barometer: Global Report Fourth Edition. Available at http://opendatabarometer.org/doc/4thEdition/ODB-4thEditionGlobalReport.pdf. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''axis mundi''' (also '''cosmic axis''', '''world axis''', '''world pillar''', '''center of the world''', '''world tree'''), in certain beliefs and philosophies, is the world center, or the connection between [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]]. As the [[celestial pole]] and [[geographic pole]], it expresses a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; Communication from lower realms may ascend to higher ones and blessings from higher realms may descend to lower ones and be disseminated to all.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The spot functions as the ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel), the world's point of beginning.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Cooper. ''An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols.'' Thames and Hudson: New York, 1978. {{ISBN|0500271259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014) World Navels. ''Cartouche'' 89: 15-21 http://philpapers.org/archive/WINWN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The image relates to the center of the earth (perhaps like an [[umbilical cord|umbilical]] providing nourishment){{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It may have the form of a natural object (a [[mountain]], a [[tree]], a [[vine]], a [[Plant stem|stalk]], a column of [[smoke]] or [[fire]]) or a product of human manufacture (a staff, a [[tower]], a [[ladder]], a [[staircase]], a [[maypole]], a [[cross]], a [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], a [[rope]], a [[totem pole]], a [[Column|pillar]], a [[spire]]). Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious ([[pagoda]], [[temple mount]], [[minaret]], [[church (building)|church]]) or secular ([[obelisk]], [[lighthouse]], [[rocket]], [[skyscraper]]). The image appears in religious and secular contexts.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"&gt;[[Jean Chevalier (writer)|Jean Chevalier]] and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.61-63, 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; The ''axis mundi'' symbol may be found in cultures utilizing [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices or [[animism|animist]] belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced "urban centers". In [[Mircea Eliade]]'s opinion, "Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.39&lt;/ref&gt; The axis mundi is often associated with [[mandalas]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]]]]
The symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the spot one occupies stands at "the center of the world". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.37-39&lt;/ref&gt; From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of [[China]], meaning "Middle Nation" ({{lang|zh|中国}} [[pinyin]]: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}''), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"/&gt;

Within the central known universe a specific locale-often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest gains status as center of the center, the '''axis mundi'''. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.41-43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]] fills a similar role in China.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Chong. ''Lunheng Part I: Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung''. Trans. Alfred Forke. London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1907. p.337.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Hebrews [[Mount Zion]] expressed the symbol.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Sioux]] beliefs take the [[Black Hills]] as the axis mundi.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Mount Kailash]] is holy to [[Hinduism]] and several religions in [[Tibet]]. The [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people in central Australia consider [[Uluru]] to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient [[Mesopotamia]] the cultures of ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Babylon]] erected artificial mountains, or [[ziggurat]]s, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuacán]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York (NY)|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob's Ladder]] is an axis mundi image, as is the [[Temple Mount]]. For Christians the [[Cross]] on Mount [[Calvary]] expresses the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.680-685&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]], known in [[Taoism|Taoist literature]] as "the mountain at the middle of the world." To "go into the mountains" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.681&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries of all faiths tend, like shrines, to be placed at elevated spots. Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.

Because the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as "the center of the world". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"/&gt; [[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Caananite]] tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).&lt;ref name="Bautch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelley Coblentz Bautch|title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17-19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13103-3|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urartu|ancient Armenians]] had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was [[Mount Ararat]], which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peopleofar.com/2013/08/11/noahs-ark-in-the-mountains-of-armenia/&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  In addition to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.

Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.148-149&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash in Norse myths]]

===Plants===
Plants often serve as images of the axis mundi. The image of the [[Cosmic Tree]] provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.42-45&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Pacific island]] cultures the [[banyan]] tree, of which the [[Bodhi tree]] is of the [[Sacred Fig]] variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ''ashwath vriksha'' ("I am banyan tree among trees" - ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.  The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the historical [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], sat on the night he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. The [[Yggdrasil]], or World Ash, functions in much the same way in [[Norse mythology]]; it is the site where [[Odin]] found enlightenment. Other examples include [[Jievaras]] in [[Lithuanian mythology]] and [[Thor's Oak]] in the myths of the pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples]]. The [[Tree of Life]] and the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the [[Garden of Eden|Paradise garden]] from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. [[Bamboo]], the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The [[Christmas tree]], which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian [[Europe]]an beliefs, represents an axis mundi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrandt, Alain.

===Human figure===
The human body can express the symbol of world axis.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the ''[[sefirot]]'' in [[Kabbalism]] and in the ''[[chakra]]'' system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as [[yoga]] and [[tai chi]] begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Indian Symbolisms of Time and Eternity' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. [[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Homes===
Homes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"/&gt; The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that "the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky."&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures. The central pole of the tent still operated as an axis but a fixed reference to the four compass points was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.529-531&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shamanic function===
A common [[shamanism|shamanic]] concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from [[Odin]] and the [[Yggdrasil|World Ash Tree]] to [[the Garden of Eden]] and [[Jacob's Ladder]] to [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and [[Rapunzel]]. It is the essence of the journey described in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]]. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.
It is also a central tenet in the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F. |  title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]]| publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-300-10601-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, [[mistletoe]]. Derivations of this idea find form in the [[Rod of Asclepius]], an emblem of the medical profession, and in the [[caduceus]], an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Synthesis|date=November 2008}}
Axis mundi symbolism continues to be evoked, even in modern societies, through various art forms and has a deep rooted spiritual inspiration that transcends time.

The idea has proven consequential in the realm of [[architecture]].  Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi.  A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as "centers" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137&lt;/ref&gt; The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. pp. 45, 69, 81, 91, 97,135, 136, 143&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The column takes the form of a "sky pillar" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn.  By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point.  The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image.  This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energistic and shamanic.&lt;ref&gt; Jennifer Westjohn. Photographer. "jenniferwestjohn.com" "the5thpoint.com" 2013-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the origin of life, see [[Abiogenesis]].''
'''Biogenesis''' is the production of new living [[organism]]s or [[organelle]]s. Conceptually, biogenesis is primarily attributed to [[Louis Pasteur]] and encompasses the belief that complex [[life|living things]] come only from other living things, by means of [[reproduction]]. That is, life does not spontaneously arise from non-living material, which was the position held by [[spontaneous generation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm Pasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pasteur#External links|Louis Pasteur: External links]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is summarized in the phrase ''Omne vivum ex vivo'', Latin for ''"all life [is] from life."'' A related statement is ''Omnis cellula e cellula'', "all cells [are] from cells;" this conclusion is one of the central statements of [[cell theory]].

== Biogenesis and abiogenesis ==
The term biogenesis was coined by [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] to mean the generation of a life form  from nonliving materials, however, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] chose the term [[abiogenesis]] and redefined biogenesis for life arising from preexisting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Strick |first= James |title= Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate= August 28, 2012 |date= April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv|chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of life from non-living material is called [[abiogenesis]], and occurred through stepwise chemical and [[molecular evolution]] over millions of years.&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120110"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spiegel |first=David S. |last2=Turner |first2=Edwin L. |title=Bayesian analysis of the astrobiological implications of life’s early emergence on Earth |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/2/395.full.pdf+html |date=January 10, 2012 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=109 |number=2 |pages=395–400 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1111694108 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |arxiv = 1107.3835 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109..395S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9868373"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Orgel LE| title=The origin of life--a review of facts and speculations. | journal=Trends Biochem Sci | year= 1998 | volume= 23 | issue= 12 | pages= 491–5 | pmid=9868373 | doi= 10.1016/s0968-0004(98)01300-0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9868373 | quote=Life, therefore, originated on or was transported to the earth at some point within a window of a few hundred million years that opened about four billion years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH-20060612"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharov |first=Alexei A. |title=Genome increase as a clock for the origin and evolution of life |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |date=June 12, 2006 |issue= |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-17 |pmc=1526419 |pmid=16768805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20110114"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vieru |first=Tudor |title=Life Is 10 Billion Years Old |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Life-Is-10-Billion-Years-Old-178156.shtml |date=January 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=March 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSR-201010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wesson |first=Paul S. |title=Panspermia, Past and Present: Astrophysical and Biophysical Conditions for the Dissemination of Life in Space |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11214-010-9671-x |date=October 2010 |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=156 |issue=1-4 |pages=239–252 |doi=10.1007/s11214-010-9671-x |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |arxiv = 1011.0101 |bibcode = 2010SSRv..156..239W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biogenesis'' may also refer to biochemical processes of production in living organisms (see [[biosynthesis]]).

==Spontaneous generation and its disproof==
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
The Ancient Greeks believed that living things could spontaneously come into being from nonliving matter, and that the goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] could make life arise spontaneously from stones – a process known as ''Generatio spontanea''. [[Aristotle]] disagreed, but he still believed that creatures could arise from dissimilar organisms or from soil. Variations of this concept of spontaneous generation still existed as late as the 17th century, but towards the end of the 17th century, a series of observations and arguments began that eventually discredited such ideas. This advance in scientific understanding was met with much opposition, with personal beliefs and individual prejudices often obscuring the facts.

[[William Harvey]] (1578–1657) was an early proponent of all life beginning from an egg, ''omne vivum ex ovo''.
[[Francesco Redi]], an Italian physician, proved as early as 1668 that higher forms of life did not originate spontaneously by demonstrating that [[maggot]]s come from eggs of [[fly|flies]].&lt;ref name=lev&gt;{{cite web|author= Levine R, Evers C|title= The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859)|url= http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080426191204/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2008-04-26|accessdate= 2013-04-18|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But proponents of spontaneous generation claimed that this did not apply to microbes and continued to hold that these could arise spontaneously.  Attempts to disprove the spontaneous generation of life from non-life continued in the early 19th century with observations and experiments by [[Franz Schulze]] and [[Theodor Schwann]].&lt;ref name="Jgerm"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juuXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 | title=Germ Theory | publisher=Twenty-First Century Books | author=Herbst, Judith | year=2013 | pages=18–20 | isbn=1467703710}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1745, [[John Needham]] added chicken broth to a flask and boiled it. He then let it cool and waited. Microbes grew, and he proposed it as an example of spontaneous generation. In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] repeated Needham's experiment but removed all the air from the flask. No growth occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsguide.in/microbiology/microbiology/controversy-over-spontaneous-generation.html The controversy over spontaneous generation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, [[Heinrich G. F. Schröder]] (1810–1885) and [[Theodor von Dusch]], and in 1859, Schröder  alone, repeated the [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] filtration experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1864, [[Louis Pasteur]] finally announced the results of his scientific experiments. In a series of experiments similar to those performed earlier by Needham and Spallanzani, Pasteur demonstrated that life does not arise in areas that have not been contaminated by existing life. Pasteur's empirical results were summarized in the phrase ''Omne vivum ex vivo'', Latin for "all life [is] from life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=27 The microbial world: a look at things small]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE8/B-Ab.html Biogenesis and Abiogenesis: Critiques and Addresses]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis.gif|Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis]]

After obtaining his results, Pasteur stated: "''La génération spontanée est une chimère''" ("Spontaneous generation is a dream").

Weisstein, '''Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics CD-ROM''', ''Bipolar Coordinates'', CD-ROM edition 1.0, May 20, 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005309/http://bbs.sachina.pku.edu.cn/Stat/Math_World/math/b/b233.htm |date=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first is based on the [[Apollonian circles]].  The curves of constant ''σ'' and of ''τ'' are circles that intersect at right angles.  The coordinates have two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which are generally taken to be fixed at (−''a'',&amp;nbsp;0) and (''a'',&amp;nbsp;0), respectively, on the ''x''-axis of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].  The second system is [[two-center bipolar coordinates]]. There is also a third coordinate system that is based on two poles ([[biangular coordinates]]).  

The term "bipolar" is sometimes used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s.  However, the term ''bipolar coordinates'' is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used to describe coordinates associated with those other curves, such as [[elliptic coordinates]].

[[File:Bipolar coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|Geometric interpretation of the bipolar coordinates. The angle σ is formed by the two foci and the point '''P''', whereas ''τ'' is the logarithm of the ratio of distances to the foci. The corresponding circles of constant ''σ'' and ''τ'' are shown in red and blue, respectively, and meet at right angles (magenta box); they are orthogonal.]]

== Definition ==

The most common definition of bipolar coordinates (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''σ''-coordinate of a point ''P'' equals the angle ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P''&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the ''τ''-coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the foci 

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_1}{d_2}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Recall that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are located at (−''a'',&amp;nbsp;0) and (''a'',&amp;nbsp;0), respectively.) Note that ''σ'' ranges from ''-π/2'' to ''π/2'', and ''τ'' ranges from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;
x + i y = a i \cot\left( \frac{\sigma + i \tau}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyanin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Happel"/&gt;

== Curves of constant ''σ'' and ''τ'' ==

[[File:Bipolar sigma isosurfaces.png|right|280px]]

[[File:Bipolar tau isosurfaces.png|right|280px]]

The curves of constant ''σ'' correspond to non-concentric circles 

:&lt;math&gt;
x^2 +
\left( y - a \cot \sigma \right)^2 = \frac{a^{2}}{\sin^2 \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that intersect at the two foci.  The centers of the constant-''σ'' circles lie on the ''y''-axis.  Circles of positive ''σ'' are centered above the ''x''-axis, whereas those of negative ''σ'' lie below the axis.  As the magnitude |''σ''| increases, the radius of the circles decreases and the center approaches the origin (0,&amp;nbsp;0), which is reached when |''σ''| = ''π''/2, its maximum value.

The curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting circles of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
y^2 +
\left( x - a \coth \tau \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sinh^2 \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the foci but again are not concentric. The centers of the constant-''τ'' circles lie on the ''x''-axis.  The circles of positive ''τ'' lie in the right-hand side of the plane (''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), whereas the circles of negative ''τ'' lie in the left-hand side of the plane (''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0).  The ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 curve corresponds to the ''y''-axis (''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).  As the magnitude of ''τ'' increases, the radius of the circles decreases and their centers approach the foci.

==Reciprocal relations==
The passage from the Cartesian coordinates towards the bipolar coordinates can be done via the following formulas:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tau = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{(x + a)^2 + y^2}{(x - a)^2 + y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \pi - \sigma = 2 \arctan \frac{2ay}{a^2 - x^2 - y^2 + \sqrt{(a^2 - x^2 - y^2)^2 + 4 a^2 y^2} }.
&lt;/math&gt;

We notice also those two remarkable identities: 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tanh \tau = \frac{2 a x}{x^2 + y^2 + a^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \tan \sigma = \frac{2 a y}{x^2 + y^2 - a^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Scale factors ==
The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = h_\tau = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the infinitesimal area element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dA = \frac{a^2}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^2} \, d\sigma\, d\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Laplacian]] is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \Phi =
\frac{1}{a^2} \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^2
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \sigma^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \tau^2}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates (''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].



==Applications==
The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which bipolar coordinates allow a [[separation_of_variables#pde|separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors with differing diameters.

==Extension to 3-dimensions==
Bipolar coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates]].

*The [[bipolar cylindrical coordinates]] are produced by translating the bipolar coordinates along the ''z''-axis, i.e., the out-of-plane axis.

*The [[bispherical coordinates]] are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the ''x''-axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci.

*The [[toroidal coordinates]] are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the ''y''-axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.

The '''blesbok''' or '''blesbuck''' (''Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi'') is an [[antelope]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[South Africa]]. It has a distinctive white face and forehead which inspired the name, because ''bles'' is the [[Afrikaans]] word for a [[Wiktionary:blaze|blaze]] such as one might see on the forehead of a horse.

==Affinities and status==
The blesbok and the [[bontebok]] (''Damaliscus pygargus dorcas'') are variant subspecies of one another and can readily interbreed, the offspring being known as the bontebles or baster blesbok, the differences between the two subspecies have arisen due to preferences for different habitats in the wild. The blesbok is endemic to southern Africa and is found in large numbers in all national parks with open grasslands, from the [[Highveld]] north of the [[Vaal river]] southwards through the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], to the [[Eastern Cape]]. It is a plains species and dislikes wooded areas. It was first discovered in the 17th century, in numbers so numerous, herds reached from horizon to horizon.&lt;ref name = RGC&gt;Gordon-Cumming, Roualeyn.

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Blesbok sa 2003.jpg|left|thumb|Juvenile blesboks]]
Physically, rams and ewes are remarkably similar. Their mass can be as much as 85&amp;nbsp;kg. A characteristic of the blesbok is the prominent white blaze on the face and a horizontal brown strip which divides this blaze above the eyes. Body colour is brown with a lighter-coloured saddle on the back, and the rump an even lighter shade. The legs are brown with a white patch behind the top part of the front legs. Lower legs whitish. Both sexes carry horns, ringed almost to the tip. Female horns are slightly more slender. The neck and the top of the back of the blesbok is brown. Lower down on the flanks and buttocks, the coloring becomes darker. The belly, the inside of the buttocks and the area up to the base of the tail is white. Blesbok can be easily differentiated from other antelopes because they have a distinct white face and forehead. The blesbok differs from the bontebok by having less white on the coat and the blaze on the face, which is usually divided, the coat is also a lighter yellow than that of the bontebok. The length of their [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] averages at around 38&amp;nbsp;cm. Male adult blesbok average around 70&amp;nbsp;kg; females average lower, at around 61&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pistoleros.no/animals/blesbuck/1.htm Blesbuck] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928161019/http://www.pistoleros.no/animals/blesbuck/1.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
Blesbok can be found in open [[veld]] or plains of South Africa and Namibia. Their preferred habitat is open grassland with water. They often occupy relatively small territories of 2.5 to 6.0 acres in size.
They were once one of the most abundant antelope species of the African plains, but have become scarce since 1893 due to relentless hunting for their skins and meat.

==Reproduction==
[[File:Damalicus pygargus phillipsi Dvur zoo 2.jpg|thumb|rught|250 px|ZOO Dvůr Králové, Czech Republic]]

The blesbok is a seasonal breeder, with [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]ting from March to May. Births peak during November and December after a gestation period of about 240 days (8 months). Females give birth to a single calf per breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_blesbok.html Kruger Park: Blesbok]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The blesbok was hunted nearly to extinction because of its large numbers, but having been protected since the late 19th century, it has proliferated and today it is sufficiently numerous not to be classed as endangered. In modern times, this is largely because of the commercial value of the blesbok to private land owners, and also because it is one of the few medium-sized antelope that can be contained by normal stock fencing.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} At the start of the 21st century, blesbok numbers are stable, estimated to be around 240,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/30208/0&lt;/ref&gt; However, 97% of them live outside reserves, and only 3% in national parks. They also are common in zoos, though in far smaller numbers.

==Predators==
[[Human]]s, [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[African wild dog]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s are the blesbok's main predators, while [[jackal]]s and [[eagle]]s may attack the calves. The blesbok is both farmed and hunted for the skin, meat, and trophy. Blesbok are shy and alert; they rely on speed and endurance to escape predators, but have an tendency to return to place where they were attacked after a few minutes. They can maintain a speed of {{convert|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} when chased, but, like other white-fronted damalisques, blesbok are not good jumpers or crawlers.

==Paleontology==
Fossil remains of a prehistoric relative, ''Damaliscus niro'', were found in deposits in [[Sterkfontein]]. With a weight of approximately 120&amp;nbsp;kg, it was heavier than the modern blesbok and it had slightly different horns. ''D. niro'' became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene 12 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Brett Hilton-Barber, Lee R.

'''Chronosophy''' is the [[neologism|neologistic]] designation given by scholar [[J.T. Fraser|Julius Thomas (J.T.) Fraser]] to "the interdisciplinary and normative study of [[time]] ''sui generis''."&lt;ref name="voices"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Voices of Time: A Cooperative Survey of Man's Views of Time as Expressed by the Sciences and Humanities|year=1981|publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=0-87023-337-8 |first=J. T.|last= Fraser|edition=2nd|pages=590–2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Etymology ===
Fraser derived the term from the [[Ancient Greek]]: χρόνος, ''[[chronos]]'', "time" and σοφία, ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'', "wisdom". ''Chronosophia'' is thus defined as the "specific human skill or knowledge . . . pertaining to time . . . [which] all men seem to possess to some degree . . .".&lt;ref name="voices" /&gt;

=== Purpose ===
Fraser outlined the purpose of the discipline of chronosophy in five intentions, as follows:
# to encourage the search for new knowledge related to time;
# to set up and apply criteria regarding which fields of knowledge contribute to an understanding of time, and what they may contribute;
# to assist in [[epistemological]] studies, especially in those related to the structure of knowledge;
# to provoke communication between the [[humanities]] and the [[sciences]] using time as the common theme; and
# to help us learn more about the nature of time by providing channels for the direct confrontation of a multitude of views.

=== Assumptions ===
According to Fraser, any pursuit of chronosophical knowledge necessarily makes two assumptions:
# When specialists speak of 'time', they speak of various aspects of the same entity.
# Said entity is amenable to study by the methods of the sciences, can be made a meaningful subject of contemplation by the reflective mind, and can be used as proper material for intuitive interpretation by the creative artist.
Fraser labeled these two assumptions the ''unity of time''. Together they amount to the proposition that all of us, working separately, are nevertheless headed toward the same central idea (i.e., ''chronosophia'').

In contradistinction to the aforementioned, Fraser posits the ''diversity of time'': the existence of time's myriad manifestations, which "hardly needs proof; it is all too apparent."{{sfn|Fraser|1981|p=xxi}}

The continued qualitative and quantitative [[mediation]] of the unresolvable conflict between the unity and diversity of time would thus be the sole methodological criterion for measuring chronosophical progress. This conflict manifests itself not so much as between the humanities and the sciences (although this interpretation is cogent and apt), but rather between knowledge felt (i.e., ''passion'') and knowledge understood (i.e., knowledge ''proper''). Fraser envisions the total creativity of a society as being dependent on the effectiveness of "a harmonious dialogue between the two great branches of knowledge." He observes (paraphrasing [[Giordano Bruno]]): "The creative activity of the mind consists of the search for the one in the many, for simplicity in variety. There is no better and more fundamental problem than the problem of time in respect to which such [a] search may be conducted. It is always present and always tantalizing, it is the basic material of man's rational and emotive inquiries."{{sfn|Fraser|1981}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}} Just as a mature individual can reconcile within themselves the unity and diversity of day-to-day [[noology|noetic]] existence, so too could a mature social conception of time mediate the difference between—and perhaps ultimately reconcile—the unity and diversity of time.

=== Organization ===
Chronosophy defies systematic organization, for—like [[philosophy]]—it is a kind of ur-discipline, subsuming all other disciplines through a proposed unifying characteristic: [[temporality]]. (Hence, the possibility of producing a branch of knowledge lacking temporal import, e.g. [arguably] [[ontology]] and/or [[metaphysics]], remains; however, "atemporality" is still, by definition, a temporal category: a regress ensues.)

Fraser wrote that a successful study of time would "encourage communication across the traditional boundaries of systems of knowledge and seek a framework which . . . may permit interaction of experience and theorizing related to time without regard to the sources of experience and theory."&lt;ref name="voices" /&gt; Thus, the only methodological commitment that a chronosopher need make is to [[interdisciplinarity]].

While Fraser neglects to develop a systematic chronosophical [[methodology]] in ''The Voices of Time'', he does proffer a selection of idiomatically interdisciplinary categories to spur the research of future scholars:
* surveys of historical and current ideas of time in the sciences and in the humanities;
* studies of the relation of time to ideas of conceptual extremities such as a) to motion and rest, b) to atomicity and continuity, c) to the spatially very large and very small, and d) to the quantities of singular and many;
* comparative analysis of those properties of time that various fields of learning and intuitive expressions designate unproblematically as "the nature of time";
* inquiries into the processes and methods whereby man learns to perceive, proceeds to measure, and proposes to reason about time;
* exploration of the role of time in the communication of thought and emotion;
* search for an understanding of the relation of time to [[personal identity]] and death;
* research concerning time and organic evolution, time and the psychological development of man, and the role f time in the growth of civilizations; and
* determination of the status of chronosophy vis-à-vis the traditional systems of knowledge.&lt;ref name="voices" /&gt;

The nature of the above categories would require that chronosophy be regarded as an independent system of experiential, experimental, and theoretical knowledge about time.

=== General characteristics ===
In general, chronosophical pursuits are characterized by
# expansion beyond or abandonment of [traditional areas of] specialization, and
# the espousal of interdisciplinary or pan-disciplinary methodologies;
(1) is a weak criterion, while (2) is a strong one.

Neither of the above criteria make reference to time or temporality; for while the ontological possibly of timeless knowledge must always remain, admission of this possibility begs the question (''[[Begging the question|petitio principii]]''): e.g., what form does timeless knowledge take? how would it come to us? how could we ever be separated from such knowledge to begin with? ''et cetera ad nauseam''. The admission is therefore a [[paradox]] (akin to [[Wittgenstein]]'s seventh proposition in ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'': "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."). We must conclude that the proposal of the possibility of timeless knowledge is both necessary and senseless, a conceptual counterpart to the [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]] nature of the concept of time. Should we come to possess knowledge of that which is "beneath" or "behind" time (or, alternatively, conclude we could never have lost possession of it), there would be no discernible need for further chronosophical inquiry—in the face of such eternal truth, it would instead be chronosophy as currently conceived that would appear both necessary and senseless.

Hence: all disciplines are necessarily chronosophical (until proven otherwise).

Caveat: for the sake of logicality, future manifestations of chronosophy may resemble more closely some methods of knowing than others; however, due to the character of the "problem" of time no chronosophical endeavor could ever be thoroughly purged of its interdisciplinary perspectives: a satisfactory theory of time must necessarily satisfy a wide variety of specifications (i.e., by definition a satisfactory or sufficient chronosophy would accommodate every office of human knowledge as pertains to the subject, time).&lt;ref name="voices" /&gt;

=== Envoi ===
Why should we afford time this privileged status among our speculative and [[empirical]] undertakings?

A Fraserian chronosopher would argue that mediation of the problem(s) of time is essential to the creation and retention of individual and social identity. Hence, as long as we—as individuals and as social groups—continue to partake in the process of clarifying and defining our individual and collective identities over and against those of the world (in whole or in part) around us, the necessarily contemporaneous clarification and definition of the problem(s) of time must, by extension (''[[mutatis mutandis]]''), be universal and continuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">'''Competitive altruism''' is a possible mechanism for the persistence of [[cooperation|cooperative behaviors]], specifically those that are performed unconditionally. The theory of [[reciprocal altruism]] can be used to explain behaviors that are performed by a donor who receives some sort of benefit in the future. When no such compensation is received, however, [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] fails to explain [[altruism|altruistic behavior]].

==Characteristics==

To explain competitive altruism, Roberts&lt;ref name="rob98"&gt;Roberts, G. 1998. Competitive altruism: from reciprocity to the handicap principle. Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B 265: 429-430.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the example of [[preening]] among birds. Because certain birds cannot reach [[parasite]]s on all parts of their bodies, particularly their necks, they benefit from preening one another. For any given bird, there is an entire [[Flock (birds)|flock]] of potential preeners, who compete in hopes of establishing a beneficial relationship. Cheaters, or those birds that try to be preened without preening others, do not compete and thus are excluded from these relationships. Their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is lowered because they are ostracized by members of the flock.

McNamara et al.&lt;ref name="McNamara08"&gt;McNamara, J., Z. Barta, L. Fromhage, and A. Houston. 2008. The coevolution of choosiness and cooperation. Nature 451: 189-192.&lt;/ref&gt; quantitatively analyzed this theory. Like [[Robert Axelrod]], they created a [[computer program]] to simulate repeated interactions among individuals. The program involved players with two genetically determined [[Trait (biology)|traits]], a ‘cooperative trait’ and a ‘choosiness trait.’ They found the following results:&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘Paradoxical’ trait combinations yield particularly low payoffs: individuals with low choosiness but high effort tend to get exploited by their co-players; individuals with high choosiness but low effort waste their time searching for better co-players, which are, however, unlikely to accept them. The positive correlation between choosiness and cooperativeness leads to a positive assortment between cooperative types – an essential feature of all mechanisms that promote cooperation.&lt;ref name="McNamara08" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of such cooperation requires variation in the degree of cooperation and choosiness, which the researchers attributed to [[mutation|genetic mutation]] and [[Genetic diversity|variation]]. McNamara et al. also determined that since a period of searching is required for ‘mutually acceptable’ players to find one another, competitive altruism is more likely to arise in animals with long life spans.&lt;ref name="McNamara08" /&gt;

==The prisoner's dilemma==
To relate this condition to the [[prisoner's dilemma]], an individual may benefit the most in a one-time interaction with another by defecting (i.e. receiving benefits without incurring any cost to itself). However, in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, where individuals interact more than once, if the act of defecting makes the individual less likely to attract a [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] mate in the future, then cooperative behavior will be selected for.&lt;ref name="rob98" /&gt;

This selection for cooperation is even stronger if an individual's action in an interaction is observed by third-party individuals, for the possibility of forming a [[reputation]] arises. [[Amotz Zahavi]], famous for his work with the altruistic [[Arabian babbler]], suggests that this level of "social prestige" will affect which individuals interact with one another and how they behave.&lt;ref&gt;Zahavi, A. 1995. Altruism as a handicap: the limitations of kin selection and reciprocity. J. Avian Biol. 26 (1): 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Competitive altruism has been demonstrated repeatedly in studies with humans. For instance, individuals are more generous when their behaviour is visible to others and altruistic individuals receive more social status and are selectively preferred as collaboration partners and group leaders...&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, C. &amp; Van Vugt, M. (2006). Nice guys finish first: The competitive altruism hypothesis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32,1402-1413&lt;/ref&gt; Adding insights from sexual selection theory research has also found that men behave more altruistically in the presence of an (attractive) female and altruistic males are selectively preferred as long-term sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;Iredale, W., Van Vugt, M. &amp; Dunbar, R (2008). Showing off: Male generosity as mate signal. Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The handicap principle==
The theory of competitive altruism also helps one connect such behavior to the [[handicap principle]]. With competitive altruism, cooperation is considered a trait that provides a [[Signalling theory|signaling]] benefit, and thus is subject to [[sexual selection]]. Like a [[peacock|peacock's tail]], cooperation persists and is magnified, even though it carries a cost to the individual. Cooperation must be significantly costly to the individual, such that only a limited proportion of the population is fit enough to partake.&lt;ref&gt;Lotem, A., M. Fishman, and L. Stone. 2003. From reciprocity to unconditional altruism through signaling benefits. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 270: 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts&lt;ref name="rob98" /&gt; builds on the idea of altruism as a signaling benefit with his "free gift theory". Because the recipient gains some benefit from the interaction with the donor, there is an incentive to pay attention to the signal. For example, some male birds will offer food to a potential mate. Such behavior, called [[courtship feeding]], not only benefits the female, who receives a meal without expending any energy, but also conveys the ability of the male to forage. Consequently, the signal is kept true (i.e. it remains a correct reflection on the fitness of the mate).

However, the connection between competitive altruism and signaling is not without criticism. Wright&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J. 1999. Altruism as a signal - Zahavi's alternative to kin selection and reciprocity. Journal of Avian Biology 30: 109&lt;/ref&gt; raises the point that an altruistic signaling behavior like gift giving would cause a "flow of fitness from the higher quality individual to the lower quality one" and reduce the veracity of the signal. To account for this likely trend, Wright stipulates that the altruistic behavior must be directed at a mate or ally. In order for the theory to hold true, the signaling benefit would have to be shown to improve the individual's fitness beyond the benefit gained from the "investment" in the partner.

Lane coined the best-known slogan of the American white supremacist movement, the [[Fourteen Words]]. He has been described by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as "one of the most important ideologues of contemporary white supremacy."&lt;ref name="SPLC" /&gt;

==Early life==

Lane was born as the third of four siblings in [[Woden, Iowa]]; he had a brother and two sisters. His father was an [[alcoholic]] [[migrant worker]] who was [[Physical abuse|physically abusive]] towards his wife and children. Lane would later claim that his father forced his mother to engage in [[prostitution]] so he could obtain "booze money", and that his older brother was rendered with permanent [[deafness]] as a result of a "beating gone awry".&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=lane |title=David Lane |website=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103094309/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=lane |archivedate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lane was four years old, his father abandoned his family. In 1944, his older brother was arrested after searching for food in a neighbor's trash bins, and he and his sisters were placed in [[foster care]]. Lane was soon adopted by a traveling [[Lutheran]] minister, which resulted in Lane being separated from his two sisters. Lane described his adoptive father as a "doctrinaire [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] from the old school".&lt;ref name="DD&amp;D"&gt;''Deceived, Damned &amp; Defiant'', pp. 7–12 (online {{cite web |url=http://www.freetheorder.org/PyramidProphecy/autobio1.html |title=here |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528143518/http://www.freetheorder.org/PyramidProphecy/autobio1.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 |df= }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.freetheorder.org/PyramidProphecy/autobio2.html |title=here |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528143532/http://www.freetheorder.org/PyramidProphecy/autobio2.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 |df= }}). Also recounted in Goodrick-Clarke, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Bored with endless hours of church services, Lane rejected [[Christianity]], {{clarify|text=and originally shared relatively [[pagan]] beliefs.|reason=What are relatively pagan beliefs? With whom did he share them?|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref name="DD&amp;D" /&gt; Lane claimed that he first noticed the beauty of the [[Caucasian race]] after befriending a blonde-haired girl in first grade to whom he was attracted.&lt;ref name="adl" /&gt; Lane stated that while he reenacted battles with his foster brother as a child, he would portray a [[Nazi stormtrooper]] while his brother portrayed an American soldier.&lt;ref name="adl" /&gt;

Travelling across the [[Midwestern United States]] with his adoptive family, Lane finally settled in [[Aurora, Colorado]], where he attended [[Aurora Central High School|Aurora High School]]. Originally aspiring to become a [[golf professional]],{{sfnp|Flynn|Gerhardt|1990|p=259}} Lane worked as a [[real estate broker]] until his license was revoked because he "wouldn't sell homes to [[coloreds]] in white neighborhoods".{{sfnp|Schwartz|1996|p=64}}

Lane was briefly a member of the [[John Birch Society]] before joining the [[Ku Klux Klan]], becoming the organizer of the [[Denver]] unit of the [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] in 1979. In late 1981, Lane became Colorado State Organizer of the [[Aryan Nations]].{{sfnp|Schwartz|1996|p=64}}

Lane met [[Robert Jay Mathews]] in July 1983 at the Aryan Nations world congress.{{sfnp|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=270}} On September 22, 1983, Lane was among the nine founding members to be sworn into [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]], a white supremacist group which dedicated itself to delivering "our people from the [[Jew]] and bring total victory to the [[Aryan race]]."{{sfnp|Gardell|2003|p=193}} The Order was accused of stealing over $4.1 million in armored car hijackings, killing three people (one of whom was Order member Walter E. West), detonating bombs, [[counterfeiting]] money, organizing militaristic training camps and carrying out numerous other crimes with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the "[[The Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Zionist occupational government]]" they deemed in control of the [[United States]] and to "liberate the Pacific Northwest as a homeland for whites" in the process (see [[Northwest Territorial Imperative]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/us/jury-told-of-plan-to-kill-radio-host.html |title=Jury Told of Plan to Kill Radio Host |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 8, 1987 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his role in The Order's crimes, Lane was sentenced to consecutive sentences totaling 190 years, including 20 years for [[racketeering]], 20 years for [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], both under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO), and 150 years for violating the civil rights of [[Alan Berg]], a [[Jewish]] [[radio talk show]] host, who was murdered on June 18, 1984.&lt;ref name="SPLC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=9news/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/us/5-neo-nazis-get-stiff-sentences-for-crime-spree.html |title=5 Neo-Nazis Get Stiff Sentences For Crime Spree | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 7, 1986 |first=Wallace |last=Turner |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berg was shot and killed in the driveway of his [[Denver]] home by three members of The Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/21/us/witness-in-racist-trial-identifies-gunman-in-slaying-of-radio-host.html |title=Witness in Racist Trial Identifies Gunman in Slaying of Radio Host |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 21, 1985 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Lane was the getaway driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.denverpost.com/2009/06/17/the-murder-of-alan-berg-in-denver-25-years-later/ |title=The murder of Alan Berg in Denver: 25 years later |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |last1=Simpson |first1=Kevin |last2=Blevins |first2=Jason |last3=Auge |first3=Karen |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane was arrested on the evening of March 30, 1985 in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/01/us/around-the-nation-another-suspect-held-in-radio-host-s-death.html | title=Another Suspect Held In Radio Host's Death |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 1, 1985 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane was also among 14 men prosecuted for [[seditious conspiracy]] in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], but he was [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Lane was considered extremely dangerous by the American justice system and was incarcerated at various times after his conviction in the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]], the [[ADX Florence|United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility]] in [[Florence, Colorado]], and the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute]].

While incarcerated, he had the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] ID # 12873-057.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=david&amp;Middle=eden&amp;LastName=lane&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=David Eden Lane |website=[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane wrote books and articles about [[gematria]] and the demographic and sociopolitical status of the white race for white nationalist periodicals and websites. With his wife and Ron McVan, he ran a publishing company called 14 Word Press in [[Idaho]] to disseminate his writings.

He was featured in ''[[Nazi Pop Twins]]'', a documentary aired on July 19, 2007, on [[Channel 4]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/N/nazi_pop/ |title=Nazi Pop Twins |website=[[Channel 4]] |year=2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he was shown speaking by phone with [[Prussian Blue (duo)|Prussian Blue]] (the music act from the documentary) and termed them "fantasy sweethearts" and that he viewed them like daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2007/08/08/the-gaede-bunch-%e2%80%98a-is-for-aryan%e2%80%99/ |title=The Gaede Bunch: 'A is for Aryan' |website=Hatewatch |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=August 8, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185750/http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2007/08/08/the-gaede-bunch-%E2%80%98a-is-for-aryan%E2%80%99/ |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane's earliest possible release date from prison would have been on March 29, 2035 (at age 96). He died on May 28, 2007, in [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute|FCC Terre Haute]] due to an [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]].&lt;ref name="RMN" /&gt; On June 30, 2007, white supremacists held memorial demonstrations for Lane in cities across the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/terrorist-14-words-author-dies-prison |title=Terrorist, '14 Words' Author, Dies in Prison |journal=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |issue=Fall 2007 |date=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Racial beliefs===
Lane stated that his beliefs can be best summarized by a slogan called the "[[Fourteen words]]", a term that he coined: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children." He also coined a second 14-word slogan: "because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth."&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;

Lane authored the [[88 Precepts]], a collection of statements on [[natural law]], which combine in white supremacist shorthand with the 14 words to "14-88" or "14/88".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/1488.html |title=14/88 |website=Anti-Defamation League |quote=1488 is a combination of two popular white supremacist numeric symbols. The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the "14 Words" slogan. The second is 88, which stands for "Heil Hitler". |access-date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In white nationalism, [[88 (number)#In_white_nationalism|88]] is also a reference to "Heil Hitler".

===Wotansvolk===
{{main|Wotansvolk}}
Lane was one of the founders of the Wotansvolk movement, a racist, [[Neo-völkisch movements|neo-''völkisch'']]&lt;ref name=neo-volkisch&gt;{{cite web |title=Neo-Volkisch |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/neo-volkisch |website=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=August 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odinism]] (or Wotanism) he formed with his wife Katja in 1995 to promote his ideology&lt;ref name="SPLC"/&gt; which pursued a program of concerted outreach to prisons.{{sfnp|Gardell|2003|p=381}} Wotansvolk combines an "Aryan call to arms" with an [[esotericism|esoteric]] teaching, based in part on [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], völkish philosophy, and [[Nazism|National Socialism]].&lt;ref name="LewisPetersen2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=James R. |last2=Petersen |first2=Jesper Aa. |title=Controversial New Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fw0bBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT456&amp;lpg=PT456&amp;dq=louis+beam+14+words&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DoYnYTxaIG&amp;sig=FH-e9-1ussceyZapYsnD1tMmHzM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh3YfSz97cAhWXFzQIHX2DBc04ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=16 July 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-939436-4 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lane distanced himself from [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Racial issues|universalist Odinists]] (including "folkish Asatru") who did not embrace "survival of the Aryan race" as a core part of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/what-are-the-14-words-everyones-been-freaking-out-about-1.5482606 |title=What Are the '14 Words' Everyone's Been Freaking Out About? |date=August 12, 2018 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane argued with [[Stephen McNallen]], then leader of the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] when Lane was alive.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=280}} By 2017, McNallen came out with support for Lane's 14 Words quoting them verbatim.&lt;ref name=neo-volkisch/&gt; 

Aiming at a white revolution, Wotansvolk endorsed a "leaderless resistance" strategy popularized by Klan veteran [[Louis Beam]], a longtime friend of the Lane family.&lt;ref name="LewisPetersen2014"/&gt; However, 14 Word Press and Temple of Wotan are now defunct as organizations and no longer have mailing addresses or websites, although Wotanism is still practiced by independent [[Kindred (Heathenism)|kindreds]].

Lane also taught something he called the "Pyramid Prophecy", which included the concept that a [[Bible code]] was inserted by "[[Aryan]] adepts" within the [[King James Version]] of the Christian [[Bible]]. Lane was described by the code he deciphered as "the Man of prophecy".{{sfnp|Gardell|2003|p=381}} Lane issued a declaration called "Moral Authority", as well, which calls the [[United States]] a "[[Flag of the United States|Red, White and Blue]] traveling mass murder machine" intent on committing [[White genocide conspiracy theory|genocide against white people]]. According to the declaration, "true moral authority belongs to those who resist" this purported genocide.&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;

*[[Free and fair election]]s are degraded;&lt;ref name="DemDigest" /&gt;
*[[Liberalism|Liberal]] rights of [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of association|association]] decline, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government, hold it to account, and propose alternatives to the current regime;&lt;ref name="DemDigest"/&gt;
*The [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restrains on the government) is weakened,&lt;ref name="DemDigest"/&gt; such as when the [[independence of the judiciary]] is threatened, or when [[civil service]] tenure protections are weakened or eliminated.&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"&gt;Aziz Huq &amp; Tom Ginsburg, [https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/2/21/14664568/lose-constitutional-democracy-autocracy-trump-authoritarian How to lose a constitutional democracy], ''Vox'' (February 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The government manufactures or overemphasizes a [[national security]] threat to create "a sense of crisis", allowing the government "to malign critics as weak-willed or unpatriotic" and to depict defenders of democratic institutions "as representatives of a tired, insulated elite".&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Anchor|History}}
Aziz Huq and [[Tom Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Chicago Law School]] argue that many threats to democracy are stealthy.&lt;ref name="DemDigest"/&gt; [[Pippa Norris]] of the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and [[University of Sydney]] argues, in an article published by the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' in 2017, that two "twin forces" that pose the greatest contemporary threat to [[Western world|Western]] [[liberal democracy]]: "sporadic and random [[terrorist attack]]s on domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and the rise of populist-authoritarian forces, which feed parasitically upon these fears."&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/media/Journal%20of%20Democracy%20Web%20Exchange%20-%20Norris_0.pdf |title=Is Western Democracy Backsliding? Diagnosing the Risks |last=Norris |first=Pippa |authorlink=Pippa Norris |date=April 2017 |website=Journal of Democracy |series=Online Exchange on “Democratic Deconsolidation”|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |language=en |type=Scholarly response to column published online |access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris argues that the latter risk is especially pronounced in the United States during the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="Norris" /&gt;

The scholarly recognition of the concept of democratic backsliding reflects a reversal from older views, which held "that democracy, once attained in a fairly wealthy state, would become a permanent fixture."&lt;ref name="DemDigest"/&gt; This older view came to be realized as erroneous beginning in the mid-2000s, as (in Huq and Ginsburg's words) "an increasing number of seemingly stable, reasonably wealthy democracies have retreated from previously robust democratic regimes toward autocracy" in a variety of regions across the world, including [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]] in Europe; [[Turkey]] in the [[Mediterranean]]; and [[Bolivia]] and [[Venezuela]] in Latin America.&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt; More broadly, Huq and Ginsburg identified in an academic paper "37 instances in 25 different countries in the postwar period in which democratic quality declined significantly (though a fully [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime didn't emerge)".&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt;  Huq and Ginsburg note that [[coup]]s have decreased at the same time that democratic backsliding has increased.&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt; 

In 2017, the U.S.-based research group [[Freedom House]] published a report indicating that 25% of countries that suffered "backward moves on democracy" in the previous year were in European democracies, including the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Spain]]. The report also listed the United States as having regressed democratically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Esther King|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/democratic-backsliding-threatens-international-order-report/|title=Democratic backsliding threatens international order: report|date=January 31, 2017|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela is viewed as having propelled democratic backsliding in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kirk |last=Hawkins |ssrn=2779566 |title=Chavismo, Liberal Democracy, and Radical Democracy |journal=Annual Review of Political Science |volume=19 |year=2016 |pages=311–329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DeviantArt''' ('''deviantART''' from August 7, 2000, to December 3, 2014, abbreviated "'''DA'''" by [[User (computing)|members]]) is an [[Online community|online artwork, videography and photography community]]. The website was launched on August 7, 2000, by [[Angelo Sotira]], Scott Jarkoff, Matthew Stephens and others. Artworks are organized in a category structure, including [[photography]], [[digital art]], traditional art, [[literature]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[filmmaking]], [[skin (computing)|skins for applications]], operating system customization utilities and others, along with downloadable resources such as tutorials and [[stock photography]]. Additional features include "journals", "polls", "groups" and "portfolios".

==History==
DeviantArt started as a site connected with people who took computer applications and modified them to their own tastes, or who "deviated" the applications from the original designs. As the site grew, members in general became known as "deviants" and submissions as "deviations".&lt;ref&gt;Perkel, Daniel. [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dperkel/diss/DanPerkel-dissertation-2011_update.pdf "Making Art, Creating Infrastructure: DeviantArt and the Production of the Web"]. Berkeley CA. Retrieved September 28, 2012. p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.deviantart.com/15/|title=DeviantArt FAQ - What is a deviation?|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeviantArt was originally launched on August 7, 2000, by Scott Jarkoff, Matt Stephens, [[Angelo Sotira]] and others, as part of a larger network of music-related websites called the Dmusic Network. The site flourished largely because of its unique offering and the contributions of its core member base and a team of volunteers after its launch,&lt;ref name="spyed_journal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/609173/ |title=spyed's DeviantArt Journal |author=Angelo Sotira |date=April 10, 2003 |accessdate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was officially incorporated in 2001 about eight months after launch.&lt;ref name="tc_angelo_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/22/stop-being-weak-an-interview-with-angelo-sotira-ceo-of-deviantart-com-tctv/|title=TechCrunch|author=[[Cyan Banister]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeviantArt was loosely inspired by projects like [[Winamp]] facelift, customize.org, deskmod.com, screenphuck.com, and skinz.org, all application skin-based websites. Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program. All three co-founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community, but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and more toward an "art community". Many of the individuals involved with the initial development and promotion of DeviantArt still hold positions with the project, from administrators to volunteers serving as gallery directors and Message Network Administration. Angelo Sotira currently serves as the [[chief executive officer]] of DeviantArt, Inc.&lt;ref name="tc_angelo_interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.deviantart.com/ |title=deviantArt: About DeviantArt's Team Core |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/125134/ |title=News: TMD: 10 X 10 |publisher=News.deviantart.com |accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2006, DeviantArt gave its users the option to submit their works under [[Creative Commons licenses]] giving the artists the right to choose how their works can be used.&lt;ref name="newsubmission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/23753/ |title=News: New Submission Process... LIVE! |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Creative Commons license is one of several public copyright licenses that allow the distribution of copyrighted works. On September 30, 2007, a film category was added to DeviantArt, allowing artists to upload videos. An artist and other viewers can add annotations to sections of the film, giving comments or critiques to the artist about a particular moment in the film.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/34930/ |title=News: Now Playing: DeviantArt Film! |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, DeviantArt received $3.5 million in [[Series A round|Series A]] (first round) funding from undisclosed investors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Online Art Community DeviantArt Secures $3.5 Million In First Round|date = June 22, 2007|url = http://paidcontent.org/2007/06/22/419-draft-online-art-community-secures-35-in-first-round/|first = David|last = Kaplan|publisher = Paidcontent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, it received $10 million in [[Series B]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crunchbase.com/company/deviantart|title = DeviantArt Recent Milestones|publisher = Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2014, the site unveiled a new logo and announced the release of an official [[mobile app]] on both [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3039224/deviantart-app|title=With Its New App, DeviantArt Finally Has A Mobile Place For Those 65 Million Monthly Visitors|work=Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be released on December 10, 2014.&lt;ref name="da-boldlyfacing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boldly Facing The Future|url=http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/Boldly-Facing-The-Future-498282387|website=spyed's journal|publisher=deviantArt|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2017, DeviantArt was acquired by [[Wix.com|Wix.com, Inc.]] for $36 million. The site plans to integrate DeviantArt and Wix functionality, including the ability to utilize DA resources on websites built with Wix, and integrating some of Wix's design tools into the site.&lt;ref name="tc-wixda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Website builder Wix acquires art community DeviantArt for $36M|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/website-builder-wix-acquires-art-community-deviantart-for-36m/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 1, 2017, DeviantArt banned [[Syria]] from accessing its services entirely citing US and Israeli sanctions and aftermath, on February 19, 2018, Syrian user "Mythiril" used a VPN to access the site and disclose the geoblocking in a journal "the Hypocrisy of Deviantart" that sparked a public outcry across Deviantart and other sites.  DeviantArt eventually ended the geoblocking except for commercial features.&lt;ref name="da-hypo"&gt;{{cite web|title=The hypocrisy of DeviantArt|url=https://mythiril.deviantart.com/journal/The-hypocrisy-of-deviantArt-731065159|website=DeviantARt|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright and licensing issues ===
There is no review for potential copyright and [[Creative Commons]] licensing violations when a work is submitted to DeviantArt, so potential violations can remain unnoticed until reported to administrators using the mechanism available for such issues.&lt;ref name="help_copyvio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://help.deviantArt.com/155/ | title=FAQ #155: How do I report a submission which I think breaks the rules? on DeviantArt Help and FAQ | accessdate=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the community have been the victims of copyright infringement from vendors using artwork illegally on products and prints, as reported in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2007/05/29/art-theft-scandals-rock-deviantart/ | title=Art Theft Scandals Rock deviantArt | date=May 29, 2016 |publisher=PlagiarismToday |access-date=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Sarah |date=May 5, 2014 |title=DeviantART clarifies it doesn't sell artists' work after Hot Topic shirt debacle |url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/deviantart-hot-topic-shirt-art-stolen/ |publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]'' |access-date=November 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reporting system in which to counteract copyright infringement directly on the site has been subject to a multitude of criticism from members of the site, given that it may take weeks, or even a month before a filed complaint for copyright infringement is answered.

=== Contests for companies and academia ===
Due to the nature of DeviantArt as an art community with worldwide reach, companies use DeviantArt to promote themselves and create more advertising through contests.  ''CoolClimate'' is a research network connected with the University of California, and they held a contest in 2012 to address the impact of climate change. Worldwide submissions were received, and the winner was featured in ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christos-lamprianidis/coolclimate-art-contest-w_b_754929.html |title=Christos Lamprianidis: CoolClimate Art Contest Winner: What Motivated Me |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various car companies have held contests. [[Dodge]] ran a contest in 2012 for art of the [[Dodge Dart]] and over 4,000 submissions were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmnews.com/dodge-dart-looks-to-score-during-nfl-opener/article/257672/ |title=Dodge Dart looks to score during NFL opener – Direct Marketing News |publisher=Dmnews.com |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners received cash and item prizes, and were featured in a gallery at Dodge-Chrysler headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deviantart.com/journal/Dodge-Dart-Inspired-By-You-Contest-296645585 |title=Dodge Dart Inspired By You Contest by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=DeviantArt.com |date=April 17, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lexus]] partnered with DeviantArt in 2013 to run a contest for cash and other prizes based on their [[Lexus IS]] design; the winner's design became a modified Lexus IS and was showcased at the [[SEMA]] 2013 show in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/Lexus-IS-Design-Contest-382663603 |title=Lexus IS Design Contest by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=July 12, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeviantArt also hosts contests for upcoming movies, such as ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]''. Fan art for ''Riddick'' was submitted, and director [[David Twohy]] chose the winners, who would receive cash prizes and some other DeviantArt-related prizes, as well as having their artwork made into official fan-art posters for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/Riddick-Rule-the-Dark-Winners-395129005 |title=Riddick 'Rule the Dark' Winners by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=August 29, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/The-Riddick-Rule-the-Dark-Fan-Art-Contest-385949865 |title=The Riddick 'Rule the Dark Fan Art Contest' by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar contest was held for [[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]] where winners received cash and other prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/Dark-Shadows-The-Barnabas-Portrait-Project-295136507 |title=Dark Shadows: The Barnabas Portrait Project by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/The-Barnabas-Portrait-Project-Winners-Announcement-301322222 |title=The Barnabas Portrait Project Winners Announcement by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games also conduct contests with DeviantArt, such as the 2013 ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' contest. The winner had their art made into an official print sold internationally at the Tomb Raider store, and received cash and other prizes. Other winners also received cash and DeviantArt-related prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayame-kenoshi.deviantart.com/journal/Tomb-Raider-Reborn-Contest-351846219 |title=Tomb Raider Reborn Contest by Ayame-Kenoshi on deviantART |publisher=Ayame-kenoshi.deviantart.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pregnancy]] when coupled with [[domestic violence]]''' is a form of [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) where [[health]] risks may be amplified. Abuse during pregnancy, whether physical, verbal or emotional, produces many adverse [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological]] effects for both the mother and fetus. Domestic violence during pregnancy is categorized as abusive behavior towards a pregnant woman, where the pattern of abuse can often change in terms of severity and frequency of violence. Abuse may be a long-standing problem in a relationship that continues after a woman becomes pregnant or it may commence in pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.K., F. Haider, K. Ellis, D.M. Hay, S.W. Lindow. "The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 110.3 (2003): 272-75. Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although female-to-male partner violence occurs in these settings, the overwhelming form of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women.&lt;ref name="Stephenson, Rob 2008"&gt;Stephenson, Rob, Michael A. Koenig, Rajib Acharya and Tarun K. Roy. "Domestic Violence, Contraceptive Use, and Unwanted Pregnancy in Rural India." Studies in Family Planning. 39.3 (2008): 177-86. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnancy provides a unique opportunity for healthcare workers to screen women for domestic violence though a recent review found that the best way in which to do this is unclear.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahanfar|first1=S|last2=Howard|first2=LM|last3=Medley|first3=N|title=Interventions for preventing or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 November 2014|volume=11|pages=CD009414|pmid=25390767|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009414.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing domestic violence in pregnancy should improve outcomes for mothers and babies though more good quality studies are needed to work out effective ways of screening pregnant women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Causes and triggers ==

Domestic abuse can be triggered by pregnancy for a number of reasons. Pregnancy itself can be used a form of coercion and the phenomenon of preventing an intimate partner's reproductive choice is referred to as [[reproductive coercion]]. Studies on [[birth control sabotage]] performed by males against female partners have indicated a strong correlation between domestic violence and birth control sabotage.&lt;ref name="impactresearch.org"&gt;[http://www.impactresearch.org/documents/birthcontrolexecutive.pdf Domestic Violence and Birth Control Sabotage: A Report from the Teen Parent Project], Center for Impact Research, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pregnancy can also lead to a hiatus of domestic violence when the abuser does not want to harm the unborn child. The risk of domestic violence for pregnant women is greatest immediately after [[childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;Mezey, Gillian C., and Bewley Susan. "Domestic Violence and Pregnancy: Risk Is Greatest after Delivery." BMJ: British Medical Journal. 314.7090 (1997): 1295. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence can increase a woman's chances of becoming pregnant and the number of children she has, both because the woman may be coerced into sex and because she may be prevented from using birth control.&lt;ref name=Krug2002&gt;{{cite book

==Birth control sabotage==
{{Main|Birth control sabotage|Forced pregnancy}}
[[Birth control sabotage]], or reproductive coercion, is a form of coercion where someone manipulates another person's use of birth control - weakening efforts to prevent an [[unwanted pregnancy]]. Replacing [[birth control pill]]s with fakes, puncturing [[condom]]s, and threats and violence are examples of prevention of an individual's attempt to avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy-promoting behavior of abusive male partners is one method of domestic violence and is associated with unwanted pregnancy, particularly in adolescents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Miller, Elizabeth, Decker, Michelle, Reed, Elizabeth, Male Partner Pregnancy-Promoting Behaviors and Adolescent Partner Violence: Findings from a Qualitative Study with Adolescent Females.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion itself is a form of domestic violence because it results from unwanted sexual activity and hinders a woman’s ability to control her body. [[Forced pregnancy]] can also be a form of financial abuse when a woman becomes trapped in a relationship because the pregnancy has led to economic dependence for new mothers.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer.com"&gt;[http://irishexaminer.com/ireland/pregnancy-offers-no-protection-from-abuse-123232.html Pregnancy offers no protection from abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended pregnancies are 2 to 3 times more likely to be associated with abuse than intended pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Hathaway, L.A. Mucci and J.G. Silverman et al., Health status and health care use of Massachusetts women reporting partner abuse, Am J Prev Med 19 (2000), pp. 302–307.&lt;/ref&gt; Research among adolescent populations shows females who experience IPV use condoms at low rates and are fearful of negotiating the use of condoms.&lt;ref&gt;A. Raj, M.C. Santana and A. La Marche et al., Perpetration of intimate partner violence associated with sexual risk behaviors among young adult men, Am J Public Health 96 (2006), pp. 1873–1878.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of sexually experienced women 15-19 in Uganda, surveys found that fourteen percent of women’s first [[sexual intercourse]] had been coerced. Of those fourteen percent, the women were far more likely to be having unprotected sex without the use of modern contraceptives and to have had unintended pregnancies within the last six months compared to women who had not been sexually coerced.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Koenig, Iryna Zablotska, Tom Lutalo, Fred Nalugoda, Jennifer Wagman and Ron Gray. “Coerced First Intercourse and Reproductive Health among Adolescent Women in Rakai, Uganda.”&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, over 80% of rural women believe that beatings are sometimes justified&lt;ref&gt;
El-Zanaty F et al. Egypt demographic and health survey 1995. Calverton, MD, Macro International, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most common reasons given as a just cause for beatings is refusing a man sex.&lt;ref&gt;El-Zanaty F et al. Egypt demographic and health survey 1995. Calverton, MD, Macro International, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David F, Chin F. Economic and psychosocial influences of family planning on the lives of women in Western Visayas. Iloilo City, Central Philippines University and Family Health International, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This affects the ability of women to protect themselves from unwanted sexual contact and the consequences of sexual intercourse, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="Violence by Intimate Partners"&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap4.pdf Violence by Intimate Partners] WHO: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the Center for Impact Research on young mothers classified birth control sabotage into two categories: verbal and behavioral. Verbal sabotage is verbal or emotional pressure not to use birth control, or pressure to become pregnant. Behavioral sabotage is the use of force to prevent the use of birth control, or to have unprotected sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="impactresearch.org"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
In most cases, domestic violence can be prompted by or intensified by pregnancy, but in some cases domestic violence ends during pregnancy because the abuser makes a conscious effort to not harm the [[fetus]].&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"&gt;Campbell, JC, Oliver C, Bullock L. “Why battering during pregnancy?” AWHONN's clinical issues in perinatal and women's health nursing. 4.3 (1993.) 343. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decreased violence===
Domestic violence does not always increase during pregnancy and can even lead to a hiatus in violence. This phenomenon can provide protection for both the woman and child.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"/&gt; Because this can lead to decreased violence, some women use pregnancy as a means of protection against domestic abuse. Since abuse generally restarts after the pregnancy ends, women may get pregnant intentionally to prevent violence. However, since women who have been abused before getting pregnant are more likely to experience violence during pregnancy, this is not a reliable means of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchus, Loraine,, Gill Mezey, Susan Bewley, and Alison Haworth. "Prevalence of domestic violence when midwives routinely enquire in pregnancy." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 111.5 (2004): 441-45. Web. 22 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased violence===
Although pregnancy can be a protective period for some women, either in terms of a hiatus of pre-existing violence, for others it is a risk period during which abuse may begin or escalate. Women with violent partners have a hard time protecting themselves from unintended pregnancy and sexual violence can directly lead to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Heise LL, Ellsberg M, Gottemoeller M. Ending violence against women. Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Center for Communications Programs, 1999 (Population Reports, Series L, No. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Studies consistently indicate that domestic violence is more common in large families.&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N. Full report of the prevalence, incidence, and consequences of violence against women: findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Washington, DC, National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).&lt;/ref&gt; However, international studies show that 25% of women are abused for the first time during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="irishexaminer.com"/&gt;

In one study conduct by Campbell ''et al.'', women were asked to speculate on why they thought they were abused during their pregnancies. The answers were categorized into four categories:&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"/&gt;
*[[Jealousy]] towards the unborn child
*[[Anger]] towards the unborn child
*Pregnancy specific violence not directed toward the child
*“Business as usual."

==Effects==
There are many dangerous effects that violence during pregnancy can cause for both the mother and child. A violent pregnancy is considered high risk because verbal, emotional, and physical abuse all lead to adverse health consequences for both the mother and fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.K., F. Haider, K. Ellis, D.M. Hay, S.W. Lindow. "The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 110.3 (2003): 272-75. Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence during pregnancy has been associated with [[miscarriage]], late [[prenatal care]], [[stillbirth]], [[preterm birth]], fetal injury (including bruising, broken and fractured bones, stab wounds&lt;ref&gt;Mezey, Gillian C., and Bewley Susan. "Domestic violence and pregnancy." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 104.5 (1997): 528-531. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and low birth weight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Violence during pregnancy also leads to additional risks for the mother such as increased [[psychiatric disorders of childbirth|mental health problems]], suicide attempts, worsening of chronic illness, injury, [[substance abuse]], anxiety, stress, chronic pain, and gynecological problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/ 0014/71240/MPS_GEM_ MDA_ new.pdf] WHO Europe. “Making Pregnancy Safer &amp; Gender Maisntreaming: Response to domestic violence in pregnancy”&lt;/ref&gt; Women battered during pregnancy were more frequently and severely beaten throughout the course of their relationship compared to women who were not abused during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 1993"/&gt; IPV also accounts for a large portion of maternal mortality. [[Homicide]] is the second leading cause of injury related deaths in pregnant and post-partum women in the United States&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Public Health, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and a study conducted in hospital in India found that 16% of all deaths during pregnancy were a result of partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;Too far, too little, too late: a community-based case–control study of maternal mortality in rural west Maharashtra, India. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found a correlation between domestic violence and increased use of [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;Amaro et al. “Violence during pregnancy and substance abuse.” Am J Public Health. May 1990. 575-9&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant abused women are less likely to report abuse or leave their abuser because of added financial and housing security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawc.org/atf/cf/{CE32CB3730BB42828F80EDC059FE3ED6}/DV%20and%20Pregnancy%20Snapshot.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Houston Area Women’s Center. “Dangers of Domestic Violence during Pregnancy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
Certain women are more likely to be abused during pregnancy than others. Women who have been abused before getting pregnant are at higher risk of violence during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Bacchus, Loraine 2004"&gt;Bacchus, Loraine, Gill Mezey, Susan Bewley, and Alison Haworth. "Prevalence of domestic violence when midwives routinely enquire in pregnancy." BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 111.5 (2004): 441-45. Web. 22 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse is not restricted to a specific socio-economic or demographic group of women or to a specific period in a woman’s reproductive life.&lt;ref&gt;(Hedin-Widding L. Postpartum, also a risk period for domestic violence. Eur J Obstet Gynecol 2000;89:41 – 45. 24. McLeer SV)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the rate of physical violence during pregnancy decreases as household income increases. Women whose total household income was less than $16,000 were much more likely to experience physical or sexual violence during pregnancy than women with a total household income over $16,000.&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. “Physical Violence: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring system [www.schs.state.nc.us/SCHS/data/prams.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partner violence in a relationship increases the chances of unintended pregnancy. A Canadian study that outlined causes of physical abuse identified “social instability” (e.g. low age, unmarried, lower level of education, and unemployment) as a trigger for violence and used unplanned pregnancies as an example. This suggests that partner violence can lead to increased unintended pregnancies which, in turn, increases physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart DE, Ceccutti A. Physical abuse in pregnancy. Can Med Assoc J 1993;149: 1257–1263&lt;/ref&gt; Younger women are statistically more susceptible to reproductive coercion and this may be due to less experience in relationships and, for minors, less access to doctor’s appointments and emergency contraception. Adolescents are especially at risk and [[teenage pregnancy]] is correlated with increased rates of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Young women with older boyfriends are more likely to experience domestic violence.&lt;ref name="impactresearch.org"/&gt; Women who experience physical violence from their husbands are less likely to use contraception and more likely to have an unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Stephenson, Rob 2008"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
A study done on reporting rates of domestic violence concluded that a woman’s risk of physical and sexual violence during pregnancy is under-reported and underestimated.&lt;ref name="Bacchus, Loraine 2004"/&gt; Each year, over 324,000 pregnant women are victims of domestic violence in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CDC, “Safe Motherhood", U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of countries have sought to statistically estimate the number of adult women who have experienced domestic violence during pregnancy:
*United Kingdom prevalence: 3.4% &lt;ref name="Bacchus, Loraine 2004"/&gt;
*United States prevalence: 3.4 – 33.7% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huth-Bocks AC, Levendosky AA, Bogat GA |title=The effects of domestic violence during pregnancy on maternal and infant health |journal=Violence Vict |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=169–85 |date=April 2002 |pmid=12033553 |doi=10.1891/vivi.17.2.169.33647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Torres S |author2=Campbell J |author3=Campbell DW |author4=''et al.

The '''fading affect bias''', more commonly known as '''FAB''', is a [[psychology|psychological]] phenomenon in which information regarding negative [[emotion]]s tends to be forgotten more quickly than that associated with pleasant emotions. Although there have been some contradictory findings regarding the presence of FAB, it has been largely found to be real.

==Description==

Initially, the Fading Affect Bias was widely accepted as the process whereby the emotional [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of certain events fades over time. More specifically, early researchers largely believed that there was a general fading over time of emotional content and intensity in relation to specific life events, regardless of whether the experiences were positive ones or negative ones. However, later studies found that cognitive processes occur that cause the emotional intensity of negative events to dissipate at a faster rate than positively perceived events. Many conclusions have been drawn regarding FAB, and many explanations have been proposed for why it even exists.

==Related studies==

Some of the earliest evidence and argument for the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of the Fading Affect Bias can be dated back to {{harvtxt|Cason|1932}}'s [[experiment|study]]. In this study, a [[retrospective]] procedure was put into effect, which entailed the recollection of past events as well as a rating of the emotions which the respective events prompted. [[Data]] from this study reflected that the recalling of positive events was generally stronger than that of negative events. However, criticism of this study centered upon the fact that retrospective and introspective procedures could possibly be subject to memory biases. Thus, a later study&amp;mdash;{{harvtxt|Holmes|1970}}&amp;mdash;took a "non-introspective" approach to studying FAB. Twenty-six subjects were told to record events in a diary and record the emotional intensities of the experiences. Data results from these studies were found to be generally consistent with FAB.

Publication from {{harvtxt|Walker et al.|1997}} has been viewed as the "modern era" of FAB studies. In a 1997 publication, Walker discussed the role which memory plays in FAB. Here, it is stated that [[human being]]s are preferential in what they select to remember and that certain particulars of events fade, but emotions necessarily do not. Walker used a [[diary]] recording method to analyze the cognitive processes of a sample of [[White People|Caucasian]] [[Undergraduate education|undergraduates]]. This study found that emotions prompted by positive events were more likely to last than those prompted by negative occurrences. Nonetheless, later studies were conducted by others which were more representative of the [[population]], in that they included people of various [[Race (human classification)|races]], different [[socioeconomic status]]es, and both [[gender]]s.

{{harvtxt|Ritchie et al.|2009}} used subject's personal responses to 1200 [[autobiographical]] events to study the Fading Affect Bias. In this study, four possible trends were found regarding memory: the Fixed Affect (wherein emotional intensity is maintained), the Fading Affect (wherein emotional intensity diminishes), the Flourishing Affect (where there is an increase in intensity), and the Flexible Affect (where there is a reversal of valence). For positive recollections, the Fixed Affect was more prominent (39%) than the Fading Affect (37%). However, for negative occurrences, the Fading Affect was more prominent (51%) than the Fixed Affect (38%). Instances of the Flourishing Affect and the Flexible Affect were significantly low for both instances.

In addition to the aforementioned psychological studies, related [[neurobiological]] studies were conducted that could possibly further explain the phenomenon of FAB. During an [[interview]], [[neurobiologist]] Matt Wilson detailed that in studying the [[brain activity]] of [[rat]]s it was found that the remembrance of past events and the anticipation of future events seemed to be linked neurologically.{{sfn|Blue|2008}} This is a possible implication of why FAB exists: the human need to catalog relevant information to be used in the future.

==Freudian influence on research==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[theory]] of repression was used during initial research of FAB. A key tenet of the FAB theory is that certain emotional intensities dissipate over the course of time. Freud's theory of repression, however, implies that while specific event memories can be eventually forgotten over time, accompanying emotions remain unbothered. Also, it states that intense emotions are more likely to be remembered, but "not necessarily the substance of."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Possible explanations==

Researchers have drawn many conclusions regarding why FAB occurs. A popular explanation for FAB among psychologists and researchers alike is the need for healthy self-awareness and positive self-esteem. It has been largely found that FAB is more prevalent among mentally healthy individuals as opposed to those who suffer from [[Mental dysfunction|mental]] and [[Neurological disorder|neurological dysfunction]]. More specifically, it has been established that people who suffer from even mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]] are more likely to maintain negative emotions from unpleasant experiences. Thus, it has been concluded that FAB allows one to have positive perception and be more likely to attain a positive self-image. In addition, it has been found that human beings have the tendency to alter their negative emotions into positive ones and to use certain negative occurrences as learning experiences. This too adds to having a positive outlook on life. Several things, such as [[self-image]], one's [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] disposition, the frequency of rehearsal, and "[[recreational drug use]]" are considered [[Moderator variable|moderators]] of FAB.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The '''inset''' shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process.]]
Outside the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], free [[neutron]]s are unstable and have a [[mean lifetime]] of {{val|881.5|1.5|u=[[second|s]]}} (about 14 minutes, 42 seconds). Therefore, the [[half-life]] for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of {{nowrap|[[Natural logarithm|ln]](2) ≈ 0.693}}) is {{val|611|1|u=s}} (about 10 minutes, 11 seconds).&lt;ref name="Particle data group"&gt;J. Beringer et al. (Particle Data Group), Phys. Rev. D86, 010001 (2012) http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/tables/rpp2012-sum-baryons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[beta decay]] of the neutron, described above, can be denoted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons]. lbl.gov (2007).

&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}}

This decay, like any [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]]-changing process, occurs through operation of the [[weak interaction|weak force]]. It involves the emission of a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-|link=yes}} boson from one of the [[down quark]]s within the neutron, thereby converting the down quark into an [[up quark]] and the neutron into a proton; the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} then decays into the [[electron]] and the [[electron antineutrino|antineutrino]]. The following equations denote the same process as the first equation above, but also include the short-lived {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} and describe the process on both the [[nucleon]] and the [[quark]] level:
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}}

:{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}}

For the free neutron, the [[decay energy]] for this process (based on the [[rest mass]]es of the neutron, proton and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. That is the difference between the rest mass of the neutron and the sum of the rest masses of the products. That difference has to be carried away as [[kinetic energy]]. The maximal energy of the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 ± .013 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Ideas and Concepts in Nuclear Physics: An Introductory Approach, Third Edition
K. Heyde Taylor &amp; Francis 2004. Print {{ISBN|978-0-7503-0980-6}}. eBook {{ISBN|978-1-4200-5494-1}}. DOI: 10.1201/9781420054941.ch5 ([http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/9781420054941.ch5 full text]).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the [[neutrino]] (which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy); furthermore, neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods.

A small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted [[gamma ray]]:

:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Photon|link=yes}}

This gamma ray may be thought of as a sort of "internal [[bremsstrahlung]]" that arises as the emitted beta particle (electron) interacts with the [[electric charge|charge]] of the proton in an electromagnetic way. In this process, some of the decay energy is carried away as [[photon energy]]. Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons, that is, those within a nucleus.

A very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called "two-body (neutron) decays", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the "two bodies"). In this type of free neutron decay, in essence all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino (the other "body").

The transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton.

==Neutron lifetime puzzle==

While the neutron lifetime has been studied for decades, there currently exists a lack of [[consilience]] on its exact value, due to different results from two experimental methods ("bottle" versus "beam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/ |title=Neutron Lifetime Puzzle Deepens, but No Dark Matter Seen |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |date=13 February 2018 |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |access-date=31 July 2018 |quote=When physicists strip neutrons from atomic nuclei, put them in a bottle, then count how many remain there after some time, they infer that neutrons radioactively decay in 14 minutes and 39 seconds, on average. But when other physicists generate beams of neutrons and tally the emerging protons — the particles that free neutrons decay into — they peg the average neutron lifetime at around 14 minutes and 48 seconds. The discrepancy between the “bottle” and “beam” measurements has persisted since both methods of gauging the neutron’s longevity began yielding results in the 1990s. At first, all the measurements were so imprecise that nobody worried. Gradually, though, both methods have improved, and still they disagree.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28409">In [[economics]], '''hyperbolic discounting''' is a time-''inconsistent'' model of [[delay discounting]]. It is one of the cornerstones of [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref name=Ain2015&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/mde.2715 | volume=37 | title=The Cardinal Anomalies that Led to Behavioral Economics: Cognitive or Motivational? | year=2015 | journal=Managerial and Decision Economics | pages=261–273 | last1 = Ainslie | first1 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grune-Yan&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0269889715000307 | volume=28 | title=Models of Temporal Discounting 1937–2000: An Interdisciplinary Exchange between Economics and Psychology | year=2015 | journal=Science in Context | pages=675–713 | last1 = Grüne-Yanoff | first1 = Till}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discounted utility approach states that [[intertemporal choice]]s are no different from other choices, except that some consequences are delayed and hence must be anticipated and discounted (i.e., reweighted to take into account the delay).

Given two similar rewards, humans show a preference for one that arrives sooner rather than later. Humans are said to ''discount'' the value of the later reward, by a factor that increases with the length of the delay. This process is traditionally modeled in the form of [[exponential discounting]], a time-''consistent'' model of discounting. A large number of studies have since demonstrated deviations from the constant discount rate assumed in exponential discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frederick |first=Shane |first2=George |last2=Loewenstein |first3=Ted |last3=O'Donoghue |year=2002 |title=Time Discounting and Time Preference: A Critical Review |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=351–401 |doi=10.1257/002205102320161311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyperbolic discounting is an alternative mathematical model that accounts for these deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = Leonard | last2 = Myerson | first2 = Joel | year = 2004 | title = A discounting framework for choice with delayed and probabilistic rewards | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 769–792 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.769| pmc = 1382186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to hyperbolic discounting, valuations fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days). For example, in an early study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer.&lt;ref name=Thaler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thaler |first=R. H. |year=1981 |title=Some Empirical Evidence on Dynamic Inconsistency |journal=Economic Letters |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=201–207 |doi=10.1016/0165-1765(81)90067-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with exponential discounting, in which valuation falls by a constant factor per unit delay and the discount rate stays the same.

The standard experiment used to reveal a test subject's hyperbolic discounting curve is to compare short-term preferences with long-term preferences. For instance: "Would you prefer a dollar today or three dollars tomorrow?" or "Would you prefer a dollar in one year or three dollars in one year and one day?" It has been claimed that a significant fraction of subjects will take the lesser amount today, but will gladly wait one extra day in a year in order to receive the higher amount instead.&lt;ref name="Thaler" /&gt;  Individuals with such preferences are described as "[[present-biased preferences|present-biased]]".

The most important consequence of hyperbolic discounting is that it creates temporary preferences for small rewards that occur sooner over larger, later ones. Individuals using hyperbolic discounting reveal a strong tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time – they make choices today that their future self would prefer not to have made, despite knowing the same information. This [[dynamic inconsistency]] happens because hyperbolas distort the relative value of options with a fixed difference in delays in proportion to how far the choice-maker is from those options.&lt;ref name="Laibson1997QJE"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=David Laibson |last=Laibson |first=David |year=1997 |title=Golden Eggs and Hyperbolic Discounting |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=443–477 |doi=10.1162/003355397555253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
The phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting is implicit in [[Richard Herrnstein]]'s "[[matching law]]", which states that when dividing their time or effort between two non-exclusive, ongoing sources of reward, most subjects allocate in direct proportion to the rate and size of rewards from the two sources, and in inverse proportion to their delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVilliers|first1=P.|last2=Herrnstein|first2=R.J.|title=Toward a law of response strength|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1976|volume=83|pages=1131–1153|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1131}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, subjects' choices "match" these parameters.

After the report of this effect in the case of delay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chung |first=S. H. |last2=Herrnstein |first2=R. J. |year=1967 |title=Choice and delay of Reinforcement |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=67–74 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1967.10-67 |pmid=16811307 |pmc=1338319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] pointed out that in a single choice between a larger, later and a smaller, sooner reward, inverse proportionality to delay would be described by a plot of value by delay that had a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic shape]], and that when the smaller, sooner reward is preferred, this preference can be reversed by increasing both rewards' delays by the same absolute amount.  Ainslie's research showed that a substantial number of subjects reported that they would prefer $50 immediately rather than $100 in six months, but would NOT prefer $50 in 3 months rather than $100 in nine months, even though this was the same choice seen at 3 months’ greater distance.  More significantly, those subjects who said they preferred $50 in 3 months to $100 in 9 months  said they would NOT prefer $50 in 12 months to $100 in 18 months—again, the same pair of options at a different distance—showing that the preference-reversal effect did not depend on the excitement of getting an immediate reward.&lt;ref name=A&amp;H83&gt;Ainslie, George and Haendel, V.

A large number of subsequent experiments have confirmed that spontaneous preferences by both human and nonhuman subjects follow a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic curve]] rather than the conventional, [[exponential discounting|exponential]] curve that would produce consistent choice over time.&lt;ref name="Green et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Green |first=L. |last2=Fry |first2=A.

However, given the choice between $50 in five years or $100 in six years almost everyone will choose $100 in six years, even though that is the same choice seen at five years' greater distance.

Hyperbolic discounting has also been found to relate to real-world examples of self-control. Indeed, a variety of studies have used measures of hyperbolic discounting to find that drug-dependent individuals discount delayed consequences more than matched nondependent controls, suggesting that extreme delay discounting is a fundamental behavioral process in drug dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bickel |first=Warren K. |last2=Johnson |first2=Matthew W. |year=2003 |chapter=Delay Discounting: A Fundamental Behavioral Process of Drug Dependence |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAOGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA419 |pages=419–40 |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Loewenstein |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Read |editor3-first=Roy F. |editor3-last=Baumeister |title=Time and Decision |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |isbn=0-87154-549-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madden |first=G.

The degree of discounting is vitally important in describing hyperbolic discounting, especially in the discounting of specific rewards such as money. The discounting of monetary rewards varies across age groups due to the varying discount rate.&lt;ref name="Green et al"/&gt; The rate depends on a variety of factors, including the species being observed, age, experience, and the amount of time needed to consume the reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loewenstein |first=G. |authorlink2=Drazen Prelec |last2=Prelec |first2=D. |year=1992 |title=Choices Over Time |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |isbn=0-87154-558-6 }}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raineri |first=A. |last2=Rachlin |first2=H. |year=1993 |title=The effect of temporal constraints on the value of money and other commodities |journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision-Making |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=77–94 |doi=10.1002/bdm.3960060202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Several alternative explanations of non-exponential discounting have been proposed. An article from 2003 noted that this pattern might be better explained by a [[similarity heuristic]] than by hyperbolic discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubinstein |first=Ariel |year=2003 |title="Economics and Psychology"? The Case of Hyperbolic Discounting. |journal=International Economic Review |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=1207–1216 |doi=10.1111/1468-2354.t01-1-00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects have also reported changing relative preferences as they see more details of what they are choosing—a “temporal construal” effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trope|first1=Yaacov|last2=Liberman|first2=Nira|title=Temporal construal|journal=Psychological Review|date=2003|volume=110|issue=3|pages=403–421|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.3.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Daniel Read introduces "subadditive discounting": the fact that discounting over a delay increases if the delay is divided into smaller intervals. This hypothesis may explain the main finding of many studies in support of hyperbolic discounting—the observation that impatience declines with time–while also accounting for observations not predicted by hyperbolic discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Read |first=Daniel |year=2001 |title=Is time-discounting hyperbolic or subadditive? |journal=Journal of risk and uncertainty |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=5–32 |doi=10.1023/A:1011198414683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although these observations depart from exponential discounting, they do not entail preference reversal as time from the choice to the earlier reward increases.

Arousal of appetite or emotion does sometimes lead to preference reversal, and this has been the most widely accepted alternative to a simply hyperbolic function: [[hyperboloid]] or quasi-hyperbolic discounting fuses exponential curves with an arousal bump as a visceral reward becomes imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McClure | first1 = Samuel M. | last2 = Laibson | first2 = David I. | last3 = Loewenstein | first3 = George | last4 = Cohen | first4 = Jonathan D. | year = 2004 | title = The grasshopper and the ant: Separate neural systems value immediate and delayed monetary rewards | url = | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = | pages = 503–507 | doi=10.1126/science.1100907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such cases are obviously important, but still do not account for cases where either both or neither choice is made during arousal.

The most obvious objection to hyperbolic discounting is that many or most people learn to choose consistently over time in most situations. Similarly, a 2014 paper criticized the existing studies for mostly using data collected from university students and being too quick to conclude that the hyperbolic model of discounting is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersen |first1=Steffen |last2=Harrison |first2=Glenn W. |last3=Lau |first3=Morten |last4=Rutström |first4=E.

===Step-by-step explanation===

Suppose that in a study, participants are offered the choice between taking ''x'' dollars immediately or taking ''y'' dollars ''n'' days later.  Suppose further that one participant in that study employs exponential discounting and another employs hyperbolic discounting.

Each participant will realize that ''a'') they should take ''x'' dollars immediately if they can invest the dollar in a different venture that will yield more than ''y'' dollars ''n'' days later and ''b'') they will be indifferent between the choices (selecting one at random) if the best available alternative will likewise yield ''y'' dollars ''n'' days later.  (Assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the values of all available investments are compounded daily.)  Each participant correctly understands the fundamental question being asked:  "For any given value of ''y'' dollars and ''n'' days, what is the minimum amount of money, ''i.e.'', the minimum value for ''x'' dollars, that I should be willing to accept?  In other words, how many dollars would I need to invest today to get ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now?"  Each will take ''x'' dollars if ''x'' is greater than the answer that they calculate, and each will take ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now if ''x'' is smaller than that answer.  However, the methods that they use to calculate that amount and the answers that they get will be different, and only the exponential discounter will use the correct method and get a reliably correct result:

* The exponential discounter will think "The best alternative investment available (that is, the best investment available in the absence of this choice) gives me a return of ''r'' percent per day; in other words, once a day it adds to its value ''r'' percent of the value that it had the previous day.  That is, every day it multiplies its value once by (100% + ''r''%).  So if I hold the investment for ''n'' days, its value will have multiplied itself by this amount ''n'' times, making that value (100% + ''r''%)^''n'' of what it was at the start – that is, (1 + ''r''%)^''n'' times what it was at the start.  So to figure out how much I would need to start with today to get ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, I need to divide ''y'' dollars by ([1 + ''r''%]^''n'').  If my other choice of how much money to take is greater than this result, then I should take the other amount, invest it in the other venture that I have in mind, and get even more at the end.  If this result is greater than my other choice, then I should take ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, because it turns out that by giving up the other choice I am essentially investing that smaller amount of money to get ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, meaning that I'm getting an even greater return by waiting ''n'' days for ''y'' dollars, making this my best available investment."
* The hyperbolic discounter, however, will think "If I want ''y'' dollars ''n'' days from now, then the amount that I need to invest today is ''y'' divided by ''n'', because that amount times ''n'' equals ''y'' dollars.  [There lies the hyperbolic discounter's error.]  If my other choice is greater than this result, I should take it instead because ''x'' times ''n'' will be greater than ''y'' times ''n''; if it is less than this result, then I should wait ''n'' days for ''y'' dollars."

Where the exponential discounter reasons correctly and the hyperbolic discounter goes wrong is that as ''n'' becomes very large, the value of (1 + ''r'' %)^''n'' becomes much larger than the value of ''n'', with the effect that the value of ''y'' / [(1 + ''r'' %)^''n''] becomes much smaller than the value of ''y'' /''n''.  Therefore, the minimum value of ''x'' (the number of dollars in the immediate choice) that suffices to be greater than that amount will be much smaller than the hyperbolic discounter thinks, with the result that they will perceive ''x''-values in the range from ''y'' / [(1 + ''r'' %)^''n''] to ''y''/''n'' (inclusive at the low end) as being too small and, as a result, irrationally turn those alternatives down when they are in fact the better investment.

===Formal model===

Hyperbolic discounting is mathematically described as
:&lt;math&gt;g(D)=\frac{1}{1+kD}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g''(''D'') is the [[discount factor]] that multiplies the value of the reward, ''D'' is the delay in the reward, and ''k'' is a parameter governing the degree of discounting. This is compared with the formula for exponential discounting:
:&lt;math&gt;f(D)=e^{-kD}\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Comparison====

If &lt;math&gt;f(D)=2^{-D}\,&lt;/math&gt; is an exponential discounting function and &lt;math&gt;g(D)=\frac{1}{1+D}\,&lt;/math&gt; a hyperbolic function (with ''D'' the number of weeks of delay), then the exponential discounting a week later from "now" (''D''=0) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the exponential discounting a week from week ''D'' is &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(D+1)}{f(D)}=\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means they are the same. For ''g''(''D''), &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(1)}{g(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as for ''f'', while &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(D+1)}{g(D)}=1-\frac{1}{D+2}\,&lt;/math&gt;. From this one can see that the two types of discounting are the same "now", but when ''D'' is much greater than 1, for instance 52 (one year), &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(D+1)}{g(D)}\,&lt;/math&gt; will tend to go to 1, so that the hyperbolic discounting of a week in the far future is virtually zero, while the exponential discount factor is still 1/2, so there is still substantial discounting in the far future.

===Quasi-hyperbolic approximation===
The "quasi-hyperbolic" discount function, proposed by Laibson (1997),&lt;ref name="Laibson1997QJE"/&gt; approximates the hyperbolic discount function above in [[discrete time]] by

:&lt;math&gt;f_{QH}(0)=1, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;f_{QH}(D)=\beta \times \delta^D,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β'' and ''δ'' are constants between 0 and 1; and again ''D'' is the delay in the reward, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''QH''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') is the discount factor. The condition ''f''(0) = 1 is stating that rewards taken at the present time are not discounted.

Quasi-hyperbolic time preferences are also referred to as "beta-delta" preferences. They retain much of the analytical tractability of [[exponential discounting]] while capturing the key qualitative feature of discounting with true hyperbolas.

==Explanations==

===Uncertain risks===
Whether discounting future gains is rational or not—and at what rate such gains should be discounted—depends greatly on circumstances. Many examples exist in the financial world, for example, where it is reasonable to assume that there is an implicit risk that the reward will not be available at the future date, and furthermore that this risk increases with time. Consider paying $50 for dinner today or delaying payment for sixty years but paying $100,000. In this case, the restaurateur would be reasonable to discount the promised future value as there is significant risk that it might not be paid (e.g. due to the death of the restaurateur or the diner).

Uncertainty of this type can be quantified with [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian analysis]].&lt;ref name="sozou1998"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. D.| title = On hyperbolic discounting and uncertain hazard rates| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| last1 = Sozou| volume = 265| issue = 1409| pages = 2015–2020| year = 1998| doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0534| pmc = 1689473}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose that the probability for the reward to be available after time ''t'' is, for known hazard rate λ,
:&lt;math&gt;P(R_t|\lambda) = \exp(-\lambda t),\,&lt;/math&gt;

but the rate is unknown to the decision maker. If the [[prior probability]] distribution of λ is
:&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda) = \exp(-\lambda/k)/k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then the decision maker will expect that the probability of the reward after time ''t'' is
:&lt;math&gt;P(R_t) = \int_0^\infty P(R_t|\lambda) p(\lambda) d\lambda = \frac{1}{1 + k t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the hyperbolic discount rate. Similar conclusions can be obtained from other plausible distributions for λ.&lt;ref name="sozou1998"/&gt;

===Present value of a standard annuity===

The present value of a series of equal annual cash flows in arrears discounted hyperbolically is

where ''V'' is the present value, ''P'' is the annual cash flow, ''D'' is the number of annual payments and ''k'' is the factor governing the discounting.

'''Injustice''' is a quality relating to unfairness or undeserved outcomes. The term may be applied in reference to a particular event or situation, or to a larger [[status quo]]. In [[Western philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], injustice is very commonly—but not always—defined as  either the absence or the opposite of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze" /&gt;

The sense of injustice is a universal human feature, though the exact circumstances considered unjust can vary from culture to culture. While even acts of nature can sometimes arouse the sense of injustice, the sense is usually felt in relation to human action such as misuse, [[abuse]], neglect, or malfeasance that is uncorrected or else sanctioned by a [[legal system]] or fellow human beings.

The sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated.

==Relationship with justice==
Professor [[Judith N. Shklar|Judith Shklar]] has written that Western philosophers tend to spend much more time discussing the concept of 'justice' rather than 'injustice'. On the other hand, she states both historical writing and fiction use instances of injustice as subject matter far more often than justice.&lt;ref name = "Judith" /&gt;

In philosophy and jurisprudence, the dominant view has been that injustice and justice are two sides of the same coin—that injustice is simply a lack of justice.  This view has been challenged by professors including Judith Shklar, Thomas W Simon and [[Eric Heinze]], who consider that justice and injustice are independent qualities. So, in this minority view, you can increase the justice of a situation without reducing the injustice. Heinze has even gone as far as to argue that an increase in justice can actually cause an increase in injustice.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;

A relatively common view among philosophers and other writers is that while justice and injustice may be interdependent, it is injustice that is the primary quality. Many writers have written that, while it is hard to directly define or even perceive justice, it is easy to demonstrate that injustice can be perceived by all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]], the earliest known thinker to state that injustice is the primary quality was [[Heraclitus]],  whose view was echoed by [[Aristotle]] and dozens of others down the centuries. Hayek said that writers often express the idea that injustice is the primary concept "as though it were a new discovery", suggesting the view is rarely directly expressed in theories on Justice. But Hayek went on to say that [[legal positivism]] has proved that injustice, not justice, is the primary quality.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 8 "THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE"  in Vol 2 of  von Hayeks's ''The mirage of social justice'' (University of Chicago Press,  1978). For a list discussing dozens of writers who have stated down the centuries that  injustice, not justice, is the primary concept, look out for the long footnote under the sub heading  "Rules of just conduct are generally prohibitions of unjust conduct"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sense of injustice==
[[File:Flickr - Yale Law Library - Beast of Injustice.jpg|thumb|right|A metaphorical injustice eating the innocent in [[Guillaume Rouillé]]'s ''Justicie atque Iniusticie''.  The legs of the beast include ''adolescés sine obediétia'' (disobedient youth) and ''plebs sine disciplina''(undisciplined commoners).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://library.law.yale.edu/blogs/rare-books/2010-07 |author=Mike Widener |title=More images in our Flickr galleries|publisher=Yale Law Library |date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Scholars including Judith Shklar, Edmond Cahn  and [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]] have surveyed anthropological and historical work on injustice, concluding that the sense of injustice is found everywhere there are men and women; it is a [[human universal]].&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore" /&gt;    
These writers, and others like [[Simone Weil]], Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold that the sense of injustice is a powerful motivational condition — unlike the sense of justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Clive. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Priority_of_Injustice.html?id=_2jmAQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory'']. (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2017). {{ISBN| 978-0820351520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cahn held that, for [[evolution|evolutionary reasons]], humans who witness others being subjected to injustice can respond as though it was an act of aggression towards themselves. There can be an immediate, visceral activation of the [[fight-or-flight response|flight or fight]] system. As [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] puts it "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Letter from a Birmingham Jail]] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in [[Psychological Science]] found that even babies have a sense of injustice and dislike having it violated, even when they witness events that do not directly effect them.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of jurisprudence, Cahn has argued that it is an important skill for lawyers to know how to rouse a jury's sense of injustice — something best done by appeals to the particular, not by abstractions or [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] type statements.  Barrington Moore asserts that reasons why populations often submit to [[oppression]] for long periods of time is that they consider it inevitable and so their sense of injustice is not aroused. He says that a widely shared sense of injustice is an essential, though not sufficient, cause of rebellion.  Writers including Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Judith Shklar have said that an aroused sense of injustice can be an essential prerequisite to action needed for protecting the weak and afflicted.&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast"/&gt;

==Causes==
A common cause of injustice is human selfishness. As [[Plato]] described at length in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', people will often commit acts of injustice when they calculate it is in their interests to do so.&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;  Plato also adds that "The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not".   Human injustice is not always caused by attempt to gain unfair advantage or malice; it may be simply the result of the flawed human [[decision making]]. For example, studies have found that judges sitting on review boards are less likely to reach decisions favorable to applicants depending on how long it is since the judges had their last food break.&lt;ref&gt;"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break." {{cite journal |author1=Shai Danzigera |author2=Jonathan Levav |author3=Liora Avnaim-Pessoa| title=Extraneous factors in judicial decisions |date=11 April 2011 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=17 |pages=6889–92 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018033108 |pmid=21482790 | accessdate=15 November 2011|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.6889D |pmc=3084045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on the substantial difference in judges' decisions depending on time since last food break, see chpt 3 of [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Misuse and abuse with regard to a particular case or context may represent a systemic failure to serve the cause of justice (cf. [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]]).&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">In [[mathematics]] the '''Karoubi envelope''' (or '''Cauchy completion''' or '''idempotent completion''') of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''C''' is a classification of the [[idempotent]]s of '''C''', by means of an auxiliary category. Taking the Karoubi envelope of a [[preadditive category]] gives a [[pseudo-abelian category]], hence the construction is sometimes called the pseudo-abelian completion. It is named for the French mathematician [[Max Karoubi]].

Given a category '''C''', an idempotent of '''C''' is an [[endomorphism]] 

:&lt;math&gt;e: A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;

with 

:&lt;math&gt;e\circ e = e&lt;/math&gt;.

An idempotent ''e'': ''A'' → ''A'' is said to '''split''' if there is an object ''B'' and morphisms ''f'': ''A'' → ''B'',
''g'' : ''B'' → ''A'' such that ''e'' = ''g'' ''f'' and 1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' ''g''.

The '''Karoubi envelope''' of '''C''', sometimes written '''Split(C)''', is the category whose objects are pairs of the form (''A'', ''e'') where ''A'' is an object of '''C''' and &lt;math&gt;e : A \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; is an idempotent of '''C''', and whose [[morphism]]s are the triples

: &lt;math&gt;(e, f, e^{\prime}): (A, e) \rightarrow (A^{\prime}, e^{\prime})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f: A  \rightarrow A^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism of '''C''' satisfying &lt;math&gt;e^{\prime} \circ f = f = f \circ e&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;f=e'\circ f\circ e&lt;/math&gt;).

Composition in '''Split(C)''' is as in '''C''', but the identity morphism 
on &lt;math&gt;(A,e)&lt;/math&gt; in '''Split(C)''' is &lt;math&gt;(e,e,e)&lt;/math&gt;, rather than
the identity on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

The category '''C''' embeds fully and faithfully in '''Split(C)'''. In '''Split(C)''' every idempotent splits, and '''Split(C)''' is the universal category with this property.
The Karoubi envelope of a category '''C''' can therefore be considered as the "completion" of '''C''' which splits idempotents.

The Karoubi envelope of a category '''C''' can equivalently be defined as the [[full subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[presheaf (category theory)|presheaves]] over '''C''') of retracts of [[representable functor]]s. The category of presheaves on '''C''' is equivalent to the category of presheaves on '''Split(C)'''.

== Automorphisms in the Karoubi envelope ==

An [[automorphism]] in '''Split(C)''' is of the form &lt;math&gt;(e, f, e): (A, e) \rightarrow (A, e)&lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt;(e, g, e): (A, e) \rightarrow (A, e)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying:

: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = e = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f \circ g = g&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f \circ g \circ f = f&lt;/math&gt;

If the first equation is relaxed to just have &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;, then ''f'' is a partial automorphism (with inverse ''g''). A (partial) involution in '''Split(C)''' is a self-inverse (partial) automorphism.

==Examples==

* If '''C''' has products, then given an [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; the mapping &lt;math&gt;f \times f^{-1}: A \times B \rightarrow B \times A&lt;/math&gt;, composed with the canonical map &lt;math&gt;\gamma:B \times A \rightarrow A \times B&lt;/math&gt; of symmetry, is a partial [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].
* If '''C''' is a [[triangulated category]], the Karoubi envelope '''Split'''('''C''') can be endowed with the structure of a triangulated category such that the canonical functor '''C''' → '''Split'''('''C''') becomes a [[triangulated functor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations| last1=Balmer | last2=Schlichting | year=2001 | nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Karoubi envelope is used in the construction of several categories of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motives]].
*The Karoubi envelope construction takes semi-adjunctions to [[adjoint functors|adjunction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* The category of [[projective module]]s over any ring is the Karoubi envelope of its full subcategory of free modules.
* The category of [[vector bundle]]s over any paracompact space is the Karoubi envelope of its full subcategory of trivial bundles. This is in fact a special case of the previous example by the [[Serre-Swan theorem]] and conversely this theorem can be proved by first proving both these facts, the observation that the [[global section]]s functor is an equivalence between trivial vector bundles over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and projective modules over &lt;math&gt;C(X)&lt;/math&gt; and then using the universal property of the Karoubi envelope.

'''Kiberpipa''' ({{lang-sl|Cyberpipe}}) was a [[hackerspace]] in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], established in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mladina.si/97440/kiberpipa/|title=Katalizator računalniških subkultur|publisher=Mladina|first=Jaka|last=Železnikar|date=1 October 2001|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of the K6/4 Institute. After a breakup with the parent organization and moving to a different location in 2013 it ceased most operations in 2015.

The hackerspace operated as a [[cultural centre]], computer laboratory and [[Internet café]] (with free wireless access) at Kersnikova 4, Ljubljana. Kiberpipa engaged primarily in open source programming, electronic art and the recycling of computer devices&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.culture.si/en/Cyberpipe|website=Culture.si|title=Cyberpipe|date=3 May 2014|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Between 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://slo-tech.com/novice/t196248|title=Otvoritev Kiberpipinega računalniškega muzeja|website=Slo-Tech|date=14 December 2005|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013 it also hosted a small living computer museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://boingboing.net/2009/03/12/bb-video-cyberpipes.html|archive-url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYSzoOfPsYo|title=Cyberpipe's Mecca of Vintage Computers|date=13 March 2009|access-date=25 February 2018|publisher=Boing Boing Video|first=Johannes|last=Grenzfurthner|archive-date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The mostly volunteer team in the hackerspace organised workshops, lectures, and entertainment and information events, with around 150 events yearly at the height of its activity&lt;ref name="delo"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.delo.si/zgodbe/sobotnapriloga/kiberpipa-garazna-hisa-namesto-valilnice-inovacij.html|title=Kiberpipa: garažna hiša namesto valilnice inovacij|publisher=Delo|first=Matej|last=Kovačič|date=4 May 2013|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2013, the Student Organization of [[University of Ljubljana]], the owner of the building where Kiberpipa originally operated, decided to re-purpose the building as a restaurant and a parking garage. After failing to negotiate a new position within the organization, Kiberpipa team opted to continue operating independently of the Student Organization and moved to a new location&lt;ref name="delo" /&gt;. In the same year, the Student Organization opened its own hackerspace Rampa&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://kersnikova.org/rampa/|title=Rampa: Laboratorij za hekanje znanosti, umetnosti in družbe.|publisher=Zavod Kersnikova|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014, Kiberpipa re-opened at a new location at Gosposvetska 2 using volunteer work and donations&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://novice.kulturnik.si/cat/tehnologija/before/2014-03-29|title=Delovna akcija (sprint) v novih prostorih Kiberpipe Kiberpipa|date=28 March 2014|access-date=25 February 2018|website=Kulturnik}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It continued to organize lectures and open source software-related events at the new location until closure in 2015. In 2015 a web server malfunction also resulted in the loss of the Kiberpipa website and archived content&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.kiberpipa.org/?p=23|title=Hrčki so šli po svoje…|website=Kiberpipa|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


== Partnerships and events ==
[[File:Kiberpipa 2010.jpg|thumb|Kiberpipa lecture in 2010]]
Kiberpipa co-operated with other organizations in Slovenia, e.g. the Slo-Tech and 3delavnica teams, regional multimedia centres (including Ljudmila - Ljubljana Digital Media Lab, [[Kibla|KIBLA Multimedia Centre]]) and organizations abroad (Mama New Media Centre in Zagreb, HackLab in Pula for example).

Kiberpipa organised the bi-annual HAIP Festival (Hack/Act/Interact/Progress Festival).

Kiberpipa was a member of the m3c Multimedia Centres Network of Slovenia.

In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''local flatness''' is a property of a [[submanifold]] in a [[topological manifold]] of larger [[dimension]]. In the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of [[Submanifold#Embedded submanifolds|embedded submanifolds]] in the category of [[smooth manifolds]]. Local flatness and the [[topology]] of ridge networks is of importance in the study of [[Crumpling|crumpled structures]] with importance in materials processing and [[mechanical engineering]].

Suppose a ''d'' dimensional manifold ''N'' is embedded into an ''n'' dimensional manifold ''M'' (where ''d'' &amp;lt; ''n'').  If &lt;math&gt;x \in N,&lt;/math&gt; we say ''N'' is '''locally flat''' at ''x'' if there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt; U \subset M&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' such that the [[topological pair]] &lt;math&gt;(U, U\cap N)&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, with a standard inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; as a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. That is, there exists a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;U\to R^n&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;U\cap N&lt;/math&gt; coincides with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

The above definition assumes that, if ''M'' has a [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]], ''x'' is not a boundary point of ''M''. If ''x'' is a point on the boundary of ''M'' then the definition is modified as follows. We say that ''N'' is '''locally flat''' at a boundary point ''x'' of ''M'' if there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U\subset M&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' such that the topological pair &lt;math&gt;(U, U\cap N)&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n_+,\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_+&lt;/math&gt; is a standard [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is included as a standard subspace of its boundary. In more detail, we can set 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_+ = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n\colon y_n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n\colon y_{d+1}=\cdots=y_n=0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

We call ''N'' '''locally flat''' in ''M'' if ''N'' is locally flat at every point. Similarly, a map &lt;math&gt;\chi\colon N\to M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''locally flat''', even if it is not an embedding, if every ''x'' in ''N'' has a neighborhood ''U'' whose image &lt;math&gt;\chi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is locally flat in ''M''.

Local flatness of an embedding implies strong properties not shared by all embeddings.  Brown (1962) proved that if ''d'' = ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, then ''N'' is collared; that is, it has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to ''N'' &amp;times; [0,1] with ''N'' itself corresponding to ''N'' &amp;times; 1/2 (if ''N'' is in the interior of ''M'') or ''N'' &amp;times; 0 (if ''N'' is in the boundary of ''M'').

'''Low information rationality''' is a [[social theory]] that states that people are [[information]] consumers with limited benefits and time for processing and understanding information. Due to the limited benefits and time individuals have for learning new information, individuals use various shortcuts and [[heuristics]] to understand information quicker. Simply put, it does not make sense for the average individual to develop in depth understandings of most issues. The theory is often used to explain the limited understanding of [[politics]] and [[Science|scientific]] [[Technology|technologies]] by the general [[public]].

==Assumptions==
The concept of low-information rationality is based on the assumption that [[human being]]s are [[cognitive miser]]s and minimize the economic costs of making decisions and forming attitudes. Most citizens will therefore not bother to develop an in-depth understanding of political or scientific issues, which would require significant time and effort. Rather, they collect only as much information as they think is necessary to make any given decision.&lt;ref name="Messages and Heuristics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@msh_publishing_group/documents/web_document/wtx032691.pdf|title=3 MESSAGES AND HEURISTICS: HOW AUDIENCES FORM ATTITUDES ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES|last=Scheufele|first=Dietram|work=Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key mechanisms==
The reason this theory comes about in today's age is due to vast increase in amount of information that each of us is exposed to through the [[internet]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], and [[Television|TV]]. Therefore, these patterns of [[information processing]] make perfect sense for citizens who have to deal with thousands of pieces of new information every day, and we all use them. We spend less [[Cognition|cognitive]] effort in buying toothpaste than we do when picking a new car. And that difference in [[Information seeking|information-seeking]] is largely a function of the costs.&lt;ref name="Messages and Heuristics" /&gt;

==Shortcuts==
There are a variety of shortcuts individuals use to process information quickly and more efficiently. This does not mean, however, that these methods always lead to accurate and reliable conclusions. Common shortcuts include, [[stereotypes]], opinions of others, interpersonal influences, [[Framing (social sciences)|news frames]], [[heuristic]]s and [[political ideology]].

==Samuel Popkin: ''The Reasoning Voter''==
American pollster and political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin|Samuel Popkin]] coined the term "low-information" in 1991 when he used the phrase "low-information signaling" in his book ''The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns.''&lt;ref name="popkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popkin|first=Samuel|title=The Reasoning Voter|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0226675440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAT-IREgyQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkin relies on a theory of low information rationality to explain how voters are able to make rational choices between candidates. Voters do this by using information shortcuts that they receive during campaigns, usually using something like a "drunkard's search." Voters use small amounts of personal information to construct a narrative about candidates. Essentially, they ask themselves this: "Based on what I know about the candidate personally, what is the probability that this presidential candidate was a good governor? What is the probability that he will be a good president?" Popkin's analysis is based on one main premise: voters use low information rationality gained in their daily lives, through the media and through personal interactions, to evaluate candidates and facilitate electoral choices.

==Other models==
The science Literacy/[[knowledge deficit]] model states that the public is willing and able to process information if it is available. Therefore, a lack of public support or participation is caused by a lack of information available to the public.

==Problems for science==
As mentioned above, scientists who use the knowledge deficit model face great difficulty conveying information to the lay public when overwhelming amount of psychology and political science studies show that the public uses the low information rationality model. Some examples of this are in the cutting-edge sciences of [[nanotechnology]] and biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brossard, D. |author2=Shanahan, J. |author3=Nesbitt, T.C. |title=The Public, the Media, and Biotechnology|year=2007|publisher=CABI|location=UK|isbn=978 1 84593 204 6|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For issues such as [[agricultural biotechnology]], for example, where developing an in-depth understanding would require significant efforts on the part of ordinary citizens, the pay-offs in terms of being able to make informed policy judgments may simply not be enough. As a result, it makes perfect sense for citizens to rely on shortcuts such as  opinions of others when forming their own opinions and trying to make sense of different policy positions.

'''Lèse-majesté''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|z|ˌ|m|æ|ʒ|ɛ|s|ˈ|t|eɪ}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lese-majeste ''Collin's English Dicitonary'']&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|i:|z|_|ˈ|m|æ|dʒ|ᵻ|s|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|lese-majesty}}&lt;/ref&gt; also '''lese-majesty''', '''lese majesty''' or '''leze majesty''') is the crime of violating [[majesty]], an offence against the dignity of a reigning [[monarch|sovereign]] or against a state.

This behaviour was first classified as a criminal offence against the dignity of the [[Roman Republic]] of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5PwrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA735&amp;lpg=PA735&amp;dq=laesa+maiestas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1sprtKMss5&amp;sig=h8EYzeDMApaifbzOgjbwEoiGRlc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wRFXVenrJ4WDsAXCioGwBg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=laesa%20maiestas&amp;f=false Oxford Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities] A complex development as distinct from treason occurred from kingdom thru empire. Arguably there was no distinction in the republican period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dominate]], or Late Empire period, the [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] eliminated the Republican trappings of their predecessors and began to identify the state with their person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/lese+majesty TheFreeDictionary.com], "Lese majesty" [[TheFreeDictionary.com]], [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although legally the ''[[princeps civitatis]]'' (his official title, meaning, roughly, 'first citizen') could never become a sovereign because  the republic was never officially abolished, emperors were deified as [[apotheosis|divus]], first posthumously but by the Dominate period while reigning. Deified emperors enjoyed the same legal protection that was accorded to the divinities of the [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|state cult]]; by the time it was replaced by Christianity, what was in all but name a monarchical tradition had already become well-established.

Narrower conceptions of offences against Majesty as offences against the crown predominated in the European kingdoms that emerged in the early medieval period. In [[Feudalism|feudal]] Europe, some crimes were classified as lèse-majesté even if they were not intentionally directed against the crown. An example is counterfeiting, so classified because coins bore the monarch's effigy and/or coat of arms.

With the disappearance of [[absolute monarchy]] in Europe, lèse-majesté came to be viewed as less of a crime. However, certain malicious acts that would have once been classified as the crime of lèse-majesté could still be prosecuted as [[treason]]. Future republics that emerged as great powers generally still classified as a crime any offence against the highest representatives of the state. These laws are still applied as well in monarchies outside of Europe, such as modern [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]].

In Italy, Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite swiss law|sr=311.0|link=311_0|art=296|en=Swiss Penal Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poland]] it is illegal to insult foreign heads of state publicly. This was also the case in Germany until 2017.

On 25 January 2017, the German Justice Minister Heiko Maas announced a decision by the Cabinet to remove the law from the German criminal code, effective January 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-abolishing-slander-law-on-insulting-foreign-leaders/a-37268893 Deutsche Welle], "Berlin abolishing slander law on insulting foreign leaders", Retrieved July 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The decision came several months after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in April 2016 a controversial decision to honor the Turkish government's request to prosecute a German comedian for reading an obscene poem about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on late-night television. In that announcement, Merkel also stated the intention to consider repeal of the little-known law.&lt;ref&gt; [https://theintercept.com/2016/04/15/germany-repeal-dumb-law-first-using-prosecute-comic-insulting-erdogan/ TheIntercept.com] "German Chancellor Refuses to Block Prosecution of Comic Who Insulted Turkey’s President" retrieved July 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution was dropped in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-abolishing-slander-law-on-insulting-foreign-leaders/a-37268893 Deutsche Welle]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*On 5 January 2005, [[Marxist]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] publisher [[Jerzy Urban]] was sentenced by a Polish court to a fine of 20,000 złoty (about €5000, UK£3384 or US$6,200) for having insulted [[Pope John Paul II]], a visiting head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/64210/ IFEX.org], "Criminal Defamation Laws Hamper Free Expression" [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange|IFEX.org]], retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 26–27 January 2005, 28 human rights activists were temporarily detained by the Polish authorities for allegedly insulting [[Vladimir Putin]], a visiting head of state. The activists were released after about 30 hours and only one was actually charged with insulting a foreign head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/6498297.stm NEWS.BBC.co.uk], "Sensitive heads of state", retrieved 30 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], the monarch is protected by the usual [[libel]] paragraph (§ 267 of the [[Danish penalty law|penal code]] which allows for up to four months of imprisonment), but §115&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=113401|title=Resinformation.dk|work=retsinformation.dk|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for doubling of the usual punishment when the regent is target of the libel. When a [[queen consort]], [[queen dowager]] or the crown prince is the target, the punishment may be increased by 50%. There are no historical records of §115 having ever been used, but in March 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists who unfurled a banner at a dinner at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] were charged under this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COP-15 activists in lèse majesté case|newspaper=[[Politiken]]|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1209764/cop-15-activists-in-lse-majest-case/|date=1 March 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011|location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received minor sentences for other crimes, but were acquitted of the charge relating to the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Københavns Byret (22-08-2011). ''[http://www.domstol.dk/KobenhavnsByret/nyheder/domsresumeer/Pages/Greenpeace-aktivisterid%C3%B8mtbetingetf%C3%A6ngseli14dage.aspx Greenpeace-aktivister idømt betinget fængsel i 14 dage.]'' (in Danish).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====
Insulting a country, foreign head of state, its representatives or flag can be punished by up to two years of imprisonment according to the 95th article of the penal code. For a very serious breach the time can be extended to 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/1940019.html#G95|title=Almenn hegningarlög|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
For insulting the king, the heiress apparent, and their relatives, an offender may receive up to five years' imprisonment plus a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/politics/world-leaders/140310/insult-world-leader-crime-punishment|title=This is how these 12 countries will punish you for insulting their heads of state|work=globalpost.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total 18 prosecutions were brought under the law between 2000 and 2012, half of which resulted in convictions.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36799639|title=Dutchman jailed for 30 days for 'insulting' the king|date=14 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, a 47-year-old man was sentenced to one week's imprisonment and fined €400&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221124434/http://current.com/news-and-politics/88877763_dutch-man-jailed-for-insulting-the-queen.htm|archivedate=2011-02-21|url=http://current.com/news-and-politics/88877763_dutch-man-jailed-for-insulting-the-queen.htm|title=Dutch man jailed for insulting the queen.|work=current.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for, amongst other things, lèse-majesté in the [[Netherlands]] when he called [[Queen Beatrix]] a "whore" and told a police officer that he would have anal sex with her because "she would like it".&lt;ref&gt;Rechtbank Amsterdam, 13/420932-07 en 13/421786-06, {{ECLI|ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2007:BB1044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, a 44-year-old man was sentenced to 30 days in jail for 'intentionally insulting' [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]], accusing him of being a murderer, thief and rapist.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

====Spain====

====Kuwait====
In January 2009 there was a diplomatic incident between Australia and Kuwait over an Australian woman being held for allegedly insulting the Emir of Kuwait during a fracas with Kuwaiti immigration authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/emir-we-wont-intervene/2009/01/13/1231608677664.html|title=Australia will not intervene as woman held in Kuwait for emir 'insult' - National|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jordan====
In September 2012, pro-reform activists faced charges of lèse-majesté following protests in two locations in Jordan. The protests turned violent after the activists reportedly chanted slogans against the Jordanian regime and insulted King [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II]] and the Royal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleNO=17751 |title=Tafileh Reform Activists to be Charged with Slander, Lese Majeste &amp;#124; Jordan News &amp;#124; Ammon News |publisher=En.ammonnews.net |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Mohammad Saeed Baker, a member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s shura council, was arrested in Jordan and sentenced to six months in prison for lèse-majesté. He was released in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/brotherhood-member-released-after-serving-six-month-prison-term|title=Brotherhood member released after serving six-month prison term|date=2 February 2015|work=jordantimes.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
Under the counterterrorism law that took effect in 2014, actions that "threaten Saudi Arabia’s unity, disturb public order, or defame the reputation of the state or the king" are considered acts of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Saudi writer arrested"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi writer arrested for insulting long-dead king|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-writer-arrested-insulting-king-175970668#sthash.wGGUZRFv.dpuf|accessdate=1 June 2016|agency=Middle East Eye|publisher=Middle East Eye|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offense may carry harsh [[corporal punishment]], including public lashings, lengthy jail terms and even death, the sentences may be determined on a per case basis owing to the arbitrary nature of the Saudi legal system.&lt;ref name="Zaid Hamid sentenced in Saudi Arabia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani commentator Zaid Hamid sentenced to prison, lashing in Saudi Arabia|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/pakistani-commentator-zaid-hamid-sentenced-to-prison-lashing-in-saudi-arabia-1.1545104|accessdate=1 June 2016|agency=Gulf News|publisher=Gulf News|date=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

====Morocco====
Moroccans are routinely prosecuted for statements deemed offensive to the King. The minimum penalty for such a statement is one year's imprisonment if the statement is made in private (i.e. not broadcast), and three years' imprisonment if it is made in public.

In 2008, an 18-year-old was charged with "breach of due respect to the king" for writing "God, Homeland, [[FC Barcelona|Barça]]" on a school board, in reference to his favorite football club and satirising the [[national motto]] ("God, Homeland, King").

In February 2012, 18-year-old Walid Bahomane was convicted for posting two mild cartoons of the king on Facebook. The procès-verbal cites two [[Facebook]] pages and a computer being seized as evidence. Walid was officially prosecuted for "touching the sacralities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Busted for Posting Caricatures of the King on Facebook |url=http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/08/morocco-busted-for-posting-caricatures-of-the-king-on-facebook-2/|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Lèse majesté in Thailand}}
[[Thailand]]'s [[Law of Thailand|criminal code]] has carried a prohibition against lèse-majesté since 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6547413.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Thailand's king pardons Swiss man|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, when [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thailand's monarchy]] ceased to be absolute and a [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]] was adopted, it too included language prohibiting lèse-majesté. The [[Thai constitutional referendum, 2016|2016 Constitution of Thailand]], and all previous versions since 1932, contain the clause, "The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action." Thai criminal code elaborates in Article 112: "Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years." Missing from the code, however, is a definition of what actions constitute "defamation" or "insult".&lt;ref name="BBC_JHead"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Head|first1=Jonathan|title=Writer held for 'insulting' Thai royals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7604935.stm|accessdate=26 October 2016|work=BBC|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2005, the Thai court system only saw four or five lèse-majesté cases a year. From January 2006 to May 2011, however, more than 400 cases came to trial, an estimated 15 times increase.&lt;ref name="increase"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110527/ap_on_re_as/as_thailand_monarchy |title=Thailand arrests American for alleged king insult |author=Todd Pitman and Sinfah Tunsarawuth |date=27 March 2011 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers attribute the increase to increased polarization following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006 military coup]] and sensitivity over the elderly king's declining health.&lt;ref name="increase"/&gt; In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Thailand]] ruled in case no. 6374/2556 that Article 112 of the Penal Code protects the past kings as well as the present one. Criticisms or comments which tarnish past kings or the monarchy is punishable by law. However, scholars raised doubts as to how far back lèse-majesté will be applied as the present Thai monarchy ([[Chakri Dynasty]]) dates back more than 200 years while other monarchies which ruled Siam can be traced back almost 800 years.

Neither the king nor any member of the royal family has ever personally filed any charges under this law. In fact, during his birthday speech in 2005, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] encouraged criticism: "Actually, I must also be criticized. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know." He later added, "But the King ''can'' do wrong", in reference to those he was appealing to not to overlook his human nature.&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite web |date=5 December 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html|title=Royal Birthday Address: 'King Can Do Wrong'|publisher=National Media|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the NCPO junta which [[2014 Thai coup d'état|overthrew the democratic regime in May 2014]], charges of lèse-majesté have increased significantly, especially against the opponents of the junta. Lèse-majesté is now seeing increasing use as a tool to stifle free speech and dissent in the country.&lt;ref name="Mother of Dissident"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Thai cleaning lady facing prison for 'I see'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36328865|accessdate=21 May 2016|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the parents of the former princess Srirasmi Suwadee as well as her uncle have been charged with lèse-majesté. On March 9, 2015, a court sentenced her father Apiruj Suwadee and mother Wanthanee for insulting the royal family and lodging a malicious claim. They pleaded guilty to the offenses named and were sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31828475|title=Parents of Thai ex-princess given jail term for lese majeste|date=11 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 2017 in Bangkok a 33-year-old Thai man by the first name of Wichai was given 35 years imprisonment for posting 10 Facebook photos and comments about the Thai royalty. This sentence was reduced from initial 70 years following a guilty plea made after a year in jail before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simth|first1=Nicola|title=Man handed 35-year sentence for insulting Thai royal family on Facebook|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/man-handed-35-year-sentence-insulting-thai-royal-family-facebook/|agency=Telegraph|date=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2017 the [[United Nations]] has called on Thailand to amend its law on lèse-majesté.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40298570#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former laws==

===Japan===
Laws against offending the emperor were in place between 1880 and 1947, when the law was abolished, during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]]. The last person to be convicted of the crime was Shōtarō Matsushima, a factory worker and member of the [[Japanese Communist Party]]. During a 1946 protest against food shortages in front of the Imperial Palace, during which the protesters demanded entry into the palace kitchens which were said to be stocked with staple foods, Matsushima wielded a placard reading, on the one side, "Imperial Edict: The Emperor system has been preserved. I, the Emperor, have eaten to my heart's content, but you, my subjects, should starve to death! Signed, (Imperial Seal)". The other side demanded that the Emperor give a public accounting of the food shortages. Matsushima was arrested and charged with impairing the dignity of the Emperor. The Allied occupation authorities intervened and had the charges reduced to libel. Matsushima was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison, but was pardoned immediately under an Imperial amnesty commemorating the new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;p. 242, Eiji Takemae: The Allied Occupation of Japan (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main article|Lèse majesté in Norway}}

Following the [[Penal Code (Norway)|2005 Penal Code]] (introduced in 2015), lèse majesté is no longer considered a criminal offense.

The 1902 Penal Code, article 101, provided a fine or up to five years of prison for lèse majesté.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#101 Straffeloven, § 101] at ''Lovdata.no''&lt;/ref&gt; According to article 103, prosecution had to be ordered or accepted by the King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#103 Straffeloven, § 103] at ''Lovdata.no''&lt;/ref&gt; Article 101 stated: "If any defamation is exercised against the King or the Regent, the guilty is punished with a fine or up to five years of prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Forøves nogen Ærekrenkelse mod Kongen eller Regenten, straffes den skyldige med Hefte eller Fængsel indtil 5 Aar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 abolished the common law criminal offences of [[sedition]] and "leasing-making". The latter offence, also known as "lease {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|z}} making", was considered an offence of lèse-majesté or making remarks critical of the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]].  The final prosecution for this offence had occurred in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=5495&amp;mode=html|title=Justice Committee Official Report|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Media_pluralism_trends_2018.jpg|thumb|436x436px|Media pluralism trends 2018, UNESCO's World Trends Report]]
Media pluralism is often recognized by [[International organization|international organizations]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] as being an essential part of a [[Democracy|democratic]] state, [[Reporters Without Borders]] considers ''"access to a plurality of editorial lines and analyses [as] essential for citizens to be able to confront ideas, to make their own informed choices and to conduct their life freely"''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Expanded access to the [[Internet]] and the [[Digital television transition|digital switch-over]] has enabled an increased availability of [[Content (media)|media content]], largely through sharing and [[user-generated content]] on [[social media]], in addition to the digital channels to which individuals have access across television and radio. The diversity of content is however accompanied by what [[Comparing Media Systems|Hallin and Mancini]] call polarized pluralism in a media system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|last=Hallin|first=Daniel C.|last2=Mancini|first2=Paolo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0521543088|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the [[World Trends Report]], a sharper division in the way we use news is coming up due to the interaction between consumption habits, changing [[Economic model|economic models]] and technical systems. This signifies that even if multiple kinds of information and programming are available, each segmented group may only ingest one branch of the whole. The increase of Internet penetration and reliance on online sources for news is thought of to producing siloed debates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level, ‘[[Zero-rating|zero rating]]’— in which Internet or [[Mobile network operator|mobile service providers]] allow users to access specific content or applications without counting towards the user’s data ‘cap’— expands in parallel to mobile uptakes, particularly in [[Emerging markets|emerging countries]]. Traditional business models for the news media continue to be disrupted, leading to vertical and horizontal concentration and introduction of new types of ownership. Challenges to media funding introduce new types of economic models such as [[Paywall|pay-walls]] and [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding]] initiatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Gender equality|Gender]] is a part of media pluralism and is characterized by the under-representation of [[Women in media|women in the media]] workforce, in [[decision-making]] and in media content. People with disabilities are also under-represented in the media system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/disability-and-the-media.html|title=Disability and the Media {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding media pluralism ==

* Pluralism means choice for media consumption and production, as distinct from monopolization of offerings and opportunities.
* Pluralism involves sensitivity to a variety of economic ownership models and a technical architecture of delivery in which multichannel and multi-platform distribution is available.
* Pluralism often resonates with strong commitments on behalf of governments to public service and community media to provide for diversity.

[[Karol Jakubowicz|Jakubowicz]] focuses on "provisions" or "supply" of media content and the impact of available information in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media Ecology: reconceptualizing media pluralism.

== Access ==
{{Main|Access to information}}Access to information, as the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively, is an aspect of media pluralism. It can include or allow "scientific, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and [[Educational technology|e-learning]]; diffusion of new media and information [[literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B054385_2_76&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/access.html|title=Access to information.|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While “[[access to information]]”, “right to information”, “right to know” and “freedom of information” are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Percentage_of_individuals_using_the_internet_2012-2017.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Percentage_of_individuals_using_the_internet_2012-2017.svg|thumb|419x419px|Percentage of individuals using the Internet 2012–2017]]

=== Internet and mobile ===
According to the World Trends Report, access to all types of media has increased between 2012 and 2017, but this is especially true for access to the Internet. International commitments such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], the work of the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]] and the [[Internet Governance Forum]]’s intersessional work on ‘Connecting the Next Billion’ testify of this.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017a.

Available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/wtid.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of Internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b.

==== Limitations ====
[[File:Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg|thumb|344x344px|Number of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012-2016]]
[[Mobile Web|Mobile Internet]] connectivity has an impact in expanding access. The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020. As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;GSMA. 2017. The Mobile Economy 2017. Available at https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the open web affords explorations beyond a user’s immediate range of interests, Mobile Internet has the singularity of creating siloed information spaces predisposing mobile users to access only a limited portion of the available information. [[Censorship]] and [[surveillance]] are also factors of media pluralism as they cause different experiences for users accessing the Internet in different States.

==== Zero-rating ====
The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet. [[Zero-rating]], the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017. Zero-rating in Emerging Economies. London: Chatham House. Available at https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/GCIG%20 no.47_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study led by the [[Alliance for Affordable Internet]] (A4AI) of eight countries in the [[Global South]] found that zero-rated data plans exist in every country, although there is a great range in the frequency with which they are offered and actually used in each.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI). 2015. Models of Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Research brief. The Impacts of Emerging Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Available at http://a4ai.org/the-impacts-of-emerging-mobile-data-services-in-developing-countries/ The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]], found Facebook’s Free Basics and [[Wikipedia Zero]] to be the most commonly zero-rated content.&lt;ref&gt;Gillwald, Alison, Chenai Chair, Ariel Futter, Kweku Koranteng, Fola Odufuwa, and John Walubengo. 2016.

=== Broadcast media ===
[[File:Main_source_of_news_by_age.svg|thumb|248x248px|Main source of news by age]]
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of [[television]] as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than [[radio]], which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In the Arab region, geopolitical interests has contributed to the growing reach of state-owned global news broadcasters and has determined the launching of Arabic-language channels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Generational trends ====
Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the Internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 [[Reuters]] Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A.

==== Digital transition ====
{{See also|Digital television transition}}Digital transition is the process in which older [[Analog TV|analog television]] [[broadcasting]] is converted to and replaced by [[digital television]].The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) has been mapping the progress in [[Digital television transition|digital switchovers]] across the globe. According to them, the switch from [[Analog television|analogue television]] to [[digital television]] has been completed in 56 countries in 2017, and was ongoing in 68, steadily increasing the range of channels to which individuals have access.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b.

==== Expansion strategies ====

* Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language [[EFE|Agencia EFE]], have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, [[China]] [[Global Television Network]] (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by [[China Central Television]], changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], [[Amharic]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pidgin]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. 2016.

Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as [[Streaming media|online streaming]] is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, [[Netflix]] experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the [[United States]], where the company began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Tom. 2017. Netflix Has More U.S. Subscribers Than Cable TV. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/15/netflix-more-subscribersthan-cable/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper industry ===
The [[Internet]] has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt; As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Advertising issues ====
Print media is continuously affected by changing trends in advertising: in 2012 its share of total news media revenues globally dropped below 50 per cent and continued falling to 38 per cent in 2016. Newspapers transition to online platforms increase the volume of revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]]. The main challenge that [[Newspaper|newspapers]] face, according to Cecilia Campbell, is how to capture more of the digital subscriptions and advertising growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Economic models ==
Media systems are built from a variety of economic models including mixes of [[Market economy|market]], [[public service]], [[community]] and [[State-owned enterprise|state entities]]. A plurality of media owners and economic models serves as an essential element of external pluralism, guaranteed by competition in the market. Nonprofit public service and [[community media]] can help achieve internal pluralism by incorporating social and [[cultural diversity]] in the content they produce. Community media, drawing especially on volunteers, can be a unique source of local dialogue and [[information exchange]]. The lack of adaption and of efficient economic strategies from [[Old media|traditional media]] has led to proliferation of privately owned media. This involves a diversification of newspapers but may also affects quality journalism and [[media independence]], especially with the financial contributions from "backers".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pluralism in media ownership ===

==== State-owned media ====
In 2012, the [[Arab States Broadcasting Union]] (ASBU) counted 1,230 television stations broadcasting via Arab and international satellites, of which 133 were state-owned and 1,097 private.&lt;ref&gt;Arab States Broadcasting Union. 2015. Arab Satellite Broadcasting Annual Report 2015. Available at http://www.asbu.net/medias/NewMedia_2016/text/asbu_report_2015.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[government]] owned channels in the media sector is paralleled by a growth in outlets with a [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] agenda. In some countries, private media outlets often maintain close ties to governments or individual politicians , while media houses owned by politically non-aligned individuals have struggled to survive, often in the face of advertising boycotts by state agencies. According to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), public service broadcasting tend to struggle with fundings and to decline since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 2015. Funding of Public Service Media 2015. Available at https://www.ebu.ch/publications/funding-of-public-service-med-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controlled liberalization ====
Media [[privatization]] and the lessening of the State dominance over media content is a global trend, according to the [[World Trends Report]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Establishing profitable models of [[State ownership|state-owned]] but relatively independent papers is part of the controlled liberalization process and is a common practice in the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific]] region.
* State owned papers are top selling in Africa and the Arab region but often lack in reflecting society's plurality.
* [[Vertical integration]] and concentration in [[Mature market|mature markets]] are found in Central and Eastern Europe, but they tend to lack [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] on ownership and of institutional safeguards with regard to pluralism (e.g. monitoring of concentration and regulatory intervention).
* Limits to [[Concentration of media ownership|concentration]] are clearly set out in Western Europe but they face [[Lobbying|lobbies]] from media actors who are able to loosen norms and the enforcement of the law.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== New types of cross-ownership ====
{{See also|Cross ownership}}[[Cross ownership|Cross-ownership]] is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Drawing the line between the media and other industries is a challenge for new types of cross-ownership. The acquisition of the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] by the founder of online retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] raised concerns about the newspaper independence, the newspaper has significantly increased its standing in the [[Digital media|online media]]—and print—and introduced significant innovations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Community-centered media ownership model ====
Most common in isolated, rural or disadvantaged areas [[Community media|community-centered media]] ownership is also mostly pertaining to radio. Through this model, not-for-profit media outlets are run and managed by the communities. They are also characterized as "independent and governed by and in the service of the communities they serve"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/community-media-sustainability/policy-series/defining|title=Community media sustainability|last=|first=|date=2017-04-07|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represent what UNESCO calls &lt;ref&gt;Steve Buckley, 2011, Community Media: A Good Practice Handbook.

=== Advertising, between old and new models ===
[[File:Internet_advertising_revenue_2012-2016.svg|thumb|286x286px|Internet advertising revenue 2012-2016]]
One of the challenges to [[Old media|traditional media]] is [[Advertising|advertisement]], which has evolved since 2010. According to the World Trends Report&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, between 2012 and 2016, revenues from advertisement in print have decreased by 27 percent In 2012, print advertising’s share of total news advertising revenue was 48 per cent, falling to 38 per cent by 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Circulation of [[Digital newspaper|digital versions of traditional newspapers]] and digital advertisements have grown significantly, but have not been sufficient to offset losses in print. Once the transitioning phase from old media to digital media is over, revenues from digital advertisement tend to increase.&lt;ref&gt;PwC. 2017. IAB internet advertising revenue report 2016 full year results. Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). The trend captured by the study of the Internet Advertising Bureau is limited to the USA, where the largest multinational companies  that are responsible for transformations in digital advertisement are headquartered&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon pushed advertisers to pay premium prices to quality publications.

Tauel Harper considers that with the rise of [[big data]], media have been seen to lose the "advertising [[subsidy]]" for journalistic content, through which "private" advertising paid for "[[Civic journalism|public journalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Tauel. 2016.

=== New platforms and business models ===
The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in the [[United States]], or the [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] in [[South Africa]] use extensions or variations of existing schemes such as pay-walls created by publications considered to be of particularly high quality or addressing a particular niche.

The [[The Guardian|Guardian]] uses [[Wikipedia]]'s borrowed strategy of frequently asking readers for [[Donation|donations]] in support to quality journalism or [[free content]].

In various sectors, the number of [[Crowdfunded Journalism|crowdfunded journalism]] projects has increased significantly. While in 2012, 88 projects received funding through the platform, in 2015, the number of projects rose to 173, scattered across 60 countries (even if North America continues to register the majority of funded projects). The funds collected grew from $1.1 million in 2012 to $1.9 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Nancy, and Amy Mitchell. 2016.

[[File:Share_of_Internet_advertising_revenue_by_platform_2012-2016.svg|thumb|284x284px|Share of Internet advertising revenue by platform 2012-2016]]
Economic models also depend on larger structural reconfiguration of the market. While in 2012 advertising revenues from [[Mobile advertising|mobile]] represented a tiny portion of the market in the [[United States]], in 2016 they surpassed revenues from all other platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Media actors have also started testing new formats and technologies of journalism, experimenting with how [[virtual reality]] or [[Video game journalism|gaming]] can facilitate immersive experiences of relatively distant events. In 2015 for example, the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] opened its Virtual Reality Lab, seeking to provide original perspectives on issues ranging from the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], to the [[South Sudanese Civil War|conflict in South Sudan]], to the thinning of the [[Antarctica|ice cap in Antarctica]]. The [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] app proved the most downloaded in the history of interactive applications launched by the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Madeline. 2015.

== Content ==
According to [[Cisco Systems]], in 2016 an average of 96,000 [[Petabyte|petabytes]] was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Systems. 201.

Total number of websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User-generated content ===
Reaching two billion daily active users in June 2017, [[Facebook]] has emerged as the most popular social media platform globally.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. 2017. Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Now Has 2 Billion Users Worldwide. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-userbase/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Other social media platforms are also dominant at the regional level such as: [[Twitter]] in [[Japan]], [[Naver]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Instagram]] (owned by Facebook) and [[LinkedIn]] (owned by [[Microsoft]]) in [[Africa]], [[VKontakte]] (VK) and [[Odnoklassniki]] in [[Russia]] and other countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ]] in [[China]].

However, a concentration phenomenon is occurring globally giving the dominance to a few online platforms that become popular for some unique features they provide, most commonly for the added privacy they offer users through disappearing messages or [[end-to-end encryption]] (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Snapchat]], [[Signal (software)|Signal]], and [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]]), but they have tended to occupy niches and to facilitate the exchanges of information that remain rather invisible to larger audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Production of freely accessible information has been increasing since 2012. In January 2017, [[Wikipedia]] had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012. This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English. In 2017, less than 12 per cent of Wikipedia content was in English, down from 18 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Wikimedia Foundation. 2017. Wikipedia Statistics. Available at https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, Straumann, and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge. For example, while content on Africa has dramatically increased, a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe, rather than from Africa itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping Participation in Wikipedia.|last=Graham|first=Mark|last2=Staumann|first2=Ralph K.|last3=Hogan|first3=Bernie|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers 105 (6): 1158–1178.|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algorithms, echo chambers and polarization ===
The proliferation of online sources represents a vector leading to an increase in pluralism but [[Algorithm|algorithms]] used by [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and [[Web search engine|search engines]] to provide users with a personalized experience based on their individual preferences represent a challenge to pluralism, restricting exposure to differing viewpoints and news feed. This is commonly referred to as "eco-chambers" and "[[Filter bubble|filter-bubbles]]".

With the help of algorithms, filter bubbles influence users choices and perception of reality by giving the impression that a particular point of view or representation is widely shared. Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum of membership of the European Union in the United Kingdom]] and the [[United States presidential election|United States presidential elections]], this gained attention as many individuals confessed their surprise at results that seemed very distant from their expectations. The range of pluralism is influenced by the personalized individualization of the services and the way it diminishes choice.

The term "[[fake news]]" gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America. It is determined by [[Fraud|fraudulent]] content in news format and its velocity. According to Bounegru, Gray, Venturini and Mauri, fake news is when a deliberate lie "is picked up by dozens of other [[Blog|blogs]], retransmitted by hundreds of websites, cross-posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands" that it then effectively becomes "fake news".&lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana, Jonathan Gray, Tommaso Venturini, and Michele Mauri. 2017.

=== Marginalized groups ===
The media covering of [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]] such as refugees tend to be influenced by and influence the political and social perceptions. While a large proportion of the European press initially articulated a sympathetic and empathetic response towards the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict in [[Syria]], according to Georgiou and Zaborowski, this sentiment was gradually replaced by suspicion and, in some cases, hostility towards [[Refugee|refugees]] and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, Myria, and Rafal Zaborowski. 2016.

=== News players ===
[[Gatekeeping (communication)|Gate-keeping]] mechanisms continue to influence not only what is being communicated, but also who is given the opportunity to frame events. Citizens’ voices have indeed increased in new stories, individuals included in these stories tend to be treated, not as agents capable of asserting their world views and their interpretation of events, but rather as [[Vox populi|vox-pol]], employed to add color to a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Toni G.L.A., Piet Verhoeven, Johannes W.J.

International journal of Communication 5: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although novel media operations and actors have had a smaller impact on mainstream reporting, they have been instrumental in animating intermediate spaces, which aggregate content in ways that can reach broader audiences.

As users increasingly move from broadcast to online media to access information, the same large media institutions tend to predominate online spaces, even if filtered and mediated in much of their social media presence. A decade later, the majority of the most visited and viewed news websites remain traditional media outlets ([[CNN]], New York Times, the Guardian, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], [[BBC News|BBC]]), although news aggregation websites such as [[Reddit]] and [[Google News]] have emerged among the top five sites with the highest [[web traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexa. 2017.

Authors Frau-Meigs, Velez, and Michel (2017) and Frau-Meigs and Torrent (2009) consider diversity in media can also be enhanced by [[Information and media literacy|media and information literacy]] (MIL).&lt;ref&gt;Frau-Meigs, Divina, and Jordi Torrent. 2009.

Many types of MIL exist from [[information literacy]], [[media literacy]], news literacy, advertising literacy, [[digital literacy]], media education, to digital and media literacy. A few initiatives already exist in the field:

* UNESCO launched in 2013 the Global Alliance for Partnerships on Media and Information Literacy (GAPMIL), as an "effort to promote international cooperation to ensure that all citizens have access to media and information competencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/media-development/media-literacy/global-alliance-for-partnerships-on-media-and-information-literacy/about-gapmil/|title=About GAPMIL - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The recent annual yearbook by the [[The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media|International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media]] focuses on trends and opportunities for MIL in the [[Arab world|Arab region]].
* There have also been efforts to embed media and information literacy initiatives and requirements into legislation in countries such as [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/five-serbian-ministries-government-joined-forces-enable-media-and-information-literacy-policies|title=Five Serbian Ministries Government Joined Forces to Enable Media and Information Literacy Policies|last=|first=|date=2017-03-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;Finnish Media Education.

* Education initiatives have been proliferating online reflecting a growth of [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] or massive online courses. Available on platforms such as [[Coursera]] and [[edX]], as well as by [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]], these courses target both students and consumers of media, as well as teachers.
* There have also been a growing number of initiatives launched by internet companies to combat [[online hate speech]] or the proliferation of ‘fake news’, largely built on users’ inputs and support in flagging content that appears to not comply with a platform’s [[terms of service]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford History Education Group. 2016.

== Gender equality ==
[[File:Invisible_women_-_Gender_equality_in_media_content,_decision-making_and_media_workforce.png|thumb|329x329px|Invisible women? Gender equality in media content, decision-making and media workforce]]
Tuchman, Daniels, and Benoit (1978) use the term "[[symbolic annihilation]]" (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe women's relationship to and visibility in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]], women’s visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015|last=Macharia|first=Sarah|publisher=London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC).|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://cdn.agilitycms.com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_report_en.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regional organization|Regional]] and [[International organization|international organizations]] also recognize gender and media pluralism as often being problematic:

* In 2010, [[UNESCO]] developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2013, the Council of the [[European Parliament]] adopted the recommendation made by the European Institute for Gender Equality, that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2016, [[UN Women]] launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on eradicating all forms of inequalities. The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The media workforce ===
According to Byerly, in many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: intercultural dialogue. Nordicom. Available at http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A769151&amp;dswid=-8862. Accessed 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of [[Women in media|women media]] professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media workforce.&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the US, Harp, Bachmann, and Loke, show that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of columnist at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 GMMP found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Closer analysis shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent), for example, and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65. Part of this is likely due to recent improvements that have allowed more young women to enter the field, but it could also relate to the differences in how aging is perceived between men and women, as well as limitations in career advancement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center|Women’s Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the USA shows that at 20 of the nation’s top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Women’s Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at https://www.womensmediacenter.com/reports/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.-media-2017. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016.

=== Women and decision-making ===
[[File:Gender_equality_in_decision-making_positions_and_on_boards_in_media_organizations_in_Europe.svg|thumb|439x439px|Gender equality in decision-making positions and on boards in media organizations in Europe]]
The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top [[management]] (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and [[Eastern Europe]] (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]] region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings: men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017. Gender Statistics Database. Available at http://eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/dgs. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In [[Southern Africa]], a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016. Whose news, whose views? Southern Africa Gender and Media Progress Study 2015. Johannesburg: Gender Links. Available at http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whose-news-whose-views/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that [[sexual harassment]] remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

=== Representation ===
The 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]] made a comparison across 20 years of women's representation in the media and assessed that between 1995 (17 percent) and 2015 (24 percent), female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sarah Macharia highlights the fact that where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[Spokesperson|spokespersons]] and 19 per cent of [[Expert|experts]] featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in [[North America]], followed by the [[Caribbean]] (29 per cent) and [[Latin America]] (27 per cent). In the [[Southern Africa|southern African]] region, Gender Links’ 2016 Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women’s views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The picture of women in media ===

* Women have won only a quarter of [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer prizes]] for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the [[Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/women-foreign-correspondents/472596/|title=Why Don't Female Journalists Win More Awards?|first=Christina|last=Asquith|date=7 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the [[African Development Bank]] began sponsoring a category for [[Women's rights|Women’s Rights]] in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by [[One World Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/african-development-bank-promotes-gender-equality-in-the-media-through-womens-rights-in-africa-award-14447/|title=African Development Bank promotes gender equality in the media through 'Women's Rights in Africa' Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15467">'''Not In Our Town''' is a project that uses documentary film, new media, and organizing to stop hate, address bullying, and build safe, inclusive communities. Not In Our Town is the primary program of The Working Group, an [[Oakland, California]]-based nonprofit media production company founded in 1988.

==Original story==

The Not In Our Town project began in 1995 with a national [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] special that told the story of how citizens of [[Billings, Montana]] joined forces to respond to hate crimes in their town. The program set a new standard for television impact, launching screenings and town hall meetings in hundreds of communities nationwide. The first campaign mobilized faith-based organizations, non-profits, law enforcement agencies, educators, public TV stations, labor representatives and many other stakeholders to organize anti-hate actions in local communities.

==Subsequent projects==
The project laid the groundwork for many subsequent films. For the past 20 years, Not In Our Town has documented hundreds of community response and proactive efforts to prevent hate and address intolerance. In addition to film making, Not In Our Town plays a direct role with schools and communities by providing hands-on support, tools, training, and coaching.

The original Not In Our Town website was hosted by PBS. In 2010, Not In Our Town expanded online offerings at [http://www.NIOT.org NIOT.org], including over 100 short community films, crowd-sourced lessons from local communities, tools and resources, as well as an interactive map. The site is also the digital home of Not In Our School, which has more than 50 streaming school films. Many of the films have guides and lesson plans that are aligned to the Common Core State Standards. NIOT.org also features a portal for law enforcement at [http://www.NIOT.org/COPS NIOT.org/COPS].

PBS and public media stations for key partners for Not In Our Town. Not In Our Town has collaborated with other organizations, including the U.S. Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), the National Parent Teacher Association and Facing History and Ourselves. Their work is used overseas in Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, South Africa, and Northern Ireland.

==PBS Films &amp; Public Television Campaigns==

Over the past two decades, Not In Our Town produced five [[PBS]] documentaries, held thousands of community screenings nationwide. In an engagement effort sponsored by PBS and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], Light In the Darkness involved partnerships with 17 public media stations, nearly 20 national organizations and more than 300 community screenings nationwide. Public media stations created local content and Not In Our School resources around the film, including [[WDET]], [[WEDQ|WUSF-TV]] Tampa, [[KQED]] San Francisco, [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] Pittsburgh, [[KCPT]] Kansas City, Cleveland [[Ideastream]], [[NPR]], [[Nashville Public Television]], and [[KPBS (TV)|KPBS]] San Diego of the [[Fronteras]] network.

PBS and public television films, in reverse chronological order:

[http://www.niot.org/cops/wakinginoakcreek ‘’Waking in Oak Creek’’] (2014) follows residents in [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin]] after six [[Sikh]] worshippers are killed by a white supremacist and the local community finds inspiration in the Sikh tradition of forgiveness and faith. Lt. Brian Murphy, shot 15 times in the attack, joins the mayor and police chief as they forge new bonds with the Sikh community. Young temple members, still grieving, emerge as leaders in the quest to end the violence. In the year following the tragedy, thousands gather for vigils and community events to honor the victims and seek connection. Together, a community rocked by hate is awakened and transformed by the Sikh spirit of relentless optimism.

[http://video.pbs.org/video/2196486631/ ‘’Not In Our Town: Class Actions’’] (2012, 30 min) profiles students and community members who are creating change in the wake of racism, anti-Semitism, and the traumatic consequences of bullying. [[University of Mississippi]] students peacefully confront old divisions and the Ku Klux Klan by turning their backs on hate, hundreds gather on the [[Indiana University]] campus to light menorah candles after anti-Semitic attacks on campus, and a massive circle of Southern California high school students break the silence about bullying at school with a loud and united chant, "Not In Our Town."

[http://video.pbs.org/program/not-our-town-light-darkness/ ‘’Not In Our Town: Light in the Darkness’’] (2011, 60 min and 27 min versions), follows a community in crisis after the fatal attack of local immigrant resident Marcelo Lucero in [[Patchogue, New York]]. Stunned by the violence, diverse community stakeholders openly confront the crime and the divisive 
atmosphere, and commit to ongoing actions to prevent future hate crimes and intolerance.

[http://www.niot.org/niot-video/not-our-town-northern-california ‘’Not In Our Town Northern California: When Hate Happens Here’’] (2005, 60 min), a co-production with [KQED], looks at five Northern California communities dealing with deadly hate violence over a five-year period. Together, the stories reveal that whether the motivation is racism, anti-Semitism, or crimes motivated by gender or sexual orientation, hate requires a joint response. Californians find innovative ways to respond to hate and build community.

Not In Our Town II (1996, 60 min) briefly recaps the Billings story and tells six new stories about people working to create hate-free towns, cities, workplaces and schools. A Klan rally is countered with a diversity celebration; citizens work with police to address hate crimes; young people discuss how hate crimes affect their lives; office workers discover that improved communication skills can ease racial tensions and create a more harmonious workplace; people come together to rebuild burnt churches in the South; and a town finds that preventing hate before it starts is the best solution.

[http://www.niot.org/niot-video/not-our-town-billings-montana-0 ‘’Not In Our Town’’] I (1995, 30 min) is the film that launched the movement. Not In Our Town follows the citizens of [[Billings, Montana]] as they join together to respond to a series of hate crimes in their town. White supremacist activities had been on the rise. Racist literature was found around town, skinheads disrupted the services of an African-American church, the home of a Native American family was spray painted with swastikas and racist slurs, and a brick was thrown through the window of a Jewish family's home. The film follows a powerful local force—law enforcement, civic leaders, faith groups, citizen activists and local media outlets—that sent a simple and powerful message to white supremacists, "Not In Our Town." after the film was broadcast in 1995, viewers around the country began to apply this model to their own communities.

Minister and musician [[Fred Small (singer-songwriter)|Fred Small]] wrote a song of the same name, published in 1994, telling the same story in a different format. Psychotherapist [[Janice Cohn]] wrote a book, [[Christmas Menorahs]], and play, [[Paper Candles]], detailing the Billings story.

==The Not In Our Town Model &amp; Community Campaigns==

Many communities use Not In Our Town campaigns to bring together stakeholders from different aspects of civic life—school, community, law enforcement, media and faith leaders—to address or prevent hate incidents. [[Bloomington, Illinois]] was the first Not In Our Town city. Many other cities have passed Not In Our Town proclamations and pledges and sponsored Not In Our Town days or weeks in order to raise the issue of hate and create safe environments for their citizens, including [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[San Francisco, California]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  In 2012, [[Marshalltown, Iowa]] launched a [http://www.timesrepublican.com/page/category.detail/nav/5165/Not-In-Our-Town.html proactive Not In Our Town Anti-Bullying Campaign].

The model rests on several core assumptions, namely that cross-constituency engagement gives everyone a voice and leads to great inclusion; bystander behavior must be addressed and that any single person can become an "upstander" to support victims; and that positive stories can offer solutions and help shift community norms.

To help equip communities, the project provides specific films, resources and training for these key stakeholders. Not In Our Town serves educators and parents through the Not In Our School program and law enforcement—including police chiefs and prosecuting attorneys—through a collaboration with the [[U.S. Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office)]].

==Not In Our School==

Not In Our School grew from the lessons of Not In Our Town. An initial campaign was launched by a middle school teacher in [[Auburn, Maine]] in 1996. A hallmark of Not In Our School campaigns is that students are supported in defining the problems and identifying solutions. These solutions incorporate peer-to-peer actions to make schools safe and help bystanders gather the courage to become upstanders.

Many innovative Not In Our School ideas were piloted in the [[Palo Alto Unified School District]] in [[Palo Alto, California]] starting in 2005. Today, Not In Our School supports efforts that not only address bullying, but all forms of intolerance. The program combines film, resources and coaching that help educators develop student-led programs that create safe and inclusive schools.

[[Lancaster, California]], [[Marshalltown, Iowa]] and [[Paducah, Kentucky]], among others, have launched citywide anti-bullying programs under the Not In Our School banner. [[Facing History and Ourselves]] co-authored curriculum on five Not In Our School films. The [[Bully (2011 film)|BULLY]] DVD [http://shop.thebullyproject.com/products/educators-dvd-and-toolkit Educator Toolkit] features several Not In Our School films and materials.

The Not In Our School short film, [http://www.niot.org/niot-video/gunn-high-school-sings-away-hate-group “Gunn High School Sings Away the Hate]," spread across the internet after it was tweeted by celebrity [[Ellen DeGeneres]]. More than 50 short school films are available online including "[http://www.niot.org/nios-video/students-map-bully-zones-create-safer-school Students Map Bully Zones to Create a Safer School]," "[http://www.niot.org/nios-video/students-take-cyberbullying Students Take on Cyberbullying]," "[http://www.niot.org/nios-video/lancaster-ca-city-unites-end-school-bullying Lancaster, CA: A City Unites to End School Bullying]," and "[http://www.niot.org/nios-video/new-immigrants-share-their-stories. New Immigrants Share Their Stories]."

==Not On Our Campus==

Like Not In Our School, the original Not In Our Town story sparked a number of college campus campaigns. [[Scottsdale Community College]] in Arizona took a Not On Our Campus pledge, [[UC Santa Barbara]] created a Not In Our Hall campaign and guide for resident assistants, and [[Bowling Green State University]] as well as [[Skidmore College]] created Not On Our Campus pledge cards.

Not On Our Campus films also feature [http://www.niot.org/project/notonourcampus efforts] at the [[University of Mississippi]], [[University of San Diego]] and [[Indiana University]].

==International Work==

The Not In Our Town project has sparked anti-intolerance activity in hundreds of communities in the United States and in other countries including [[South Africa]], [[Ireland]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Ukraine]]. Women groups through [[Project Kesher]] started 20 Not In Our Town campaigns across the former Soviet Union starting in 2011. Not In Our Town was introduced in three cities in [[Hungary]] in Spring 2013, and was presented to six U.S. Embassies in Central Europe by the [[State Department]]. In Fall 2013, concerned Hungarian citizens launched [Nalunknem.org Nalunknem.org], modeled after NIOT.org.

[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Stirner by philosophical rival [[Friedrich Engels]]]]
The '''philosophy of Max Stirner''' is credited as a major influence in the development of [[individualism]], [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]] (especially of [[egoist anarchism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[postanarchism]] and [[post-left anarchy]]). [[Max Stirner]]'s main philosophical work was ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, or more accurately ''The Individual and his Property''). Stirner's philosophy has been cited as an influence on both his contemporaries, most notably [[Karl Marx]] (who was strongly opposed to Stirner's views)&lt;ref&gt;Marx reacted to Stirner with a voluminous polemics ''Saint Max'', that he never published; cf. [http://question-everything.mahost.org/Archive/MarxAndStirner.doc Nicholas Lobkowicz: ''Karl Marx and Max Stirner.''] In: Frederick J. Adelmann (ed.): ''Demythologizing Marxism: A Series Of Studies On Marxism''. Boston: Boston College Chestnut Hill 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subsequent thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;The possible influence on Nietzsche was a heavily disputed topic around 1900 and recently again. For a summary and a fresh view, see [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html ''Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's Initial Crisis''] (2002); [[#See also|See also]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico Arrigoni]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Albert Camus]]&lt;ref name="camus"&gt;"[[Albert Camus]] devotes a section of ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' to Stirner". [http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/egomax.htm "The Egoism of Max Stirner"] by Sidney Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Newman]].

== Thought ==
=== The self ===
Stirner argues that the concept of the self is something impossible to fully comprehend; a so-called "creative nothing" he described as an "end-point of language": {{quotation|The Unique One is the straightforward, sincere, plain-phrase. It is the end point of our phrase world, of this world in whose "beginning was the Word."|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

In order to understand this creative nothing, Stirner uses poetry and vivid imagery. The creative nothing by its dialectical shortcomings creates the need for a description, for meaning: {{quotation|What Stirner says is a word, a thought, a concept; what he means is no word, no thought, no concept. What he says is not what is meant, and what he means is unsayable.|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

Stirner elaborated this attempt to describe the indescribable in the essay ''Stirner's Critics'', written by Stirner in response to Feuerbach and others (in custom with the time, he refers to himself in the third person): {{quotation|Stirner speaks of the Unique and says immediately: Names name you not. He articulates the word, so long as he calls it the Unique, but adds nonetheless that the Unique is only a name. He thus means something different from what he says, as perhaps someone who calls you Ludwig does not mean a Ludwig in general, but means You, for which he has no word. [...] It is the end point of our phrase world, of this world in whose "beginning was the Word."|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

''The Ego and Its Own'' opens and closes with a quotation from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] that reads "I have taken up my cause without foundation", with the unstated next line of the poem being "and all the world is mine". One of Stirner's central ideas is that in realizing the self is "nothing" one is said to "own the world" because—as the book states in its last line—"all things are nothing to me" [''Ibidem'', p.&amp;nbsp;324]: {{quotation|By bringing the essence into prominence one degrades the hitherto misapprehended appearance to a bare semblance, a deception. The essence of the world, so attractive and splendid, is for him who looks to the bottom of it—emptiness; emptiness is—world's essence (world's doings).|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 40}}
{{quotation|[F]or 'being' is abstraction, as is even 'the I'. Only I am not abstraction alone: I am all in all, consequently, even abstraction or nothing: I am all and nothing; I am not a mere thought, but at the same time I am full of thoughts, a thought-world.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 300}}
{{quotation|I say: liberate yourself as far as you can, and you have done your part; for it is not given to every one to break through all limits, or, more expressively, not to everyone is that a limit which is a limit for the rest. Consequently, do not tire yourself with toiling at the limits of others; enough if you tear down yours. [...] He who overturns one of his limits may have shown others the way and the means; the overturning of their limits remains their affair.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 127}}

Stirner describes this world view in brief as "enjoyment" and claims that the "nothingness" of the non-self is "unutterable" (p.&amp;nbsp;314) or "unnameable" (p.&amp;nbsp;132), "unspeakable" yet "a mere word" (p.&amp;nbsp;164; cf. Stirner's comments on the skeptic concepts ataraxia and aphasia, p.&amp;nbsp;26).

=== Egoism ===
Stirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both [[psychological egoism]] and [[ethical egoism]], although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any "ought" could be seen as a new "fixed idea". Therefore, he may be understood as a [[rational egoist]] in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self-interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Further, rationality as an end in and of itself is another fixed idea.

Individual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be 'possessed' by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: {{quotation|Sacred things exist only for the egoist who does not acknowledge himself, the ''involuntary egoist'' [...] in short, for the egoist who would like not to be an egoist, and abases himself (combats his egoism), but at the same time abases himself only for the sake of "being exalted", and therefore of gratifying his egoism. Because he would like to cease to be an egoist, he looks about in heaven and earth for higher beings to serve and sacrifice himself to; but, however much he shakes and disciplines himself, in the end he does all for his own sake [...]. On this account I call him the involuntary egoist.

[...] As you are each instant, you are your own creature in this very 'creature' you do not wish to lose yourself, the creator. You are yourself a higher being than you are, and surpass yourself [...] just this, as an involuntary egoist, you fail to recognize; and therefore the 'higher essence' is to you—an alien essence. [...] Alienness is a criterion of the "sacred" [''Ibidem'', Cambridge edition, pp. 37–38].}}

The contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as [[law]], [[Rights|right]], [[morality]], [[religion]] and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts and not to be obeyed can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own "creature" (in the sense of 'creation') and one's own "creator" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism. It is the only justified method of gaining '[[property]]'. Even [[love]] is explained as "consciously egoistic": {{quotation|[L]ove cuts no better figure than any other passion [if] I obey [it] blindly. The ambitious man, who is carried away by ambition [...] has let this passion grow up into a despot against whom he abandons all power of dissolution; he has given up himself because he cannot ''dissolve'' himself, and consequently cannot absolve himself from the passion: he is possessed.

I love men too—not merely individuals, but every one. But I love them with the consciousness of my egoism; I love them because love makes ''me'' happy, I love because loving is natural to me, it pleases me. I know no 'commandment of love'. I have a ''fellow-feeling'' with every feeling being, and their torment torments, their refreshment refreshes me too [''Ibidem'', p. 258].}}

However, Stirner cautioned against any [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of the egoist or subject: {{quotation|The egoist, before whom the humane shudder, is a spook as much as the devil is: he exists only as a bogie and phantasm in their brain. If they were not unsophisticatedly drifting back and forth in the antediluvian opposition of good and evil, to which they have given the modern names of "human" and "egoistic," they would not have freshened up the hoary "sinner" into an "egoist" either, and put a new patch on an old garment [Second Part: The Owner: 3 – My Self Enjoyment].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/enee.html#secondii3 ''Max Stirner - The Ego and Its Own''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Anarchism ===
{{main|Egoist anarchism|Individualist anarchism in Europe}}
Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions&amp;mdash;including the notion of state, property as a right, [[natural rights]] in general and the very notion of society&amp;mdash;were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society that "the individuals are its reality". Stirner wants to "abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members".&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocated egoism and a form of [[amoralism]] in which individuals would unite in "[[Union of egoists]]" only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"&gt;Stirner, Max. ''The Ego and Its Own''. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;—that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity: "The conquerors form a society which one may imagine so great that it by degrees embraces all humanity; but so-called humanity too is as such only a thought (spook); the individuals are its reality" (''The Ego and Its Own'', Tucker ed., p.&amp;nbsp;329).

Stirner never referred to markets and his philosophy on property causes problems for a market system because—according to proponents of markets—property is not considered to be legitimate if taken by force. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. He said in ''The Ego and Its Own'': {{quotation|All attempts to enact rational laws about property have put out from the bay of ''love'' into a desolate sea of regulations. Even Socialism and Communism cannot be excepted from this. Everyone one is to be provided with adequate means, for which it is little to the point whether one socialistically finds them still in a personal property, or communistically draws them from a [[Common ownership|community of goods]]. The individual's mind in this remains the same; it remains a mind of dependence. The distributing ''board of equity'' lets me have only what the sense of equity, its ''loving'' care for all, prescribes. For me, the individual, there lies no less of a check in collective wealth than in that of ''individual others''; neither that is mind, nor this: whether the wealth belongs to the collectivity, which confers part of it on me, or to individual possessors, is for me the same constraint, as I cannot decide about either of the two. One the Contrary, Communism, by the abolition of all personal property, only presses me back still more into dependence on another, ''viz.'', on the generality or collectivity; and, loudly as it always attacks the "State," what it intends is itself again a State, a ''status'', a condition hindering my free movement, a sovereign power over me. Communism rightly revolts against the pressure I experience from individual proprietors; but still more horrible is the might that it puts in the hands of the collectivity. Egoism takes another way to root out the non-possessing rabble. It does not say: Wait for what the board of equity will—bestow on you in the name of the collectivity (for such bestowal took place in "States" from the most ancient times, each receiving "according to his desert," and therefore according to the measure in which each was able to ''deserve'' it, to acquire it by ''service''), but: Take hold, and take what you require! With this the war of all against all is declared. ''I'' alone decide what I will have.&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. ''The Ego and Its Own''. Rebel Press. 1982. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Property ====
Stirner has a concept of "egoistic property" in which he is referring to the absence of moral restrictions on how the individual uses everything in the world, including other people.&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"/&gt; For Stirner, property come about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"/&gt; This position on property is much different from the then prevalent form of individualist anarchism, which defended the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labour.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. 1997. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[American individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] rejected the [[natural rights]] philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. Since he was a radical anarchist, he preferred a political-economic social condition that was anti-statist, anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian completely void of authoritarian monopolies (whether they positioned themselves as property or sovereignty) which were the enemies of individual liberation. Stirner's egoist anarchism is all about freeing the individual from the domination of property monopolists such as monarchs, governments, or industrialists while at the same time it positions itself against the anti-individualist nature of the traditional political left. Stirner had no concrete dogma on the issue of property and simply urged individuals to stop being ruled by others regardless of the authorities' moral claims about political sovereignty or property rights.

==== Union of egoists ====
{{main|Union of egoists}}
Stirner's idea of the "Union of egoists" was first expounded in ''The Ego and Its Own''. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Paul|title=Karl Marx and the Anarchists|publisher=[[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]]|location=London|year=1985|isbn=0-7102-0685-2|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name=nonserviam&gt;{{citation|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|title=The union of egoists|journal=Non Serviam|volume=1|first=Svein Olav|last=Nyberg|pages=13–14|location=Oslo, Norway|publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg|oclc=47758413|accessdate=1 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|archivedate=7 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union requires that all parties participate out of a [[Selfishness|conscious egoism]]. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else.&lt;ref name=nonserviam/&gt; This Union is not seen as an [[authority]] above a person's own will.

==== Revolution ====
Stirner criticizes conventional notions of [[revolution]], arguing that [[social movement]]s aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter. To illustrate this argument, he compares his own social and moral role with that of [[Jesus Christ]]: {{quotation|The time [in which Jesus lived] was politically so agitated that, as is said in the gospels, people thought they could not accuse the founder of Christianity more successfully than if they arraigned him for 'political intrigue', and yet the same gospels report that he was precisely the one who took the least part in these political doings.  But why was he not a revolutionary, not a demagogue, as the Jews would gladly have seen him? [...] Because he expected no salvation from a change of conditions, and this whole business was indifferent to him.  He was not a revolutionary, like Caesar, but an insurgent: not a state-overturner, but one who straightened himself up. [...] [Jesus] was not carrying on any liberal or political fight against the established authorities, but wanted to walk his own way, untroubled about, and undisturbed by, these authorities. [...] But, even though not a ringleader of popular mutiny, not a demagogue or revolutionary, he (and every one of the ancient Christians) was so much the more an insurgent who lifted himself above everything that seemed so sublime to the government and its opponents, and absolved himself from everything that they remained bound to [...]; precisely because he put from him the upsetting of the established, he was its deadly enemy and real annihilator[.]|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', pp. 280–281}}

As Stirner specifies in a footnote (p.&amp;nbsp;280), he was here using the word [[Insurgency|insurgent]] "in its [[etymological]] sense", therefore to rise above the religion and government of one's own times and to take control of one's life with no consideration of them, but not necessarily to overthrow them. This contrasts with the method of the revolutionary who brings about a change of conditions by displacing one government with another: {{quotation|The revolution aimed at new arrangements; insurrection leads us no longer to let ourselves be arranged, but to arrange ourselves, and sets no glittering hopes on 'institutions'.  It is not a fight against the established [...] it is only a working forth of me out of the established. [...] Now, as my object is not an overthrow of the established order but my elevation above it, my purpose and deed are not political or social but (as directed toward myself and my ownness alone) an egoistic purpose indeed.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 280}}

Stirner was writing about people liberating themselves from their own limits and rising above limiting social, political and ideological conditions and for each to walk their own way. The passages quoted above are clearly incompatible with David Leopold's conclusion (in his introduction to the [[Cambridge University Press]] edition) that Stirner "saw humankind as 'fretted in dark superstition' but denied that he sought their enlightenment and welfare" (''Ibidem'', p. xxxii). Stirner refused to describe himself as directly liberating others, but his stated purpose in these quotations seems to be to achieve the "enlightenment and welfare" of others by way of demonstration and "[[insurrection]]" as he defines it.

=== Dogma ===
The passages quoted above show the few points of contact between Stirner's philosophy and [[early Christianity]]. It is merely Jesus as an "annihilator" of the established biases and preconceptions of Rome that Stirner can relate to. His reason for "citing" the cultural change sparked by Jesus is that he wants the Christian ideologies of 19th century Europe to collapse, much as the ideology of heathen Rome did before it (e.g. "[the Christian era] will end with the casting off of the ideal, with 'contempt for the spirit'", p.&amp;nbsp;320). As with the [[Skepticism|classical skeptics]] before him, Stirner's method of self-liberation is opposed to faith or belief and he envisions a life free from "dogmatic presuppositions" (p.&amp;nbsp;135, 309) or any "fixed standpoint" (p.&amp;nbsp;295). It is not merely Christian [[dogma]] that his thought repudiates, but also a wide variety of European atheist ideologies that are condemned as [[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christian]] for putting ideas in an equivalent role: {{quotation|Among many transformations, the Holy Spirit became in time the 'absolute idea' [in Hegelian philosophy], which again in manifold refractions split into the different ideas of philanthropy, reasonableness, civic virtue, and so on. [...] Antiquity, at its close, had gained its ownership of the world only when it had broken the world's overpoweringness and 'divinity', recognised the world's powerlessness and 'vanity'. [...] [The philosophers of our time say] Concepts are to decide everywhere, concepts to regulate life, concepts to rule.  This is the religious world [of our time], to which Hegel gave a systematic expression, bringing method into the nonsense and completing the conceptual precepts into a rounded, firmly-based dogmatic.  Everything is sung according to concepts and the real man, I, am compelled to live according to these conceptual laws. [...] [[Liberalism]] simply replaced [[Christian]] concepts with [[Humanism|humanist]] ones; human instead of divine, political instead of ecclesiastical, 'scientific' instead of doctrinal etc.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', pp. 87–88}}
{{quotation|The thinker is distinguished from the believer only by believing much more than the latter, who, on his part, thinks of much less as signified by his faith (creed). The thinker has a thousand tenets of faith where the believer gets along with few; but the former brings coherence into his tenets, and take the coherence in turn for the scale to estimate their worth by. p. 304}}

What Stirner proposes is not that concepts should rule people, but that people should rule concepts. The "nothingness" of all truth is rooted in the "nothingness" of the self because the ego is the criterion of (dogmatic) truth. Again, Stirner seems closely comparable to the skeptics in that his radical [[epistemology]] directs us to emphasise [[empirical]] experience (the "unmediated" relationship of mind as world and world as mind), but it leaves only a very limited validity to the category of "truth". When we regard the impressions of the senses with detachment, simply for what they are (e.g. neither good nor evil), we may still correctly assign truth to them: {{quotation|Christianity took away from the things of this world only their irresistibleness [...]. In like manner I raise myself above truths and their power: as I am above the sensual, so I am above the truth.  Before me truths are as common and as indifferent as things; they do not carry me away, and do not inspire me with enthusiasm.  There exists not even one truth, not right, not freedom, humanity, etc., that has stability before me, and to which I subject myself. [...] In words and truths [...] there is no salvation for me, as little as there is for the Christian in things and vanities.  As the riches of this world do not make me happy, so neither do its truths. [...] Along with worldly goods, all sacred goods too must be put away as no longer valuable. (p. 307)}}
{{quotation|Truths are material, like vegetables and weeds; as to whether vegetable or weed, the decision lies in me. (p. 313)}}

In place of such systems of beliefs, Stirner presents a detached life of non-dogmatic, open-minded engagement with the world "as it is" (unpolluted by "faith" of any kind, Christian or humanist), coupled with the awareness that there is no soul, no personal essence of any kind, but that the individual's uniqueness consists solely in its "creative nothingness" prior to all concepts.

== Hegel's possible influence ==
Scholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was a major influence on ''The Ego and Its Own''. While the latter has an "un-Hegelian structure and tone" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated "untrue knowledge" and become "absolute knowledge". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stepelevich|first1=Lawrence S.|title=Max Stirner as Hegelian|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=46|issue=4|pages=597–614|date=1985|doi=10.2307/2709548|issn=0022-5037|jstor=2709548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Widukind De Ridder has argued that scholars who take Stirner's references to Hegel and the [[Young Hegelians]] as expressions of his own alleged [[Hegelianism]] are highly mistaken. De Ridder argues that ''The Ego and Its Own'' is in part a carefully constructed parody of Hegelianism, deliberately exposing its outwornness as a system of thought; and that Stirner's notions of "ownness" and "egoism" were part of his radical criticism of the implicit teleology of Hegelian dialectics.&lt;ref&gt;De Ridder, Widukind, "Max Stirner, Hegel and the Young Hegelians: A reassessment". In: History of European Ideas, 2008, 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Stirner was a philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref  name="SEP"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/max-stirner/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for Max Stirner].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, his ''The Ego and Its Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' which may literally be translated as ''The Unique Individual and His Property'')&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; was published and it is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5431">'''''Power politics''''' is a book by [[International Relations]] scholar [[Martin Wight]], first published in 1946 as a 68-page essay.  After 1959 Wight added twelve further chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hall]], ''The International Thought of Martin Wight, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Other works of Wight's were added by his former students, [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Carsten Holbraad]], and a combined volume was published in 1978, six years after Wight's death.  The book provides an overview of international politics featuring many elements of ''[[Realpolitik]]'' analysis.

==Religion==
Wight, a pacifist and devout Christian, was appalled by [[World War II]]. He favoured a revival of the biblical term [[Antichrist]] to describe recurrent warlike situations in history - Antichrist in this context meaning a "demonic concentration of power" rather than a person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hall]], ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter one he observes that the modern state has become "the ultimate loyalty for which men will fight. The mediaeval world of 'rights and wrongs' has been replaced by a modern one of 'powers, forces, dynasties and ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power Politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Wight begins: "Power politics is a colloquial phrase for international politics."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that states exploit power to achieve expansion and dominance; "every dominant power aspires... to become a universal empire."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  For diplomatic reasons, "dominant powers" are euphemized as "Great Powers ... who wish to monopolise (sic) the right to create international conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Powers win and lose their status through violence, and are defined by their ability to wage war; they are decreasing in number, but those remaining are increasing in size.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that War and revolution go together:  communism provoked fascist and Nazi responses; and both ideologies were led by "gangsters" seeking to rule the world.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  To suppose that revolutionary ideologies have now been discarded is to show ignorance of human nature, says Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wight, though states are few in number, they are widely diverse and atypical in character.  States are more or less immortal,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore unindictable in law.  International law is weak, unclear, decentralized, unpoliced, and therefore unenforceable; there is no sovereign power above states.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, pp. 110-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, he concludes "domestically, power is constrained by law; but internationally, law is governed and constrained by the struggle for power ... There is no international society, only "international anarchy". International politics is really "power politics", and the causes of war are inherent therein".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, pp. 102-5.&lt;/ref&gt; And, furthermore, '"diplomacy is a 'European invention imposed on the world,'"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; which "consists in information, negotiation, and communication, but also, covertly, in espionage, subversion and propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, ''Power politics'', Pelican, 1978, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chapters examine alliances, the "balance of power", arms races, disarmament, and the supra-national authority of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].  Wight concludes that "security" is inseparable from moral behavior and cites [[Gladstone]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] as examples of the latter.

==Reputation==
According to [[Charles Manning]], [[Hedley Bull]], [[Sir Michael Howard]], and [[Hans Morgenthau]] Martin Wight is one of the finest international thinkers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Porter]], review of [[Ian Hall]], ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', in ''[[International Affairs]]'', 83:4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; M. Nicholson &lt;ref&gt; 'The enigma of Martin Wight', ''[[Review of International Studies]]'', 1981&lt;/ref&gt; says: "Within the 'English school' of International Relations, the work of Martin Wight is placed in particularly high esteem. More perhaps than anyone else, he is the scholar who did IR as it ought to be done." Reviewing ''Power Politic'', F.P. King calls it a delightful book "to browse through, contemplate, refute and enjoy more than once ... Resplendent history, allusions, wit and reasoning."&lt;ref&gt; F. P. King, "[[The American Historical Review]]", volume 84/3, 1/6/1979, pp. 710-711. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Hall]] has written a detailed resumé of Wight's work:  ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.

A '''Prioritised Petri net''' is a structure (PN, Π) where PN is a [[Petri net|Petri net]] and Π is a priority [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps [[Transition (computer science)|transitions]] into non-negative [[natural number]]s representing their priority level &lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Balbo, "Introduction to Stochastic Petri Nets p.&amp;nbsp;101", Dipartimento di Informatica, Italy&lt;/ref&gt; 

The enabled transitions with a given priority k always fire before any other enabled transition with priority j&lt;k.

{{unsolved|computer science|Prove or disprove the Barendregt–Geuvers–Klop conjecture.}}
In the branches of [[mathematical logic]] known as [[proof theory]] and [[type theory]], a '''pure type system''' ('''PTS'''), previously known as a '''generalized type system''' ('''GTS'''), is a form of [[typed lambda calculus]] that allows an arbitrary number of [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Many-sorted structures|sorts]] and dependencies between any of these. The framework can be seen as a generalisation of [[Henk Barendregt|Barendregt]]'s [[lambda cube]], in the sense that all corners of the cube can be represented as instances of a PTS with just two sorts.&lt;ref name="pierce2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|page= 466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k116&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Fairouz D. | last1 = Kamareddine | first2 = Twan | last2 = Laan | first3 =  Rob P. | last3 = Nederpelt | title = A modern perspective on type theory: from its origins until today | publisher = Springer | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4020-2334-0 | chapter = Section 4c: Pure type systems | page = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Barendregt (1991) framed his cube in this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=H.P. Barendregt |first=H. P. |last=Barendregt |url= http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/henglein/papers/barendregt1991.pdf |title=Introduction to generalized type systems |journal=Journal of Functional Programming |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=125–154 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure type systems may obscure the distinction between ''types'' and ''terms'' and collapse the [[type hierarchy]], as is the case with the [[calculus of constructions]], but this is not generally the case, e.g. the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] allows only terms to depend on terms.

Pure type systems were independently introduced by Stefano Berardi (1988) and Jan Terlouw (1989).&lt;ref name="pierce2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=k116/&gt; Barendregt discussed them at length in his subsequent papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=S. Abramsky, D. Gabbay and T. Maibaum|author=H.

A modification of this cube was later called the L-cube by Geuvers, who in his PhD thesis extended the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] to this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | first = H. | last = Geuvers | title = Logics and Type Systems | citeseerx = 10.1.1.56.7045 | degree = PhD | publisher = University of Nijmegen | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these ideas, Barthe and others defined '''classical pure type systems''' ('''CPTS''') by adding a [[double negation]] operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. Barthe|author2=J. Hatcliff |author3=M. H. Sørensen |title=A Notion of Classical Pure Type System|citeseerx = 10.1.1.32.1371|journal=Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|volume=6|year=1997|pages=4–59|doi=10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;    	
Similarly, in 1998, Tijn Borghuis introduced '''modal pure type systems''' ('''MPTS''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tijn |last=Borghuis |title=Modal Pure Type Systems |journal=Journal of Logic, Language and Information |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=265–296 |doi=10.1023/A:1008254612284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roorda has discussed the application of pure type systems to functional programming; and Roorda and Jeuring have proposed a programming language based on pure type systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.cs.uu.nl/johanj/MSc/jwroorda/|author=Jan-Willem Roorda|author2=Johan Jeuring |title=Pure Type Systems for Functional Programming}}  Roorda's masters' thesis (linked from the cited page) also contains a general introduction to pure type systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

The systems from the lambda cube are all known to be [[strongly normalizing]]. Pure type systems in general need not be, for example [[System U]] from '''Girard's paradox'''&lt;!-- "Girard's paradox" redirects to this page --&gt; is not. (Roughly speaking, [[Jean-Yves Girard|Girard]] found pure systems in which one can express the sentence "the types form a type".) Furthermore, all known examples of pure type systems that are not strongly normalizing are not even (weakly) [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|normalizing]]: they contain expressions that do not have [[normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]]s, just like the untyped lambda calculus{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. It is a major open problem in the field whether this is always the case, i.e. whether a (weakly) normalizing PTS always has the strong normalization property. This is known as the '''Barendregt–Geuvers–Klop conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morten Heine |last=Sørensen |first2=Paweł |last2=Urzyczyn |title=Lectures on the Curry–Howard isomorphism |location= |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=0-444-52077-5 |chapter=Pure type systems and the lambda cube }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|358}} (named after [[Henk Barendregt]], [[Herman Geuvers]], and [[Jan Willem Klop]]).

A reaction wheel is sometimes operated as (and referred to as) a '''momentum wheel''', by operating it at a constant (or near-constant) rotation speed, in order to imbue a satellite with a large amount of stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel's spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion ([[precession]]) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|362}}, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this "momentum-bias" stabilization approach include [[SCISAT-1]]; by orienting the momentum wheel's axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a "pitch momentum bias" configuration.

A [[control moment gyroscope]] (CMG) is a related but different type of attitude actuator, generally consisting of a momentum wheel mounted in a one-axis or two-axis [[gimbal]].&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|362}} When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel using one of the gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft's pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger and/or more-agile spacecraft, including [[Skylab]], [[Mir]], and the [[International Space Station]].

==Theory==
Reaction wheels are used to control the attitude of a satellite without the use of thrusters, which reduces the [[payload fraction|mass fraction]] needed for fuel. 

They work by equipping the spacecraft with an electric motor attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA |url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1997/t3.html |title=Reaction/Momentum Wheel |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see [[torque]]); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft from one place to another (see [[translation (physics)|translational force]]).

== Implementation ==
For three axis control, reaction wheels must be mounted along at least three directions, with extra wheels providing additional redundancy to the attitude control system. A redundant mounting configuration could consist of four wheels along tetrahedral axes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinsatelliten.de/flying_laptop/systeme/lageregelung.en.html|title=Attitude Control|publisher=Universität Stuttgart Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a spare wheel carried in addition to a three axis configuration.&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|369}} Changes in speed (in either direction) are controlled electronically by computer. The strength of the materials used in a reaction wheel determine the speed at which the wheel would come apart, and therefore how much [[angular momentum]] it can store.

Since the reaction wheel is a small fraction of the spacecraft's total mass, easily controlled, temporary changes in its speed result in small changes in angle. The wheels therefore permit very precise changes in a spacecraft's [[attitude control|attitude]]. For this reason, reaction wheels are often used to aim spacecraft carrying cameras or telescopes.

Over time, reaction wheels may build up enough stored momentum to exceed the maximum speed of the wheel, called saturation, which will need to be cancelled. Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms. In the presence of a magnetic field (as in low Earth orbit), a spacecraft can employ [[magnetorquer]]s (better known as torque rods) to transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field.&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|368}} In the absence of a magnetic field, the most efficient practice is to use either high-efficiency attitude jets such as [[ion thruster]]s, or small, lightweight [[solar sail]]s placed in locations away from the spacecraft's center of mass, such as on solar cell arrays or projecting masts.  Most{{dubious|date=June 2018}} spacecraft, however, also need fast pointing, and cannot afford the extra mass of three attitude control systems.  Designers therefore usually use conventional [[monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] [[vernier engine]]s for all these purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Failures and mission impact ==
The failure of one or more reaction wheels can cause a spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain attitude (orientation) and thus potentially cause a mission failure. Recent studies&lt;ref&gt;W. Bialke, E. Hansell "[http://esmats.eu/esmatspapers/pastpapers/pdfs/2017/bialke.pdf A Newly Discovered Branch of the Fault Tree Explaining Systemic Reaction Wheel Failures And Anomalies]", 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; conclude that these failures can be correlated with [[space weather]] effects.

;Hubble: Two servicing missions to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] have replaced a reaction wheel. In February 1997, the Second Servicing Mission ([[STS-82]]) replaced one&lt;ref name="Hubblesite, RW" &gt;{{cite web

The '''red hartebeest''' (''Alcelaphus buselaphus caama'' or ''A. caama'') is a species&lt;ref name="WilsonReeder2005"/&gt; of [[even-toed ungulate]] in the family [[Bovidae]] found in [[Southern Africa]]. More than 130,000 individuals live in the wild. The red [[hartebeest]] is closely related to the [[tsessebe]] and the [[topi]].

''Alcelaphus buselaphus caama'' is a large African [[antelope]] of the family Bovidae, one of ten subspecies;  it is sometimes treated as a separate species, ''A. caama''. Commonly known as the red hartebeest, it is the most colorful hartbeest, with black markings contrasting against its white abdomen and behind. It has a longer face that other subspecies, with complex curving horns joined at the base.&lt;ref name= "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256130/hartebeest hartebeest]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The average weight of a male is about 150&amp;nbsp;kg, and female is 120&amp;nbsp;kg. Their average shoulder height is 135&amp;nbsp;cm, and horns are 60&amp;nbsp;cm long. The life expectancy of a red hartebeest is around 19 years.&lt;ref name="Red Hartebeest 2012"&gt;[http://www.smj-safaris.com/redhartebeest.htm Red Hartebeest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528214156/http://www.smj-safaris.com/redhartebeest.htm |date=28 May 2013 }}. SMJ Safaris. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little [[sexual dimorphism]] is noted between males and females, showing no distinct identifiable physical features, but body size is slightly affected. Horn size, however, expresses more dimorphism between males and females, as males fight and defend themselves for sexual selection. Thus, male skull weight and circumference is slightly greater than that of the female.&lt;ref name= "Dimorphism in hartebeest"&gt;Capellini, I. (2007). "Dimorphism in the hartebeest. Sex, size and gender roles: evolutionary studies of sexual size dimorphism", pp. 124–132, DJ Fairbairn, WU Blanckenhorn &amp; T. Szekely (Eds).&lt;/ref&gt;
Hartebeests have an excellent sense of hearing and smell, although their sense of sight is poor. When alarmed, hartebeests elude confusion before running, by which they can reach a maximum speed of 55&amp;nbsp;km/h. Their evasion tactic is to run in a zigzag pattern, making it difficult for predators to catch them.&lt;ref name="Guide to the: Red Hartebeest"&gt;[http://www.ecotravel.co.za/Guides/Wildlife/Vertebrates/Mammals/Large/Red_Hartebeest.htm A Guide to the: Red Hartebeest – ''Alcelaphus buselaphus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521062448/http://www.ecotravel.co.za/Guides/Wildlife/Vertebrates/Mammals/Large/Red_Hartebeest.htm |date=21 May 2013 }}. EcoTravel.co.za 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
=== Breeding ===
''A. buselaphus'' subspecies have a [[gestation]] period of eight months, and they give birth to single calves. They typically give birth in a seasonal pattern before the summer rain begins. After birth, calves are hidden in dense vegetation before joining a group to increase their chances of survival from predators, since they are weak.&lt;ref name= "Red Hartebeest"&gt;[http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_red_hartebeest.html "Red Hartebeest"]. Kruger National Park.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most females begin breeding after the age of two, and can conceive again 9 or 10 months after giving birth.&lt;ref name="hartebeests"&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/hartebeest.shtml Hartebeest: Alcelaphus buselaphus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522091204/http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/hartebeest.shtml |date=22 May 2013 }}. ThinkQuest. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
Red hartebeests are grass feeders, which is evidenced by their long snouts, which give the advantage of an improved cropping ability to acquire and [[Mastication|masticate]] grasses more efficiently. During the rainy season in southern Africa, the grass species ''[[Andropogon]]'' is in abundance and is the main source of dietary consumption.&lt;ref name= "diet of hartebeests"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schuette, J.|author2=Leslie, D.|author3=Lochmiller, R.|author4=Jenks, J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1998|title= Diets of hartebeests and roan antelopes in Burkina Faso: Support of the long-faced hypothesis|journal= Journal of Mammalogy|volume= 79|issue=2|pages=426–436|jstor=1382973|doi=10.2307/1382973}}&lt;/ref&gt; As grazers, their diets fluctuate seasonally, as they consume higher-quality, green primary production in wet seasons, and lower-quality sheath material in the dry seasons.&lt;ref name= "Ecology of African Grazers"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McNaughton, S. |author2=Georgiadis, N. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.17.110186.000351|title=Ecology of African Grazing and Browsing Mammals|year=1986|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=17|pages=39-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartebeests are considered less water-dependent than most alcelaphines, only needing to drink water when melons and [[tuber]]s are inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Ecology of African Grazers" /&gt;

=== Predators ===
The few carnivores preying on hartebeests in southern Africa include [[lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[cheetah]]s. However, hartebeests are not the primary food source of any of these species, particularly spotted hyenas. Lions only consume hartebeests for about 7% of their diets, hyenas consume hartebeests in 3.5%, cheetahs consume hartebeests in 1.75%, and leopards consume hartebeests in 6.25% of their diets. Lions typically prey on adult males, while both spotted hyenas and leopards tend to prey on young calves. These predatory habits are likely attributed to the difficulty of catching nomadic hartebeests, as well as the better success hyenas and leopards have with catching calves.&lt;ref name= "predators"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mills, M.|year= 1984|title= Prey selection and feeding habits of the large carnivores in the southern Kalahari|doi=10.4102/koedoe.v27i2.586|journal=Koedoe|volume=27|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental threats==
Hunting is always an issue to consider in rural areas, since little enforcement of animal protection laws is possible, or there can be no established regulations at all. Hunting hartebeests for survival is an ancient practice: [[persistence hunting]] in the hottest part of the day was most common, when hunters could catch the animal at its weakest point. Over the past 20 years, however, one of the only places where persistence hunting still occurs is in central Kalahari.&lt;ref name= "Hunting Hartebeests"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liebenberg, L. |year=2006|title= Hunting by modern hunter-gatherer|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026|doi=10.1086/508695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habitat and demographics ==
The red hartebeest is primarily found in [[South Africa|southwestern Africa]]. Southern Africa's dissected topography, geologic diversity, climate oscillations, and mosaic of distinct vegetation types has been the primary means for radiation and diversification amidst hartebeest species, which has led red hartebeests to vary slightly in their capacity to consume the diets they do.&lt;ref name="Ecology of African Grazers" /&gt; Most ungulates in Africa are nomadic, as they are dependent on food sources that become depleted if they stay in one place.  ''A. buselaphus'' lives in herds in open [[plain]]s and [[Shrubland|scrublands]] in the [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n climate.&lt;ref name= "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

== Evolutionary history ==
In the early 1900s, "antelope" was a very broad, ambiguous name given to most hollow-horned ruminants besides oxen, sheep, and goats. Of these antelopes found in Africa, Asia, and Europe, Africa has the most diverse populations of antelopes, with horn lengths ranging from six feet long, to a quarter of an inch.&lt;ref name= "Evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Capellini, I |author2=Gosling, L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Habitat, primary production, and evolution of body size within the hartebeest clade|journal= Biol Journal of Linnean Society|volume= 92|pages= 431–440|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00883.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A. b. caama'', from the family Bovidae, used to be categorized as the subfamily of Bubalinae, but are now classified under the subfamily Alcelaphini.&lt;ref name= "History Antelopes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dollman, G. |year=1936|title= African Antelopes|journal= Journal of the Royal African Society|volume=35|issue=141|pages=1–28|jstor=717166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This youngest of all African bovid subfamilies dates back 5 million years ago, and has exhibited great diversification. The oldest fossil of ''Alcelaphus'' has been dated to 740,000 years ago. Besides ''Alcelaphus'', the three other genera from the Alcelaphini are [[Hirola|''Beatragus'']], [[Wildebeest|''Connochaetes'']], and ''[[Damaliscus]]''.
Over millions of years, the Alcelaphini have diversified to fill certain niches and have spread to different habitats across the continent of Africa. The genus ''Alcelaphus'' is suggested to have evolved and diversified due to climate variability over a range of habitats in the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene era]]. About 500,000 years ago, the Alcelaphini diverged into northern and southern [[clade]]s, while the northern clade diverged once more into eastern and western lineages 400,000 years ago. The species ''Alcelaphus caama'' originated from the southern clade, also including [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest|''lichtensteinii'']], in Namibia. The northern clade comprises the rest of the hartebeest complex.

Diversification of these species has been solely attributed to environmental and habitat changes due to global warming around 250 to 195 thousand years ago, and global cooling 175 to 125 thousand years ago.&lt;ref name= "Environmental Change"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Flagstad, Ø.|author2=Syversten, P.|author3=Stenseth, N.|author4=Jakobsen, K.|last-author-amp=yes|pmid=11321054|jstor=3067612|year=2001|title=Environmental change and rates of evolution: The phylogeographic pattern within the hartebeest complex as related to climatic variation|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=667–77|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1416|pmc=1088655|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}
'''Resentment''' (also called '''ranklement''' or '''bitterness''') is a mixture of [[disappointment]], [[anger]] and [[fear]].&lt;ref&gt;TenHouten, W. D. (2007). ''General Theory of Emotions and Social Life''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises the three basic emotions of [[disgust]], [[sadness]] and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]—the [[perception]] of [[injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SrkxtpsuIZ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Forgiveness and resentment|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] of [[injustice]] becomes less frequent, so too fades [[anger]] and [[fear]], leaving [[disappointment]] as the predominant [[emotion]].{{fact|date=July 2017}} So, to the extent perceived [[disgust]] and [[sadness]] remain, the level of [[disappointment]] also remains.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Resentment can be triggered by an emotionally disturbing experience felt again or relived in the mind.{{fact|date=July 2017}} When the person feeling resentment is directing the emotion at himself or herself, it appears as [[remorse]].

[[Robert C. Solomon]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], places resentment on the same continuum as anger and [[contempt]], and he argues that the differences between the three are that resentment is anger directed toward a higher-[[Social status|status]] individual; [[anger]] is directed toward an equal-status individual; and [[contempt]] is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon R. C. (1993). ''The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life''. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment is not one of [[Paul Ekman]]'s six [[Emotion#Basic emotions|basic emotions]] ([[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], [[disgust]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]], [[anger]], and [[fear]]). 

The word originates from [[French language|French]] "''ressentir''", re-, intensive prefix, and ''sentir'' "to feel"; from the [[Latin]] "''sentire''". The English word has become synonymous with anger and [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]].

==Quasi-psychology==

===Causes===
Resentment can result from a variety of situations, involving a perceived wrongdoing from an individual, which are often sparked by expressions of [[injustice]] or [[humiliation]]. Common sources of resentment include publicly humiliating incidents such as accepting negative treatment without voicing any protest, an object of regular [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]], [[envy]]/[[jealousy]], feeling used or taken advantage of by others, and having achievements go unrecognized, while others succeed without working as hard. Resentment can also be generated by dyadic interactions, such as emotional rejection or denial by another person, deliberate embarrassment or belittling by another person, or ignorance, putting down, or scorn by another person.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/14691-handling-resentment/|title=Handling Resentment|publisher=Livestrong.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123144425/http://www.livestrong.com/article/14691-handling-resentment/|archivedate=January 23, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
[[File:PSM V36 D703 Pinched and bitter facial expression.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pinched and bitter facial expression]]
Unlike many emotions, resentment does not have physical tags exclusively related to it that telegraph when a person is feeling this emotion. However, physical expressions associated with related emotions such as anger and envy may be exhibited, such as furrowed brows or bared teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oatley |first1=Keith |first2=Dacher |last2=Keltner |first3=Jennifer M. |last3=Jenkins |chapter=Studies of the universality of facial expressions |title=Understanding Emotions |location=Oxford |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2006 |pages=88–90 |isbn=978-1-4051-3103-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment can be self-diagnosed by looking for signs such as the need for [[emotion regulation]], such as faking happiness while with a person to cover true feelings toward him or speaking in a sarcastic or demeaning way to or about the person. It can also be diagnosed through the appearance of [[Emotion|agitation]]- or dejection-related emotions, such as feeling inexplicably [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] or [[despondent]], becoming angry for no apparent reason, or having [[nightmares]] or disturbing daydreams about a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/living/how-to-get-rid-of-resentment/|title=How To Get Rid Of Resentment|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
Resentment is most powerful when it is felt toward someone whom the individual is close to or intimate with. To have an injury resulting in resentful feelings inflicted by a friend or loved one leaves the individual feeling betrayed as well as resentful, and these feelings can have deep effects.&lt;ref name="Murphy, Jeffrey G. pp 503-516"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4975.1982.tb00106.x |title=Forgiveness and Resentment |year=1982 |last1=Murphy |first1=Jeffrie G. |journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=503–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment is an emotionally debilitating condition that, when unresolved, can have a variety of negative results on the person experiencing it, including touchiness or edginess when thinking of the person resented, denial of anger or hatred against this person, and provocation or anger arousal when this person is recognized positively. It can also have more long-term effects, such as the development of a hostile, cynical, sarcastic attitude that may become a barrier against other healthy relationships, lack of personal and emotional growth, difficulty in self-disclosure, trouble trusting others, loss of self-confidence, and overcompensation.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

To further compound these negative effects, resentment often functions in a downward spiral. Resentful feelings cut off communication between the resentful person and the person he or she feels committed the wrong, and can result in future miscommunications and the development of further resentful feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/200806/emotional-abuse-is-your-relationship-headed-there-you-might |title=Emotional Abuse: Is Your Relationship Headed There? You Might be a Lot Closer than You Think! |first=Steven |last=Stosny |magazine=Psychology Today |date=June 2008 |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the consequences they carry, resentful feelings are dangerous to live with and need to be dealt with. Resentment is an obstacle to the restoration of equal moral relations among persons,&lt;ref name="Murphy, Jeffrey G. pp 503-516"/&gt; and must be handled and expunged via introspection and forgiveness.

Psychologist James J. Messina recommends five steps to facing and resolving resentful feelings. (1) Identify the source of the resentful feelings and what it is the person did to evoke these feelings, (2) develop a new way of looking at past, present and future life, including how resentment has affected life and how letting go of resentment can improve the future, (3) write a letter to the source of the resentment, listing offenses and explaining the circumstances, then forgive and let go of the offenses (but do not send the letter), (4) visualize a future without the negative impact of resentment, and (5) if resentful feelings still linger, return to Step 1 and begin again.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

==Comparison with other emotions==
Resentment is considered to be synonymous with anger, spite, and other similar emotions. However, while it may incorporate elements of these emotions, resentment is distinct from them in several ways. Aside from sharing similar facial expressions, resentment and anger differ primarily in the way they are externally expressed. Anger results in aggressive behavior, used to avert or deal with a threat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Zella E. |last2=Gardner |first2=Frank L. |title=Understanding Clinical Anger and Violence: The Anger Avoidance Model |journal=Behavior Modification |date=July 9, 2008 |url=http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/early/2008/07/09/0145445508319282.short |doi=10.1177/0145445508319282 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while resentment occurs once the injury has been dealt and is not expressed as aggressively or as openly.

Resentment and spite also differ primarily in the way they are expressed. Resentment is unique in that it is almost exclusively internalized, where it can do further emotional and psychological damage but does not strongly impact the person resented. By contrast, spite is exclusively externalized, involving vindictive actions against a (perceived or actual) source of wrong. Spiteful actions can stem from resentful feelings, however.

==Academic perspectives==
Philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]] wrote extensively on the emotion of resentment and its negative effects on those who experience it. Solomon describes resentment as the means by which man clings to his self-respect. He wrote that it is in this moment when humanity is at its lowest ebb.

==Modern culture==
The [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] organization cites resentment as the number one offender, and one of the greatest threats to an alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;AA Services. ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book''. Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 4th edition; 2002.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the [[Twelve Steps]] of AA involve identifying and dealing with resentment as part of the path toward recovery, including acknowledging one's own role in resentment and praying for the resentment to be taken away.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazelden.org/web/public/has61016.page{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment can also play a role in racial and ethnic conflicts. Resentment is cited as having infected the structure of social value, and is thus a regular catalyst in conflicts sparked by inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09502389700490151 |title=Danger in the safety zone: Notes on race, resentment, and the discourse of crime, violence and suburban security |year=1997 |last1=McCarthy |first1=Cameron |last2=Rodriguez |first2=Alicia P. |last3=Buendia |first3=Ed |last4=Meacham |first4=Shuaib |last5=David |first5=Stephen |last6=Godina |first6=Heriberto |last7=Supriya |first7=K. E. |last8=Wilson-Brown |first8=Carrie |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=274–95 |oclc=222710414}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be one of the emotions experienced during [[class conflict]], particularly by the oppressed [[social class]].

'''''Roget's Thesaurus''''' is a widely used English-language [[thesaurus]], created in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]] (1779–1869), British [[physician]], [[natural theologian]] and [[lexicographer]]. It was released to the public on 29 April 1852.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Roget's Thesaurus
Werner Hüllen  http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729&lt;/ref&gt; The original edition had 15,000 [[word]]s, and each new [[edition (book)|edition]] has been larger.&lt;ref name=karpeles&gt;[http://www.rain.org/~karpeles/rogetdis.html Roget's Thesaurus] Karcpeles Library&lt;/ref&gt;  Roget was inspired by the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help "those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition [...] this work processes to  hold out a helping hand" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to be Really Well Informed in Minutes: All you need to know about everything that matters from the popular 'Briefing' columns|last=The Week|first=|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-09194-706-4|location=Croydon|pages=74-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karpeles [[Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum|Library Museum]] houses the original manuscript in its collection.&lt;ref name=karpeles/&gt;

The name "Roget" is [[trademark]]ed in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=2055476 Case details for Trade Mark 2055476]&lt;/ref&gt;  By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name "Roget" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a [[Genericized trademark|generic]] thesaurus name.&lt;ref&gt;"The name has become synonymous with the ''Thesaurus'', yet Dr Roget himself is a shadowy figure." Lloyd 1982, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; With it's hegemonic status, it became "a mark of civility". [[J. M. Barrie|J.M. Barrie]] stated "[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Captain Hook]]] is not wholly evil [h]e has a Thesaurus in his cabin" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Indeed, [[Sylvia Plath]] considered it her [[Desert Island Discs|desert island]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;book over the [[Bible]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1982, p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Roget's Thesaurus'' is composed of six primary classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/Roget/contents.html Table of contents]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316070554/http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/Roget/contents.html |date=March 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual "meaning clusters" or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly [[synonyms]], they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept. One of the most general words is chosen to typify the spectrum as its headword, which labels the whole group.

Roget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (see [[Leibniz#Symbolic thought|Leibniz—Symbolic thought]]), itself following a long tradition of [[epistemological]] work starting with [[Aristotle]]. Some of [[Aristotle's Categories]] are included in Roget's first class "abstract relations". 

The book is updated regularly and each edition is heralded as a gauge to contemporary terms; but each edition keeps true to the original classifications established by Roget. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Naturally, it has critics calling it a book for the 'lexically lazy'. [[Simon Winchester]] believes it has allowed a "state of linguistic and intellectual mediocrity". &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whilst Robert McNeil used the Thesaurus to rewrite, satirically for [[The Scotsman]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], the 'nunnery scene': "To vegetate or not to exist, that  is the knotty point. Whether 'tis haughtier in the cerebellum to grin and bear the pea-shooters and harpoons of unmentionable serendipity ..."   thus  highlighting the book's lost art form. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">In [[United States]] law, a '''roving wiretap''' is a [[wiretap]] that follows the surveillance target. For instance, if a target attempts to defeat a regular wiretap by [[burner phone|throwing away a phone]] and acquiring a new one, another surveillance order would usually need to be applied for to tap the new one. A "roving wiretap", once authorised, follows the target rather than a specific phone device, and would give the surveilling body permission to tap second and subsequent phones without applying for new surveillance orders.

In the US, it is allowed under amendments made to Title III of the ''[[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]]'' (the "Wiretap Statute") in 1988 by the ''[[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]]'', and was later expanded by section 604 of the ''[[Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999]]''.&lt;ref name="HR3694"&gt;''[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]''.[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3694enr.txt.pdf H.R. 3694]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Progress"&gt;Fred E.

{{Jainism}}
'''''Saṃsāra''''' ('''transmigration''') in [[Jain philosophy]], refers to the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and [[reincarnation]]s in various realms of existence. {{IAST|[[Saṃsāra]]}} is described as mundane existence, full of suffering and misery and hence is considered undesirable and worth [[renunciation]]. The ''Saṃsāra'' is without any beginning and the [[Jīva (Jainism)|soul]] finds itself in bondage with its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] since the beginning-less time. ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' is the only way to be liberated from ''saṃsāra''.

== Influx of karmas (''asrava'')==
According to the Jain text, [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|(There are two kinds of influx, namely) that of persons with passions, which extends transmigration, and that of persons free from passions, which prevents or shortens it.|''Tattvārthsūtra'' (6-4-81){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=81}}}}

Activities that lead to the influx of karmas (''[[asrava]]'') which extends transmigration are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=81-82}}
*Five senses
*Four passions (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kasāya]]'')
**Anger
**Ego
**Deceit
**Greed
*The non-observance of the five vows
*Non-observance of the twenty-five activities like Righteousness 

;''Saṃsāra bhavanā''

Jain texts prescribe meditation on twelve forms of reflection (''bhāvanā'') for those who wish to stop the above described ''asrava''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=52}} One such reflection is ''Saṃsāra bhavanā''.
It has been described in one of the Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' as:{{quote|Transmigration is the attainment of another birth by the self owing to the ripening of karmas. The five kinds of whirling round have been described already. He, who wanders in the endless cycle of births and deaths, undergoing millions of afflictions in innumerable wombs and families, takes different relationships such as father, brother, son, grandson, etc, or mother, sister, wife, daughter and so on, being propelled by the mechanism of karmas. The master becomes servant and the servant master, just as an actor acts several parts on the stage. To be brief, sometimes one becomes one’s own son. There is no end to the transformations undergone by the self owing to the influence of karmas. Thus to reflect on the nature of mundane existence is contemplation on worldly existence. He who contemplates thus is alarmed at the miseries of transmigration and becomes disgusted with worldly existence. And he who is disgusted with it endeavours to free himself from it.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=246}}}}

[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th century Jain writer in his book ''The Practical Dharma'' wrote:
{{cquote|Endless is the cycle of transmigration; painful is every form of life; there is no happiness in any of the four conditions of existence; devas, human beings, animals and residents of hells are all involved in pain and misery of some kind or other; moksha alone is blissful and free from pain; the wise should, therefore, only aspire for moksha; all other conditions are temporary and painful."{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=52}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16492">{{for|the [[stiffness]] to weight ratio|specific modulus}}
The '''specific strength''' is a material's [[Strength of materials|strength (force per unit area at failure)]] divided by its [[density]].  It is also known as the '''strength-to-weight ratio''' or '''strength/weight ratio'''. In fiber or textile applications, [[Tenacity (textile strength)|tenacity]] is the usual measure of specific strength. The SI unit for specific strength is [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[kilogram|kg]], or [[Newton (unit)|N]]·m/kg, which is [[Dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, though the latter form is rarely used.

Another way to describe specific strength is '''breaking length''', also known as '''self support length''': the maximum length of a vertical column of the material (assuming a fixed cross-section) that could suspend its own weight when supported only at the top. For this measurement, the definition of [[weight]] is the force of [[gravity]] at the Earth's surface ([[standard gravity]], 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) applying to the entire length of the material, not diminishing with height. This usage is more common with certain specialty fiber or textile applications.

The materials with the highest specific strengths are typically fibers such as [[carbon fiber]], [[glass fiber]] and various polymers, and these are frequently used to make [[composite material]]s (e.g.  [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber-epoxy]]). These materials and others such as [[titanium]], [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]] and high strength steel alloys are widely used in [[aerospace]] and other applications where weight savings are worth the higher material cost.

Note that strength and stiffness are distinct. Both are important in design of efficient and safe structures.

==The 'Yuri' and space tethers==
The [[International Space Elevator Consortium]] has proposed the "Yuri" as a name for the SI units describing specific strength.  Specific strength is of fundamental importance in the description of [[space elevator]] cable materials. One Yuri is conceived to be the SI unit for yield stress (or breaking stress) per unit of density of a material under tension.  So, the units for one Yuri are ''Pa m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / kg''.  This unit is equivalent to one [[Newton (unit)|N]] [[meter|m]] / [[kilogram|kg]], which is the breaking/yielding ''force'' per ''linear'' density of the cable under tension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160114223616/http://www.isec.org/images/StrongTetherChallenge/2013/Handbook-ts2013.rev0.pdf Strong Tether Challenge 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isec.org/sec/index.php/about-the-space-elevator/terminology#MegaYuri|title=Terminology|author=Super User|work=isec.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527065913/http://www.isec.org/sec/index.php/about-the-space-elevator/terminology#MegaYuri|archivedate=2012-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A functional [[space elevator]] would require a tether of 30-80 MegaYuri (corresponding to 3100–8200&amp;nbsp;km of breaking length).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keithcu.com/wiki/index.php/Specific_Strength_in_Yuris|title=Specific Strength in Yuris|work=keithcu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental limit on specific strength==
The null [[energy condition]] places a fundamental limit on the specific strength of any material.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012"/&gt; The specific strength is bounded to be no greater than c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ~ {{val|9|e=13}}[[Kilonewton|kN]]·[[Metre|m]]/[[Kilogram|kg]], where c is the [[speed of light]]. This limit is achieved by electric and magnetic field lines, [[QCD string|QCD flux tubes]], and the fundamental strings hypothesized by [[string theory]].

==Tenacity (tensile strength)==

'''Tenacity''' is the customary measure of [[Strength of materials|strength]] of a [[fiber]] or [[yarn]]. In the U.S. it is usually defined as the ultimate (breaking) force of the fiber (in [[gram]]-force units) divided by the [[Units of textile measurement#Denier|denier]].
Because denier is a measure of the linear density, the tenacity works out to be not a measure of force per unit area, but rather a quasi-dimensionless measure analogous to specific strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Polymer Systems |first=Ferdinand |last=Rodriguez |page=282 |publisher=Hemisphere Publishing |location=New York |year=1989 |edition=3rd |isbn=9780891161769 |oclc=19122722}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tenacity of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1 {\rm \, g} \cdot 9.80665 {\rm \, m s^{-2}}}{1 {\rm \, g}/9000 {\rm \, m}}=\frac{9.80665 {\rm \, m s^{-2}}}{1/9000 {\rm \, m}}=9.80665  {\rm \, m s^{-2}} \, 9000 {\rm \, m} = 88259.85  {\rm \, m^2 s^{-2}}=88259.85 {\rm \, Yuri}=88.25985 {\rm \, kYuri} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Structural violence''' is a term commonly ascribed to [[Johan Galtung]], which he introduced in the article "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Vol. 6, No. 3 (1969), pp. 167–191&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a form of violence wherein some [[social structure]] or [[social institution]] may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Institutionalized [[Adultism#Institutional adultism|adultism]], [[ageism]], [[classism]], [[elitism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[nationalism]], [[speciesism]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]] are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.galtung-institut.de/en/home/johan-galtung/ Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iais.org.my/e/index.php/events-sp-1744003054/past-events/517-public-lecture-seeking-peace-from-resolving-conflict-between-buddhists-and-muslims-in-myanmar-and-sri-lanka-by-prof-dr-johan-galtung.html "Seeking Peace from Resolving Conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka" by Prof. Dr. Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an "avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Galtung, "Kulturelle Gewalt" (1993) Vol. 43 ''Der Burger im Staat'' p. 106 in Ho, Kathleen "Structural Violence as a Human Rights Violation" (2007). ''Essex Human Rights Review'' Vol. 4 No. 2 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Because structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including [[domestic violence|family violence]], [[sexual violence|gender violence]], [[hate crime]]s, [[racial violence]], [[police violence]], [[state violence]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = James |last1 = Gilligan |authorlink = James Gilligan |year = 1997 |title = Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic |location =  |publisher = [[Vintage Books]] |isbn = 978-0679779124 |quote = Structural violence is ... the main cause of behavioral violence on a socially and epidemiologically significant scale (from homicide and suicide to war and genocide). The question as to which of the two forms of violence—structural or behavioral—is more important, dangerous, or lethal is moot, for they are inextricably related to each other, as cause to effect. |page = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic'', [[James Gilligan]] defines structural violence as "the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them". Gilligan largely describes these "excess deaths" as "non-natural" and attributes them to the stress, shame, [[discrimination]], and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Sennett and Cobb, who examine the "contest for dignity" in a context of dramatic [[social inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilligan|first1=James|title=Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic|date=1996|publisher=First Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77912-4|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandy X Lee wrote in her article ''Causes and cures VII: Structural violence,'' "It refers to the avoidable limitations society places on groups of people that constrain them from achieving the quality of life that would have otherwise been possible. These limitations could be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature and usually originate in institutions that have authority over particular subjects."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=109–114|quote=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to say that it "directly illustrates a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather than the term being called social injustice or oppression, there is an advocacy for it to be called violence because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by human decisions, rather than just natural causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cause and effects ==
In ''The Sources of Social Power'',&amp;nbsp;Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, "increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Old is Human Brutality?: On the Structural Origins of Violence|journal=Common Knowledge|volume=22|issue=1|last=Malešević|first=Siniša|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=81–104|quote=|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Siniša&amp;nbsp;Malešević&amp;nbsp;elaborates on Mann's argument by saying, "Mann's point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis—an inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, meaning that these structures are both productive and detrimental. In our early history, hunter-gather groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food, but at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences which shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, force fields, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chopra|first=Anayika|year=2014|title=Structural Violence|url=|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Approach &amp; Studies|volume=1| issue =  4|pages=19–23|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this does not only exist for those of the lower class, although the effects are much heavier on them, including the highest rate of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is effected by social power, but these other groups have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the social and economic structure in place today, specifically the division into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior, the death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is about ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural violence==
"Cultural violence" refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Cultural Violence," ''Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Aug., 1990), pp. 291–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural violence makes direct and structural violence look or feel "right", or at least not wrong, according to Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. One mechanism of cultural violence is to change the "moral color" of an act from "red/wrong" to "green/right", or at least to "yellow/acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==International scope==
{{see also|Structural violence in Haiti}}
[[Petra Kelly]] wrote in her first book, ''Fighting for Hope'' (1984):

{{quote|A third of the 2 Billion people in the [[developing countries]] are [[starving]] or suffering from [[malnutrition]]. Twenty-five percent of their children die before their fifth birthday […] Less than 10 per cent of the 15 million children who died this year had been [[vaccinated]] against the six most common and dangerous [[Childhood disease|children's diseases]]. Vaccination costs £3 per child. But not doing so costs us five million lives a year. These are classic examples of ''structural violence''.}}

The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, [[medical anthropologist]] [[Paul Farmer]] writes:

{{quote|Their sickness is a result of structural violence: neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault; rather, historically given (and often economically driven) processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency. Structural violence is visited upon all those whose social status denies them access to the fruits of scientific and social progress.}}

This perspective has been continually discussed by [[Paul Farmer]], as well as by [[Philippe Bourgois]] and [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]].

Theorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some,{{who|date=June 2015}} this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as [[racism]] and [[sexism]], have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Paul Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see. 

1. Suffering is exoticized--that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it's easy to exoticise. 
2. The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like. 
3. Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood. &lt;ref&gt;Women, Poverty &amp; AIDS: Sex, Drugs and Structural Violence (Series in Health and Social Justice), with coauthor Margaret Connors, Common Courage Press; Reprint edition (September 1996), {{ISBN|978-1-56751-074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to health care===
Structural violence affects the availability of [[health care]] in the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects environmentally stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering [[discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|communicable diseases such as HIV]], for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence.&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Farmer |first = Paul E. |authorlink = Paul Farmer |author2 = Nizeye Bruce |author3 = Stulac Sara |author4 = Keshavjee Salmaan |date = October 24, 2006 |title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine |journal = [[PLoS Medicine]] |volume = 3 |issue = 10 |pages = 1686–1691 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030449 |pmid = 17076568 |pmc = 1621099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a [[commodity]], remaining only available to those who can afford them.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;  Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Michael A.|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald E.|last3=Jacobson|first3=C. Jeffrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Undocumented status as a social determinant of occupational safety and health: The workers’ perspective|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%2527_perspective|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|issn=1097-0274|pmc=4632487|pmid=26471878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structural violence is the result of policy and [[social structure]]s, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that "structural interventions" are one possible solution.

Countries such as Haiti and Rwanda have implemented these interventions with positive outcomes. Examples include prohibiting the [[commodification]] of the citizen needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's [[economic, social and cultural rights|social and economic rights]], thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform structural interventions.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

The lessons that have been learned from successful examples of structural interventions in these countries are fundamental. Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should be the main focus. Sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. Research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one's behavior and habits.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Although some structural interventions can decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted. Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

Structural violence also exists in the area of [[mental health]], where systems are designed to ignore the lived experiences of people with mental illnesses when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Online-only consultation may be inappropriate for people with a lived experience of mental illness. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15–25 years earlier than do people without a lived experience of mental health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8558">In [[model theory]], a discipline within the field of [[mathematical logic]], a '''tame abstract elementary class''' is an [[abstract elementary class]] (AEC) which satisfies a locality property for types called tameness. Even though it appears implicitly in earlier work of [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]], tameness as a property of AEC was first isolated by [[Rami Grossberg|Grossberg]] and VanDieren,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who observed that tame AECs were much easier to handle than general AECs.

== Definition ==

Let ''K'' be an [[abstract elementary class|AEC]] with joint embedding, amalgamation, and no maximal models. Just like in first-order model theory, this implies ''K'' has a universal model-homogeneous monster model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Working inside &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, we can define a semantic notion of [[type (model theory)|types]] by specifying that two elements ''a'' and ''b'' have the same type over some base model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; if there is an [[automorphism]] of the monster model sending ''a'' to ''b'' fixing &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; pointwise (note that types can be defined in a similar manner without using a monster model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|2009}}, Definition II.1.9.&lt;/ref&gt;). Such types are called '''Galois types'''.

One can ask for such types to be determined by their restriction on a small domain. This gives rise to the notion of tameness:

* An AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is ''tame'' if there exists a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; such that any two distinct Galois types are already distinct on a submodel of their domain of size &lt;math&gt;\le \kappa&lt;/math&gt;. When we want to emphasize &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame.

Tame AECs are usually also assumed to satisfy amalgamation.

== Discussion and motivation ==

While (without the existence of [[large cardinal]]s) there are examples of non-tame AECs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baldwin|Shelah|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; most of the known natural examples are tame.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in the introduction of {{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the following sufficient conditions for a class to be tame are known:

* '''Tameness is a large cardinal axiom''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boney|2014}}, Theorem 1.3.&lt;/ref&gt; There are class-many almost [[strongly compact cardinal]]s iff any abstract elementary class is tame.
* '''Some tameness follows from categoricity''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|1999}}, Main claim 2.3 (9.2 in the online version).&lt;/ref&gt; If an AEC with amalgamation is categorical in a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of high-enough cofinality, then tameness holds for types over saturated models of size less than &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Conjecture 1.5 in &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;''':   If K is categorical in some λ ≥ Hanf(K) then there exists χ &lt; Hanf(K) such that K is χ-tame.

Many results in the model theory of (general) AECs assume weak forms of the [[Generalized continuum hypothesis]] and rely on sophisticated combinatorial set-theoretic arguments.&lt;ref&gt;See for example many of the hard theorems of Shelah's book ({{harvnb|Shelah|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the model theory of tame AECs is much easier to develop, as evidenced by the results presented below.

== Results ==

The following are some important results about tame AECs.

* '''Upward categoricity transfer''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame AEC with amalgamation that is categorical in some [[successor cardinal|successor]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge \operatorname{LS}(K)^{++} + \kappa^+&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. has exactly one model of size &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; up to isomorphism) is categorical in ''all'' &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Upward stability transfer''':&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Baldwin|Kueker|VanDieren|2006}}, Theorem 4.5 for the first result and {{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006a}} for the second.&lt;/ref&gt; A &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame AEC with amalgamation that is [[stable]] in a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge \kappa&lt;/math&gt; is stable in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^+&lt;/math&gt; and in every infinite &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu^\lambda = \mu&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Tameness can be seen as a topological separation principle''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|2011}}, Proposition 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; An AEC with amalgamation is tame if and only if an appropriate [[Topological space|topology]] on the set of Galois types is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].
* '''Tameness and categoricity imply there is a forking notion''':&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Vasey|2014}} for the first result, and {{harvnb|Boney|Vasey|2014}}, Corollary 6.10.5 for the result on dimension.&lt;/ref&gt; A &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame AEC with amalgamation that is categorical in a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of [[cofinality]] greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; has a good frame: a forking-like notion for types of singletons (in particular, it is [[stable]] in all cardinals). This gives rise to a well-behaved notion of [[dimension]].

'''''The Principle of Hope''''' ({{lang-de|Das Prinzip Hoffnung}}) is a book by the Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]], published in three volumes in 1954, 1955, and 1959, in which the author explores utopianism, studying the utopian impulses present in art, literature, religion and other forms of cultural expression, and envisages a future state of absolute perfection. ''The Principle of Hope'' has become fundamental to dialogue between Christians and Marxists.&lt;ref name="Corrington"&gt;{{cite book |author=Corrington, Robert S. |title=The Community of Interpreters: On the Hermeneutics of Nature and the Bible in the American Philosophical Tradition |year=1987 |publisher=Mercer University Press |page=103 |isbn=0-86554-284-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Originally written between 1938 and 1947 in the United States,&lt;ref name="Corrington" /&gt; an enlarged and revised version of ''The Principle of Hope'' was published successively in three volumes in 1954, 1955, and 1959. Bloch, who had emigrated to the United States in 1938, returned to Europe in 1949 and became a Professor of Philosophy in [[East Germany]]. Despite having initially supported the regime, Bloch came under attack for his philosophical unorthodoxy and support for greater cultural freedom in East Germany, and publication of ''The Principle of Hope'' was delayed for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kołakowski, Leszek |title=Main Currents of Marxism Volume 3: The Breakdown |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |pages=425–439 |isbn=0-19-285109-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]] calls ''The Principle of Hope'' Bloch's ''magnum opus'', writing that it contains all his important ideas.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski" /&gt; The work has been described as "monumental" by the philosopher [[Robert S.

The '''thermal time hypothesis''' is a possible solution to the [[problem of time]] in classical and quantum theory as has been put forward by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Alain Connes]]. Physical time flow is modeled as a fundamental property of the theory, a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Connes, C. Rovelli, "Von Neumann Algebra Automorphisms and Time-Thermodynamics Relation in General Covariant Quantum Theories", ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' 11:2899–2918, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Generally covariant]] theories do not have a notion of a distinguished [[physical time]] with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6677">'''Thomas Hency Brewer, Sr.''' (1894-1956) was an [[African-American]] [[physician]], born on November 19, 1894, in [[Saco, Alabama|Saco]], [[Alabama]], who was instrumental in the [[civil rights movement]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]] during the early- to mid-20th century, before he was [[assassination|assassinated]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-brewer-1894-1956|title=Thomas Brewer (1894-1956)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and Death ==

Dr. Thomas Brewer was born in Saco, Alabama, graduated from [[Selma University]] in Selma, Alabama, then from [[Meharry Medical College]] in Nashville, Tennessee, and moved to Columbus, Georgia in 1920. He became a respected physician and one of Columbus' most prominent civil rights activists, succeeding in the desegregation of the Columbus Police Department, being one of the founders of the city's [[NAACP]] chapter, and as a supporter of Primus King, among other advocacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Thomas Brewer's Office|url=http://digitalarchives.columbusstate.edu/11-dr-thomas-brewers-office|website=Columbus State University Archives|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican Party]], serving as a delegate to the GOP National Convention in Philadelphia.

On July 4, 1944, Primus E. King, an African-American registered voter, went to the [[Muscogee County]] Courthouse in Columbus to cast his vote in the Democratic Party’s primary election. He was turned away by law enforcement. Dr. Brewer encouraged and financially supported Mr. King in his lawsuit filed in federal court, styled ''King v. Chapman''.  In a landmark ruling, the court found in Mr. King's favor, deciding that the exclusion of black voters was unconstitutional.  The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed, which ended the [[State of Georgia]]'s "whites only" primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primus King and the Civil Rights Movement|url=http://georgiahistory.com/ghmi_marker_updated/primus-king-and-the-civil-rights-movement/|website=Georgia Historical Society|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Brewer shared an office building on First Street in Columbus with the F&amp;B Department store, owned by Luico Flowers.  In 1956, the two men witnessed a beating of a black man by police outside of the building. Dr. Brewer and Mr. Flowers argued about the incident: Dr. Brewer believed the police officer used excessive force and Mr. Flowers disagreed.  About a week later, on February 18, 1956, Mr. Flowers shot Dr. Brewer seven times and killed him, claiming self-defense. The grand jury believed Mr. Flowers' account of the incident and he was not charged. A year later, Mr. Flowers was found shot dead, in what authorities determined was a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Doctor's Death Causes Black Professionals to Flee|url=http://www.civilrights.uga.edu/cities/columbus/doctors.htm|website=Freedom on Film: University of Georgia|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 2,500 mourners showed up for Dr. Brewer's funeral at the [[First African Baptist Church (Columbus, Georgia)|First African Baptist Church]] on Fifth Avenue.

Lillian "Bunky" McClung, the daughter of the first African-American mayor of Columbus, A.J. McClung, recalled the death of Dr. Brewer in a 2015 interview with the Columbus [[Ledger-Enquirer]] newspaper: ''"Dr. Brewer had been the person behind motivating the people in this community to want more. ... I remember that day he was shot. I remember when my daddy got that phone call and he ran out the door. ... There were several dentists, several doctors in the community ... they all left when Dr Brewer was shot."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunday Interview with Lillian "Bunky" McClung|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article44930010.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|agency=''Ledger-Enquirer''|date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer's wife and daughter left the city, as did Brewer's attorney and several other prominent physicians and businessmen, including Dr. W.G. McCoo, his spouse, Dr. Mary McCoo and their children, including their young daughter [[Marilyn McCoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Judith|title=Black America Series: Columbus, Georgia|date=2000|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738542874|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Brewer (1894-1956)|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-brewer-1894-1956|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[historical marker]] placed at the site of his assassination reads ''"Dr. Thomas H. Brewer - A [[Pike County, Alabama]] native of African-American descent, Dr. Brewer was born November 16, 1894. His office was located at 1025½ First Avenue. Brewer emerged as a chief spokesman for the civil rights of the [[Negro]] and was described by [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP as a 'fearless champion of the rights of his people.' His goal to guarantee the Negro the right to vote throughout the State of Georgia and [[Southern United States|the South]] was achieved in the Primus King case in 1945. He was a leader of the local chapter of the NAACP and worked tirelessly for racial equality. Brewer was killed by gunshots February 18, 1956 near this site."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/muscogee/dr.-thomas-h.-brewer|title=Historical Markers by County - GeorgiaInfo|website=georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer programming]], a '''trait''' is a concept used in [[object-oriented programming]], which represents a set of [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] that can be used to extend the functionality of a [[Class (computer science)|class]].&lt;ref name="schaerli-ecoop-2003"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Nathanael | last1=Schärli | first2=Stéphane | last2=Ducasse | first3=Oscar | last3=Nierstrasz | author-link3=Oscar Nierstrasz | first4=Andrew P. | last4=Black | url=http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf | title=Traits: Composable Units of Behaviour | journal=Proceedings of the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP). | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume=2743 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=2003 | pages=248–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Stéphane | last1=Ducasse | first2=Oscar | last2=Nierstrasz | first3=Nathanael | last3=Schärli | first4=Roel | last4=Wuyts | first5=Andrew P. | last5=Black | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1119479.1119483 | title=Traits: A mechanism for fine-grained reuse. | journal= ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=331–388 | date=March 2006 | doi=10.1145/1119479.1119483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Traits both provide a set of methods that implement behaviour to a class, and require that the class implement a set of methods that [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameterize]] the provided behaviour.

For inter-object communication, traits are somewhat between an object-oriented [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol (interface)]] and a [[mixin]]. An interface may define one or more behaviors via [[Function prototype|method signatures]], while a trait defines behaviors via full method definitions: i.e., it includes the [[Class implementation file|body of the methods]]. In contrast, mixins include full method definitions and may also carry [[State (computer science)|state]] through member variable, while traits usually don't.

Hence an object defined as a trait is created as the composition of methods, which can be used by other classes without requiring [[multiple inheritance]]. In case of a [[naming collision]], when more than one trait to be used by a class has a method with the same name, the programmer must explicitly disambiguate which one of those methods will be used in the class; thus manually solving the ''[[Multiple inheritance#The diamond problem|diamond problem]]'' of multiple inheritance. This is different from other composition methods in object-oriented programming, where conflicting names are automatically resolved by [[Scope (computer science)|scoping rules]].

Whereas mixins can be composed only using the [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] operation, traits offer a much wider selection of operations, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* ''symmetric sum'': an operation that merges two disjoint traits to create a new trait
* ''override'' (or ''asymmetric sum''): an operation that forms a new trait by adding methods to an existing trait, possibly overriding some of its methods
* ''alias'': an operation that creates a new trait by adding a new name for an existing method
* ''exclusion'': an operation that forms a new trait by removing a method from an existing trait. (Combining this with the alias operation yields a ''shallow rename'' operation).

Traits are composed in the following ways:
* Trait composition is commutative; the ordering of adding traits does not matter. For example, given trait ''S'' = ''A'' + ''B'', then trait ''T'' = ''B'' + ''A'' is the same as ''S''.
* Conflicting methods are excluded from the composition.
* Nested traits are equivalent to flattened traits; the composition hierarchy does not affect the traits behaviour. For example, given trait ''S'' = ''A'' + ''X'', where ''X'' = ''B'' + ''C'', then trait ''T'' = ''A'' + ''B'' + ''C'' is the same as ''S''.&lt;ref name="schaerli-ecoop-2003"/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== PHP ===
This example uses a trait to enhance other classes:
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
// The template
trait TSingleton
{
    private static $_instance = null;

    private function __construct(){} // Must have private default constructor and be aware not to open it in the class

    public static function getInstance()
    {
        if (null === self::$_instance)
        {
            self::$_instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$_instance;
    }
}

class FrontController
{
    use TSingleton;
}

// Can also be used in already extended classes
class WebSite extends SomeClass
{
    use TSingleton;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows simulating aspects of multiple inheritance:
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
trait TBounding
{
    public $x, $y, $width, $height;
}

trait TMoveable
{
    public function moveTo($x, $y)
    {
        // …
    }
}

trait TResizeable
{
    public function resize($newWidth, $newHeight)
    {
        // …
    }
}

class Rectangle
{
    use TBounding, TMoveable, TResizeable;

    public function fillColor($color)
    {
        // …
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Rust ===
A trait in Rust declares a set of methods that a type must implement&lt;ref&gt;http://gradebot.org/doc/ipur/trait.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Rust compilers require traits to be explicated, which ensures the safety of [[Generic programming|generics]] in Rust. It also helps to avoid major problems of [[Template (C++)|template in C++]]. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="rust"&gt;
// type T must have the "Ord" trait
// so that "&gt;" and "&lt;" operations can be done
fn get_max&lt;T: Ord&gt;(a: &amp;[T]) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; {
	let mut result = a.get(0)?;
	for n in a {
		if *n &gt; *result {
			result = &amp;n;
		}
	}
	Some(result)
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To simplify tedious and repeated implementation of traits like &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;derive&lt;/code&gt; can be used to request compilers to generate certain codes automatically&lt;ref&gt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/traits.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Derivable traits include: &lt;code&gt;Clone&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PartialEq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PartialOrd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Hash&lt;/code&gt;.

The term '''tribe''' or '''digital tribe'''&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digital Tribes - Creating Behaviour Change in Users - The UX Review|url = http://theuxreview.co.uk/digital-tribes-creating-behaviour-change-users/|website = The UX Review|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used as a [[slang]] term for an unofficial [[community]] of people who share a common interest, and usually who are loosely affiliated with each other through [[social media]] or other [[Internet]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;mechanisms. The term is related to "''[[tribe]]''", which traditionally refers to people closely associated in both [[geography]] and [[genealogy]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tribes and Tribal: Origin, Use, and Future of the Concept|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260405121_Tribes_and_Tribal_Origin_Use_and_Future_of_the_Concept|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it looks more like a [[virtual community]] or a personal network and it is often called global digital tribe. Most [[anthropologist]]s agree that a tribe is a (small) [[society]] that practices its own customs and [[culture]], and that these define the tribe. The tribes are divided into [[clan]]s, with their own customs and [[cultural values]] that differentiate them from activities that occur in 'real life' contexts. People feel more inclined to share and defend their [[idea]]s on [[social network]]s than they would dare to say to someone face to face. For example, it would be ridiculous to '[[Poke (Facebook)|poke]]' someone in real life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning with 'e's: Global digital tribe|url = http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/global-digital-tribe.html|website = steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "[[tribe]]" originated around the time of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states and the early formation of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Latin]] term "tribus" has since been transformed to mean "''A group of persons forming a [[community]] and claiming descent from a common [[ancestor]]''" (Oxford English Dictionary, IX, 1933, p.&amp;nbsp;339, as cited in Fried, 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;7). As years passed by, the range of meanings have grown greater, for example, "''Any of various systems of [[social organization]] comprising several local [[village]]s, [[Tribe (Native American)|band]]s, [[districts]], lineages, or other groups and sharing a common [[Ancestor|ancestry]], [[language]], [[culture]], and [[name]]''" (Morris, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;1369). Morris (1980) also notes that a [[tribe]] is a "''group of persons with a common occupation, interest, or [[habit]],''" and "''a large family.''"&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Vestiges of ancient tribe communities were preserved in both large gatherings (like [[football]] matches) and in small ones (like [[Church (building)|church]] [[Community|communities]]). Even though nowadays the range of groups referred to as tribal is truly enormous, it wasn't until the [[industrial society]] eroded the tribal gatherings of more primitive societies and redefined [[community]]. However, the existence of [[social media]] as we know it today is due to the [[post-industrial society]] that has seen the rapid growth of [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[Internet|the Internet]]. People now can [[Collaboration|collaborate]], [[Communication|communicate]], celebrate, commemorate, give their advice and share their ideas around these virtual clans that have once again redefined the [[Social behavior|social behaviour]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The first attempt of such social [[Community|communities]] dates back to at least 2003, when [[tribe.net]] was launched.

=== tribe.net starting point ===
Tribe Networks is the driving force behind [[tribe.net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = tribe.net|url = http://www.tribe.com/|website = tribe.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[website]] similar to other [[Social networking websites|social networking]] sites. Users can create their own profiles and join networks, called 'tribes', based on common interests. Moreover, members can post job offers and event recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why did tribe.net (Mark Pincus) not work out? - Quora|url = https://www.quora.com/Why-did-tribe.net-(Mark-Pincus)-not-work-out|website = www.quora.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribe serves 50 metropolitan [[market (place)|market]]s, its largest being the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New York City]]. The firm was found in July 2003 by [[Mark Pincus]], Paul Martino and Valerie Syme, with the goal of connecting local people for what Pincus described as "''an online cocktail party where people are getting leads through their friends. So people are there to have fun and connect and meet new people.''" Soon the site caught the attention of [[Knight Ridder]], The Washington Post Company and blue chip venture firm Mayfield, which both totally invested around $6.3 million in [[venture capital]]. After three months of activity, Tribe brought together 48,000 registered users and 6,900 distinct tribes, earning revenue from job postings and class fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Vault Guide to the Top Internet Industry Employers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPjwN9_FmkYC|publisher = Vault Inc.|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9781581313840|first = Laurie|last = Pasiuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes from a technical perspective ==
Not only do [[Twitter]] tribes have mutual interests,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The rise of the Twitter tribes|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/02/twitter-tribes-lady-gaga-rihanna|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Michael|last = Cragg}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also share potentially [[subconscious]] [[language]] features as found in the 2013 study by researchers from [[Royal Holloway University of London]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Dr. John Bryden from the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway states that it is possible to anticipate which community somebody is likely to belong to,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which Twitter tribe are you? Researchers discover new wave of online communities which even have their own languages|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2293912/Twitters-online-tribes-revealed-Users-forming-distinct-communities-languages-study-shows.html|website = Mail Online|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 80 percent accuracy. This research shows that people try to join [[Society|societies]] based on the same interests and [[Hobby|hobbies]]. In order to achieve this, publicly available messages were sent via Twitter to record conversations between two or more participants. As a result, each community can be characterised by their most used words. This approach can enrich new communities detection based on word analysis in order to automatically classify people inside [[social network]]s. The methods of identification of tribes relied heavily on [[algorithm]]s and techniques from [[statistical physics]], [[computational biology]] and [[network science]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter|url = http://www.epjdatascience.com/content/2/1/3|journal = EPJ Data Science|date = 2013-02-25|issn = 2193-1127|pages = 3|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1140/epjds15|first = John|last = Bryden|first2 = Sebastian|last2 = Funk|first3 = Vincent AA|last3 = Jansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter users forming tribes with own language, tweet analysis shows|url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/twitter-users-tribes-language-analysis-tweets|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-31|first = Jason|last = Rodrigues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = People with same interests or occupation form 'tribes' on Twitter {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-people-with-same-interests-or-occupation-form-tribes-on-twitter-1811627|website = dna|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ickn.org/documents/Tribefinder_COINs18.pdf|title=Identifying Tribes on Twitter through Shared Context|last=Gloor|first=P.|last2=Fronzetti Colladon|first2=A.|date=|website=ICKN Intelligent Collaborative Knowledge Networks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11|last3=de Oliveira|first3=J.|last4=Rovelli|first4=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is taken by Tribefinder.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system is able to identify tribal affiliations of [[Twitter]] users using [[deep learning]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system establishes to which tribes individuals belong through the analysis of their tweets and the comparison of their [[vocabulary]]. These tribal vocabularies are previously generated based on the vocabulary of tribal influencers and leaders using keywords expressing concepts, ideas and beliefs. 

The final step to make the system learn on how to associate random individuals with specific tribes consists of the analysis of the language these influential tribal leaders use through deep learning. In so doing, classifiers are created using embedding and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] (long short-term memory) models. Specifically, these classifiers work by collecting the Twitter feeds of all the users from the tribes that Tribefinder is training on. On these, [[embedding]] is applied to map words into vectors, which are then used as input for the following LSTM models. Tribefinder analyzes the individual’s word usage in their tweets and then assigns the corresponding alternative realities, lifestyle, and recreation tribal affiliation based on the similarities with the specific tribal vocabularies.

The research had four main stages on which it focused: background, results, conclusions and methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Background ===
The [[language]] is a system of [[communication]] consisting of [[phoneme|sounds]], words, and [[grammar]], or the system of [[communication]] used by people in a particular [[country]] or type of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = language Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/language|website = dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is perhaps the most important characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M.A, Jansen, V.A.A., and Plotkin, J.B 2000. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6777/abs/404495a0.html] Nature, 404, pp.495-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has a wide range of social implications that can be associated with [[Social group|social or cultural groups]]. People usually group in communities with the same interests. This will result in a variation of the words they use because of the differentiation of terms from each domain. Therefore, the [[Hypothesis of a theorem|hypothesis]] of this study would be that this variation should closely match the community structure of the [[Social network|network]]. To test this theory, around 250,000 users from the [[List of social networking websites|social networking]] and [[microblogging]] site Twitter were monitored in order to analyse whether the groups identified had the same language features or not. As Twitter uses unstructured data and users can send messages to any other users, the study had to be based on complex algorithms. These algorithms had to determine the word frequency inside messages between people and make a link to the groups they usually visited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Results and discussion ===
[[File:Word usage based tribes on Twitter, Bryden et al.png|thumb|517x517px|Communication between and within tribes of [[Twitter]] users [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] based on word usage. '''Tribes''' tend to communicate more within than between themselves.]]
The problem of detecting the community features is one of the main issues in the study of networking systems. [[Social network]]s naturally tend to divide themselves into communities or [[modules]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modularity and community structure in networks|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2006-06-06|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1482622|pmid = 16723398|pages = 8577–8582|volume = 103|issue = 23|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0601602103|first = M. E. J.|last = Newman|arxiv = physics/0602124|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.8577N}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some world networks are too big so they must be simplified before information can be extracted.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = mapequation.org - publications|url = http://www.mapequation.org/publications.html|website = www.mapequation.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an effective way of dealing with this drawback for smaller communities is by using ''[[Modularity (programming)|modularity]]'' [[algorithm]]s in order to partition users into even smaller [[Social group|groups]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For larger ones, a more efficient algorithm called 'map equation' decomposes a [[Network topology|network]] into [[Modularity|modules]] by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Each community was therefore characterised according to the words they used the most, based on a ranking algorithm. To determine the significance of word usage differences, word endings and word lengths were also measured and showed that the [[pattern]] found was the correct one. Moreover, these studies also helped in predicting community membership of users, by comparing their own word frequencies with community word usage. This helped in forecasting which community a certain user is going to access based on the words that they are using.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Proportion of users whose community is correctly predicted.png|thumb|The proportion of users whose topological community association is correctly predicted by the study.|700x700px|none]]

=== Conclusions ===
[[File:An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.png|thumb|An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.|333x333px]]
The aim of this research was to study the bond between community structure in a social network environment and language use within the community . The striking pattern that was found suggests that people from different clans tend to use different words based on their own interests and hobbies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This study can show how people make friends based on the same [[vocabulary]] range that they use.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Even though this approach didn't manage to cover all people inside Twitter, it has several advantages over ordinary surveys that cover a smaller scale of groups: it is systematic, it is non-intrusive and it easily produces large volumes of rich [[data]]. Moreover, other cultural characteristics can be found out when extending this study. For example, whether individuals that belong to multiple communities use different word sets in each of them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methods ===
A process called [[Snowball sampling|snowball-sampling]] helped forming the sample [[Network topology|network]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds15/fulltext.html|doi = 10.1140/epjds15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each user's [[Twitter|tweets]] and messages were recorded and any new users referenced were added to a list from where they were picked to be sampled. Messages that were copies have been ignored. In order to find out the words that characterise each clan, the fraction of people that use a certain word was compared with the fraction of people that use that word globally. The difference between communities has also been measured by comparing the relative word usage frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Last but not least, individual word usage was compared with each community word usage to pick the best matching clan for individual users.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Different language misspellings within tribes ==
[[Word]]s, and the way we [[Spelling|spell]] them are in a continuous change, as we find new ways to communicate. Despite the fact that traditional [[Dictionary|dictionaries]] don't take into account the changes, online ones have adopted many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misspellings show language's evolution, but does that mean they're OK for journalists to use? {{!}} Poynter.|url = http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/161298/misspellings-show-languages-evolution-but-does-that-mean-theyre-ok-for-journalists-to-use/|website = www.poynter.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting fact outlined in the research above is that communities tend to use their own misspelt words. According to Professor Vincent Jansen from [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] communities would misspell words in different ways, just as people have different regional [[Diacritic|accents]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, [[Justin Bieber]] fans tend to end words in ''"ee"'' as in ''"pleasee"'', while school teachers tend to use long words. Moreover, the largest group found in the study was composed of [[African American]]s who were using the words ''"[[nigga]]"'', ''"poppin"'', and ''"chillin"''. Members of this community also had the common habit of shortening the ends of the words, replacing ''"ing"'' with ''"in"'' and ''"er"'' with ''"a"''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The campfire ==
Each tribe has an [[Electronic trading platform|online-platform]] (such as [[Flickr]] or [[Tumblr]]), called campfire around which they gather. These campfires tend to enable one or more of the following three tribal activities:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* [[Cooperation]] (e.g. [[Wikipedia]])
* [[Communication]] (e.g. [[Social network]]s)
* [[Cognition]] (e.g. [[Blogs]])
However, some brands are building their own tribes around [[Platforms (computing)|platforms]] outside of these.

== Cooperation ==
[[Cooperation]] is the action of working together to the same end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cooperation - definition of cooperation in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cooperation|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation developed naturally over time, as it helped companies to streamline their research costs and to better answer to users' requirements. As a result, nowadays organisations are looking for flexible structures that can easily adapt to this rapidly changing environment. [[Collaborative software|Groupware]] systems perfectly cater to these needs of companies. Informal [[communication]] predominates and specialists in certain domains exchange their experience with other people within the groupware environment. [[Collaboration]] and cooperation are available through instant messages; people can discuss, chat and swap ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Software Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_SklFgSidxQC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2009-03-31|isbn = 9781605660615|first = Tiako, Pierre|last = F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people can work together while they are located remotely from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is groupware? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/definition/groupware|website = SearchDomino|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupware can be split into three categories: '''communication''', '''collaboration''' and '''coordination''', depending on the level of cooperation and technology involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Groupware: Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest and well-known cooperation software is Wikipedia.
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-en.svg|thumb|The logo of Wikipedia]]

=== Wikipedia ===
[[Wikipedia]] is a [[Collaborative real-time editor|collaborative software]] because anyone can edit it. You can edit articles, view past revisions and discuss through a forum the current state of each article. Due to the fact that anyone can change it and find [[information]] very quickly, it has become one of the 10 most accessed sites on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Advantages ====
Wikipedia has many advantages over other encyclopedias:&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using the Web to Get Stuff Done: What is Wikipedia?|url = http://www.gcflearnfree.org/using-the-web-to-get-stuff-done/what-is-wikipedia|website = GCFLearnFree.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Advantages and Disadvantages Of Using Wikipedia For Research  - Youth Village|url = http://www.youthvillage.co.za/2014/10/advantages-disadvantages-using-wikipedia-research/|website = Youth Village|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It's free and open for anyone on the Internet;
* All past edits and chats from the forum are public and everyone can see them;
* Updates happen frequently;
* It contains millions of articles;
* Easy to use and learn;

==== Disadvantages ====
However, there are also some drawbacks:&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* Information can be inaccurate;
* It is open to [[Spamming|spam]] and [[vandalism]];
* Some articles can contain omissions and be hard to understand;
* It can be too open sometimes (for [[Confidentiality|confidential]] documentation);
* It requires Internet connectivity.

== Communication ==
[[Communication]] is the act or an instance of communicating; the imparting or exchange of [[information]], [[idea]]s, or [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "communication" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/communication|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication has drastically changed over time and [[social network]]s have changed the way people [[Communication|communicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.solari.net/documents/position-papers/Solari-Social-Media-and-Communication.pdf|title = Social Media and Its Effect on Communication|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://www.solari.net/|publisher = Solari Communication|last = Maggiani|first = Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though people]can interact with each other 24/7, there is a new wave of barriers and [[threat]]s. In the [[workplace]] environment, electronic Communication has overtaken face-to-face and voice-to-voice Communication by far. This major shift has been done in advantage of [[Millennials|Generation Y]], who prefer [[instant messaging]] than talking directly to someone. It is often said that it could become an ironic twist, but [[social media]] has the real potential of making us less social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Social Media Sabotaging Real Communication?|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/susantardanico/2012/04/30/is-social-media-sabotaging-real-communication/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are studies that confirm that people are becoming more social, but the style in which they interact with each other has changed a lot. One of the major drawbacks of social networks is [[privacy]], as people tend to trust others more rapidly and send more open [[message]]s about themselves. As a result, personal information can be easily exposed to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Media and Interpersonal Communication|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/051313p10.shtml|website = www.socialworktoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] are two of the biggest social networks in the world.

=== Facebook ===
{{essay|section|date=December 2015}}
[[Facebook]] is currently the largest social network in the world with more than 1 billion people using this website. This actually means that one in seven people on Earth use Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From relationships to revolutions: seven ways Facebook has changed the world|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/from-relationships-to-revolutions-seven-ways-facebook-has-changed-the-world|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Jessica|last = Elgot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook users share their stories, images and videos in order to celebrate and commemorate events together. They can also play [[social network game|social games]] and like other Facebook pages.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Moreover, there is also a section called {{'}}''News Feed''{{'}} where users can see social information from their [[Friendship|friends]] or from the pages that they liked or shared. Each user has their own profile page that is called 'wall', where they can post all the above-mentioned materials (their friends can do this as well).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=etd_mas_theses|title = The Virtual Campfire: An Ethnography of Online Social Networking|date = May 2008|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/|publisher = Wesleyan University|last = Ryan|first = Jennifer Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of Facebook is that you can make new friends, as well as find old [[Interpersonal relationship|acquaintances]] and restart [[Socialization|socialising]] with them. One of the most useful feature of Facebook is the existence of [[Social group|groups]]. Users with the same interests can create a new group or take part in already existing ones to debate information and exchange their ideas. However, there are also groups that are created to declare an affiliation, such as an obsession for different subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Group Dilemma|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/the-group-dilemma/2249512130|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] is another social network that allows users to send and read short messages called 'tweets'. Even though messages can contain only 140 characters, this is the perfect length for sending status updates to followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New user FAQs|url = https://support.twitter.com/articles/13920|website = Twitter Help Center|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of Twitter is that people can gain followers quickly and share ideas and [[links (web browser)|links]] very fast. There are [[Social network|network]]s of influential people who can be connected via Twitter.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter: Top 5 Ways to Find Your Tribe|url = http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2012/01/twitter-top-5-ways-to-find-your-tribe/|website = The Book Designer|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Twitter, tribes manifest themselves as followers of either a person, a company or an institution. As a result, it can be used as a [[marketing]] tool to make someone's [[product (business)|product]] visible, on condition that a big tribe of followers is created. In order to do this, the right community must be built, as finding the right people can be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Build Your Twitter Tribe|url = http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-build-your-twitter-tribe/|website = Social Media Examiner|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some steps that users could take into account in order to make connections and therefore make people follow them: search using Twitter search, follow the followers of other users, look at Twitter Lists, use #[[Hashtag]]s and find [[Third-party developer|third-party]] programs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Cognition ==
[[Cognition]] is the mental action or process of acquiring [[knowledge]] and understanding through [[thought]], [[experience]] and [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cognition - definition of cognition in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cognition|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; People like to share their ideas and gather together via [[blog]]s. A blog is an online [[Diary|journal]] where people express themselves and want to get their voice heard. People tend to frequent blog communities due to the fact that they offer specific information in which the reader is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|url = http://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|website = Blog Basics|publisher = https://www.google.com/+Blogbasics|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[business]] blogs that can be used to share information within a company. These can be used as a flexible medium, where employees can be informed about topics that can range from the use of new [[technology]] to the company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Help - IBM Connections|url = https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/help/index.jsp?topic=%252Fcom.ibm.lotus.connections.blogs.help%252Fc_welcome_blogs.html|website = www.ibm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On blogs, people tend to gather in tribes or [[clan]]s if they find information that can satisfy their interests. In order to accomplish this goal, bloggers title their postings in such way that they can catch people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medical Web Design {{!}} Medical Marketing {{!}} Medical Web Development|url = http://www.mednet-tech.com/newsletter/blogs/what-are-blogs|website = www.mednet-tech.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of blogs is that bloggers tend to help each other when someone feels at a loss due to the fact that some bonds might have been created inside the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blog Tip Friday: Create your blogging tribe|url = http://www.honestmom.com/2013/04/05/blog-tip-friday-create-your-blogging-tribe/|website = Honest Mom|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Find a Tribe-Kirsten Oliphant|last = says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
As [[Seth Godin]] states, "''The Internet eliminated geography''".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People join tribes or clans because they find and share the same ideas and interests with other people.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The main disadvantage of old tribes is that they couldn't influence group behaviour. On the other hand, new tribes are self-sustaining and can survive without a leader, they are not necessarily dialogue based and they are long lasting. As it has been demonstrated within this article, tribes have influenced the way languages, organisations and cultures work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They have redefined old concepts with the help of social media and have changed the way people will interact in the future.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''Unconscious cognition''' is the processing of perception, memory, learning, thought, and language without being aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://baars-gage.com/furtherreadinginstructors/Chapter08/Chapter8_Cognitive_Unconscious.pdf | title=Cognition, unconscious processes - section 7 | publisher=Elsevier | date=2007 | accessdate=2013-04-23 | author=John F. Kihlstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the [[unconscious mind]] on decision making is a topic greatly debated by [[neuroscientist]]s, [[linguist]]s and [[psychologist]]s around the world. Though the actual level of involvement of the unconscious brain during a [[cognitive]] process might still be a matter of differential opinion, the fact that the unconscious brain does play a role in cognitive activity is undeniable. Several experiments and well recorded phenomena attest to this fact, for example the [[illusory truth effect|illusion-of-truth effect]]. There have also been several experiments suggesting that the unconscious mind might actually be better at decision making than the conscious mind when there are multiple variables to take into consideration.

== History ==

The attitude of the scientific community towards the unconscious mind has undergone a drastic change from being viewed as a lazy reservoir of memories and non-task oriented behavior to being regarded as an active and essential component in the processes of decision making.

Historically, the unconscious mind has been viewed as the source of dreams, [[implicit memory]] (which allows people to walk or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about the activity), and the storing place for memories. But new insight revealing that the unconscious brain might also be an active player in decision making, problem solving, creative writing and critical thinking have revolutionized the predominant view of the importance of the unconscious on cognitive processes. One familiar example of the operation of the unconscious in problem solving is a well-known phenomenon of having a "Eureka!" moment when a solution to a problem in the past presents itself without the involvement of active thinking.

Currently, several experiments are being performed to measure the extent of unconscious' influence on conscious thought.

== Types of unconscious ==

===Freud's unconscious===
[[Sigmund Freud]] is perhaps the most well-known psychologist and his theories laid the foundation for the serious scientific investigation of the unconscious brain. Consciousness, according to Freud, was the center for perception whereas the unconscious was the storehouse of memories, desires, and needs. According to Freud past thoughts and memories which are deleted from conscious thought are stored by the unconscious and these thoughts help direct the thoughts and feelings of an individual and influence their decision making processes. Freud believed that the Unconscious' influence on thoughts can be accessed by training one’s mind through meditation, or by random association, dream analysis and paying attention to [[Freudian slips]].

===Jung's unconscious===
[[Carl Jung]] further expounded Freud’s view of the unconscious and categorized the unconscious into the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. He believed that the personal unconscious held memories and experiences specific to every individual and the collective unconscious held memories, predispositions and experiences of a species which are passed on from generation to generation and are shared among all the individuals of a species.

===Lacan's linguistic unconscious===

[[Jacques Lacan]] in his psychoanalytical theory compared the structuring of the unconscious to the way a language is structured. According to his theory there is no reference to self thus making the unconscious a dynamic structure. This suggests that unconscious influence on thought processes could be altered after [[traumatic brain injury]]. This theory could explain the cases of altered personality, like [[Phineas Gage]], due to trauma or traumatic brain injury.

== Measurement ==

To establish unconscious perception a demonstration of the absence of some critical stimulus is established and the effect of the same stimulus on behavior is tested. To establish the absence of the stimulus, the degree to which a critical stimulus reaches conscious awareness is assessed, by testing whether a subject can acknowledge or perceive the presence of the stimulus. This is called a direct measure (D) of processing, as the task requires some type of direct report on the perception of the critical stimulus from the subject. Also, one must assess the degree to which the stimulus affects a certain behavior. This process is the indirect measure (I) as responses of something other than the critical stimulus is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt T, Vorberg D |title=Criteria for unconscious cognition: three types of dissociation |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=489–504 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16900839 |doi=10.3758/bf03193692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These measurements are associated to the dissociation logic, a foundational assumption that has dictated research into unconscious cognition for over a century now, according to which a cognitive phenomenon is strictly either conscious or unconscious. In fact, it has now the status of a [[scientific paradigm]], but criticism has started to fall upon it, with calls for a [[paradigm shift]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto, L. M. (2018). Transitions versus dissociations: A paradigm shift in unconscious cognition. ''Axiomathes'', 28, 269-291. {{doi|10.1007/s10516-017-9366-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of the unconscious during data gathering ==

It has been well established that the unconscious plays a vital role in [[perception]] and data analysis. The numerous examples of [[optical illusions]], [[hallucinations]] and other tricks that the unconscious brain plays on the conscious brain provide ample evidence of the active role of the unconscious mind during data gathering and analysis. Several experiments have been performed to show that the unconscious brain is able to gather data at a much faster rate than the conscious brain and also that the unconscious brain filters out a great amount of information and can use this information to influence cognitive decision making processes.

Ramachandran]] in his research proved that the unconscious brain not only  screens certain data from the conscious brain, rendering visual data inaccurate, but also is responsible for filling in false data in place of missing data in certain circumstances. In his paper on "Perceptual filling in of artificially induced [[scotomas]] in human vision"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramachandran VS, Gregory RL |title=Perceptual filling in of artificially induced scotomas in human vision |journal=Nature |volume=350 |issue=6320 |pages=699–702 |date=April 1991  |pmid=2023631 |doi=10.1038/350699a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; he records the effect of the unconscious brain filling in the blind spots in the human visual field.

===Subliminal Messages===
[[Subliminal messages]] also utilize the phenomenon of the unconscious brain processing messages faster than the conscious brain and also noticing data in a visual or auditory field that remain below the threshold of the conscious brain.  come in various forms. They can be quick clips inserted within another video or barely perceptible text inscribed in a picture.
These messages flutter on the edge of perception and are almost impossible to notice unless and until one's conscious brain is called to pay attention to these minute details. Modern day ads, posters and even shows and movies which are broadcast around the world use subliminal messages to unconsciously attract an individual or manipulate an individual to unconscious like a product or a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vokey JR, Read JD |title=Subliminal messages. Between the devil and the media |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1231–9 |date=November 1985  |pmid=4083611 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on learning, thinking and decision making ==

===Artificial grammar learning===
Studies that test the way in which humans acquire language skills and learn how to apply the rules of [[grammar]] show that a large amount of language and grammar learning takes place unconsciously. Experiments were performed in which participants were asked to identify whether certain  nonsensical and made up words belong to a group of words which they had been previously shown. Some participants were not informed that the word sets were based on  rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scott RB, Dienes Z |title=The conscious, the unconscious, and familiarity |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=1264–88 |date=September 2008  |pmid=18763904 |doi=10.1037/a0012943}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of their responses showed that the participants were more likely to associate words which were not shown previously as a part of the group if they followed the preset grammatical rules. This shows that it might not be necessary to be consciously aware of grammatical rules to know proper grammar. This theory might explain the feeling we undergo when we feel that a certain sentence structure is awkward or wrong even though we might not be able to clearly define the reason why the sentence is incorrect.

===Implicit egotism===
Implicit egotism refers to the unconscious tendency of people to prefer things that resemble the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brett W. |last1=Pelham |first2=Mauricio |last2=Carvallo |first3=John T. |last3=Jones |date=April 2005 |title=Current Directions in Psychological Science |journal=Implicit Egotism |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=106–10 |jstor=20182998 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies performed to test the effect of implicit egotism it has been shown that implicit egotism does in fact play a significant role in processes that influence major life decisions. Studies show that inexplicably people choose partners whose name is phonetically or structurally similar to their own names. This effect of implicit egotism is not only limited to relationship decisions but can also be seen in decisions regarding place or city of residence and arguable in almost every other aspect of life.

===Unconscious association===
The unconscious mind's tendency to make associations can have a significant effect on decision making processes. For example, we generally associate a green traffic light as a sign to keep proceeding while we associate a red traffic light as a sign to come to a halt. If in an experimental setting a person attuned to these associations was asked to come to a halt when shown a green light and keep moving when shown a red light, the individual would have to make a conscious effort to follow these new set of rules.The associations of the unconscious mind lead to the creation of implicit attitudes. An [[implicit attitude]] manifests itself as an action or judgment that is under the control of automatically activated evaluation, without the performer's awareness of that causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, Banaji MR |title=Implicit social cognition: attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=4–27 |date=January 1995  |pmid=7878162 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/102/1/4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit attitudes can have a profound effect on decision making when automatic implicit associations are made in socially significant ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, McGhee DE, Schwartz JL |title=Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: the implicit association test |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1464–80 |date=June 1998  |pmid=9654756 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/74/6/1464 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on unconscious racial prejudice, sexist attitudes and [[nepotism]] might have a huge bearing in the real world as one might unconsciously show favoritism due to implicit attitudes.

== Unconscious thought theory ==
{{Main|Unconscious thought theory}}
Experiments were performed to measure the decision making prowess of the unconscious mind and they showed that when there are multiple variables to be considered in a given decision making situation, the unconscious mind can actually be a better decision maker than the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;González-Vallejo, C., Lassiter, G. D., Bellezza, F. S., &amp; Lindberg, M. J. (2008). "Save angels perhaps": A critical examination of  and the deliberation-without-attention effect. Review of General Psychology, 12(3), 282-296. {{doi|10.1037/a0013134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ap Dijksterhuis]] in his experiments to measure the effectiveness of the unconscious brain in its decision making abilities performed 3 experiments that involved choosing or evaluating different alternatives based on positive and negative attributes. Participants were divided in 3 groups and different groups were allowed come to a conclusion about the alternatives in different ways. The first group was asked to come up with instantaneous evaluations, the second group was asked to come up with an evaluation after careful consideration (consciously) and the third group was asked to come with an evaluation after a period of time in which they were distracted by another task, which occupied their consciousness, unconsciously. It was proven in all three experiments that the group which was allowed to think about the different alternatives unconsciously stumbled upon the right evaluations and picked the alternatives with the most positive attributes more often than the other 2 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dijksterhuis A |title=Think different: the merits of unconscious thought in preference development and decision making |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=586–98 |date=November 2004  |pmid=15535773 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.5.586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "radical plasticity" thesis ==

[[Axel Cleeremans]], a professor of cognitive science with the Department of Psychology of the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, in his paper "The radical plasticity thesis: how the brain learns to be conscious", proposed the idea that conscious brain is a product of  unconscious brain's attempts at predicting the consequences of its actions on the external world. The paper also states that the activity of one cerebral region and its effect on the other regions of the brain. According to "radical plasticity" thesis, thinking and reasoning are the products of the unconscious mind's ability to decipher and process countless possibilities and predict the consequences of taking a certain course of action. In contrast, the conscious mind is only able to process the outcomes of no more than a couple of courses of action during decision making.&lt;ref name=pmid21687455&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cleeremans A |title=The Radical Plasticity Thesis: How the Brain Learns to be Conscious |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=2 |issue= |pages=86 |year=2011 |pmid=21687455 |pmc=3110382 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain unconsciously learns to re-describe its own activity to itself in terms of possibilities and probabilities and generates a method to allow activate certain parts of its anatomy to help engender the most profitable outcome. These learned re-descriptions, enriched by the emotional value associated with them, form the basis of conscious experience.&lt;ref name=pmid21687455/&gt;

In traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]], {{nihongo||[[wikt:侘|侘]][[wikt:寂|寂]]|'''wabi-sabi'''}} is a [[world view]] centered on the acceptance of [[wikt:transience|transience]] and imperfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm|title=What Is Wabi-Sabi?|website=nobleharbor.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; It is a concept derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}} and {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}.

Characteristics of the ''wabi-sabi'' aesthetic include [[asymmetry]], roughness, [[simplicity]], economy, austerity, modesty, [[intimacy]], and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

==Description==
According to [[Leonard Koren]], ''wabi-sabi'' can be defined as "the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional Japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese [[wiktionary:pantheon|pantheon]] of aesthetic values as do the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideals of [[beauty]] and perfection in the far West."&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; Whereas  Andrew Juniper notes that "If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi."&lt;ref name=Juniper&gt;{{cite book |last=Juniper |first=Andrew |title=Wabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanence | publisher=Tuttle Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-8048-3482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Richard Powell, "Wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book | author=Powell, Richard R. | title=Wabi Sabi Simple | publisher=Adams Media | year=2004 | isbn=1-59337-178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' do not translate easily. ''Wabi'' originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society; ''sabi'' meant "chill", "lean" or "withered". Around the 14th century these meanings began to change, taking on more positive connotations.&lt;ref name=Koren&gt;{{cite book |last=Koren |first=Leonard |title=Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-880656-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wabi'' now connotes rustic simplicity, freshness or quietness, and can be applied to both natural and human-made objects, or understated elegance. It can also refer to quirks and anomalies arising from the process of construction, which add uniqueness and elegance to the object. ''Sabi'' is beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its [[patina]] and wear, or in any visible repairs.

After centuries of incorporating artistic and Buddhist influences from China, wabi-sabi eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. Over time, the meanings of ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' shifted to become more lighthearted and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honored as tantamount to the first step to [[satori]], or enlightenment. In today's Japan, the meaning of wabi-sabi is often condensed to "wisdom in natural simplicity". In art books, it is typically defined as "flawed beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an engineering or design point of view, ''wabi'' may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; then ''sabi'' could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word sabi, {{nihongo|to rust|錆||also pronounced ''sabi''}}. Although the [[kanji]] characters for "rust" is not the same {{nihongo||寂|sabi}} in ''wabi-sabi'', the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'') is believed to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;錆びをめぐる話題, 井上勝也, 裳華房, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.memenet.or.jp/kinugawa/sabi/00121.htm さびの文字] on the Kinugawa Chain Mfg. Co. Ltd website&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Contemporary wabi-sabi tea bowl.jpg|left|thumb|Modern tea vessel made in the ''wabi-sabi'' style]]
A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain styles of Japanese pottery. In the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], the pottery items used are often rustic and simple-looking, e.g. [[Hagi ware]], with shapes that are not quite symmetrical, and colors or textures that appear to emphasize an unrefined or simple style. In fact, it is up to the knowledge and observational ability of the participant to notice and discern the hidden signs of a truly excellent design or [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (akin to the appearance of a diamond in the rough). This may be interpreted as a kind of wabi-sabi aesthetic, further confirmed by the way the colour of glazed items is known to change over time as hot water is repeatedly poured into them (''sabi'') and the fact that tea bowls are often deliberately chipped or nicked at the bottom (''wabi''), which serves as a kind of signature of the ''Hagi-yaki'' style.

''Wabi'' and ''sabi'' both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] to a simpler life. Mahayana philosophy itself, however, warns that genuine understanding cannot be achieved through words or language, so accepting wabi-sabi on nonverbal terms may be the most appropriate approach. Simon Brown&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brown, Simon | title=Practical Wabi Sabi | publisher=Carroll &amp; Brown |year=2007 | isbn=1-904760-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that wabi-sabi describes a means whereby students can learn to live life through the senses and better engage in life as it happens, rather than be caught up in unnecessary thoughts. In this sense wabi-sabi is the material representation of Zen Buddhism. The idea is that being surrounded by natural, changing, unique objects helps us connect to our real world and escape potentially stressful distractions.

In one sense wabi-sabi is a training whereby the student of wabi-sabi learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. Wabi-sabi can change our perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' concepts are religious in origin, but actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual because of the [[syncretic]] nature of Japanese belief.

==In Japanese arts==
Many [[Japanese art]]s over the past thousand years have been influenced by [[Zen]] and [[Mahayana]] philosophy, particularly acceptance and contemplation of the imperfection, constant [[flux]] and [[impermanence]] of all things. Such arts can exemplify a wabi-sabi aesthetic. Examples include:
* [[Honkyoku]] (traditional [[shakuhachi]] music of wandering Zen monks)
* [[Ikebana]] (flower arrangement)
* [[Bonsai]] design features such as snags, deadwood and hollow trunks highlight passage of time and natural cycles. Bonsai are often displayed in fall color or after they have shed leaves seasonally, to admire their bare branches.
* [[Japanese garden]]s, [[Zen garden]]s  (tray gardens)
* [[Japanese poetry]]
* [[Japanese pottery]], [[Hagi ware]], [[Raku ware]]
* [[Japanese tea ceremony]]

A contemporary Japanese appraisal of this concept is found in the influential essay ''[[In Praise of Shadows]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].

==Western use==
Designer [[Leonard Koren]] (born 1948) in 1994 published ''Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers''&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; as an examination of wabi-sabi, contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren's book subsequently "became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes."&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Penelope|title=An Idiosyncratic Designer, a Serene New Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/garden/23leonard.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics  and techniques and founded an influential European aesthetic movement which also included Dame [[Lucy Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]].

Some [[haiku in English]] adapt the wabi-sabi aesthetic, with spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} such as [[Nick Virgilio]]'s "autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cor van den Heuvel]], editor. ''The Haiku Anthology''. Fireside, 1986. {{ISBN|0671628372}} p285&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of American artist [[John Connell]] (born 1940) is  centered on the idea of wabi.&lt;ref&gt;Hess Art Collection, Hatje Cantz, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Stuckist]] artist and [[remodernist film]]maker [[Jesse Richards]] (born 1975) employs it in nearly all of his work, along with [[mono no aware]].

During the 1990s the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in [[Agile programming]] and [[Wiki]] to describe acceptance of the state of ongoing imperfection that is the product of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2009, [[Marcel Theroux]] presented "In Search of Wabi Sabi" on [[BBC Four]] as part of the channel's ''Hidden Japan'' season of programming. Theroux traveled throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people, beginning by comically enacting a challenge from the book ''Living Wabi Sabi'' by [[Taro Gold]] to "ask people on a Tokyo street to describe Wabi Sabi." Theroux showed that, just as Gold predicted, "they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that Wabi Sabi is simply unexplainable." &lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yun Posun was born in Dunpo-myeon, [[Asan]], [[South Chungcheong Province]] in 1897. He was a son of Yun Chiso (윤치소, 1871–1944) and Lady Yi Beomsuk (이범숙, 1876–1969). Yun studied in the [[United Kingdom]], graduating with a [[Master of Arts]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1930. He returned to Korea in 1932.

==Political career==
Yun entered politics in 1945 following [[Gwangbokjeol]] (Liberation Day). The first [[Doctor of Philosophy]] from Princeton University in Korea, as well as first President of South Korea, Dr. [[Syngman Rhee]], was his [[mentor]]. By 1947, Yun was serving as Secretary to the Korean Chief of Staff. In 1948, Rhee appointed Yun to the position of mayor of [[Seoul]]. A year later, he was made Minister of Commerce and Industry. However, Yun soon began to disagree with Rhee's authoritarian policies.

While serving as president of the [[Red Cross Society]], he was elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he co-founded the opposition South Korean Democratic Party. In 1959, he became a representative to the Supreme Council of the Democratic Party.

==Short term presidency==
Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led, pro-democracy uprising in 1960; and Yun was elected president on August 13, and appointed [[Chang Myon]] as First Minister. In response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime, South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system; so in fact Yun served merely as a figurehead.

Following [[Park Chung Hee]]'s coup in 1961, Yun stayed in his post in order to provide some legitimacy to the new regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. In the following years, Yun received suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule&lt;ref name="Yun Bo-Seon criticizes US policy towards Korea."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Japan-Korea Normalization Process and Korean Anti-Americanism|url=https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0004-4687(196604)6%3A4%3C241%3ATJNPAK%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ran for president twice, in 1963 and 1967, losing each time.

Yun retired from active politics in 1980 and focused his life on cultural activities until his death on July 18, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yun Po Sun, 92, Dies; Ex-President of Korea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/19/obituaries/yun-po-sun-92-dies-ex-president-of-korea.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
