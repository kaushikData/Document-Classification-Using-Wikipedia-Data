      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6514">'''ATP''' (formally, the '''Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to be used for such Carriage (ATP)''') is a 1970 [[United Nations]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] that establishes standards for the international [[Food distribution|transport]] of [[perishable food]] between the states that ratify the treaty. It has been updated through amendment a number of times and as of 2016 has 50 state parties, most of which are in Europe or Central Asia. It is open to ratification by states that are members of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) and states that otherwise participate in UNECE activities. "ATP" is derived from the French name of the treaty: '''''A'''ccord relatif aux '''t'''ransports internationaux de denrées '''p'''érissables et aux engins spéciaux à utiliser pour ces transports''.

ATP was concluded in [[Geneva]] on 1 September 1970 under the aegis of the UNECE. It was signed by [[Austria]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], and [[Switzerland]]. The treaty entered into force on 21 November 1976 after it had been ratified by five states. ATP was intended to replace the Agreement on Special Equipment for the Transport of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Use of such Equipment for the International Transport of some of those Foodstuffs, which was concluded in 1962 but never received enough ratifications to enter into force.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2016, the 1962 Agreement has been ratified by [[France]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Spain]]. At the time ATP was created, it had only been ratified by France, Spain, and [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP mandates that certain types of equipment be used to transport perishable food across borders and that such equipment will be regularly inspected. (For instance, equipment may need to be [[refrigeration|refrigerated]], heated, or [[Thermal insulation|insulated]].) ATP applies to transport by road and by rail, but it does not apply to transport within the borders of a single country.

As of 2016, the following 50 states are party to ATP:

The airline ticket may be one of two types: a ''paper ticket'', which comprises coupons or vouchers; and an [[electronic ticket]] (commonly referred to as an ''e-ticket'').

The ticket, in either form, is required to obtain a [[boarding pass]] during [[check-in]] at the [[airport]]. Then with the boarding pass and the attached [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]], the passenger is allowed to board the aircraft.

==Details==
Regardless of the type, all tickets contain the following information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Industry Bids Farewell to Paper Ticket|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2008-31-05-01.aspx|publisher=[[International Air Transport Association]]|accessdate=17 October 2013|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The passenger's name.
*The issuing airline.
*A ticket number, including the airline's 3 digit code&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx Airline and Airport Code Search]&lt;/ref&gt; at the start of the number.
*The cities the ticket is valid for travel between.
*Flight that the ticket is valid for. (Unless the ticket is "open")
*Baggage allowance. (Not always visible on a printout but recorded electronically for the airline)
*Fare. (Not always visible on a printout but recorded electronically for the airline)
*Taxes. (Not always visible on a printout but recorded electronically for the airline)
*The "[[Fare basis code|Fare Basis]]", an alpha or alpha-numeric code that identifies the fare.
*Restrictions on changes and refunds. (Not always shown in detail, but referred to).
*Dates that the ticket is valid for.
*"Form of payment", i.e., details of how the ticket was paid for, which will in turn affect how it would be refunded.
*The Rate of Exchange used to calculate any international parts of the fare and tax.
*A "Fare Construction" or "Linear" showing the breakdown of the total fare.
Times on airline tickets are generally for the local [[time zone]] where the flight will be at that moment.

== Issuing air ticket ==
A revenue passenger on an airline must hold a valid issued ticket. In order for a ticket to be issued, there are two distinct process:

; Reservation
A reservation for an itinerary is made in the airline system, either directly with the airline of by an agent. The itinerary includes all the above details needed for the issuance of an air ticket, except the ticket number.

When the reservation the made, a [[passenger name record]] (PNR) will be created which is used to manage the reservation and check in. It is possible to have multiple passengers in a single [[passenger name record]].

; Issuance
Having a reservation does not entitle the passenger to travel. Only when the airline receives the payment, a ticket is issued which is linked to the reservation which allows the passenger to travel.

Traditionally, reservation and payment are separate steps, which the time between them are defined in the fare rules when the reservation is made. However, it is more common to require immediate payment on online booking systems.

Each passenger must hold his/her own air ticket, as shown by an individual ticket number, even when the reservations are linked by a single PNR.

==Replacement of paper tickets==
[[File:Handwritten_flight_coupon_Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines.jpg|thumb|left|A handwritten flight coupon for [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]]]]

[[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] announced that as of June 1, 2008, IATA-member airlines will no longer issue any paper tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Industry Bids Farewell to Paper Ticket|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2008-31-05-01.aspx|publisher=[[International Air Transport Association]]|accessdate=17 October 2013|date=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ticket is generally only good on the airline for which it was purchased. However, an airline can endorse the ticket, so that it may be accepted by other airlines, sometimes on standby basis or with a confirmed seat. Usually the ticket is for a specific [[flight]]. It is also possible to purchase an 'open' ticket, which allows travel on any flight between the destinations listed on the ticket. The cost for doing this is greater than a ticket for a specific flight. Some tickets are refundable. However, the lower cost tickets are usually not refundable and may carry many additional restrictions.

The carrier is represented by a standardized 2-letter code. In the example above, Thai Airways is TG. The departure and destination cities are represented by [[International Air Transport Association airport code]]s.  In the example above, Munich is MUC and Bangkok is BKK. The [[International Air Transport Association]] is the standard setting organization.

Only one person can use a ticket. If multiple people are traveling together, the tickets are linked together by the same [[record locator]] or reservation number, which are assigned, if the tickets were purchased at the same time. If not, most airlines can cross-reference the tickets together in their reservation systems. This allows all members in a party to be processed in a group, allowing seat assignments to be together (if available at the time of the assignment)

==Resale==
When paper tickets were still frequently used, a practice existed by travellers to get rid of their tickets (which are person-specific), when they decided to alter the course of their trips. This practice consisted of selling the ticket to other travellers (often at discount prices), after which the seller accompanied the buyer at the time of departure to the airport. Here, the original owner checked in under his name and provided the airline with the buyer's baggage. After this, the buyer boarded the airplane at the moment of departure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Timmerhuis |first=Frans |title=Handboek Voor De Wereldreiziger |year=2007 |publisher=Elmar |location=Rijswijk |isbn=978-9038917597|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since most airlines check identification on boarding, this procedure is rarely functional.{{Citation needed|reason=No ID check at boarding in United States and many other places|date=October 2018}}  The practice of using another person's ticket is illegal in many jurisdictions.

'''''American Jurisprudence''''' (second edition is cited as '''Am. Jur. 2d''') is an [[encyclopedia]] of the [[United States]] [[law]], published by [[West (publisher)|West]]. It was originated by Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, which was subsequently acquired by the [[Thomson Corporation]]. The series is now in its second edition, launched in 1962. It is a staple of [[law libraries]], and the current edition is over 140 volumes, updated with replacement volumes, annual pocket supplements, and a New Topic Service binder. The discussion has extensive research references to other Thomson West publications, including sister publications ''Am. Jur. Trials, Am. Jur. Proof of Facts, Am. Jur. Pleading and Practice Forms,'' and ''Am. Jur. Legal Forms.'' Before Thomson's acquisition of West Publishing, it was a competitor to [[Corpus Juris Secundum]]. ''Am. Jur.'' is available online through both  [[Westlaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://west.thomson.com/documentation/westlaw/wlawdoc/lawstu/lssecd06.pdf |title=Westlaw: Using Secondary Sources |publisher=West |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007171745/http://west.thomson.com/documentation/westlaw/wlawdoc/lawstu/lssecd06.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.lexis.com/online/record.asp?ArticleID=searching_amjur|title=Searching ''American Jurisprudence'' 2d ''(AMJUR)''|publisher=LexisNexis Support Center|access-date=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English law, an application for financial relief following the presentation of a petition for [[divorce]], [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]] or [[judicial separation]] used to be described as '''ancillary relief'''. The term arose because the financial application was 'ancillary' to the petition. However, the term was discarded by the Family Procedure Rules 2010 which substituted it with the term "application for a financial order".

==Explanation==
The courts powers derive in large part from the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]], and in particular section 25(2) which sets out the statutory checklist of factors that should be taken into account. The court can order lump sum payments, property adjustment orders (e.g. requiring a property is transferred into the ownership of a husband or wife), periodical payments (known as 'maintenance') and (from 2000) pension sharing orders.

Maintenance orders can be given on nominal or specific terms. Nominal orders operate on the basis that if the court makes no order for maintenance (known as "periodical payments") at the time of the final order, it cannot later come back and make an order. If, on the other hand, it makes an order, it can later vary it. This is why an order for periodical payments at the rate of 5 pence per year (the usual nominal order) is known as a nominal order - it gives the recipient the right to come back and make an application for a substantive monthly sum at a later date.

Following a 1984 amendment, the court is obliged to consider whether the parties' financial relationship should be terminated ('clean break').&lt;ref&gt;la.c.c.part.102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal rulings==
The leading cases are now the [[House of Lords]] decisions of ''[[White v White 2001]]'' 1 A.C. 596 and [[Miller/ McFarlane]].

[[File:ISGardnerMuseum.JPG|thumb|The [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] was [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft|robbed in 1990]] with the paintings and items stolen valued at over $500 million.]]

'''Art theft''' is usually for the purpose of resale or for [[ransom]] (sometimes called '''artnapping'''). Stolen art is sometimes used by criminals as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] to secure loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Hopkins |title=How art treasures are stolen to order |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/08/nickhopkins |work=The Guardian |date=January 8, 2000 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316154211/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/08/nickhopkins |archivedate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small percentage of stolen art is recovered—estimates range from 5 to 10%. This means that little is known about the scope and characteristics of art theft.

==Individual theft==
Many thieves are motivated by the fact that valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms at most.  Transport for items such as paintings is also trivial, assuming the thief is willing to inflict some damage to the painting by cutting it off the frame and rolling it up into a tube carrier.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=July 2011}} Also, while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places with multimillion-dollar art collections have disproportionately poor security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cameron |last=Skene |title=Art theft ranked as fourth-largest criminal enterprise |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=40babe8f-84b5-46d7-a311-344494e03788 |work=National Post |location=Canada |date=September 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174559/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=40babe8f-84b5-46d7-a311-344494e03788 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical [[smash-and-grab]], but offer a huge potential payoff.  Thieves sometimes target works based on their own familiarity with the artist, rather than the artist's reputation in the art world or the theoretical value of the work.&lt;ref name="rembrandts" /&gt;

Unfortunately for the thieves, it is extremely difficult to sell the most famous and valuable works without getting caught, because any interested buyer will almost certainly know the work is stolen and advertising it risks someone contacting the authorities. It is also difficult for the buyer to display the work to visitors without it being recognized as stolen, thus defeating much of the point of owning the art.  Many famous works have instead been held for ransom from the legitimate owner or even returned without ransom, due to the lack of black-market customers.  Returning for ransom also risks a [[sting operation]].&lt;ref name="rembrandts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Stealing Rembrandts: The Untold Stories of Notorious Art Heists|author1=Anthony M. Amore|author2=Tom Mashberg|isbn=978-0230339903|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those with substantial collections, such as the [[David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquess of Cholmondeley]] at [[Houghton Hall]], the risk of theft is neither negligible nor negotiable.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Chris.

September 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention in museums==
Museums can take numerous measures to prevent the theft of artworks include having enough guides or guards to watch displayed items, avoiding situations where security-camera sightlines are blocked, and fastening paintings to walls with hanging wires that are not too thin and with locks.&lt;ref name=rkhhii/&gt;

=== Art theft education ===
The Smithsonian Institution sponsors the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection, held annually in Washington, D. C. The conference is aimed at professionals in the field of cultural property protection.

Since 1996, the Netherlands-based Museum Security Network has disseminated news and information related to issues of cultural property loss and recovery. Since its founding the Museum Security Network has collected and disseminated over 45,000 reports about incidents with cultural property. The founder of the Museum Security Network, Ton Cremers, is recipient of the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection Robert Burke Award.

2007 saw the foundation of the Association for Research into Crimes against Art (ARCA). ARCA is a nonprofit [[think tank]] dedicated principally to raising the profile of art crime ([[art forgery]] and [[vandalism]], as well as theft) as an academic subject.  Since 2009, ARCA has offered an unaccredited postgraduate certificate program dedicated to this field of study. The [[Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection]] is held from June to August every year in Italy. A few American universities, including [http://arthistory.as.nyu.edu/page/home New York University], also offer courses on art crime.

==Recovery==

In the public sphere, [[Interpol]], the [[FBI]] Art Crime Team, London's [[Metropolitan Police]], [[New York Police Department]]'s special frauds squad&lt;ref&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228031853/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse |date=December 28, 2016}} ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide maintain "squads" dedicated to investigating thefts of this nature and recovering stolen works of art.

According to [[Robert King Wittman]], a former FBI agent who led the Art Crime Team until his retirement in 2008, the unit is very small compared with similar law-enforcement units in Europe, and most art thefts investigated by the FBI involve agents at local offices who handle routine property theft. "Art and antiquity crime is tolerated, in part, because it is considered a victimless crime," Wittman said in 2010.&lt;ref name=rkhhii&gt;Kennedy, Randy, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/arts/design/07wittman.html?ref=arts "His Heart Is in the Art of Sleuthing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209034311/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/arts/design/07wittman.html?ref=arts |date=February 9, 2016}}, p C1, ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a growing public awareness of art theft and recovery, a number of not-for-profit and private companies now act both to record information about losses and oversee recovery efforts for claimed works of art. Among the most notable are:

* [[International Foundation for Art Research|IFAR]]
* [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe]]
* [[Holocaust Claims Conference]]
* [[Art Loss Register]]
* [[Art Recovery Group]]

In January 2017, Spain's [[Interior Ministry]] announced that police from 18 European countries, with the support of Interpol, [[Europol]], and [[Unesco]], had arrested 75 people involved in an international network of art traffickers. The pan-European operation had begun in October, 2016 and led to the recovery of about 3,500 stolen items including archaeological artifacts and other artwork. The ministry did not provide an inventory of recovered items or the locations of the arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/world/europe/75-arrested-in-european-crackdown-on-art-trafficking.html?emc=edit_ee_20170123&amp;nl=todaysheadlines-europe&amp;nlid=62598762 |title=75 Arrested in European Crackdown on Art Trafficking |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 22, 2017 |author=Raphael Minder |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State theft, wartime looting and misappropriation by museums==
From 1933 through the end of World War II, the [[Nazi]] regime maintained a policy of [[Nazi plunder|looting art]] for sale or for removal to museums in the Third Reich. [[Hermann Göring]], head of the [[Luftwaffe]], personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces, generally stolen from Jews and other victims of [[the Holocaust]].

In early 2011, about 1,500 art masterpieces, assumed to have been stolen by the [[Nazis]] during and before World War II, were confiscated from a private home in Munich, Germany. The confiscation was not made public until November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?_r=0 "Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205111313/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?_r=0 |date=February 5, 2017}}, ''The New York Times'', Nov. 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated value of $1 billion, their discovery is considered "astounding,"&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/10424791/Expert-stolen-Nazi-art-find-astounding.html "Expert: stolen Nazi art find 'astounding'"], ''The Telegraph'', U.K., Nov. 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and includes works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Max Beckmann]] and [[Emil Nolde]], all of which were considered lost.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police "Modernist art haul, 'looted by Nazis', recovered by German police"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105213919/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police |date=November 5, 2013}}, ''The Guardian'', U.K. Nov. 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The looted, mostly [[Modern art|Modernist]] art, was banned by the Nazis when they came to power, on the grounds that it was "un-German" or Jewish Bolshevist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10425983/Nazi-art-does-Germany-have-a-problem-returning-art-stolen-by-the-Nazis.html "Nazi art: does Germany have a problem returning art stolen by the Nazis?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106020130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10425983/Nazi-art-does-Germany-have-a-problem-returning-art-stolen-by-the-Nazis.html |date=November 6, 2013}}, ''The Telegraph'', U.K., Nov. 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of Jewish collectors who were robbed of their works by the Nazis may be able to claim ownership of many of the works.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Members of the families of the original owners of [[looted art|these artworks]] have, in many cases, persisted in claiming title to their pre-war property.

The 1964 film [[The Train (1964 film)|''The Train'']], starring [[Burt Lancaster]], is based on the true story of  works of art which had been placed in storage for protection in France during the war, but was looted by the Germans from French museums and private art collections, to be shipped by train back to Germany. Another film, ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' (2014), co-produced, co-written and directed by [[George Clooney]], is based on a similar true-life story. In this film, U.S. soldiers are tasked with saving over a million pieces of art and other culturally important items throughout Europe, before their destruction by [[Nazi plunder]].

In 2006, after a protracted court battle in the United States and Austria (see [[Republic of Austria v. Altmann]]), five paintings by [[Austrians|Austrian]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] were returned to [[Maria Altmann]], the niece of pre-war owner, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. Two of the paintings were portraits of Altmann's aunt, Adele.  The more famous of the two, the gold ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'', was sold in 2006 by Altmann and her co-heirs to philanthropist [[Ronald Lauder]] for $135 million. At the time of the sale, it was the highest known price ever paid for a painting. The remaining four [[Restitution|restituted]] paintings were later sold at [[Christie's East|Christie's New York]] for over $190 million.

Because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures, there are numerous cases where artworks (often displayed in the acquiring country for decades) have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy. One prominent example is the case of the [[Elgin Marbles]], which were moved from Greece to the [[British Museum]] in 1816 by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Many different [[Greece|Greek]] governments have maintained that removal was tantamount to theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Summer |last=Banks |title=Now you see it, now you don't |date=January 25, 2008 |url =http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/23119 |work =Yale Daily News |accessdate=January 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129122413/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/23119 |archivedate=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar controversies have arisen over [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Aztec]], and [[Italian art|Italian]] artworks, with advocates of the originating countries generally alleging that the removal of artifacts is a pernicious form of [[cultural imperialism]]. [[Yale University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] is engaged (as of November 2006) in talks with the government of [[Peru]] about possible [[Art repatriation|repatriation]] of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] taken during the excavation of [[Machu Picchu]] by Yale's [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]].   Likewise the Chinese government considers Chinese art in foreign hands to be stolen and there may be a clandestine repatriation effort underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Alex W |title=The Great Chinese Art Heist |url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-great-chinese-art-heist |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=[[GQ]] |date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, New York's [[Metropolitan Museum]] reached an agreement with Italy to return many [[illicit antiquities|disputed pieces]].  The [[Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles is also involved in a [[Marion True|series of cases]] of this nature. The artwork in question is of Greek and ancient Italian origin. The museum agreed on November 20, 2006, to return 26 contested pieces to Italy. One of the Getty's signature pieces, a statue of the goddess [[Aphrodite]], is the subject of particular scrutiny.

In January 2013, after investigations by Interpol, FBI and The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, police in Canada arrested [[John Tillmann (art thief)]] for an enormous spate of art thefts. It was later determined that Tillmann in conjunction with his Russian wife, had for over twenty years, stolen at least 10,000 different art objects from various museums, galleries, archives and shops from around the world. While not the largest art heist in total dollar value, Tillmann's case may be the largest art heist ever, in number of objects stolen.

{{Main|Nazi plunder}}
The [[Nazi plunder]]ing of artworks was carried out by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories]] (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzen Gebiete). In occupied France, the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume Art Museum]] in Paris was used as a central storage and sorting depot for looted artworks from museums and private [[art collection]]s throughout France pending distribution to various persons and places in Germany. The Nazis confiscated tens of thousands of works from their legitimate Jewish owners. Some were confiscated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of the war. Many ended up in the hands of respectable collectors and institutions. Jewish ownership of some of the art was codified into the [[Geneva conventions]].

In 1945, an American soldier Joe Meador stole eight medieval artifacts found in a mineshaft near [[Quedlinburg]] which had been hidden by local members of the clergy from Nazi looters in 1943.

Returning to the United States, the artifacts remained in Meador's possession until his death in 1980.  He made no attempt to sell them. When his older brother and sister attempted to sell a 9th-century manuscript and 16th-century prayer book in 1990, the two were charged. However, the charges were dismissed after it was declared the [[statute of limitations]] had expired.

[[Russborough House]], the Irish estate of the late Sir [[Alfred Lane Beit|Alfred Beit]], has been robbed four times since 1974.

In 1974, members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], including [[Rose Dugdale]], bound and gagged the Beits, making off with nineteen paintings worth an estimated £8 million.  A deal to exchange the paintings for prisoners was offered, but the paintings were recovered after a raid on a rented cottage in [[County Cork|Cork]], and those responsible were caught and imprisoned.

In 1986, a [[Dublin]] gang led by [[Martin Cahill]] stole eighteen paintings worth an estimated £30 million in total.  Sixteen paintings were subsequently recovered, with a further two still missing {{as of|2006}}.

Two paintings worth an estimated £3 million were stolen by three armed men in 2001. One of these, a [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] had been previously stolen by Cahill's gang. Both paintings were recovered in September 2002.

A mere two to three days after the recovery of the two paintings stolen in 2001, the house was robbed for the fourth time, with five paintings taken. These paintings were recovered in December 2002 during a search of a house in [[Clondalkin]].

On April 15, 1983, more than 200 rare clocks and watches were stolen from the [[L. A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Among the stolen watches was one known as the [[Marie-Antoinette]], the most valuable piece of the watch collection made by the French-Swiss watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] on order by Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], it is estimated to be worth $30 million. The heist is considered to be the largest robbery in Israel. The man responsible for the robbery was [[Naaman Diller]]. On November 18, 2008, French and Israeli police officials discovered half of the cache of stolen timepieces in two bank safes in France. Of the 106 rare timepieces stolen in 1983, 96 have now been recovered. Among those recovered was the rare Marie-Antoinette watch. In 2010, Nilli Shomrat, Diller's widow, was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and given a five-year suspended sentence for possession of stolen property.

|{{main|John Tillmann (art thief)}}
On January 18, 2013, police in Canada arrested John Mark Tillmann of Fall River Nova Scotia after extensive investigations by Interpol, FBI, RCMP and the US Dept of Homeland Security. The case was a mammoth one and it took authorities nearly three years to close the file. Tillmann was sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing over 10,000 pieces of art-work. In sheer volume, it may be the biggest case of art heist of all time. It was later determined that Tillmann had acted in concert with his Russian wife and her brother, and that they had travelled extensively over the world posing as security and maintenance workers to gain access to museums. Successfully eluding authorities for almost twenty years, the trio had stolen millions of dollars of artifacts in every continent except Australia. Tillmann and his accomplice wife, even raided the Nova Scotia Provincial Legislature in his home province, making off with a valuable 200 year old watercolour. He was versatile in his art thefts, not solely concentrating on paintings, but also known for stealing rare books, statutes, coins, edged weapons, medieval Knight suits of armour and even a 5,000 year old Egyptian mummy. A university graduate, he was also known to be an avid history buff.

|Sripuranthan [[Chola]] Idols

|{{main|Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol}}
In 2006, about 8 antique [[Chola]] idols, that of [[Nataraja]]r and Uma Mashewari, [[Ganesha|Vinayagar]], Devi, [[Lakshmi|Deepalaksmi]], Chandrashekarar, Sampanthar and [[Krishna]]r, were stolen from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, allegedly on the orders of New York-based art dealer [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]], and smuggled to the United States. Of these statues the Natarajar idol was sold to the [[National Gallery of Australia]], Canberra for USD 5.1 million and the Vinayagar idol to the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], Ohio and the Uma Maheswari idol to [[Asian Civilisation Museum]], Singapore. The scandal was exposed by the investigative website Chasing Aphrodite, and received wide coverage in the Indian media. The Australian Government decided to return to idol to India and it was handed over to the Indian Prime Minister. The other museums also agreed to return the stolen idols.

|[[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] art in [[Madrid]] 
|June 2015, made public in March 2016
|Five paintings –said to be of medium-to-small size and worth a combined estimated €30m– by British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] were stolen from the Madrid home of their owner during his absence in what has been defined as the largest contemporary art heist in recent Spanish history. The owner is the last known love interest of the painter, from whom he had inheritted the paintings. The art thieves left no fingerprints and managed to get away with the works without setting off any alarms or raising any eyebrows in one of the city’s safest and most heavily monitored districts. 
In May 2016 seven people were detained in connection with the case, they stand accused for masterminding the heist and are currently on parole. However the artworks (which are believed to remain somewhere in Spain) were not found.

In July 2017 three of the five paintings were recovered by the Spanish police.

==Fictional art theft==
Genres such as [[crime fiction]] often portray fictional art thefts as glamorous or exciting raising generations of admirers. Most of these sources add adventurous, even heroic element to the theft, portraying it as an achievement. In literature, a niche of the [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] genre is devoted to art theft and forgery. In film, a [[caper story]] usually features complicated heist plots and visually exciting getaway scenes. In many of these movies, the stolen art piece is a [[MacGuffin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/stolen-v324754 |title=Stolen (2005) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast - AllMovie |work=AllMovie |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019024217/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/stolen-v324754 |archivedate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Association law''' is a term used in the [[United States]] for the law governing [[homeowner association]]s and related organizations.

[[Real estate]] developers often choose to maximize [[residential]] [[construction]] to clusters of residences within real property parcels. Many people purchase their residence within an association for reasons such as location along [[beach]]es and other areas, [[amenity|amenities]], uniformity of appearance and other particular benefits or reasons.  Associations are registered by the developer of the community as a [[not-for-profit corporation]], which form of corporation is also governed by particular [[statute]]s.

The legal forms of residential associations include homeowner associations, [[condominium]] associations, [[cooperative]] associations and [[mobile home]] associations. Thus, state laws are enacted to address specific types of associations applicable to the type of communities and relationships between the governing association and its constituents.

==Florida law==
In [[Florida]] there are statutes under Ch. 718, ''The Condominium Act'', Ch. 719, regarding Co-Operative ownership, Ch. 720, governing Homeowner Associations, and Ch. 721, controlling laws for Mobile Homes.  The laws for such associations continually evolve to address important legal and socioeconomic matters.&lt;ref&gt;"2007: Problems Still Unsolved", ''Legal Beat'', Fall 2006, by Eric M. Glazer, Esq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deed restrictions apply to purchasers of residential interests within such communities pursuant to a recorded Declaration, By-Laws, Covenants and Restrictions and/or Rules and Regulations for the particular community. Associations and all owners therein are subject to state statutes enacted for the particular form of community. Thus, compliance with such restrictions is mandatory and will be enforce by an applicable court of law and/or arbitration unless such restrictions are declared to be invalid or otherwise illegal.

Associations are also required to comply with applicable laws concerning structural and other components of the condominium or other applicable building to help ensure the safety of owners.&lt;ref&gt;''40 Year Recertification'', Legal Beat, Fall 2007, by Andrew C. Demos, Esq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the developer arrives at a certain percentage of sales or permanent leasing of units within the association, the developer is statutorily required to transfer control of the association to owners other than the developer including control of a majority of the board of directors and delivery of financial records, all association records and all association property. ''E.g.'', Fla. Stat. sec. 718.301(1).

Particular laws apply to financial requirements, construction defects and other matters concerning the developer of associations with applicable deadlines and various statutes of limitations.  ''E.g.'', Fla. Stat. sec. 718.301(4)(c)(90-day deadline following turnover of control for the developer of a condominium to pay for and provide an independent audit of the financial records); ''e.g.'', Fla. Stat. sec. 718.203(developer warranties). Even a conversion of an older building to condominium can subject the developer to providing warranties to its owners. ''E.g.'', 718.618(6).  Thus, following the transition of the association from the developer to unit owners other than the developer, the board of directors has the exceedingly important task of timely evaluating same through expert and legal advice.

There is a growing trend for developers to choose to construct or convert buildings to non-residential commercial offices.&lt;ref&gt;''Commercial Real Estate Developers Go Condo'', Articles Tree, Joe Hanoa, September 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons for this growth in popularity is that the residential market is cooling with slower sales, high levels of investment ownership and high levels of supply.

The '''banking union''' in the [[European Union]] is the transfer of responsibility for banking policy from the national to the EU level in several countries of the [[European Union]], initiated in 2012 as a response to the [[Eurozone crisis]]. The motivation for banking union was the fragility of numerous banks in the [[Eurozone]], and the identification of vicious circle between credit conditions for these banks and the [[sovereign credit]] of their respective home countries ("bank-sovereign vicious circle"). In several countries, private debts arising from a property [[economic bubble|bubble]] were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system [[bailout]]s and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. Conversely, weakness in sovereign credit resulted in deterioration of the balance sheet position of the banking sector, not least because of high domestic sovereign exposures of the banks. 

As of 2014, the banking union mainly consists of two main initiatives, the [[Single Supervisory Mechanism]] and [[Single Resolution Mechanism]], which are based upon the EU's "single rulebook" or common financial regulatory framework.&lt;ref name=comprehensive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-244_en.htm|title=A comprehensive EU response to the financial crisis: substantial progress towards a strong financial framework for Europe and a banking union for the eurozone|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=30 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSM took up its authority on 4 November 2014, and the SRM entered into full force on 1 January 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Commission – PRESS RELEASES  – Press release – Commission welcomes the successful ratification of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism by Greece and calls on Luxembourg to follow suit|url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-15-6258_en.htm?locale=en|website = europa.eu|accessdate = 31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of October 2018, the geographical scope of the banking union was identical to that of the euro area. In future, other non-euro member states of the EU may join the banking union under a procedure known as close cooperation. [[Bulgaria]] is expected to join in the course 2019, as part of its longer-term aim to adopt the euro as its currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=BNR Radio Bulgaria|url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/101011196/bulgaria-gives-itself-less-than-one-year-to-join-erm2-and-banking-union|title=Bulgaria gives itself less than one year to join ERM2 and banking union|author=Vladimir Sabev|date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The integration of [[bank regulation]] has long been sought by EU policymakers, as a complement to the [[internal market]] for capital and, from the 1990s on, of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|single currency]]. However, powerful political obstacles including the willingness of member states to retain instruments of [[financial repression]] and [[economic nationalism]] led to the failure of prior attempts to create a European framework for banking supervision, including during the negotiation of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1991 and of the [[Treaty of Nice]] in 2000. During the 2000s, the emergence of pan-European banking groups through cross-border [[mergers and acquisitions]] (such as the purchases of [[Abbey National]] by [[Santander Group]], [[HypoVereinsbank]] by [[UniCredit]] and [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]] by [[BNP Paribas]]) led to renewed calls for banking policy integration, not least by the [[International Monetary Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cihak|first=Martin|last2=Decressin|first2=Jörg|title=The Case for a European Banking Charter|series=IMF Working Paper|volume=WP/07/173|year=2007|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp07173.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with limited policy action beyond the creation of the [[Committee of European Banking Supervisors]] in 2004.

Deterioration of credit conditions during the [[Eurozone crisis]], and specifically the contagion of financial instability to larger member states of the [[euro area]] from the middle of 2011, led to renewed thinking about the interdependence between banking policy, financial integration, and financial stability. On 17 April 2012, IMF managing director [[Christine Lagarde]] renewed the institution's earlier calls for banking policy integration by specifically referring to the need for the euro monetary union to be "...supported by stronger financial integration which our analysis suggests be in the form of unified supervision, a single bank resolution authority with a common backstop, and a single deposit insurance fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=International Monetary Fund|date=17 April 2012|title=IMF/CFP Policy Roundtable on the Future of Financial Regulation: Opening Remarks by Christine Lagarde|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2012/041712.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week on 25 April 2012, [[European Central Bank]] President [[Mario Draghi]] echoed this call by noting in a speech before the [[European Parliament]] that "Ensuring a well-functioning EMU implies strengthening banking supervision and resolution at European level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=European Central Bank|date=25 April 2012|title=Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament: Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120425.en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions for more integrated European banking supervision were further discussed during an informal European Council meeting on 23 May 2012, and appear to have been backed at the time by French President [[François Hollande]], Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]], and [[European Commission]] President [[José Manuel Barroso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Presidency of the European Council|title=Remarks by President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy following the informal dinner of the members of the European Council|date=24 May 2012|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/130376.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] signalled a degree of convergence on this agenda when declaring on 4 June 2012, that European leaders "will also talk about to what extent we have to put systemically (important) banks under a specific European oversight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=EurActiv|date=4 June 2012|title=Merkel warms up to EU banking union|url=http://www.euractiv.com/euro-finance/merkel-warms-eu-banking-union-news-513122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another milestone was the report delivered on 26 June 2012, by [[European Council]] President [[Herman Van Rompuy]], which called for deeper integration in the [[Eurozone]] and proposed major changes in four areas. First, it called for a banking union encompassing direct recapitalisation of banks by the [[European Stability Mechanism]], a common financial supervisor, a common bank resolution scheme and a deposit guarantee fund. Second, the proposals for a [[fiscal union]] included a strict supervision of eurozone countries' budgets, and calls for [[eurobonds]] in the medium term. Third, it called for more integration on economic policy, and fourth, for the strengthening of democratic legitimacy and accountability. The latter is generally envisioned as giving supervisory powers to the [[European Parliament]] in financial matters and in reinforcing the political union. A new treaty would be required to enact the proposed changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/373846/towards-a-genuine-economic-and-monetary-union.pdf|title=Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union|author=[[Herman Van Rompuy]]|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key moment of decision was a summit of [[euro area]] heads of state and government on 28–29 June 2012. The summit's brief statement, published early on 29 June, began with a declaration of intent, "We affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns," which was later repeated in numerous successive communications of the [[European Council]]. It followed by announcing two major policy initiatives: first, the creation of the [[Single Supervisory Mechanism]] under the [[European Central Bank]]'s authority, using Article 127(6) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]; and second, "when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established," the possibility of direct bank recapitalisation by the [[European Stability Mechanism]], possibly with retroactive effect in the case of Spain and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/131359.pdf|title=Euro Area Summit Statement|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following weeks, the German government quickly backtracked on the commitment about direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Finpolconsult|author=Hans-Joachim Dübel|title=Why Germany did not agree on direct bank recapitalization through the ESM in Spain|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=20 September 2014|url=http://www.finpolconsult.de/mediapool/16/169624/data/Bank_Restructuring/Why_Germany_did_not_agree_on_direct_ESM_bank_recapitalization_in_Spain_Oct_12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, it was joined on this stance by the governments of [[Finland]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Statement of the Ministers of Finance of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland|website=Finnish Ministry of Finance|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=20 September 2014|url=http://www.vm.fi/vm/en/03_press_releases_and_speeches/01_press_releases/20120925JointS/name.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, such conditions were put on the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument that, as of September 2014, it has never been activated. However, the creation of the [[Single Supervisory Mechanism]] proceeded apace. Furthermore, in December 2012 the [[European Council]] announced the creation of the [[Single Resolution Mechanism]]. Europe's banking union has been identified by many analysts and policymakers as a major structural policy initiative that has played a significant role in addressing the [[Eurozone crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=European Central Bank|title=Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament: Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB|date=9 October 2012|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121009.en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

[[Bruegel (institution)|Bruegel]], a Brussels-based [[think tank]], has been credited for popularising both the concept and the expression of European banking union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Yes Virginia, There is a European Banking Union! But it May Not Make Your Wishes Come True|author=Martin Hellwig|date=August 2014|ssrn=2487757}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Journal of European Public Policy|title=Banking on a union: the politics of changing eurozone banking supervision|author=Stefaan De Rynck|date=16 March 2015|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13501763.2015.1019551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest public use of the expression "banking union" in the [[Eurozone crisis]] context is an article by Bruegel scholar [[Nicolas Véron]] in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Vox|author=Nicolas Véron|title=Europe must change course on banks|date=22 December 2011|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/europe-must-change-course-banks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Bloomberg Markets|title=Bloomberg Markets' 50 Most Influential|date=5 September 2012|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/slideshow/2012-09-04/bloomberg-markets-50-most-influential.html#slide40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use paralleled the earlier advocacy of [[fiscal union]] by various observers and policymakers in the same context, especially in Germany in the second half of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Guardian|title=European debt crisis:leaders ponder fiscal union|date=15 September 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/15/european-debt-crisis-fiscal-union}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 2012, the expression was later popularised by the financial press, initially with reference to its use by Bruegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Financial Times|author=Alex Barker|title=Eurozone weighs union on bank regulation|date=3 April 2012|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f03ab0bc-7d84-11e1-81a5-00144feab49a.html#axzz3Dte7ubVz}}&lt;/ref&gt; From June 2012 onward, it was increasingly used in the public policy debate, including by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=European Commission|title=Update – The banking union|date=22 June 2012|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-478_en.htm?locale=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single rulebook is a name for the EU laws that collectively govern the financial sector across the entire European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook|title=The Single Rulebook|publisher=[[European Banking Authority]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ceurulebook/&gt; The provisions of the single rulebook are set out in three main legislative acts:&lt;ref name=ceurulebook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/policies/ecofin/banking-union?tab=Single-rulebook&amp;lang=en|title=Policies – Economic and Financial Affairs – Banking union – Single rulebook|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-244_en.htm|title=A comprehensive EU response to the financial crisis: substantial progress towards a strong financial framework for Europe and a banking union for the eurozone|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=28 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single Supervisory Mechanism==

{{main|Single Supervisory Mechanism}}
[[File:European central bank euro frankfurt germany.jpg|thumb|The [[Eurotower (Frankfurt am Main)|Eurotower]], home of the [[European Central Bank]] supervisory staff]]
One pillar of the banking union is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which would grant the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) a supervisory role to monitor the implementation of the single rulebook and the financial stability of banks based in participating states.&lt;ref name="IP-12-953"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-953_en.htm?locale=en|title=Commission proposes new ECB powers for banking supervision as part of a banking union|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all EU member states will participate in the SSM. Participation is automatic for eurozone states. Since the EU treaties only give the ECB jurisdiction over eurozone states, legally it cannot enforce measures in non-eurozone state. This would prevent the ECB from effectively carrying out its supervisory role in these states. However, the SSM allows for non-eurozone states to enter into a "close cooperation" agreement with the ECB to let banks in that country be supervised by the ECB provided that they have mechanisms in place to make ECB measures binding upon national authorities. A "close cooperation" agreement can be ended by the ECB or by the participating non-eurozone member state.&lt;ref name=SSMEP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-780_en.htm?locale=en|title=Legislative package for banking supervision in the Eurozone – frequently asked questions|date=12 September 2013|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating non-eurozone states will also gain a seat on the ECB's Supervisory Board.&lt;ref name=CSSM/&gt;

While all banks in participating states will be under the supervision of the ECB, this will be carried out in co-operation with national supervisors. The most significant institutions, including those with holdings greater than 30&amp;nbsp;billion euros or 20% of the GDP of the state where they are based, and those directly funded by the [[European Stability Mechanism]] or [[European Financial Stability Facility]], or have applied for such financing, will be directly supervised by the ECB.&lt;ref name=SSMEP/&gt; Smaller banks will remain directly monitored by their national authorities, though the ECB has the authority to take over direct supervision of any bank.&lt;ref name=SSMEP/&gt; The ECB's monitoring regime includes conducting [[Stress test (financial)|stress tests]] on financial institutions.&lt;ref name=SSMEP/&gt; If problems are found, the ECB will have the ability to conduct early intervention in the bank to rectify the situation, such as by setting capital or risk limits or by requiring changes in management. However, if a bank is in danger of failing, the responsibility for resolving it rests with the Single Resolution Mechanism.&lt;ref name=SSMEP/&gt;

The SSM was enacted through two regulations:&lt;ref name=CSSM/&gt;
*Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions&lt;ref name=R10242013&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=CELEX:32013R1024|title=COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions|date=29 October 2013|journal=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|publisher=[[European Union]]|volume=L|issue=287|pages=63–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] released their proposal for the SSM in September 2012.&lt;ref name="IP-12-953"/&gt; The European Parliament and Council agreed on the specifics of the SSM on 19 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-251_en.htm?locale=en|title=An important step towards a real banking union in Europe: Statement by Commissioner Michel Barnier following the trilogue agreement on the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the eurozone|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=agree&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3174910/Wanted-EU-banking-union-as-Cyprus-kills-off-deposit-insurance-dream.html|title=Wanted: EU banking union as Cyprus kills off deposit-insurance dream|publisher=[[Euromoney]]|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament voted in favour of the SSM Regulations on 12 September 2013,&lt;ref name=SSMEP/&gt; and the [[Council of the European Union]] gave their approval on 15 October 2013.&lt;ref name=CSSM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%2014044%202013%20INIT|title=Council approves single supervisory mechanism for banking|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation set 4 November 2014 as the date when the ECB was to begin its supervisory role.&lt;ref name=R10242013/&gt;

The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) is a proposed pillar that would centrally implement the common rulebook's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in participating Member States, and would establish a [[Single Resolution Fund]] (SRF) to finance their restructuring.&lt;ref name=SRMprop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-674_en.htm|title=Commission proposes Single Resolution Mechanism for the Banking Union|date=10 July 2013|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRM would let troubled banks operating under the SSM be restructured with a variety of tools including bailout funds from the centralised SRF, valued at 1% of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all the participating member states (estimated at around 55&amp;nbsp;billion euros), which would be filled with contributions by participating banks during an eight-year establishment phase.&lt;ref name=IGASIGN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRMFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-295_en.htm?locale=en|title=A Single Resolution Mechanism for the Banking Union – frequently asked questions|date=15 April 2014|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPSRM/&gt; This would help to alleviate the impact of failing banks on the sovereign debt of individual states.&lt;ref name=SRMprop/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite web| title =EU unveils plans to wind down failed banks| work =BBC| date =10 July 2013| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23253365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=active&gt;{{cite web| title =Brussels unveils Single Resolution Mechanism for banking union| work =Euractiv| date =11 July 2013| url =http://www.euractiv.com/video/brussels-unveils-single-resoluti-529242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SRM would also handle the winding down of non-viable banks. The Single Resolution Board would be directly responsible for the resolution of significant banks under ECB supervision, while national authorities would take the lead in smaller banks.&lt;ref name=SRMFAQ/&gt;

Like the SSM, the SRM Regulation will cover all banks in the eurozone, with other states eligible to join.&lt;ref name=SRMFAQ/&gt; The text of the Regulation approved by Parliament stipulates that all states participating in the SSM, including those non-eurozone states with a "close cooperation" agreement, will automatically be participants in the SRM.&lt;ref name=SRMR/&gt;

The SRM is to be enacted through a Regulation and an [[Enhanced cooperation#Related intergovernmental treaties|Intergovernmental Agreement]] (IGA) titled:
*Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Bank Resolution Fund and amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council&lt;ref name=SRMR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2014-0341|title=European Parliament legislative resolution of 15 April 2014 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Bank Resolution Fund and amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council|date=14 May 2014|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=52013PC0520&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=CELEX:52013PC0520|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Bank Resolution Fund and amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council|date=10 July 2013|journal=[[EUR-Lex]]|publisher=[[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==
The 19 eurozone member states participate automatically in the SSM and SRM.&lt;ref name=eurozone&gt;{{cite web|title=Euro area 1999 – 2015|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/intro/html/map.en.html|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the EU treaties only give the ECB jurisdiction over eurozone states, legally it cannot enforce measures in non-eurozone states. This would prevent the ECB from effectively carrying out its supervisory role in these states. Under the European Treaties, non-eurozone countries do not have the right to vote in the ECB's Governing Council and in return are not bound by the ECB's decisions. Non-eurozone countries cannot become full members of the SSM and SRM in the sense of having the same rights and obligations as eurozone members.  However, non-eurozone EU member states can enter into a "close cooperation agreement" on the SSM with the ECB. The banks in that country are then supervised by the ECB and the country gains a seat in the ECB's Supervisory Board. It would allow banks in that country to be supervised by the ECB provided that they have mechanisms in place to make ECB measures binding upon national authorities. A "close cooperation" agreement can be ended by the ECB or by the participating non-eurozone member state.&lt;ref name=SSMEP/&gt; Participating non-eurozone states will also gain a seat on the ECB's Supervisory Board.&lt;ref name=CSSM/&gt;  The text of the SRM stipulates that all states participating in the SSM, including those non-eurozone states with a "close cooperation" agreement, will automatically be participants in the SRM.&lt;ref name=SRMR/&gt;

The first request to enter into "close cooperation" was made by [[Bulgaria]] on 18 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.novinite.com/articles/191155/Bulgaria+to+Formally+Apply+to+Join+EU%27s+Banking+Union]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish government announced in April 2015 its intention to join the banking union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/04/30/uk-eu-banks-denmark-idUKKBN0NL1TR20150430|title=Denmark moves closer to joining EU banking union|date=2015-04-30|accessdate=2015-06-19|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the justice ministry found that the move did not entail any transfer of sovereignty and thus would not automatically require a referendum, the Danish People's Party, Red Green Alliance and Liberal Alliance oppose joining the banking union and collectively the three won enough seats in the subsequent [[Danish general election, 2015|June 2015 election]] to prevent parliament from joining without the approval through a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/05/29/uk-denmark-eu-banking-idUKKBN0OE1XX20150529|title=Danish opposition parties seek referendum on EU banking union|date=2015-05-29|accessdate=2015-06-19|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of July 2017, Denmark is studying joining, with a decision expected in the fall of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/denmark-eu-banking-union/denmark-to-make-final-decision-on-participation-in-eus-banking-union-by-2019-idUSL8N1JV13M|title=Denmark to make final decision on participation in EU's banking union by 2019|date=2017-07-04|accessdate=2017-12-25|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria's Finance Minister, [[Vladislav Goranov]], stated in July 2017 that his country would not participate prior to euro adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.financialobserver.eu/recent-news/bulgaria-to-know-its-chances-for-erm-ii-accession-by-end-2017/|title=Bulgaria to know its chances for ERM-II accession by end-2017|date=2017-07-03|accessdate=2017-07-04|publisher=Central European Financial Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after pressure from the ECB to begin participating in the Banking Union prior to joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], Goranov said in June 2018 that Bulgaria would join the Banking Union within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-12/bulgaria-seeks-to-join-erm-banking-union-simultaneously|title=Bulgaria Shifts on Euro Accession Plans After ECB Pressure|date=2018-06-12|accessdate=2018-06-12|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bulgaria sent a letter to the [[Eurogroup]] in July 2018 on its desire to participate in ERM II, and commitment to enter into a "close cooperation" agreement with the Banking Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/36111/letter-by-bulgaria-on-erm-ii-participation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/07/12/statement-on-bulgaria-s-path-towards-erm-ii-participation |title=Statement on Bulgaria's path towards ERM II participation|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Budget theory''' is the academic study of political and social motivations behind government and civil society [[budgeting]].  Classic theorists in [[Public Budgeting]] include [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]], [[William F. Willoughby]], [[V. O. Key, Jr.]], and, more recently, [[Aaron Wildavsky]]. Notable recent theorists include [[Baumgartner and Jones]]--[[Frank R. Baumgartner]] and [[Bryan D. Jones]], [[Richard Fenno]], [[Allen Schick]], [[Dennis Ippolito]], [[Naomi Caiden]], [[Irene Rubin]], [[James D. Savage]], [[Thomas Greitens]] and [[Gary Wamsley]].  Budget theory was a central topic during the [[Progressive Era]] and was much discussed in [[municipal bureaus]] and other academic and quasi-academic facilities of that time such as the nascent [[Brookings Institution]].

The [[executive budget]] in United States was a financial innovation designed to empower city mayors and city managers with the capacity to implement needed policy reforms in the [[Progressive Era]].  Since that time, the executive budget has become a tool by which the president of the United States has been able to substantively shape policy and draw power to the president from Congress, which was originally charged with "holding the purse" (and still is constitutionally, as there is no federal-legislative authority to change the constitution outside the amendment process or for congress to legislate away their authority). This has resulted in an ever increasing role and power base for what is now called the [[Office of Management and Budget]].

==Budget, Civil society and Constitutional economics==
[[Constitutional economics]] is a field of [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including [[budget process]]. The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual [[budget]] planning, as well as the latter's transparency to the society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the [[rule of law]]. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair [[government]] spending and executive [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impoundment]] of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.

The term “constitutional economics”  was used by American economist – [[James M. Buchanan]] – as a name for a new academic sub-discipline that in 1986 brought him the [[Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his “development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.” Buchanan rejects “any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members.” This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the [[State (polity)|state]] and society against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early 21st century with the idea that CE allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative, first of all, budget process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision-making and to open entrance to civil society into budget process. This model of CE is based on the understanding that it is necessary to narrow the gap between practical enforcement of the economic, social and political rights granted by the constitution and the annual (or mid-term) economic policy, budget legislation and administrative policies conducted by the government. In 2006, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova, The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform, edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics studies such issues as the proper national [[wealth]] distribution including the government spending on the judiciary, which in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the principle of powers' “[[checks and balances]]”, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the [[judiciary]]: the state (through budget planning and various privileges – being the most dangerous), and the private. The state corruption of the judiciary makes it almost impossible for any business to optimally facilitate the growth and development of national [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CFM International''' is a [[joint venture]] between [[GE Aviation]], a division of [[General Electric]] of the [[United States]], and [[Safran Aircraft Engines]] (formerly known as [[Snecma]]), a division of [[Safran]] of [[France]]. The joint venture was formed to build and support the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] series of [[turbofan]] engines.

The names of CFM International and the CFM56 product line are derived from the two parent companies' commercial engine designations: GE's [[General Electric CF6|CF6]] and Snecma's M56.

The joint venture has delivered 30,700 engines to more than 570 operators and has 13,700 engines in backlog.&lt;ref name=160711PR&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.cfmaeroengines.com/press-articles/2016-promises-another-strong-year-cfm/ |title= 2016 promises to be another strong year for CFM |publisher= CFM international common fan motor introduce to commercial fan motor|date= 11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 CFM delivered 1,665 CFM56 and 77 [[CFM International LEAP|LEAP]], and booked 2,677 orders : 876 CFM56 and 1,801 LEAP for US$36 billion at list price.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25980">{{short description|Legal duty of care, negligence and liability in recreational diving }}

The '''civil liability of a recreational diver''' may include a [[duty of care]] to [[Buddy diving|another diver]] during a [[Recreational diving|dive]]. Breach of this duty that is a [[proximate cause]] of injury or loss to the other diver may lead to civil litigation for damages in compensation for the injury or loss suffered.

Participation in recreational diving implies [[Risk management#Risk retention|acceptance of the inherent risks]] of the activity &lt;ref name="Carter Capner" /&gt; [[Diver training]] includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the [[Diver certification agency|certification agency]], and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the [[Diving instructor|instructor]] has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be competent to accept the associated risks. Certification relates to a set of skills and knowledge defined by the associated [[Recreational diving#Training standards|training standard]], which also specifies the limitations on the scope of diving activities for which the diver is deemed competent. These limitations involve depth, environment and equipment that the diver has been trained to use. Intentionally diving significantly beyond the scope of certified competence is at the diver's risk, and may be construed as [[negligence]] if it puts another person at risk. Recommendations generally suggest that extending the scope should be done gradually, and preferably under the guidance of a diver experienced in similar conditions. The training agencies usually specify that any extension of scope should only be done by further training under a registered instructor, but this is not always practicable, or even possible, as there can always be circumstances that differ from those experienced during training.

Retention of skills requires exercise of those skills, and prolonged periods between dives will degrade skills by unpredictable amounts.

== Duty ==
A [[Recreational diving|recreational diver]] may have a [[duty of care]] to another diver if one of these conditions occurs:&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt;
*The diver is the [[Diving instructor|instructor]] of the other diver.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt; This is usually established by a contract or other agreement to teach the other diver how to dive, or some part of the skills and knowledge required for certification as a competent diver.
*The diver is [[divemaster]] to the other diver.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt; This may be a formal arrangement where the divemaster is paid to lead a dive, or less formal where the divemaster leads a group from a club or a group of acquaintances. Giving the divers instructions (as opposed to advice or information) regarding the dive plan may be construed as establishing a dive leader relationship. Simply informing them of the known geography, expected conditions and a maximum time limit for the dive should not.
*The diver accepts the other diver as a [[buddy diving|dive buddy]] for a dive.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt; If no limitations are stated, it may reasonably be assumed that buddy responsibilities are as specified in the training standards for the certification of each diver. This can be problematic if the divers have different training and certification, particularly if one is a registered instructor or divemaster, as it may be claimed that this implies a greater duty of care based on competence. In the absence of any record of an agreement that the dive will be conducted to a different set of protocols, the default assumption may be that protocols of the training organisations at the time of certification will be followed, or should have been followed.

The existence of a duty of care between two persons depends on the relationship between them. Dive buddies who depend on each other to perform tasks such as equipment checks and provide assistance in an emergency are obliged to act reasonably and not increase the risks of the activity, but may be excluded from liability by [[Assumption of risk|assumption of the risk]] or [[waiver]].&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

=== Duty of the operator ===
Where relevant, the dive operator is responsible for:
* ensuring that the vessel is suitable and carries the necessary safety equipment,&lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt; 
* the crew are competent and carry out the necessary procedures on the surface to support a safe experience for a certified diver.&lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt;
* safely transporting the divers to dive sites that are suitable based on the certification of the divers and the expected conditions,&lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt;
* assessing the site conditions on arrival, conducting a dive briefing informing the divers of the known and reasonably foreseeable conditions and hazards of the site,&lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt; 
* recalling divers to the surface in an emergency, 
* recovering a distressed or incapacitated diver on the surface into the boat,
* alerting the emergency services in the event of an accident, and
* ensuring that no-one is left behind after the dive.

In a number of US cases, the failure of a charter operator to assign a buddy has been ruled a breach of the industry standard of care. It is not clear what competence or certification is required to allocate buddy pairs, and whether this duty would also apply to a boat operator who is not a divemaster or instructor. Defendants have argued that a person who dived without an allocated buddy was contributorily negligent as they also did not meet the appropriate standard of care.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

====Limiting the liability of the operator====
;Waivers and release:
:The [[waiver]] is intended as a legal defense against lawsuits claiming ordinary negligence by the operator. The diver acknowledges understanding and acceptance of the risks inherent to scuba diving. The waiver may also require the diver to  follow recognised safe diving practices. By signing the waiver the diver agrees not to sue the operator for injuries and damage due to ordinary negligence relating to the diving activity. It will generally not be enforceable for [[gross negligence]] and events beyond the normal scope of diving. &lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt;

;Medical statement:
:The [[Fitness to dive#Standard forms for recreational diving|medical statement]] is intended to draw the diver's attention to the range of medical conditions that may increase the risk of injury during a dive. Failure to disclose a known medical condition which is then the cause of an injury will usually disqualify the diver from legal compensation, and may also void an insurance claim. It also transfers responsibility for establishing fitness to dive from the operator to the diver.&lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt;

=== Duty of the diver ===
The certified diver is responsible for ensuring that their personal equipment, competence and fitness is sufficient to ensure their own safety in and under the water on the planned dive, allowing for reasonably foreseeable contingencies, and to follow safe diving practices.&lt;ref name="Robbs 2013" /&gt;

A diver in training may not be competent to assume one or more of these duties, or their competence may be limited, depending on their existing certification. The duty of care of the instructor is to compensate for the known or reasonably predictable shortfalls in the learner's competence.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==== Responsibilities of buddies ====
The responsibilities of dive buddies have been established by training standards and usage. Buddies are responsible for: 
* planning the dive, taking into account known hazards and personal limitations and the level of risk acceptable to both&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;
* visually checking each other's equipment after kitting up and before entering the water&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;
* monitoring each other's safety throughout the dive&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;
* providing assistance to an entangled buddy&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;
* sharing breathing gas in an emergency&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;
* getting each other to the surface in an emergency&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;
Training agencies may differ in the detail of the procedures divers are expected to use in each of these cases. In most cases both systems work and are reasonably compatible when they require the active participation of one diver at a time, but there are examples where differences could lead to complications. For example, the specific procedures for sharing air can vary considerably between agencies, and have changed over time. It is quite possible for a buddy pair to have been trained in two conflicting protocols for air sharing, and each use equipment selected according to the system they were trained to use. In an emergency this could lead to sub-optimal response even if the procedures had been agreed during planning.

Divers may be given vague, conflicting and outmoded advice:
*"Always dive with a buddy." &amp;ndash; [[Solo diving]] is fairly common, it is actively promoted in books and magazines, there are recognised certifications in solo diving, a great deal of nominally buddy diving is effectively solo diving, and solo diving can eliminate the risks of an incompetent buddy. On the other hand, service providers may be found negligent if they do not allocate buddies.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt;
*"Know how to use decompression tables." &amp;ndash; Many divers use dive computers exclusively for diving where no obligatory decompression is required, and a computer failure can be satisfactorily managed by an immediate ascent at a controlled rate. Some of these divers never use tables, and have no obvious need to be able to do so.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt;
*"Do not make decompression dives." &amp;ndash; All dives are decompression dives, and what is actually meant is not to do dives that require decompression stops during a direct ascent from any point in the planned dive profile. Dives requiring stops are fairly common when using dive computers with conservative algorithms, safety stops and slow ascent rates. Extended-range and tech diving routinely require planned decompression, and mitigation procedures for a possible computer failure on a decompression dive are well known.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt;
*"Do not dive beyond {{convert|60|feet|m}} as an open-water diver or beyond {{convert|130|feet|m}} as a recreational diver." &amp;nbsp; This is the policy of only some diver certification agencies, and may be appropriate for their training standards. Other organisations with different training standards have established different recommendations. Technical divers are generally considered competent to dive to greater depths, and [[technical diving]] is legally considered recreational diving in some jurisdictions, such as the USA.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt;

==== Solo diving option ====

An option for some divers is to dive without a buddy. Although this would relieve the diver of any duty to a buddy and any related liability, this may not be permitted by the service provider, or in a few cases, by national law.

Not all dive professionals agree that the buddy system is entirely preferable to solo diving. Even professionals who basically support the buddy system in theory accept that in practice it often leaves a great deal to be desired, and that in some circumstances diving solo may be safer as this avoids the hazards imposed by a panicked or incompetent buddy. Solo diving advocates also contend that most dives do not follow the buddy system as specified by the training agencies, as the divers are often too far apart to notice if a problem occurs or to respond effectively.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

==== Remedies ====
The usual strategies used by divers to minimize the likelihood of being sued and the consequences of a lawsuit are insurance, liability releases and care in selecting a buddy.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt; Following the accepted procedures when buddy diving, ensuring personal competence and taking due care will reduce the risk of an incident occurring due to fault of the diver.

;Insurance: Adequate insurance cover of the defendant will not generally prevent litigation, as the policy may be seen as a guarantee of ability to pay, and may thereby encourage litigation, but it does provide financial relief for the defendant. Adequate cover of the injured party is more likely to result in an insurance payout than litigation, however many insurance policies exclude cover for voluntary activities which may be construed as "dangerous", or specifically exclude scuba diving.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

;Specific liability releases: Divers who want liability protection beyond that afforded by insurance may provide specific waivers or amend service provider waivers to include buddies as persons contractually shielded from liability.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

;Choice of buddy: An obvious solution is for the diver to be a competent, responsible buddy, to follow recommended procedure at all times, and to only dive with a buddy wo is known to also be competent, responsible and to follow the same recommended procedures at all times. A competent diver with extensive experience who practices emergency procedures often enough to respond with confidence is less likely to panic in an emergency.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt; Buddies equipment must be compatible and allow the emergency procedures familiar to both divers.&lt;ref name="McDonald and Lang 2012" /&gt;

== Inherent dangers and assumption of risk ==

In recreational diving the participant is taking on a voluntary risk.&lt;ref name="DAN legal team 2016" /&gt;
In sport participants accept that other participants may be careless and may cause injuries to others due to inept behaviour.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

Assumption of risk is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] in the law of [[tort]]s, which bars or reduces a [[plaintiff]]'s right to recovery against a negligent [[tortfeasor]] if the defendant can demonstrate that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risks at issue inherent to the dangerous activity in which they were participating at the time of the injury.&lt;ref name="Vargo 1978" /&gt;

What is usually meant by assumption of risk is more precisely termed ''primary'' or "express" assumption of risk. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the duty to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability on the theory that upon assumption of the risk, there is no longer a duty of care between the defendant and the plaintiff, and without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on their part.&lt;ref name="Knight v Jewett" /&gt;  However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket exemption from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity.  The ''specific'' risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply.  Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.&lt;ref name="Cheong v Antablin 1997" /&gt;

== Breach ==
To establish [[negligence]] in a civil court there must be a [[Negligence#Breach of duty|breach of duty]] which can be shown to [[Proximate cause|have caused]] harm to the other person.&lt;ref name="Scuba diving 2006" /&gt;

A breach is a failure to follow an appropriate standard of care where a duty exists based on a relationship. This can occur between buddies and between a provider and a client.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

Once it is established that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff/claimant, the matter of whether or not that duty was breached must be settled. A defendant who knowingly exposes the plaintiff/claimant to a substantial risk of loss, or fails to recognise a substantial risk of loss to the plaintiff/claimant, which any [[reasonable person]] in the same situation would clearly recognise, breaches that duty.&lt;ref name="Doubleday vs Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyong vs Shirt" /&gt;

=== Negligence ===
{{see also|Tort#Categories}}
The standard action in tort is negligence. The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States. Negligence actions include claims personal injury accidents of many kinds, including scuba diving.

If although not intending to do harm someone can reasonably foresee that their actions could harm another person, and they continue with those actions and do not stop, and that other person is eventually injured or suffers damages as a consequence of those actions, that is negligence, and the injured party can hold the negligent person liable for compensation.&lt;ref name="DAN legal team 2016" /&gt;

=== Dereliction of duty of care ===

A person who has a legal duty to take reasonable care and does not do so, can be held liable for damages that are directly caused by the breach of that duty. Directly caused means that the injury or damage is a direct consequence of the failure to perform the reasonable duty. Reasonable care is the standard of care that is considered reasonable to expect in a given situation, taking into account the conditions, experience, training, qualifications, etc. The standard does not require perfection and makes allowance for mistakes and errors in judgement, provided that the person has exercised caution appropriate to the circumstances. In determining a standard of care, the courts would take an objective approach, and take into account the person’s specific knowledge or experience, and the level at which the person represented themself.&lt;ref name="DAN legal team 2016" /&gt;

== Litigation ==
When a voluntarily accepted risk leads to an involuntary injury there must be evidence of someone either doing something that they should not have done or not doing something that they should have done before a claim for damages can succeed.&lt;ref name="DAN legal team 2016" /&gt; 

A large proportion of cases are litigated due to uncertainty of the cause of the accident.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

The history of appeal cases in the USA tend to rule that the buddy relationship creates a duty to act reasonably and not increase the risks associated with diving. The existence of damages can usually be proven though the amount may be contested. The aspect that is usually litigated is whether a breach occurred and whether the breach was a proximate case of the injury. A defense often raised is assumption of the risk by the plaintiff, supported where applicable by a signed waiver.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

In about 70%  of diving fatalities, drowning is reported as the cause of death, without specifying the reason for drowning. Drowning generally just means that the diver died underwater and there was no physical obstacle to water entering the respiratory passages. It is a diagnosis that is often reached in the absence of a more specific understanding of the sequence of events, and often reached when little effort has gone into the investigation to exclude other possible causes to  find out why the diver drowned.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

There is a common misconception and presumption by the general public that someone should have intervened to prevent the drowning, which presupposes that someone should have known it was happening, and was negligent in not taking preventative action. A large amount of litigation is based on the desire to hold someone else accountable, and this is aggravated by the commonly inadequate investigation and vague conclusions regarding the trigger and sequence of events in fatal accidents. Statistic indicate that the majority of diving fatalities are due to error on the part of the victim.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

=== Preservation of evidence ===

Failure to identify, preserve, and produce critical evidence such as dive computer data can result in sanctions against the responsible party, including findings in favour of the party requesting the lost information. Investigators without a sufficient knowledge of diving equipment have been known to destroy or lose critical evidence through mishandling of equipment, even when it survived rescue and recovery efforts.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt;

=== Proximate cause ===
{{main|Proximate cause}}
In law, a proximate cause is an event sufficiently related to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury. There are two types of causation in the law: cause-in-fact, and proximate (or legal) cause, which tends to be an act or omission by a person. Legal causation is the "causal relationship between conduct and result". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury, as a means to establishing the scope of liability. In many cases negligence can be attributed to both the plaintiff, or decedent, and the defendants. The degree of negligence established by the court reduces the recovery of damages in that proportion.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2008" /&gt;

=== Damages ===
{{main|Damages}}
In a claim for damages the plaintiff must convince the court that injury or loss occurred, and that the compensation value claimed is realistic. Damages are likely to be limited to those reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. If a defendant could not reasonably have foreseen that someone might be hurt by their actions, there may be no liability.

The '''Coinage Act of 1873''' or '''Mint Act of 1873''', [[Statutes at Large|17 Stat. 424]], was a general revision of the laws relating to the [[United States Mint|Mint of the United States]]. In abolishing the right of holders of silver bullion to have their metal struck into fully legal tender [[Seated Liberty dollar|dollar coins]], it ended [[bimetallism]] in the United States, placing the nation firmly on the [[gold standard]]. Because of this, the act became contentious in later years, and was denounced by some as the "'''Crime of '73'''".

By 1869, the Mint Act of 1837 was deemed outdated, and Treasury Secretary [[George Boutwell]] had Deputy [[Comptroller of the Currency]] [[John Jay Knox]] undertake a draft of a revised law, which was introduced into Congress by Ohio Senator [[John Sherman]]. Due to the high price of silver, little of that metal was presented at the Mint, but Knox and others foresaw that development of the [[Comstock Lode]] and other rich silver-mining areas would lower the price, causing large quantities of silver dollars to be struck and the gold standard to be endangered. During the almost three years the bill was pending before Congress, it was rarely mentioned that it would end bimetallism, though this was not concealed. Congressmen instead debated other provisions. The legislation, in addition to ending the production of the silver dollar, abolished three low-denomination coins. The bill became the Act of February 12, 1873, with the signature of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

When silver prices dropped in 1876, producers sought to have their bullion struck at the Mint, only to learn that this was no longer possible. The matter became a major political controversy that lasted the remainder of the century, pitting those who valued the deflationary gold standard against those who believed [[free silver|free coinage of silver]] to be necessary for economic prosperity. Accusations were made that the passage of the act had been secured through corruption, though there is little evidence of this. The gold standard was explicitly enacted into law in 1900, and was completely abandoned by the U.S. in 1971.

== Background ==

The [[Coinage Act of 1792|Mint Act of 1792]] established the [[United States Mint|Mint of the United States]]. The Mint, in its first decades, only coined gold and silver in response to deposits of that metal by citizens, returning the bullion to the depositor in the form of coins. Either gold or silver could be presented for conversion into currency, as both metals were a [[legal tender]], a dollar was equal to both a legally defined weight of silver, and another legally defined quantity of gold. Having a currency be defined in terms of two different metals is called [[bimetallism]]. Such a system may experience instability as the price of gold and silver on the world market changes, and this took place in the first decades after 1792, as the relative values of gold and silver in Europe changed. At that time, gold or silver U.S. coins were rarely seen in the nation, as they were heavily exported because of such shifts—most pieces in circulation were foreign in origin.{{sfn|Lange|p=40}}{{sfn|Taxay|pp=217–221}}

In 1834, Congress made a dollar worth slightly less, thus lightening U.S. gold and silver coins (known collectively as [[Commodity money|specie]]), making them uneconomical to export, and they were seen more often in commerce within the U.S.{{sfn|Lange|pp=41–42}} With this greater circulation, Congress re-examined the existing statutes relating to the Mint, and found many provisions to be obsolete. It enacted the [[Mint Act of 1837]], a thorough revision of the statutes relating to the Mint. New provisions included the establishment of a bullion fund, allowing depositors to be paid without waiting for their metal to go through the coining process. The ratio of value between equivalent weights of gold and silver was adjusted slightly, allowing coins of both metals to circulate within the U.S.{{sfn|Lange|p=47}}

[[File:1873-CC 50C No Arrows.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Under an 1853 act, depositors could no longer have their metal struck into half dollars.]]
When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the [[California Gold Rush]], silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) [[Andrew Johnson]], the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853, allowing them to circulate. Until then, depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above; the [[Coinage Act of 1853|Act of 1853]] lightened the silver coins from the [[half dime]] to the [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations. Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into [[Seated Liberty dollar|dollar coins]], but since there was more than a dollar's worth of silver in a dollar coin, it was more profitable to sell the bullion to manufacturers and jewelers. So long as silver prices remained high, this effectively placed the United States on the [[gold standard]].{{sfn|Taxay|pp=217–221}}

Although the Mint rarely received deposits of silver for striking into coins after 1853, it purchased silver bullion using the new lightweight silver coins at above-market prices. This was illegal, as Congress had ordered that the new lightweight coins only be purchasable using gold, a provision intended to limit quantities sold to actual demand. As the silver pieces had a legal tender limit of $5, if excessive numbers were circulated, they might choke commerce. This in fact occurred, and merchants and bankers complained that the legal tender limit was causing them to have to sell accumulations at a discount to brokers.{{sfn|Lange|pp=91–92}}

The glut was replaced with a shortage when most federal coins were hoarded amid the economic chaos of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Slowest to vanish was the base-metal [[Indian Head cent|cent]], which only had value because government said it did, and at that time, confidence in government was shaken. Eventually, it too vanished from circulation and commanded a premium for change.{{sfn|Carothers|pp=186–192}}{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=140}} A variety of makeshifts replaced the vanished coins, such as [[Fractional currency (United States)|fractional currency]] and [[Civil War token|merchant's tokens]].{{sfn|Carothers|pp=180, 193–194}} Beginning in 1864, Congress began to authorize base metal coins that would not be hoarded. It reduced the weight of the cent, causing it to be made of bronze, and also required a [[Two-cent piece (United States)|two-cent piece]] of the same metal.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=241–242}} The following year saw the initiation of the [[three-cent nickel]] and in 1866, the [[nickel (United States coin)|five-cent nickel]] (today simply known as the nickel) began production.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=243–245}} The two-cent piece, initially popular, saw declining mintages as the public preferred the smaller, more convenient nickel{{efn|Actually, 25 percent nickel and 75 percent copper}} coins.{{sfn|Carothers|p=200}}

[[United States Note|Greenbacks]], which were backed by neither silver nor gold but by the credit of the United States, and which were necessitated by vast wartime expenditures, had helped to finance the war.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=9–11}} In the late 1860s, politicians disagreed about how quickly to have the government resume paying out gold and silver in payment of its obligations. Treasury Secretary [[Hugh McCulloch]] felt the best way to return to that practice was to withdraw the greenbacks as quickly as possible, and he did so until stopped by Congress, which felt his contractionist stand was hurting the economy.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=91–95}} More and more silver was being mined in the Far West. Falls in the price of the metal made the option of depositing silver at the Mint in exchange for coin more attractive, and mintages of the silver dollar rose considerably in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. The silver dollar was fully legal tender, and some officials worried that the increased deposits would cause silver to drive gold from circulation as predicted by [[Gresham's law]], endangering the gold standard.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=147–149}}

As it had been two decades since much silver was regularly deposited for striking into coins, the fact that the United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the [[United Kingdom]] (1816) and the [[German Empire]] (1871).{{sfn|Nugent|pp=33–34}}

== Inception ==
[[Image:John Jay Knox - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Jay Knox]], photographed by [[Mathew Brady]]]]
Losses of nearly $250,000 at the [[San Francisco Mint]] had concerned the Treasury,{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=53}} and, in 1866, McCullough sent [[John Jay Knox Jr.|John Jay Knox]], a Treasury employee, on a special investigatory mission.{{sfn|Carothers|p=209}} Knox found that informalities in transferring bullion between various officers of that mint had led to inconsistent sets of accounts, but due to the lack of receipts kept, it was not possible to pinpoint who was to blame.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=53}} In 1869, Knox, by then Deputy [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Comptroller of the Currency]], was sent by McCullough's successor [[George S. Boutwell|George Boutwell]] to investigate other Mint facilities, discovering severe irregularities and large government losses at the New York [[Assay office#US assay offices|Assay Office]]. Knox again discovered a dearth of proper accounting procedures, and that officials there had trouble finding a copy of the Mint's regulations.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=53}}

In 1867, an [[international monetary conferences|international monetary conference]] was held in Paris to discuss how to have gold coins of various countries struck to a [[Latin Monetary Union|common standard]]. Slight adjustments to the British gold [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] and to the five-dollar gold piece (or [[half eagle]]) would make each equal to 25 francs, and it was proposed that the British and Americans make those changes while France began striking a 25-franc piece. None of this ever came to fruition, but in January 1868, Ohio Senator [[John Sherman]] introduced legislation to place the United States formally on the gold standard, to eliminate silver as a legal tender, and to implement the recommendations of the conference.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=67–100, 105}}

Knox, in his 1866 report, had recommended a thorough revision of the laws pertaining to the Mint, and in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft. In this, Knox had the assistance of former Mint Director [[Henry Linderman]],{{sfn|Carothers|p=226}}{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=54}} who then held a roving commission for the Treasury Department; Linderman would in 1873 become the first director of the Bureau of the Mint.{{sfn|Taxay|p=250}}

Knox completed a draft bill, intended to repeal many antiquated legal provisions, and to rewrite others. He proposed to eliminate the standard silver dollar (he proposed a lightweight silver dollar that would have a low legal tender limit), move the office of the Director of the Mint from Philadelphia to Washington, eliminate the Mint's charge to strike gold bullion (then .5 percent), and abolish the office of Treasurer at the mints and assay offices, transferring its functions to the superintendent.{{sfn|Taxay|p=251}} In drafting the bill, Knox consulted with a number of former Mint officers besides Linderman, such as former directors [[James Ross Snowden]] and [[Robert Maskell Patterson|Robert M. Patterson]], as well as former Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner [[Franklin Peale]]. Mint Director [[James Pollard]] submitted the bill to Congress on April 25, 1870.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=54}}

== Consideration and passage ==

[[File:John Sherman, Brady-Handy photo portrait, ca1860-1875.jpg|thumb|Senator [[John Sherman]] shepherded the bill through Congress.]]
Sherman introduced the bill on April 28, 1870, and it was referred to the [[Senate Finance Committee]], of which he was chairman.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=59}} He did not seek its passage in that session of Congress, as lawmakers were busy with other financial legislation.{{sfn|Nugent|p=138}} The bill attracted next to no newspaper attention throughout the period of almost three years it was under consideration, though monetary experts and others watched its progress closely.{{sfn|Nugent|p=140}} On January 9, 1871, Sherman brought the bill to the Senate floor for debate. That it abolished the silver dollar, and thus bimetallism, was not discussed, as senators focused on the omission of the coinage charge (the fee for the Mint's services in converting bullion to money). This was of importance to the Senate—especially members from the Far West—because it affected what mining companies and refiners (an important economic interest) could get for their product.{{sfn|Nugent|p=145}} Sherman offered an amendment to retain the coinage charge, but it was attacked by Western senators as an unjust tax on miners and refiners of gold, and the amendment was defeated, 26–23. On January 10, the bill passed the Senate, 36–14, with Sherman voting against his own bill.{{sfn|Weinstein|p=318}} It was then sent to the House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures from which it was briefly brought forth on February 25 by Pennsylvania's [[William D. Kelley]], the chairman, before being recommitted to committee.{{sfn|Taxay|p=254}} The bill was not considered by the House during the remainder of the [[41st Congress]], which expired on March 3, 1871, and the Senate-passed bill died with it.{{sfn|Carothers|p=231}}

Kelley reintroduced the bill in the House when Congress reconvened in December 1871.{{sfn|Nugent|p=147}} Chairman Kelley was from Philadelphia, and was influenced by industrialist [[Joseph Wharton]], who owned a nickel refinery in nearby [[Camden, New Jersey]], from which the Mint purchased, without competitive bidding, much of the metal for the three-cent and five-cent base metal coins. The bill at that time proposed that the cent, then made of bronze, be made of nickel alloy as well—when it was debated on January 9, 1872, Wharton's interest was an immediate target.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=149–151}} Kelley was quizzed by New York Representative [[Clarkson Nott Potter|Clarkson Potter]], who called the bill "this Pennsylvania contrivance" which would give "a monopoly to the gentleman in Pennsylvania [Wharton]."{{sfn|Taxay|p=254}} Another New Yorker, [[Dwight Townsend]], moved to scuttle the bill in disgust over how long it was taking to pass; his motion on voice vote would have succeeded, but there was no [[quorum]] and it failed on a roll call vote.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=149–150}} On January 10, Missouri Congressman [[James Robinson McCormick|James R. McCormick]], who represented nickel producers in his home state, introduced an amendment for competitive bidding for nickel purchases by the Mint.{{sfn|Taxay|p=254}} Rather than accede to McCormick's amendment, Kelley sent the bill back to committee.{{sfn|Nugent|p=152}}

When the bill was brought back to the House floor on April 9, 1872, it was managed by Massachusetts Representative [[Samuel Hooper]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Committee on Banking and Currency]]. He went through the bill section by section, and stated the bill would place the United States on the gold standard. In the ensuing debate, other representatives, including Potter and Kelley, showed their understanding of that. The bill now provided for competitive nickel bidding, but was again withdrawn, this time by Hooper, after Kelley accused Potter of trying to benefit New York bullion merchants. This fracas caused other New Yorkers to oppose the bill.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=152, 156}} On May 27, Hooper presented a substitute bill, which he got passed, 110–13, without it even being read. Among the changes that the House made to Knox's bill were a slight increase in weight of the subsidiary{{efn|Even with the increase, a dollar's worth of the smaller coins weighed less than the to-be-abolished silver dollar, thus they were subsidiary.}} silver coins (the [[dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter dollar]], and half dollar), making a dollar in them weigh {{convert|25|g}}.{{sfn|Carothers|p=232}}{{sfn|Taxay|pp=256–257}}

The bill then awaited Congress reconvening in December. Early in that month, Secretary Boutwell issued his annual report, calling for the passage of the legislation. On the 16th, the bill was referred to Sherman's committee. It emerged without the plan to make the cent from copper-nickel, and with the lightweight silver dollar{{efn|Bimetallism would not have remained with the retention of the lightweight dollar.  The new coins would only have been issued on government order: thus, depositors of bullion could not have had their metal converted into the lightweight pieces. The proposed piece was to be struck to the standard of the subsidiary coins, thus two half dollars would have weighed the same as one of the new dollars. See {{harvnb|Taxay|p=257}}, {{harvnb|Van Ryzin|p=107}}.}} replaced with a [[Trade dollar]] intended for commerce in the Far East, having limited legal tender status in the U.S. The bill was reported back to the Senate on January 7, 1873.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=107}}{{sfn|Taxay|pp=257}} It was debated there on the 17th.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=160–161}}

One topic of discussion was the bill's requirement that an eagle appear on larger U.S. coins. Linderman had requested an amendment to require that gold and silver coins bear a statement of their weight and fineness, which would mean sacrificing the eagle. California's [[Eugene Casserly]] opposed the amendment, which was sponsored by Sherman, stating "it will hardly be possible to think of a half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without the eagle upon it".{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=96}} The eagle was saved when the amendment failed, 24 in favor and 26 against. Casserly was less successful with an amendment to remove entirely the reduced coinage charge of .2 percent, which failed.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=96}} Sherman moved the bill along as quickly as he could, and it passed without a recorded vote. The House initially refused to agree to the Trade dollar; representatives of both houses, led by Sherman and Potter, met in a [[conference committee]], and the House acceded to the Senate amendment for the Trade dollar.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=160–161}}{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=96–97}} The bill passed both houses without further debate, and was signed by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on February 12, 1873.{{sfn|Taxay|p=258}} At no point in its almost three-year journey through the legislative process did the bill provide for the retention of the standard silver dollar, into which depositors could have their bullion coined.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=117}}

=== Intent of the bill's authors ===
[[File:1873 $1 Seated Liberty.jpg|thumb|left|450px|The standard [[Seated Liberty dollar|silver dollar]] was abolished by the Coinage Act of 1873.]]
When, several years after its passage, the 1873 law became a political issue, some of those involved in enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate.{{sfn|Nugent|pp=168–170}} They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that "in 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard&amp;nbsp;... hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a double [i.e., bimetallic] standard.{{sfn|Nugent|p=169}}

Within a few years, the idea that the omission of the silver dollar from the Coinage Act had not been with intent to place the United States on the gold standard became the establishment position. Part of this was in reaction against the conspiracy theories that were circulating about the "Crime of '73", as advocates of bimetallism called the act. This was accepted by many historians well into the 20th century.{{sfn|Nugent|p=168}} Neil Carothers, in his 1930 history of small-denomination U.S. currency, wrote that "many others have demonstrated that this was not a corrupt or surreptitious action by the enemies of silver. The elimination of the standard silver dollar was simply in the interests of clarifying the coinage law&amp;nbsp;... Not one party to the passage of the law of 1873 recognized the significance of the abolition of the legally existing double standard."{{sfn|Carothers|p=235}} According to historian [[Allen Weinstein]], "Silver's demonetization, according to the traditional account, came as an unplanned if fortunate by-product of a complex and largely technical revision of the mint laws in the Coinage Act of 1873."{{sfn|Weinstein|p=310}}

Economist [[Milton Friedman]] wrote, "what is not open to question is that the standard silver dollar was omitted from the list of coins to be minted intentionally, in full knowledge of the likely consequences, and in the belief that those consequences were desirable."{{sfn|Friedman|p=1166}} He cited Walter T. K. Nugent's 1968 book, ''Money and American Society, 1865—1880'',

{{quote|
as Nugent documents in great detail, Senator John Sherman, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, had been determined to demonetize silver from at least 1867 and had arranged to have a bill to that effect drafted at the end of 1869. From then on, Sherman, Linderman, John Jay Knox (deputy comptroller of the currency and then comptroller), and Secretary of the Treasury George Boutwell cooperated to push a coinage bill that included the demonitization of silver.{{sfn|Friedman|p=1166}}
}}

Knox and Linderman were both personally familiar with mining conditions in the Far West. They knew that the amount of bullion produced was only going to increase, and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation.{{sfn|Nugent|p=136}}{{sfn|Friedman|p=1172}} Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=106}} According to Nugent, "Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? It is inconceivable that they were not; Knox's statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? No one made an explicit statement to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case."{{sfn|Nugent|pp=136–137}}

== Provisions ==

=== Bureau of the Mint; duties of officers (§§1–12) ===
[[File:Coinage Act 1873.pdf|thumb|right|Text of the Coinage Act of 1873]]
The Director of the Mint had always been located at the Philadelphia Mint, with the other mints and assay offices governed by superintendents of whom the director was in charge.{{sfn|Taxay|p=250}} The 1873 act moved the office to Washington, where the director supervised the new Bureau of the Mint and remained in charge of all mints and assay offices. The Mint Director required appointment by the president and confirmation by the Senate and served a term of five years (unless removed by the president).{{sfn|Taxay|p=258}}{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=50–51}} Henceforth, the Philadelphia Mint would be under the immediate control of a superintendent, like the other mints. The act also formally made the bureau part of the Department of the Treasury.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=51}} The Mint of the United States had originally reported directly to the president but over time legislation had made it subject to control by the Treasury Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mint: Annual Report of the Director|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/93278343?accountid=14541|date=December 9, 1873|page=2}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little change was made to the officers of the mints, other than adding a superintendent for Philadelphia (Pollock would be the first incumbent), and abolishing the office of Treasurer at each facility. In addition to the superintendent, each mint had as officers the Assayer, the Melter and Refiner, and the Coiner; each was required to post a bond to indemnify the government against losses during their tenure of office, and each was responsible for part of the coining process. Philadelphia also had an Engraver (sometimes Chief Engraver), responsible for preparing coinage dies and designs, though the Director of the Mint could, with the agreement of the Treasury Secretary, hire outside artists to design coins.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=51–53}}{{sfn|Nugent|p=156}} The provision allowing for the hiring of outside artists was inserted at the suggestion of former director Patterson.{{sfn|Taxay|p=254}} The act set the salaries and bonding requirements for the officers, and required them to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as was the case under both the 1792 and 1837 acts. It also set forth the procedures for appointment of an acting officer or Director of the Mint, in the case of the incumbent's temporary absence.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=51–53}}

=== Coins and deposit of bullion (§§13–39) ===

{{Css Image Crop|Image =1873_2C_Closed_3.jpg|bSize = 450|cWidth = 220|cHeight = 220|oTop = 4|oLeft = 3|Location = right}}

Sections 14 to 16 of the act set forth the coins authorized to be struck by the Mint Bureau. This is the part of the act that would later prove contentious, as it omitted the standard silver dollar, since 1853 the only coin into which depositors of silver bullion could have their metal struck. It did allow for a Trade dollar, of higher weight than the old coin, that depositors could have their silver made into, but the legal tender of this and all silver coins was limited to $5{{sfn|Taxay|pp=258–259}}—the old silver dollar had an unlimited legal tender.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=31}} All gold coins had unlimited legal tender, and the act made provision for the redemption of gold coin [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] below normal weight at full value, if twenty years or more old and if still containing 99.5 percent or more of the authorized weight. Lightweight gold coin that did not meet these qualifications would have the loss in value fall upon the depositor.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=54}}

Also eliminated by the 1873 act were the two-cent piece, three-cent silver and half dime.{{sfn|Taxay|p=258}} Although the first two coins circulated little, the half dime was still being heavily struck by the San Francisco Mint for use in the Far West, where paper money was disfavored.{{sfn|Breen|pp=255–258}} The coins authorized by the 1873 act were the cent, [[three-cent nickel]], five-cent nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, [[Trade dollar (United States coin)|Trade dollar]], [[gold dollar]], [[quarter eagle]], [[three-dollar piece]], [[half eagle]], [[eagle (United States coin)|eagle]], and [[double eagle]].{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=54}}

The act prescribed the specifications of each coin. No change was made to the bronze composition of the cent. The dime, quarter, and half dollar were made slightly heavier so that a dollar in these coins would weigh {{convert|25|g}}, in a nod to the metric system—the five-cent nickel already weighed {{convert|5|g}}. It required that the obverse of each American coin be emblematic of Liberty, and that an eagle must appear on the reverse, except for the small-diameter cent, three-cent nickel, five-cent nickel, dime, gold dollar, and three-dollar piece, on which an eagle could not appear. It required the use of the country's name on the reverse, and of "E Pluribus Unum" somewhere on the coin. It allowed the motto "In God We Trust" to appear on American coinage{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=55}}—continuing permission granted in the Act of March 3, 1865, which had authorized the three-cent nickel.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=47–48}} The 1873 law allowed for the redemption of current or obsolete base-metal coinage by the Treasury when presented in lots of $20 or more,{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=57}} continuing a provision enacted in 1871.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=50}}

Further provisions in this part of the act allowed depositors of silver bullion to receive their metal back in the form of bars or in Trade dollars. It forbade deposit of silver for striking into other coins, but allowed the Mint, for two years, to purchase silver bullion with silver coins at Philadelphia and at the New York Assay Office.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=56–57}} This practice, although illegal under the 1853 act, had long been permitted by Mint Directors.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=253–254}}

=== Testing and the Assay Commission (§§40–50) ===
[[File:1873 Assay Commission Medal (Julian AC-12).jpg|thumb|450px|Medal (by Chief Engraver [[William Barber (engraver)|William Barber]]) struck for the 1873 Assay Commission. The casket on the reverse honors Philadelphia Mint Assayer Jacob Eckfeldt, who had recently died.{{sfn|Pessolano-Filos|p=9}}]]
{{main article|United States Assay Commission}}

The annual [[United States Assay Commission|Assay Commission]] met at the Philadelphia Mint in most years from 1797 to 1980, when it was abolished. Consisting of government officials and members of the public, it tested the gold and silver coins issued by the Mint to ensure they met standards.{{sfn|Coin World Almanac|pp=163–164}}

The 1837 act had designated the judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]], the [[United States Attorney]] for that district, and the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia as members ''ex officio'' of the Assay Commission. The Coinage Act of 1873 kept the judge as a member, but omitted the other two, substituting the Comptroller of the Currency and the assayer of the New York [[Assay office]]. Under the 1837 act, the president was allowed to appoint members of the public each year, and this continued under the new legislation. The 1873 law also prescribed a detailed procedure for taking samples from each delivery by that mint's Coiner, sealing them in envelopes and transmitting them to Philadelphia, where the Assay Commission met each February.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=35, 59–61}}

This part of the Coinage Act also provided as to how the Coiner should settle accounts, for internal testing of coins outside the auspices of the Assay Commission, and continued the bullion fund, allowing depositors of gold or silver to receive coins or other payment without having to wait for the actual metal they had deposited to go through the coining process. The mints were required to have a set of weights conforming to the official weight weighing one troy pound purchased by the U.S. minister in London in 1827, and to have the ones at Philadelphia tested in the presence of the Assay Commission each year.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=59–61}}

=== Criminal offenses and miscellaneous provisions (§§51–67) ===
Sections 51 to 53 regulated matters that had proved controversial in past decades. Section 51 required all obverse dies (containing the date on most denominations) to be destroyed at the conclusion of each year.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=62}} Under Director Snowden in the 1850s, the Mint had restruck rare early-dated coins to sell or exchange with collectors.{{sfn|Taxay|p=191}} Medals of a national nature could be struck at Philadelphia under Section 52, but private medals were forbidden.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=62}} Until 1854, the year in which he was fired by President [[Franklin Pierce]], Peale had conducted a controversial medals business on the premises of the Philadelphia Mint.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=188–190}} Section 53 required the bureau's profits from [[seigniorage]] to be deposited in the Treasury and forbade the Mint from paying expenses or salaries from that money.{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|p=62}} Under Director Patterson (retired 1851), the Mint had retained such earnings, and spent them without congressional oversight.{{sfn|Taxay|p=180}}

The assay offices were regulated by sections 54 through 60, under the control of the Director of the Mint. Each office would be governed in a manner similar to the mints, with a superintendent in charge and two subordinate officers: an Assayer and a Melter and Refiner. Sections 61 to 64 forbade counterfeiting, intentional lightening of coins to secure metal, and other offenses, and prescribed the punishments for them. Section 65 is a transition provision, setting an April 1, 1873 effective date, as well as providing that the current Director of the Mint (Pollock) would become superintendent at Philadelphia, and the occupants of the office of Treasurer at each mint (abolished by the legislation) would become Assistant Treasurers of the United States. Section 66 names each mint and assay office, and Section 67 names the legislation as the "Coinage Act of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three".{{sfn|Bureau of the Mint|pp=62–66}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Later reaction ===

The abolition of the half dime, still circulating in the Far West, led to shortages of small change there. Congress tried to address this with the unpopular [[twenty-cent piece (United States coin)|twenty-cent piece]], which was struck for circulation only in 1875 and 1876 and was rejected by the public for its similarity to the quarter dollar. The Western United States was not fully supplied with small change until the Mint began striking cents there in 1908 and five-cent nickels in 1912.{{sfn|Breen|pp=295–298, 334}} The Trade dollar, struck principally to compete with Mexican dollars in the Far East trade, failed to gain full acceptance in the Orient. Many were returned to (or never left) the United States. As they could be purchased at a discount, they were popular among employers, who placed them in workers' pay packets. In 1876, Congress revoked even the limited legal tender status they enjoyed; in 1878, the Mint stopped striking them except for collectors, and even that limited issue ceased after 1885. In 1887, Congress allowed a six-month window during which they could be redeemed for other currency, provided they had not been [[seal (East Asia)|chopmarked]] by Asian merchants.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=124–132}}{{sfn|Taxay|p=284}}

[[File:1873-CC T$1.jpg|thumb|left|450px|The [[Trade dollar]], intended for use in the Far East, became controversial when circulated in the U.S.]]
As Friedman noted, if the price of silver had remained high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant.{{sfn|Friedman|p=1168}} By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian [[Don Taxay]], "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously."{{sfn|Taxay|p=259}} One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, [[Thomas F. Bayard]], in 1878, "at the beginning&amp;nbsp;... I was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized."{{sfn|Weinstein|p=308}}

A severe depression, the [[Panic of 1873]], began in the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold standard too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism.{{sfn|Nugent|p=195}} The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily.{{sfn|Barnett|p=179}} The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.{{sfn|Carothers|p=249}}

In early 1875, Congress passed a bill for the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act|resumption of specie payments]] (that is, in gold and silver coin)—effective in 1879.{{sfn|Carothers|p=248}} Friedman stated that had it not been for the 1873 act, resumption would have been on the effective basis of a silver standard, which he viewed as a good thing, allowing for more economic stability and "almost surely would have avoided" the downturn of the early 1890s known as the [[Panic of 1893]].{{sfn|Friedman|pp=1172–1176}}

[[File:Survival of the Fittest.jpg|thumb|right|The gold standard triumphant: a caricature from [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'' magazine]], 1900.]]
Support for bimetallism grew in the 1870s, and resulted in the passage of the [[Bland–Allison Act]] of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase millions of dollars' worth of silver bullion each month, and coin it into [[Morgan dollar|silver dollars]]—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=143, 196–198}} Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President [[Grover Cleveland]] secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=205–206}}

The [[free silver]] movement reached its height with the [[William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1896|1896 campaign]] of former Nebraska representative [[William Jennings Bryan]], who won the Democratic nomination for president after his [[Cross of Gold speech]], which decried the gold standard, electrified the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]]. Bryan was defeated in [[United States presidential election, 1896|the election]] by former Ohio governor [[William McKinley]], and in 1900, Congress passed the [[Gold Standard Act]], placing that standard into law.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=247–254}} The gold standard was departed from for many purposes by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s New Deal administration, and completely ended by President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDR takes United States off gold standard|publisher=The History Channel|accessdate=August 24, 2015|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Crime of '73" ===

[[File:1873-S 50C Arrows.jpg|thumb|right|450px|The arrows by the date of this half dollar show that it is one made after the Coinage Act increased its weight to 12.5 grams.]]
''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]]'' on April 1, 1873, reported the passage of the Coinage Act. It noted the abolition of the two-cent piece and the authorization of the Trade dollar, but did not mention the ending of the standard silver dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Coinage Act|date=April 1, 1873|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Constitution]]|page=1|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/494552455/fulltextPDF/F85B2E09464F4B40PQ/1?accountid=14541}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no widespread objection to the 1873 act until 1876. Several factors combined to bring forth protest then: tight [[Monetary policy|money policies]] by the Treasury in preparation for the resumption of specie payments, a more precipitous drop in the price of silver than had hitherto been the case, and widespread use of Trade dollars after their rejection in the Chinese market. At the same time, the [[Comstock Lode]] and other Western mining areas were producing record amounts of silver. With a depression still ongoing, silver began to be seen as a means of inflating the currency and stimulating the economy.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=179–180}}

Beginning in March 1876, former newspaper editor George Weston published letters asserting that bimetallism was mandated by the Constitution, and questioning how the Coinage Act had passed. Sympathetic newspapers began to suggest that the legislation had been enacted through corruption for the benefit of wealthy capitalists.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|pp=180–181}} On August 5, 1876, Missouri Congressman [[Richard P. Bland]] (soon to be known as "Silver Dick") told the House of Representatives, "The act of February 12, 1873 was a fraud, because its title gave no clue to the real intent of the act. The record shows that the act was stealthily passed, without reconsideration and without debate."{{sfn|Taxay|p=259}} In 1878, Congressman Kelley, who had introduced the bill into the House, stated, "I was ignorant of the fact it would demonetize the silver dollar".{{sfn|Taxay|pp=260–261}}

Often blamed by those who deemed the act a crime was British financial writer [[Ernest Seyd]], who had given advice as to the text of the bill, as attested by Congressman Hooper on the House floor in 1872.{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=190}} Seyd, according to this theory, was the agent of a group of British holders of American bonds, who had sent Seyd to America with ₤100,000 (then about $550,000) to bribe congressmen into demonetizing silver. Kelley denied this had taken place, but the story stuck, and became a common belief in the silver movement.{{sfn|Nugent|p=163}} In 1890, Seyd's corrupt involvement was asserted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Arkansas's [[Thomas C. McRae]].{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=190}} Seyd was in fact an ardent bimetallist who strongly objected to the American demonetization of silver.{{sfn|Friedman|p=1165}} He had submitted, at Hooper's request, an analysis of the bill in the course of which he advocated retaining the silver dollar as a legal tender.{{sfn|Weinstein|p=320 n.60}}

The earliest use of the phrase "Crime of 1873" in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator [[Henry M. Teller]], who on July 10, 1890, stated, "the fight for free coinage [of silver] is on, and it will stay on, too, till the will of the people shall be heard in the enactment of a law that shall put silver back where it belongs and where it would have been but for the blunder or the crime of 1873".{{sfn|Barnett|p=181}} The act had long been referred to as a "crime" without the exact phrase being used; in one 1889 speech, Nevada Senator [[William Morris Stewart|William M. Stewart]] called it a "crime" seven times. He had voted for it in 1873.{{sfn|Barnett|p=180}}{{sfn|Van Ryzin|p=116}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2668">A '''conservator''' (from {{lang-la|{{linktext|conservator|lang=la}}|lit=a keeper, preserver, defender}}),{{refn|{{Wiktionary-inline|conservator}}}} was a [[judge]] delegated by the [[pope]] to defend certain privileged classes of persons – as [[University|universities]], [[Catholic religious order]]s, [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]], the poor – from manifest or notorious injury or violence, without recourse to a [[Legal procedure|judicial process]]. Conservators were appointed as early as the 13th century.{{sfn|Fanning|1908}}

==History==
[[Pope Innocent IV]] presupposed their existence in the decree from which we first learn their power.{{refn|''[[Liber Septimus]]'', VI 1.14.15 "{{lang|la|De officio et potestate iudicis delegati}}", cited in {{harvtxt|Fanning|1908}}.}} Owing to abuses and complaints the [[Council of Trent]] limited their [[jurisdiction]],{{sfn|Fanning|1908}} but new controversies, often recurring, caused popes [[Clement VIII]], [[Gregory XV]], and [[Innocent X]] to define their privileges more precisely.{{sfn|Fanning|1908}}

Troubles continued to arise, especially concerning the conservators of religious orders. [[Pope Clement XIII]] decreed that in missionary countries such officials should no longer be chosen, but that all controversies should be referred to the [[Holy See]].{{sfn|Fanning|1908}} From that time forth conservators fell into practical [[desuetude]].{{sfn|Fanning|1908}}

According to law, these officials were to be chosen from among the [[prelate]]s or dignitaries of [[cathedral]] and [[collegiate church]]es; later from the [[synod]]al judges. When a conservator had been chosen by [[regular clergy]] he could not be removed for five years without cause. He had no jurisdiction in cases that required juridical examination. While he took {{linktext|cognizance}} of all complaints against regular clergy, he had no authority to receive those of the regular clergy against others unless they were notorious. In the latter case the conservator decided the question summarily. He could punish with ecclesiastical penalties even high church dignitaries who interfered with his duties. His power was limited, however, to the one [[diocese]] in which be had been elected, nor could the same conservator have power in several dioceses.{{sfn|Fanning|1908}}

The term '''convening authority''' is used in [[United States]] [[Military justice|military law]] to refer to an individual with certain legal powers granted under either the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (i.e. the regular military justice system) or the [[Military Commissions Act of 2009]] (for the [[Guantanamo military commissions]]).

==Uniform Code of Military Justice==
The term "convening authority" is used in the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) when referring to an individual whose function is of critical importance in the US military justice system. The persons who may exercise this authority are defined in article 22 ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|822}}) for [[Courts-martial in the United States|general court-martial]], article 23 ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|823}}) for special court-martial, and article 24 ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|824}}) for summary court-martial. The convening authority decides on the disposition of cases to investigation and trial, and also selects the members of a court-martial.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote=In referring a matter to court-martial, the CO becomes the convening authority. As such, the CO decides what charges to refer to the court-martial; what type of courts-martial; and selects the court-martial members (jury).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointees serve as the military judge and members of the "panel", which decides the guilt or innocence of a person standing trial before the court-martial or military commission.{{dubious|what about article 15 hearings...|reason=Doesn't the convening authority ALSO appoint individuals to article 15 hearings -- which are not courts martial|date=March 2015}}  When an enlisted member is on trial, he or she may demand that enlisted members be included on the panel.&lt;!--RCM Rule 503 --&gt; The court-martial then reports back to the convening authority their recommended verdict.&lt;ref name=UsCodeConveningAuthority&gt;

| quote=The findings and sentence of a court-martial shall be reported promptly to the convening authority after the announcement of the sentence. 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a civilian trial, the convening authority's "command prerogative" entitles them to amend or overturn the sentence of a court-martial. However, the convening authority may not set aside a finding of not guilty or increase the severity of a recommended punishment.&lt;!--Yes, citation not provided at present. But it is at RCM section 1107. --&gt;

While normally only exercised in practice by members of the armed forces, six civilian officials can also act as a convening authority: the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the three "service secretaries" (the [[Secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], and [[Secretary of the Air Force]]), and the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] (when the [[United States Coast Guard]] is under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and has not been transferred to the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] under the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]).

==Military Commissions Act==
The individual in over-all charge of the [[Guantanamo military commissions]] is also called the convening authority, and it broadly mirrors the provisions found in the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].
The first three incumbents were civilian officials, although the first and third incumbents, [[John D. Altenburg]] and [[Bruce MacDonald (American lawyer)|Bruce MacDonald]], were retired military [[flag officer]]s.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Altenburg-Quit"&gt;

The '''copyright status of ''The Wizard of Oz'' and related works''' is complicated for several reasons.  The book series is very long-running, and written by multiple authors, so the books often fall on opposite sides of eligibility for copyright laws.  There have also been multiple adaptations across many different media, which enjoy different kinds of copyright protection.  The [[copyright law of the United States]] has changed many times, and impacted Oz works every time.  Currently, twenty-three Oz books and five movies are in the public domain.  Nothing else will enter the [[public domain]] until 2019 at the earliest.  All of the [[Famous Forty]] will be in the public domain in 2059, barring another extension of [[copyright terms]].

==Books==

===L. Frank Baum===
When [[L. Frank Baum]] began publishing the Oz books, the copyright law in effect was the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], which provided a 28-year term with a possible fourteen more years upon renewal of the copyright.  However, the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] retroactively affected Baum's books, allowing a 28-year renewal for fifty-six total years of copyright protection.  The [[L. Frank Baum Trust]] renewed the copyright on all of Baum's Oz novels.

''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' was published in 1900, and was the first to enter the public domain in ''1956''.  This allowed [[Reilly &amp; Lee]], the publisher of all the other Oz books (as well as Baum's other books) to issue their own edition of ''The Wizard of Oz'', which had previously been published by [[George M. Hill Company]] and later by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company|Bobbs Merill Company]] after Hill went bankrupt..

''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', which was published in 1904, followed suit and entered public domain in 1960.

All of Baum's subsequent Oz books, published between 1907 and 1920, had their copyright extended by subsequent laws.  Between 1962 and 1974, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed nine copyright acts extending the copyright one or two years each time (these acts also introduced the rule that rounds the copyright term up to the end of that calendar year).  This ensured that all works published after September 1906 (and renewed as necessary) stayed copyrighted until the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] took effect.&lt;ref&gt;US Copyright Office, [http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf "Duration of Copyright"]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 Act extended the renewal to 47 years, meaning works could stay copyrighted for 75 years after publication.  Thus, the rest of Baum's Oz books did not enter public domain until the 75-year terms was up.  ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (published in 1907) was the first to enter the public domain in 1983, and the subsequent books followed, with ''[[Glinda of Oz]]'' (published in 1920) finally entering the public domain in 1996.

This accounts for all of the apocryphal Oz books that sprang forth in the [[1980s]]; once more Oz books entered the public domain, it allowed other authors to utilize those elements in their own works.

All of Baum's [[L. Frank Baum#Bibliography|other works]] - non-Oz books, plays, and musicals - are also in the public domain, and have been since 1995 at the latest.

===Ruth Plumly Thompson===
The first two books written by [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], ''[[The Royal Book of Oz]]'' (published in 1921) and ''[[Kabumpo in Oz]]'' (published 1922), entered the public domain 75 years later (1997 and 1998, respectively) pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1976.
The next twelve books (''[[The Cowardly Lion of Oz]]'' through ''[[Speedy in Oz]]'', published between 1923 and 1934) were still copyrighted when the 1998 [[Sonny Bono Act]] extended the copyright term a further twenty years, meaning works would now be copyrighted for 95 years.  These twelve books of Thompson's are therefore still copyrighted, and will not begin entering the public domain until 2019.  By 2030, all of them will be in the public domain.

Thompson did not renew the copyright on her last five canonical books: ''[[The Wishing Horse of Oz]]'', ''[[Captain Salt in Oz]]'', ''[[Handy Mandy in Oz]]'', ''[[The Silver Princess in Oz]]'', and ''[[Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz]]''.  Thus, these books entered the public domain 28 years after publication, between 1963 and 1967.
Congress [[Copyright Term Extension Act|amended the copyright law in 1992]] so there would subsequently be automatic renewals of copyright.  Therefore, the copyright on Thompson's deutero-canonical books ''[[Yankee in Oz]]'' (published in 1972) and ''[[The Enchanted Island of Oz]]'' (published in 1976) will not expire until 2068 and 2072 respectively.

===John R. Neill===
[[John R. Neill]]'s three canonical Oz books – ''[[The Wonder City of Oz]]'', ''[[The Scalawagons of Oz]]'', and ''[[Lucky Bucky in Oz]]'' – were published between 1940 and 1942.  Neill's heirs renewed the copyrights, so these books will not enter the public domain until 2036 through 2038, pursuant to the 95-year term.
A fourth Oz book by Neill – ''[[The Runaway in Oz]]'' – was written by Neill in 1943.  It was published posthumously in 1995.  The 1976 Copyright Act introduced an alternate copyright terms for all works published after 1977, stating that the new copyright term would be fifty years after the death of the author.  However, for all works that were published posthumously after 1977, the law treats them as if the author died no sooner than 1977.  The Sonny Bono Act upheld this, but increased the term to seventy years after the author's death.  Therefore, although Neill died in 1943, The Runaway in Oz will not enter public domain until 2048.

===Jack Snow===
Snow published two canonical Oz books: ''[[The Magical Mimics in Oz]]'' in 1946, and ''[[The Shaggy Man of Oz]]'' in 1949.  The copyright was never renewed on either of these, so they entered the public domain in 1974 and 1977, respectively.  They are the last two Oz books that entered the public domain.

===Rachel Cosgrove===
''[[The Hidden Valley of Oz]]'' was published by [[Rachel Cosgrove]] in 1951, had the copyright renewed, and therefore will enter public domain in 2047.

Cosgrove also wrote ''[[The Wicked Witch of Oz]]'' in 1954.  However, it was not published until 1993.  Since it was published after 1977, it will remain copyrighted for seventy years after the author's death.  Cosgrove died in 1998, so ''The Wicked Witch of Oz'' will enter public domain in 2069.

===Eloise Jarvis McGraw and Lauren Lynn McGraw===
The McGraws' canonical book, ''[[Merry Go Round in Oz]]'', was published in 1963.  No renewal was needed, so it will enter the public domain in 2059.  It will be the last book in the Famous Forty to enter the public domain.

The McGraws co-wrote another Oz book, ''[[The Forbidden Fountain of Oz]]'', which was published in 1980.  Its copyright lasts for seventy years after the death of last living author. [[Lauren Lynn McGraw|Lauren McGraw]] is still alive, so ''The Forbidden Fountain of Oz'' will enter the public domain seventy years after her death.  Since it will remain copyrighted until at least 2085, it will be the last deutero-canonical work to enter the public domain.

[[Eloise McGraw]] wrote ''[[The Rundelstone of Oz]]'' by herself, and it was published posthumously in 2001.  Since Eloise McGraw died in 2000, it will enter the public domain in 2071.
All other Oz books (with the exception of the special cases listed below) are still copyrighted under the current laws of 70 years after author's death.

==Infringements on the ''Oz'' books ==

===Frank Baum===
Baum's son, [[Frank Joslyn Baum]], wrote his own Oz story – ''[[The Laughing Dragon of Oz]]''.  He tried to get it published by Reilly &amp; Lee, but they refused, and he published it with [[Whitman Publishing Company]] in 1934.  This was an infringing work at the time – all of the Oz books were still copyrighted, and the rights were held by Frank Baum's mother, [[Maud Gage Baum]].
Both Maud Baum and Reilly &amp; Lee sued Frank Baum and Whitman Publishing.  The case was settled and ''The Laughing Dragon'' stayed out of print until 2006.  However, its copyright was renewed in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Office, Library of Congress.[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ychAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1965#v=onepage&amp;q=laughing%20dragon&amp;f=false "Catalog of Copyright Entries 1962 July-December"]&lt;/ref&gt; so it will remain copyrighted until 2030, per the 95-year term.
''The Laughing Dragon of Oz'' was the first high-profile case of infringement on the Oz books, and it would be the first of many.

===Alexander Volkov===
[[Alexander Melentyevich Volkov|Alexander Volkov]]'s six Oz books were published in the [[Soviet Union]], so they are subject to [[Russian copyright law]].  The first book – ''[[The Wizard of the Emerald City]]'' – was published in 1939, when ''The Wizard of Oz'' was still copyrighted.  ''The Wizard of the Emerald City'' is an adaptation of ''The Wizard of Oz'', borrowing liberally from the original book without even crediting Baum.
The subsequent four books were published between 1963 and 1970, and the last one – ''[[The Secret of the Deserted Castle]]'' – was published in 1980.  At the time of publication, ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''The Land of Oz'' were in the public domain, but the other Oz books were still copyrighted.  However, Volkov's books are mostly original sequels to ''The Wizard of the Emerald City'', so whether they are infringing or not is difficult to say.  Barely any of the elements from later Oz books are featured in Volkov's works, so most likely they were not infringing.

The Soviet Union did not have [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union#Accession to the UCC in 1973|international copyright relations]] until 1973, when it joined the 1971 Paris version of the [[Universal Copyright Convention]].  This meant that when ''The Secret of the Deserted Castle'' was published in 1982, it was automatically copyrighted in the United States.  However, the UCC did not work retroactively, so Volkov's first five works were not copyrighted in the US.

Russia joined the [[Berne convention]] in 1995, which ensured that the US and Russia (and all other member countries) had to retroactively recognize all existing copyrights in the opposite countries.  That included Volkov's first five books, which were now copyrighted under US law.

The copyright lasts for seventy years after the author's death in Russia, as of a 2004 amendment.  Volkov died in 1977, so all of his books will enter the public domain in 2048.  In the meantime, other Russian authors are continuing Volkov's Oz series, much as American authors posthumously continued Baum's series.  Volkov's works received faithful and legitimate English translations by [[Peter Blystone]] in 1991, 1993, and 2007.

===March Laumer===
[[March Laumer]] infringed on both American and Russian Oz writers, though he never saw any repercussions because his works were not considered significant enough to fight.  He published Oz books between 1978 and 1999, but incorporated elements from all the preceding Oz writers, most of whose works were still copyrighted.

He collaborated with [[Chris Dulabone]] to release an English translation of ''[[The Yellow Fog]]'' in 1986.  The two writers then adapted ''[[The Seven Underground Kings]]'' into ''The Underground Kings of Oz'' in 1993.  Both of these works, while clearly infringing on Volkov's works, were legal in the US at the time.  This preceded Russia's accession to the Berne convention, and the US did not recognize the copyright on any Russian work published before 1973 (''The Yellow Fog'' and ''The Seven Underground Kings'' were published in 1970 and 1964, respectively).

==Feature film adaptations==

===Silent Oz films===
The copyright on the [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1910 film)|1910 film]] entered public domain in 1938. Baum's [[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)|Oz]] [[The Magic Cloak of Oz|Film]] [[His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz|Manufacturing]] Company movies entered public domain in 1942. and then the [[Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 Larry Semon movie version of ''The Wizard of Oz'']] entered the public domain in 1954.  These films remain the only Oz live action movies in the public domain.

===1939 film===
The [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 version]] of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is the most well-known adaptation of ''The Wizard of Oz''; in many respects, its popularity surpassed the original book.  Its copyright was renewed in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Office, Library of Congress. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=oz;id=mdp.39015084450975;view=image;seq=136;num=100;start=1;size=125;page=root;orient=0  "Catalog of Copyright Entries 1966-1969 Motion Pictures"]&lt;/ref&gt; so it will remain copyrighted for a 95-year term, entering the public domain in 2035.  This has caused issues for most subsequent Oz adaptations, especially because WB (the current owners of the copyright), have been very aggressive in protecting the film's copyright.  Recently, they went after potential merchandise for the upcoming ''[[Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return]]''.

In a landmark case, [http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/11/07/101743P.pdf  WB v. AVELA (2011)], the US [[Eighth Circuit]] ruled that any visual depictions and aspects of characters in public domain developed solely for the copyrighted movies are under copyright protection. This was significant, because the film is not a particularly faithful adaptation of the book, so much of it is still protected.  (In the case, AVELA was utilizing the promotional materials for the film, and the court ruled that those images are not copyrighted and therefore may be used, but only those exact images may be used.)&lt;ref&gt;Stacia Lay, [http://iplaw.hllaw.com/2011/07/articles/copyright/warner-bros-largely-wins-appeal-in-copyright-infringement-case-involving-use-of-film-publicity-materials-in-the-public-domain/ "Warner Bros. Largely Wins Appeal..."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140324221733/http://iplaw.hllaw.com/2011/07/articles/copyright/warner-bros-largely-wins-appeal-in-copyright-infringement-case-involving-use-of-film-publicity-materials-in-the-public-domain/ |date=2014-03-24 }}, ''IP Law Chat'', July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journey Back to Oz===
''[[Journey Back to Oz]]'' was a 1974 [[animated film]] that served as an official [[sequel]] to the 1939 movie, as well as a very loose adaptation of ''The Land of Oz'' (which was in public domain by then).  It is just about the only film that could borrow from the 1939 movie without issue.  It was copyrighted in 1971 as it was nearing completion.

===Return to Oz===
The 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'' was based on ''The Land of Oz'' and ''Ozma of Oz''.  [[Disney]] owned the rights to adapt all of Baum's books except ''The Wizard of Oz'', but this did not matter because by 1985 both ''The Land of Oz'' and ''Ozma of Oz'' were in the public domain.

The only element that ''Return to Oz'' used from the 1939 movie was the ruby slippers – in the book, the slippers were silver.  The ruby slippers had become so iconic due to the MGM movie, Disney paid handsomely for the rights to use them. [http://www.waltdisneysreturntooz.com/Ruby.htm]

===Oz the Great and Powerful===
The 2013 film ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]'' was technically a [[prequel]] to the 1939 movie, but it was not allowed to be considered as such.  The filmmakers had to toe a fine line between calling the film to mind but not infringing on it.  To that end, they had a copyright expert on set to ensure that no infringement occurred.

The copyright expert had to make sure that the Wicked Witch's shade of green was distinct enough from [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]'s shade of green.  The expert also ensured that the [[Emerald City]] was not too close in appearance to the Emerald City in the 1939 film.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Staskiewicz, [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20679726_2,00.html "Hello, Yellow Brick Road"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', March 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

While WB and Disney did not engage in a copyright battle, they did file rival trademarks.  Disney filed a [[trademark]] on "Oz the Great and Powerful."  One week later, WB filed its own trademark for "The Great and Powerful Oz."  The [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] suspended WB's attempt at a trademark because Disney had filed basically the same one a week earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Eriq Gardner, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wizard-of-oz-disney-warner-bros-289305 "Disney, Warner Bros. Fighting Over 'Wizard of Oz' Trademarks"], ''Hollywood Reporter'', February 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cushing, [http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130304/18411522197/insanity-making-wizard-oz-film-todays-ip-climate.shtml "The Insanity of Making a 'Wizard of Oz' Film in Today's IP Climate"], ''Tech Dirt'', March 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Wicked Witch of the West==
[[The Wicked Witch of the West]] is one of the most iconic [[villain]]s of modern times.  However, the iconic version of the Wicked Witch is Margaret Hamilton's portrayal in the 1939 movie, which is copyrighted.  The character of the Wicked Witch from the book is in public domain, but that version of the Wicked Witch is not even green.  Most modern portrayals of the Wicked Witch of the West do make her green, because that is how the public thinks of the Wicked Witch, but they all strive to make her appearance somehow distinctive.
The Wicked Witch is not given a name in the books, so subsequent authors gave her their own names.  All of these names are protected under copyright as part of their respective works, which means new creators have to keep coming up with their own version.  Some of the most well-known incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West are "[[Elphaba]]" (''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''), "Theodora" (''Oz the Great and Powerful''), "Zelena" (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV Series)|Once Upon a Time]]''), "Evillene" (''[[The Wiz]]''), and "Azkadellia" (''[[Tin Man (TV miniseries)|Tin Man]]'').
There are similar issues regarding portrayals of the [[Wicked Witch of the East]], but she is not as prevalent in the public conscious as her Western sister.

{{short description|a person's choice to deny reality, as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth}}
In the psychology of [[human behavior]], '''denialism''' is a person's choice to [[denial|deny]] [[reality]], as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable [[truth]].{{sfn|Maslin|2009}} Denialism is an essentially [[irrational]] action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an [[empirical]]ly verifiable reality.{{sfn|O'Shea|2008|p=20}} In the sciences, denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed, well-supported parts of the [[scientific consensus]] on a subject, in favor of radical and controversial ideas.{{sfn|Scudellari|2010}} The terms ''[[Holocaust denialism]]'' and ''[[AIDS denialism]]'' describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters,&lt;ref&gt;Usages of Holocaust and AIDS denialism:
{{harvnb|Kim|2007}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|2007}}; {{harvnb|Smith|Novella|2007|p=e256}}; {{harvnb|Watson|2006|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Nature Medicine's editor|2006|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''[[climate change denial]]'' describes denial of the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that the [[climate change]] of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;Usages of global-warming denialism: {{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|page=425}} {{harvnb|Colquhoun|2009|p=b3658}}; {{harvnb|Connelly|2007}}; {{harvnb|Goodman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus.{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}
The motivations and causes of denialism include religion and self-interest (economic, political, financial) and [[defence mechanisms]] meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas.{{sfn|Hambling|2009}}{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}}

==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
Anthropologist [[Didier Fassin]] distinguishes between ''[[denial]]'', defined as "the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied", and ''denialism'', which he defines as "an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth".&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"&gt;Didier Fassin, ''When bodies remember: experiences and politics of AIDS in South Africa'', Volume 15 of California Series in Public Anthropology, [[University of California Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25027-7}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jn9yoyuEV1YC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and [[scientific consensus]] engage in ''denialism'' when they use [[rhetoric]]al tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate, when there is none.{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}} Rick Stoff quoted [[Chris Hoofnagle]]—a senior staff attorney at the [[Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic]] and a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]]—as follows:
{{quote|Then there are those who engage in denialist tactics because they are protecting some "overvalued idea" which is critical to their identity. Since legitimate dialogue is not a valid option for those who are interested in protecting bigoted or unreasonable ideas from scientific facts, their only recourse is to use these types of rhetorical tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoff |first=Rick |date=June 2007 |title='Denialism' and muddying the waters |journal=St. Louis Journalism Review |volume=37 |issue=296 |pages=21–33, 2p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2003 newspaper article, [[Edwin Cameron]]—a senior South African judge who has [[AIDS]]—described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and by those who deny that the [[AIDS pandemic]] is due to infection with HIV. He states that "For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence".&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic-90503.html The dead hand of denialism] [[Edwin Cameron]]. [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this they employ "distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic."&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt;  Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to "make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics",&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt; as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources.

A 2009 article published in the journal ''[[Globalization and Health]]'' also notes "recourse to data debates and [[pseudo-scientific]] 'evidence{{'"}} as a common feature of several types of denialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chazan M, Brklacich M, Whiteside A |title=Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research |journal=[[Global Health]] |volume=5 |issue= |page=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19807923 |pmc=2764568 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-5-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area which British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] mentioned as part of his analysis of the [[David Irving]]'s work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued  [[Deborah Lipstadt]] for libel:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 6. General Conclusion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140414/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 |date=October 12, 2007 }} Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Mark Hoofnagle]] (brother of [[Chris Hoofnagle]]) has described denialism as "the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none".{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}{{efn|"AIDS denialism is one of several incarnations of denialism. All denialism is defined by rhetorical tactics designed to give the impression of a legitimate debate among experts when in fact there is none. [[Holocaust deniers]] claim that historians disagree about the evidence for Nazi mass gassings and systematic murder of Jews. Global warming denialists say that climatologists are torn by the evidence about climate change.

# [[Conspiracy theories]] – Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in "a conspiracy to suppress the truth".
# [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] – Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research.
# [[False attribution|False experts]] – Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility.
# [[Moving the goalpost]] – Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence.
# Other [[logical fallacies]] – Usually one or more of [[false analogy]], [[appeal to consequences]], [[straw man]], or [[red herring]].

Tara Smith of the [[University of Iowa]] also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the "majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory" in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own "unproven ideas will fill the void".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310459&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The fanaticism of denial that must be exposed |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |author=Tara Smith |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 author [[Michael Specter]] defined group denialism as "when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie".&lt;ref name="Specter 2009"&gt;

==Prescriptive and polemic==
If one party to a debate accuses the other of ''denialism'' they are framing the debate. This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and [[polemic]]. Prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim; [[polemic]] since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other's motives.&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"/&gt;

Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known, advocates who use the term "denialist" in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than holocaust deniers. For example, in an essay discussing the general importance of skepticism, [[Clive James]] objected to the use of the word denialist to describe climate change skeptics, stating that it "calls up the spectacle of a fanatic denying the Holocaust";{{sfn|James|2009}} and [[Celia Farber]] has objected to the term ''AIDS denialists'', arguing that it is unjustifiable to place this belief on the same moral level with the Nazi crimes against humanity.{{sfn|Farber|2006}} However, [[Robert Gallo]] ''et al.'' defended this latter comparison, stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of [[pseudoscience]] that "contradicts an immense body of research".{{sfn|Gallo|Geffen|Gonsalves|Jefferys|2006}}

Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at [[Exeter University]], has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of "deny", akin to "disown" (as in the [[Apostle Peter]] [[Denial of Peter|denying Jesus]]), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that "An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness." He suggests that, by the introduction of the word ''denier'' into further areas of historical and scientific debate, "One of the great achievements of [[The Enlightenment]]—the liberation of historical and [[scientific enquiry]] from [[dogma]]—is quietly being reversed", and that this should worry liberal-minded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Edward |last=Skidelsky |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/words-that-think-for-us-3/ |title=Words that think for us: The tyranny of denial |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]| accessdate=10 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use: scientific denialism==

===Flat Earth===
{{main|Flat Earth|Modern flat Earth societies}}

The [[superseded scientific theories|superseded belief]] that the [[Earth]] is [[flat Earth|flat]], and [[denial]] of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately [[spheroid]] [[globe]] that rotates around its axis and revolves around the [[Sun]], persists into the [[21st century]]. Modern proponents of flat-Earth [[cosmology]] (or [[flat-earther]]s) refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence, dismissing all [[spaceflight]]s and images from space as [[hoax]]es and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of [[conspiracy theory|conspiring]] to "hide the truth". They also claim that no actual [[satellite]]s are [[orbit]]ing the Earth, that the [[International Space Station]] is fake, and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand [[cover-up]].

[[belief perseverance|Adherents]] of the modern flat-Earth model propose that a dome-shaped [[firmament]] encloses a disk-shaped Earth. They commonly claim that the Sun is only [[Samuel Rowbotham|3,000 miles]] above the Earth and that the [[Moon]] and the Sun orbit above, but not around, a flat Earth. Modern flat-earthers believe that [[Antarctica]] is not a continent but a massive [[ice flow]], with a wall 150 feet or higher, which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything (including all the oceans' water) from falling off the edge.

Flat-earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore [[Antarctica]], despite contrary evidence. According to them, all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city [[skyline]]s and clouds below the horizon, revealing the [[curvature of the Earth]], have been [[photo manipulation|manipulated]], [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or somehow faked. Therefore, regardless of any scientific or [[empirical evidence]] provided, flat-earthers will [[delusion|stubbornly conclude]] it is fabricated or altered in some way.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listverse.com/2016/02/01/10-absurd-claims-of-modern-flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists/ |title=10 Absurd Claims of Modern Flat Earth Conspiracy Theorists |last=Nixon |first=Eli |publisher=Listverse |date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity, sunsets, tides, eclipses, distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model, claimants replace commonly-accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort how perspective, mass, boyancy, light or other physical systems work.  These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other, finally leaving many flat-Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain "mysteries" and more investigation is to be done.  In this conclusion, adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model, shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism.

===AIDS===
{{main|HIV/AIDS denialism}}
[[AIDS denialism]] is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Essex M |title=AIDS denialism and public health practice |journal=AIDS Behav |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=237–47 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20058063 |doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS denialism has been described as being "among the most vocal anti-science denial movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalichman SC, Eaton L, Cherry C |title="There is no Proof that HIV Causes AIDS": AIDS Denialism Beliefs among People Living with HIV/AIDS |journal=J Behav Med |volume= 33|issue= 6|pages= 432–40|date=June 2010 |pmid=20571892 |doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7 |pmc=3015095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless [[passenger virus]] and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of [[recreational drug use]], malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral medication]], rather than infection with HIV.

===Climate change===
{{main|Climate change denial}}
{{see also|Politicization of science}}
Some international corporations, such as [[ExxonMobil]], have contributed to "fake citizens' groups and bogus scientific bodies" that claim that the [[scientific opinion on climate change|science]] of [[global warming]] is inconclusive, according to a criticism by [[George Monbiot]].{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}} ExxonMobil did not deny making the financial contributions, but its spokesman stated that the company's financial support for scientific reports did not mean it [[funding bias|influenced the outcome]] of those studies. "The recycling of this type of discredited [[conspiracy theory]] diverts attention from the real challenge at hand: how to provide the energy needed to improve global living standards while also [[mitigation of global warming|reducing]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]: ''[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/08/07/gore-exxon.html Gore takes aim at corporately funded climate research].''

===Evolution===
{{main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution. [[Evolution]] is still considered an undisputed fact within the [[scientific community]] and in [[academia]], where the [[level of support for evolution]] is essentially universal, yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists.{{sfn|Myers|2006}}{{sfn|NSTA|2007}}{{sfn|IAP|2006}}{{sfn|AAAS|2006}}{{sfn|Pinholster|2006}} The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]]'s [[creation myth]]. Many [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christians teach [[creationism]] as if it were fact under the banners of [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]]. Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global [[flood myth]], [[geocentrism]], and the belief that the [[Young Earth creationism|Earth is only 6,000-10,000]]  [[Age of the Earth|years old]].&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

However, safety concerns cannot, as yet, be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available.&lt;p&gt;When seeking to optimise the balance between benefits and risks, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and, above all, learn from accumulating knowledge and experience. Any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment. As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis.&lt;p&gt;Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects.&lt;p&gt;The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations. The BMA shares the view that there is no robust evidence to prove that GM foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/|title=Public and Scientists' Views on Science and Society|first1=Cary|last1=Funk|first2=Lee|last2=Rainie|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=February 24, 2016|quote="The largest differences between the public and the AAAS scientists are found in beliefs about the safety of eating genetically modified (GM) foods.

Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit [[Intention|intentional behaviors]]. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the [[neurological substrate]]s that generate consciousness.

Despite wide scientific consensus that [[pain in animals|some animals can experience pain]] and suffering,&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt; this is often denied when it is convenient for people to do so. Such denial occurs for animals on farms, in laboratories, and those used for entertainment,&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wicks, D.|title=Silence and denial in everyday life - The case of animal suffering|journal=Animals|volume=1|issue=1|year=2011|pages=186–199|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/1/1/186/htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reus, E.  |author2=Olivier, D.|year=2007|title=Mind-matter for animals matters: Science and the denial of animal consciousness|journal=[[Between the Species]]|volume=13|issue=7|pages=6|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2007v13n7.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sollund"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sollund, R.|editor=Sollund, R.|year=2008|chapter=Causes for speciesism: Difference, distance and denial|title=Global Harms: Ecological Crime and Speciesism|publisher=New York: Nova Science Publishers|pages=109–131|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=7439}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animals may come to be viewed as [[Commodity status of animals|commodities]]. A study in 2013 reported that male undergraduates in the US denied animal suffering to justify eating meat.&lt;ref name="Rothgerber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rothgerber, H.|year=2013|title=Real men don’t eat (vegetable) quiche: Masculinity and the justification of meat consumption|journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity|volume=14|issue=4|pages=363–375|doi=10.1037/a0030379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial of animal pain and suffering is often inconsistent between related species. Such beliefs have led to the publication of books such as ''[[Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows]]'' written by social psychologist [[Melanie Joy]] in which she popularised the term ''[[carnism]]''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011"&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Joy, M.|title=Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=1573245054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of animal pain and suffering can also lead to denial of broader concepts, such as denial of moral status&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson, S.D.|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/|accessdate=July 9, 2016|publisher=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|title=Animals and ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the existence of "mind"&lt;ref name="Bastian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bastian, B., Loughnan, S., Haslam, N. and Radke, H.R.|year=2012|title=Don’t mind meat?

[[India]] celebrates [[October 17]] as the '''Digital Society Day'''.

==Importance of October 17 for India==
October 17 is significant for the Digital Society in India since it was on October 17, 2000, that [[Information Technology Act|Information Technology Act 2000]], the first law of the digital society in India was notified. This notification gave for the first time in the country, legal recognition for electronic documents. It also provided a legally recognized method of authentication of electronic documents by means of digital signatures. Additionally, Information Technology Act 2000 recognized Cyber Crimes and prescribed a fast track grievance redressal mechanism for Cyber Crimes.

These provisions were critical for the development of digital society since it enabled digital contracts to be formed in support of e-commerce and e-governance. It is therefore appropriate that the day be remembered as an important event in the e-history of India.
Cyber Law College was the first organization in India to recognize October 17 as a "Digital Society Day" and undertake specific programmes related to the fulfillment of the objectives of the Information technology Act.
Digital Society Foundation of India, a Charitable Trust promoted by Naavi the founder of Cyber Law College has also started several activities to encourage the participation of the community in creating better awareness of Cyber Laws in India.

October 17 also being the Poverty Alleviation Day, and Poverty Alleviation through ICT being the theme of the WSIS, Digital Society Foundation is undertaking projects that would help Digital Society contribute to the alleviation of poverty in rural India.

The formal celebration of the day started in 2006 at Bangalore where in an event organized by  Digital Society Foundation, a trust promoted by Cyber Law College  October 17 formally declared as the Digital Society Day by the honourable Judge of Karnataka High Court Sri N Kumar.Since then, this historic day has been commemorated each with activities of interest to the digital society in India.

'''DrinkOrDie''' ('''DoD''') was one of the most prestigious underground [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]] group and [[warez]] trading network during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warez Wars |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.04/ff_warez_pr.html |first=David |last=McCandless |date=1997-04-05 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2001, a major law enforcement raid - known as [[Operation Buccaneer]] - forced it to close under criminal charges of [[copyright infringement|infringement]]. DoD, as a rule, received no financial [[profit (economics)|profit]] for their activities. The DoD network - which primarily consisted of [[university]] [[undergraduate]]s - was also supported by software company employees, who would leak copies of software and other [[digital media]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.DoD was also actively involved in illicit [[computer file|file]]-trading with other networks.

==History==

===Start up and trading===
DrinkOrDie was founded in 1993 in [[Moscow]] by a [[Russia]]n with the [[pseudonym|handle]] "deviator" aka "Jimmy Jamez" and a friend who went by the code name "CyberAngel." By 1995, the group was global with Jimmy Jamez as leader.

One of its earliest major accomplishments was the [[Internet]] release of [[Windows 95]] two weeks before [[Microsoft]] released the official version.&lt;ref name="spoils"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pirates on the Web, Spoils on the Street |first=Jennifer |last=Lee |date=2002-07-11 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/technology/pirates-on-the-web-spoils-on-the-street.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known for its DoD [[DVD]] Speed Ripper released in 1999 shortly before [[DeCSS]]. The activity of the DoD group diminished after 1996, and they were not considered major players in the [[warez scene]] by 2000.

===Member raids===
In 2001 the group was busted in a [[U.S. Customs]] operation called [[Operation Buccaneer]]. The global raids were initiated after information was given to United States Customs by James Cudney, known as Bcrea8tiv. Cudney quickly rose up the ranks of DOD council where he spent many years working undercover for US Customs, logging conversations in chat rooms and channels visited on IRC. He also carried out undercover operations in the UK, France, and the US prior to the arrests collecting detailed information on DOD members and members of other online warez groups. e.g., screenames, ftp locations, nationalities. At the time, DrinkOrDie allegedly had two leaders, one in the [[United States]] and another in [[Australia]].

====Australia====

Co-leader [[Hew Raymond Griffiths]], known by his [[user (computing)|handle]] "Bandido", was a British national and long-term Australian resident from [[Bateau Bay, New South Wales|Bateau Bay]] on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] of [[New South Wales]].  He was charged in 2003 with copyright infringement and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement under US legislation. He fought extradition to the US for over 3 years, and was arbitrarily detained by Australia for most of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Piracy king to serve 15 months in US |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/piracy-king-to-serve-15-months-in-us/2007/06/23/1182019432307.html |first=Anthony |last=Stavrinos |date=2007-06-24 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2012-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109054842/http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/piracy-king-to-serve-15-months-in-us/2007/06/23/1182019432307.html |archivedate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths was ultimately unsuccessful and in early February 2007, he was extradited to the US.  He pleaded guilty on 20 April 2007 to one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and one count of criminal copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/aussie-software-pirate-extradited/2007/05/06/1178390182639.html?page=fullpage |title=Aussie software pirate extradited |first=Kenneth |last=Nguyen |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2007 Griffiths was sentenced to 51 months in prison for conspiracy to commit copyright infringement. But the US District Court Judge, Claude M Hilton, took into account the almost three years Griffiths had spent in Australian jails while fighting extradition, meaning he only served 15 months in a US jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=US piracy sentence due for 'Bandido' |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/us-piracy-sentence-due-for-bandido/2007/06/16/1181414611488.html |first=Anthony |last=Stavrinos |date=2007-06-17 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2012-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906130158/http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/us-piracy-sentence-due-for-bandido/2007/06/16/1181414611488.html |archivedate=2008-09-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK====
As a result of [[Operation Buccaneer]], the UK's [[National Hi-Tech Crime Unit]] also arrested 6 members living in Britain.  Two of them ran a 9-month trial starting in September 2004 at the Central Criminal Court - [[Old Bailey]] and were convicted for Conspiracy to Defraud Software Companies and Institutions. Sentences for those convicted ranged from house arrest to 30 months in prison.

====Elsewhere====

Apart from Griffiths and the British defendants, others implicated in DoD were Swedish, German, Norwegian, Italian and Finnish nationals. All except Griffiths were dealt with under the copyright or fraud laws of their own country. Griffiths was the only member of the international network to be extradited to the US. This has set an important benchmark in copyright enforcement for the US Department of Justice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">The '''Driver License Compact''' is an agreement between states in the [[United States|United States of America]]. The compact is used to exchange data between motorist's home state and a state where the motorist incurred a vehicular infraction. Not all states are members, and states respond to the data differently.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.csg.org/ncic/Compact.aspx?id=56&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Under the Driver License Compact, which is a series of laws within the adopting states in the United States and adopting provinces of Canada, in order for a driver's state to penalize him/her for an out-of-state offense, the driver's state must have the equivalent statute. If the driver's state does not have the statute, no action can be taken. For example, the state of [[Indiana]] does not have a careless driving offense whereas [[Colorado]] does. If an Indiana licensed driver gets convicted of careless driving in Colorado, the [[Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles]] takes no action.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

The Driver License Compact came into existence with [[Nevada]] becoming the first member in 1960. Organizations in the Western States such as governors came together to cooperate on traffic safety.  Under the Beamer Resolution ("Interstate Compacts for Highway Safety Resolution"), Public Law 85-684, enacted on August 20, 1958, 72 Stat. 635 (named for Rep. [[John V. Beamer]], R-Indiana),&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_72_Part_1.djvu/677&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2018}} states were automatically given permission to form compacts in the areas of traffic safety.  Originally, the Driver License Compact dealt with dangerous driving violations such as drunk driving, reckless driving, commission of a felony involving a motor vehicle and others. Later on, minor violations were included as well. Quite a few states joined in the 1960s but it languished in the 1970s and part of the 1980s. In the late 1980s, there was a push by the [[AAMVA]] to get states to join and in the early to mid 1990s, quite a few states joined.

The Driver License Compact is no longer being pushed by the AAMVA as it is being superseded by the [[Driver License Agreement]] (DLA), which also replaces the [[Non-Resident Violator Compact]]. However, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, there were only three member states to the DLA: Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

== States that are not members ==
Georgia, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Tennessee are not members.&lt;ref name="aamva.org"&gt;http://www.aamva.org/uploadedFiles/MainSite/Content/DriverLicensingIdentification/DL_ID_Compacts/Compact%20Member%20Joinder%20Dates.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamva.org/aamva/DocumentDisplay.aspx?id={A0B6D32F-1B87-4430-9639-DAFC6A67AA54} Driver License Compact/National Religious Vocation Conference member status]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevada repealed the authorizing legislation in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/statutes/74th/Stats200723.html#Stats200723page2781 2007 Nev. Stat. 2781]&lt;/ref&gt; although it still generally conforms to the agreement through regulations.&lt;ref name="aamva.org"/&gt;

== Exceptions ==
* Some states, such as [[Colorado]], [[Maryland]], [[Nevada]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;[[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]]: [http://www.dmv.ny.gov/tickets.htm Traffic Tickets]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pennsylvania]], do not assess points for minor offenses and apply the DLC for only major violations.
* States that are members are free to take action on violations reported from a non-member state as well.
* Pennsylvania transfers points from another state within the agreement only if it meets certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.state.pa.us/Public/DVSPubsForms/BDL/BDL%20Fact%20Sheets/fs-dlc.pdf PENNDOT DLC Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New Jersey]] assigns two points for all out-of-state minor violations regardless of whether the point values are higher if committed in the home state.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission]]: [http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/Violations/penalties_otherStates.htm Violations committed in other states]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agreements between US states and Canadian provinces ==

Some US states share information and act on driving violations in certain Canadian provinces, in a similar way to the compact:

* [[New York (state)|New York]] does assess points for minor violations received in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt;
* [[Michigan]] and Ontario exchange information and take adverse action.
* [[Maine]] and Quebec exchange information and take adverse action.
* [[Florida]] and Quebec exchange information and take adverse action.

== National Driver Register ==
The [[National Driver Register]] (NDR) is a computerized database of information about drivers who have had their licenses revoked or suspended, or who have been convicted of serious traffic violations such as driving while [[alcohol intoxication|impaired by alcohol]] or other drugs. State motor vehicle agencies provide NDR with the names of individuals who have lost their privilege or who have been convicted of a serious traffic violation. When a person applies for a driver's license the state checks to see if the name is on the NDR file. If a person has been reported to the NDR as a problem driver, the license may be denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]: [http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/National+Driver+Register National Driver Register (NDR)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811231838/http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/National+Driver+Register |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vested Powers Under Police Regulation ==

Every police-officer is legally bound to abide by the Police Regulations, any violation of which shall render the violator liable to be prosecuted u/s 29 of the Police Act, 1861. Nevertheless, Courts and Tribunals, particularly the District Magistrate and Executive Magistrates, are also required to follow many provisions of the Police Regulations, 1943.
The Police Regulations, 1943 have been published in three volumes. Volume I contains 1290 regulations, volume II contains appendices and forms and volume III contains alphabetically arranged subject wise index of regulations and appendices. It is incumbent upon every Magistrate to go through all regulations and appendices of which the regulations appended hereto are of high importance for the Executive Magistrate.

===Relation Between Police and District Magistrate===
* '''Regulation-13: Position of Commissioners'''
(a) The Commissioner as the local head of the administration, shall exercise supervision and control over the action of the District Magistrate in police matters.
(b) An order received from the Commissioner either direct or through the District magistrate shall be promptly executed by the Superintendent, who shall, however, report it through the Deputy Inspector General of the Range to the Inspector General if it is of an unusual nature.
 
* '''Regulation-14:Relations between Range Deputy Inspectors General and Commissioners and District Magistrates.
[§.12,Act v, 1861]'''

(a) The Deputy Inspector-General of a Range shall keep in close touch with Commissioner and District Magistrates in regard to the maintenance of peace and the prevention and detection of crime in their respective charges and shall do all in his power to establish harmonious co-operation between the police and the magistracy.
(b) He shall ordinarily communicate with the Commissioner by demi-official or unofficial notes and with District Magistrates through Superintendents but he shall make a point of having personal discussions with them at intervals, e.g., when he visits their Headquarters.

* '''Regulation-15: Relations between Superintendent and District Magistrate.'''

(a) The Superintendent is the immediate head of the police force of the district and is responsible for all matters concerning its internal economy and management and for its efficiency and discipline. He is also responsible, subject to the general control of the District Magistrate, for the criminal administration of the district, and for the proper performance by officers subordinate to him of all preventive and executive duties.

(b) The District Magistrate has no authority to interfere in the internal organisation and discipline of the police force, but it is his duty to bring to the notice of the Superintendent all cases in which the conduct and qualifications of a police officer affect the general administration of his district.

(c) The District Magistrate may call for the papers relating to the conduct or character of any police officer of his district and may send them on to the Deputy Inspector-General of the Range for the information of the Inspector-General and Commissioner. He may direct an enquiry to be made into any case of misconduct of a police officer. The Superintendent shall submit to the District Magistrate the papers regarding all serious cases of misconduct and of cases likely to affect the relations of the police with the public.

(d) All orders of the District Magistrate relating to the police except those passed in his judicial capacity, shall be addressed to the Superintendent, or in the event of his absence from Headquarters to the officer in charge during his absence. The Superintendent as the local head of the police under the District Magistrate is bound to carry out his orders except in regard to the internal economy organisation and discipline of the force, and matters of a purely departmental nature.

(e) Should any difference of opinion on any question relating to the police administration arise between the Superintendent and the District Magistrate, it is the duty of the Superintendent to carry out the Magistrate's instructions. The Magistrate shall in such cases forth with refer the matter to the Commissioner and the Superintendent shall similarly make a reference to his Deputy inspector-General. The Commissioner and the Deputy Inspector-General shall consult together and, if possible, arrive at an agreed decision. If they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the Provincial Government through the inspector-General

(f) The District Magistrate, in the exercise of his power of control, shall abstain from any action likely to weaken the authority of the Superintendent or to deprive him of responsibility. For this reason he shall avoid, as far as possible, the issue of executive orders until he has consulted the Superintendent.

(g) No circular or general order dealing with questions of law or procedure other than purely departmental matters may be issued by a Superintendent until it has been approved by the District Magistrate.

* '''Regulation-16:Personal Communication with Superintendent, District Magistrate.'''
 
(a) The Superintendent shall remain in constant personal communication with the District Magistrate whenever possible, and consult him on all important matters. It is incumbent on him to afford the District Magistrate all possible assistance in the criminal administration of the district, and in such matters he shall, as far as possible, accede to his wishes. Should any question arise on which they do not agree the District Magistrate shall give the Superintendent written orders and the Superintendent will carry them out; but the District Magistrate shall refer the point under dispute, if the Superintendent so desires, to the Deputy Inspector-General when the matter will be settled as laid down in regulation 15 (e).

(b) The Superintendent shall keep the District Magistrate fully informed of all matters coming to his knowledge affecting the peace of the district, and when he is on tour the police officer in charge of Headquarters shall send direct to the District Magistrate all important information which would not reach him soon enough through the Superintendent.

(c) Whenever he is about to leave the station, the Superintendent shall report his intention to the Magistrate, specifying, as far as possible, the places at which he may be found from day to day; and the Magistrate, for reasons to be recorded by him, may require the Superintendent to remain at Headquarters.

* '''Regulation-17:Correspondence between Superintendent and District Magistrate''' 
Correspondence between District Magistrates and Superinten¬dents shall be carried on by means of unofficial notes or memoranda. The original file shall be sent for action, when possible, and formal letters shall on no account be written.

* '''Regulation-18:Magistrate's orders to pass through Superintendent.'''

All orders on the police, except judicial orders, issued by the office of the District Magistrate shall ordinarily be sent through the Superintendent. This includes orders relating to tours by the District Magistrate and other officers and the provision of supplies by the police. Similarly, orders issued by the Sub-divisional Magistrate shall be sent through the Sub-divisional Police Officer, or if there be no Sub-divisional Police Officer, through the Circle Inspector.

* '''Regulation-19:Inspection by District Magistrate.'''

The District Magistrate shall exercise constant supervision over the prevention and detection of crime, for the proper conduct of which he is ultimately responsible. An important part of his duty is to inspect the police-stations of his district at regular intervals. It is not necessary for him to examine the details of the working of the department, but he should give special attention to—

(i) the general diary and the manner in which it is written up;

(ii) the recording of vital statistics;

(iii) the proper working of the Arms Act;

(iv) the methods of collecting crop statistics;

(v) the working of the rural police;

(vi) the general state of crime in the police-station and any reasons for its increase or decrease;

(vii) whether the Sub-Inspector appears to have a proper knowledge of his duties, whether he is in touch with the respectable inhabitants of his charge, has acquired local knowledge, and takes an interest in his work;

(viii) Whether the police-station officials appear to be working properly and have a proper knowledge of their duties and the neighbourhood;

(ix) whether the police-station has been regularly and properly inspected.

* '''Regulation-20:District Magistrate and transfers of police officers.'''

(a) If the District Magistrate observes in any police officer of or below the rank of Inspector marked incompetence or unfitness for the locality in which he is stationed, or unfitness for his particular duties, he may draw the attention of the Superintendent to the fact and request him to consider the advisability of transferring him to another locality or to other duties. He shall; however, bear in mind that not only are transfers detrimental to police work, but the officer transferred may do as badly or even worse in another place. Unsatisfactory work is as a rule met by punishment and a transfer should not be recommended unless it is likely to improve the criminal administration of the district as a whole.

(b) If the Magistrate observes in any police officer above the rank of Inspector incompetence or unfitness he may communicate with the Inspector-General, who after paying careful attention to the views of the District Magistrate, shall determine what measures should be taken and shall inform the Magistrate of the action which he takes in the matter.

* '''Regulation-29:Magisterial inquiries into allegations against police officers.'''
* '''Regulation-30:Police to treat courts and Magistrates with respect. [§.12,Act v, 1861]'''

Police officers shall treat all courts and Magistrates with due respect. They shall not make reflections on them in public or insert disparaging criticisms of their acts in departmental reports or similar documents which are or may be published ; but, if a Superintendent has reason to believe that there has been a failure of justice or that police officers have received unfair treatment, he may bring the case to the notice of the District Magistrate either by a formal application presented by the Court officer for action under section 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or by an unofficial note or report, the language of which shall be temperate and respectful.

30A. The District Magistrate should consider such application referred to .in regulation 30, note or report and take such action as he thinks fit but he should not transmit to the Magistrate concerned any unofficial notes or reports on the subject.

An '''executorial trustee''' is someone who is appointed to be an [[executor]] (the person who carries out the directions set forth in a [[Will (law)|will]]) and also be a [[trustee]] of an [[estate (law)|estate]] after the executors duties have been completed.

The role of trustee must be taken at a different time than that of executor, as the position of trustee precludes administration in trust law.

Especially when dealing with large and lucrative estates this position generally does not exist in many cases so as not to create a [[conflict of interest]]. The remedy is usually to have an executor act in an [[arbitration|arbitrary]] fashion and have no [[financial]] interest in how the estate will be divided up. This can be problematic, given that in some countries, such as the United States, an executor is automatically entitled to compensation for his or her services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.estateexec.com/Docs/Compensation Executor Compensation, Reimbursement, and Fees]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Expatriation Act of 1907''' ([[59th United States Congress|59th Congress]], 2nd session, chapter 2534, enacted March 2, 1907) was an act of the [[59th United States Congress]] concerning retention and [[relinquishment of United States nationality]] by married women and [[emigration from the United States|Americans residing abroad]]. It effectively functioned as Congressional endorsement of the various ''[[ad hoc]]'' rulings on loss of United States nationality that had been made by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] since the passage of the [[Expatriation Act of 1868]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sections of it were repealed by other acts in the early 1920s; those sections which remained were codified at {{USC|8|6|17}}, but those too were repealed by the [[Nationality Act of 1940]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://uscode.house.gov/table3/1907_2534.htm|chapter=1907:2534|title=United States Code, Table III|publisher=Office of the Law Revision Counsel|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NationalityAct1940"&gt;{{USStat|54|1172}}, {{USC|8|904}}.

[[File:Ambassador David Jayne Hill by Anders Zorn (1860-1920).jpg|thumb|right|The recommendations of U.S. Minister to the Netherlands [[David Jayne Hill]] ''(pictured)'' and his State Department colleagues formed the basis for Section 2 of the Expatriation Act of 1907.]]

The act contained seven sections, the last regarding rules of evidence for matters in the act, and the other six relating to citizenship and passports.&lt;ref name="Tsiang114"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsiang115"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien's passports===
Section 1 provided for the issuance of non-renewable [[alien's passport]]s of six months' validity to non-citizens who had lived in the United States for three years and had made a declaration of intention to become [[citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]]. This provision was repealed by the Act of June 4, 1920 ({{USStat|41|751}}, An Act Making appropriations for the Diplomatic and Consular Service for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=114}}; see also [[wikisource:Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_41_Part_1.djvu/760|the text of the 1920 Act on Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americans residing abroad===
Section 2 contained three grounds for loss of United States citizenship: naturalization in a foreign state, taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign state, or specifically for a naturalized citizen residing for two years in one's foreign state of origin or five years in any other foreign state; it also provided that citizenship could be lost only in peacetime.&lt;ref name="Tsiang114"/&gt; It was repealed by Section 504 of the Nationality Act of 1940; however, a saving clause in the 1940 Act provided that nothing in that Act would affect the status of those who had already lost citizenship prior to its passage.&lt;ref name="NationalityAct1940"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savorgnan"&gt;{{cite court|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/338/491|litigants=Savorgnan v. United States|reporter=70 S.Ct. 292, 94 L.Ed. 287|date=1950|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background of this section goes back to a 1906 recommendation by the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] that the State Department form a commission of inquiry on the subject of nationality laws and their relation to US citizens living abroad. Acting Secretary of State [[Robert Bacon]] named international law expert [[James Brown Scott]], [[United States Ambassador to the Netherlands|Minister to the Netherlands]] [[David Jayne Hill]], and Passports Bureau chief [[Gaillard Hunt]] to the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their report was published later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|Hill|Hunt|1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the provisions which actually ended up in the Act, the commission had also recommended that persons wishing to re-acquire US citizenship "be required to comply with the laws applicable to the naturalization of aliens". However, this was not adopted by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference between the law and the previous practice of the State Department was that any oath to a foreign state became grounds for loss of US citizenship even if no foreign nationality was acquired by that oath.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress and the State Department were in agreement that loss of citizenship in wartime should not be permitted; this had been a long-standing principle in US law going all the way back to ''[[Talbot v. Janson]]'' in 1795, and Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] had stated in the 1870s that permitting loss of citizenship in wartime "would be to afford a cover to desertion and treasonable aid to the public enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsiang|1942|p=107}}. US law has not always been consistent on this point; the [[Enrollment Act of 1865]] provided for loss of citizenship during the Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Married women===
Section 3 provided for loss of citizenship by American women who married aliens.&lt;ref name="Tsiang114"/&gt; Section 4 provided for retention of American citizenship by formerly alien women who had acquired citizenship by marriage to an American after the termination of their marriages. Women residing in the US would retain their American citizenship automatically if they did not explicitly renounce; women residing abroad would have the option to retain American citizenship by registration with a US.consul.&lt;ref name="Tsiang115"/&gt; The aim of these provisions was to prevent cases of [[multiple nationality]] among women.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these resulted in significant protests by members of the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]], and just two years after women gained the franchise, they were repealed by the [[Cable Act]] of 1922.&lt;ref name="Tsiang115"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bredbenner|1998|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cable Act itself continued to provide for the loss of citizenship by American women who married "aliens ineligible to citizenship," namely Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bredbenner|1998|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Daniel Swalm, the grandson of a Minnesota woman who had lost U.S. citizenship under Section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 for marrying a Swedish immigrant and died without regaining her citizenship, began lobbying Congress to [[posthumous citizenship|posthumously restore citizenship]] to women like his grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_22852476/he-wants-grandmas-citizenship-restored|first=Ruben|last=Rosario|title=He wants grandma's citizenship restored|work=TwinCities.com|date=2013-03-23|accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted his senator [[Al Franken]], who in 2014 sponsored a [[Simple resolution|resolution]] ({{USBill|113|S.Res.|402}}) expressing regret for the passage of the 1907 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/04/03/franken-so-sorry-for-that-terrible-law-100-years-ago/|first=Colby|last=Itkowitz|title=Franken: So sorry for that terrible law 100 years ago|work=The Washington Post|date=2014-04-03|accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wctrib.com/content/after-century-minn-woman-line-receive-posthumous-apology-us-government|first=Lareesa|last=Sandretsky|title=After a century, Minn. woman in line to receive posthumous apology from the US government|work=Minnesota West-Central Tribune|date=2014-04-07|accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution passed the Senate on May 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-senate-apology-20140516-story.html|first=Richard|last=Simon|title=Women who lost U.S. citizenship for marrying foreigners get apology|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children born abroad===
Section 5 provided that child born abroad to alien parents could acquire U.S. citizenship upon the naturalization of their parents during their minority, once the minor child him or herself began to reside permanently in the U.S. Section 6 provided that children born abroad to U.S. citizen parents would be required to swear an [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|oath of allegiance]] before a U.S. consul upon reaching the age of majority if they wished to retain U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name="Tsiang115"/&gt; Both sections were repealed by Section 504 of the Nationality Act of 1940.&lt;ref name="NationalityAct1940"/&gt;

==Case law==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] first considered the Expatriation Act of 1907 in the 1915 case ''MacKenzie v. Hare''. The plaintiff, a suffragist named Ethel MacKenzie, was living in California, which since 1911 had extended the franchise to women. However, she had been denied voter registration by the respondent in his capacity as a Commissioner of the San Francisco Board of Election on the grounds of her marriage to a Scottish man.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; MacKenzie contended that the Expatriation Act of 1907 "if intended to apply to her, is beyond the authority of Congress", as neither the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] nor any other part of the Constitution gave Congress the power to "denationalize a citizen without his concurrence". However, Justice [[Joseph McKenna]], writing the majority opinion, stated that while "[i]t may be conceded that a change of citizenship cannot be arbitrarily imposed, that is, imposed without the concurrence of the citizen", but "[t]he law in controversy does not have that feature. It deals with a condition voluntarily entered into, with notice of the consequences." Justice [[James Clark McReynolds]], in a concurring opinion, stated that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/239/239.US.299.79.html|litigants=MacKenzie v. Hare|reporter=239 U.S. 299|date=1915|accessdate=2012-10-30|pinpoint=17, 20, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the Supreme Court ruled on ''Savorgnan v. United States''. The Expatriation Act of 1907 had been repealed for nearly a decade by that point, but the case concerned a woman who married an Italian man on December 26, 1940 (after the passage of the [[Nationality Act of 1940]], but before its effective date) and then applied for naturalization as an [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizen]], all while still living in the United States. She later lived in Italy from 1941 to 1945, after the 1940 Act had taken effect. Justice [[Harold Hitz Burton]], writing the majority opinion, reversed the District Court and found that the petitioner had indeed lost U.S. citizenship. His ruling, though it relied primarily on the Nationality Act of 1940, also made reference to the Expatriation Act of 1907. He rejected the petitioner's contention that Section 2 of the Act only resulted in loss of U.S. citizenship when the act of naturalization occurred on foreign soil, and held that it was irrelevant under the Act whether or not the petitioner had intended to renounce her U.S. citizenship by applying for the Italian one. However, he declined to rule on the Government's contention that the petitioner would have lost U.S. citizenship even if she had not taken up residence abroad, writing that "it is not necessary to determine here whether the petitioner's residence and naturalization are to be tested under the saving clause or under the rest of the Act of 1940".&lt;ref name="Savorgnan"/&gt;

{{Anarchism sidebar |History}}

The '''Hague Congress''' was the fifth congress of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), held from 2–7 September 1872 in [[The Hague]], the Netherlands.

The Hague Congress is famous for the expulsion of the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] for clashing with [[Karl Marx]] and his followers over the role of politics in the IWMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leier|first=Mark|year=2006|pp=298|title=[[Bakunin: The Creative Passion]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-58322-894-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the end of this organization as a unitarian alliance of all socialist factions ([[Anarchism|anarchists]] and [[Marxists]]).

==History==

===Background===

The background to the congress lay in the failure of the [[Paris Commune]] in June of the previous year, and in the different lessons drawn from it by the two most prominent members of the International, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. Marx, in his pamphlet ''[[The Civil War in France]]'', believed that the major lesson from the Commune was that it was essential for the proletariat to take control of the State and thus the International had to become a true political party of the proletariat. On the other hand, Bakunin saw the most important element of the Commune as being the Parisian workers' rejection of the State in all its forms and continued to call for a revolutionary alliance of workers and peasants in a decentralized organization.

In September 1871, the General Council of the International, headed by Marx, held a conference in London at which a series of resolutions were passed, including one (sometimes known as Resolution No.9) which stated: "That this constitution of the working class into a political party is indispensable in order to ensure the triumph of the social revolution and its ultimate end — the abolition of classes."&lt;ref&gt;''Resolution of the London Conference on Working Class Political Action'' http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/politics-resolution.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen by many to imply a major change of direction to the content of the International's General Rules.

The resolution caused a great deal of consternation in many sections of the International, particularly in Italy, French-speaking Switzerland and Spain, as it was seen as a measure which would eliminate the autonomy of local sections and turn the General Council into a centralized political office. The Conference itself was considered irregular by these sections, who believed that decisions of this nature could only have been decided at a regular congress of the International.

In June 1872, a Congress was convened for 2 September 1872 in The Hague, the agenda for which was to concern a general revision of the organization's General Rules.

===During the conference===
[[File:Café Concert Excelsior, location of the Hague Congress of 1872.jpg|thumb|240px|Café Concert Excelsior, Lange Lombardstraat 109, The Hague. Location of the Hague Congress of 1872]]

The Hague Congress met from 2 to 7 September 1872 in [[The Hague]], Holland. Marx declared that the proletariat had to take control of the state for a successful revolution, and advocated that the Congress vote to uphold this view. The anarchists naturally objected. Anarchist leaders [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and James Guillaume were expelled for protesting after the Congress accepted Marx's proposal. Bakunin was not present at the conference but was expelled [[in absentia]].

===Aftermath===

After the expulsion of Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] from the Hague Congress, the anarchists declared it [[null and void]].&lt;ref name = "Bakunin"&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin]], "[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]", 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchist faction (including the [[Jura federation]], and the federations of Spain, Italy and Belgium) then held its own [[Congress of Saint-Imier]], a few days later, from which also emerged the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuri Mikhailovich Steklov]], ''History of the First International'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/steklov/history-first-international/ch22.htm Part II Chapter Two. The Saint-Imier Congress and the Foundation of the Anarchist International]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in that year of 1872 Bakunin wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The legitimacy of this conference has been contested. Mr. Marx, a very able political conniver, doubtless anxious to prove to the world that though he lacked firearms and cannons the masses could still be governed by lies, by libels, and by intrigues, organized his Congress of the Hague in September 1872. Barely two months have passed since this congress and already in all of Europe (with the exception of Germany where the workers are brainwashed by the lies of their leaders and their press) and its free federations – Belgian, Dutch, English, American, French, Spanish, Italian – without forgetting our excellent Jura Federation [Switzerland] – there has arisen a cry of indignation and contempt against this cynical burlesque which dares to call itself a true Congress of the International. Thanks to a rigged, fictitious majority, composed almost exclusively of members of the General Council, cleverly used by Mr. Marx, all has been travestied, falsified, brutalized. Justice, good sense, honesty, and the honor of the International brazenly rejected, its very existence endangered – all this the better to establish the dictatorship of Mr. Marx. It is not only criminal – it is sheer madness. Yet Mr. Marx who thinks of himself as the father of the International (he was unquestionably one of its founders) cares not a whit, and permits all this to be done! This is what personal vanity, the lust for power, and above all, political ambition can lead to. For all these deplorable acts Marx is personally responsible. Marx, in spite of all his mis-deeds, has unconsciously rendered a great service to the International by demonstrating in the most dramatic and evident manner that if anything can kill the International, it is the introduction of politics into its program.&lt;ref name = "Bakunin" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is it not astonishing that Mr. Marx has believed it possible to graft onto this precise declaration, which he himself probably wrote, his scientific socialism? For this – the organization and the rule of the new society by socialist savants – is the worst of all despotic governments!&lt;ref name = "Bakunin" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Human–animal marriage'''  is a marriage between a (non-human) animal and a human. This topic has appeared in mythology and [[magic in fiction|magical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diacronia.ro/en/journal/issue/4/A58/en/pdf Naithani, Sadhana (2014). Folklore Theory in Postwar Germany.] University Press of Mississippi. pp. 48–52. {{ISBN|9781617039942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century there have been numerous reports from around the world of humans marrying their pets and other animals. Human–animal marriage is often seen in accordance with [[zoophilia]], however they are not necessarily linked. Although animal-human marriage is not mentioned specifically in national laws, the act of engaging in [[Zoophilia and the law|sexual acts with an animal]] is illegal in many countries under animal abuse laws.

== Animal-human marriage in mythology ==
The practice of animal-human marriage has made appearances in several [[Mythology|mythological]] stories and [[folklore]], and is often understood to mean a deity-human marriage involving gods or heroes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alan L.|date=1995-01-01|title=The Woman Who Married a Horse: Five Ways of Looking at a Chinese Folktale|jstor=1178945|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=54|issue=2|pages=275–305|doi=10.2307/1178945}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese folktale 'The Goddess Of The Silkworm' is an example of a tale where a woman marries a horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar Irish legend tells of a king who marries a horse, symbolizing a divine union between the king and the goddess of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Y-7XvMVeYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography|last=Freeman|first=Philip|date=2004-03-17|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743267496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the indigenous [[Cheyenne]] have a story of animal-human marriage in 'The Girl who Married a dog'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stensland|first=Anna Lee|date=1977-01-01|title=The Indian Presence in American Literature|jstor=815804|journal=The English Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=37–41|doi=10.2307/815804}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Native American stories about people who married animals. In these Native American myths, animal spirits frequently assume human form.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Mi-Ni/Native-American-Mythology.html|title=Native American Mythology - Myth Encyclopedia - god, story, legend, names, ancient, animal, snake, world, creation, life|website=www.mythencyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not seen as literal animals, but representatives from the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Animal-Human marriage in the real world ==
Although it is uncertain if there is a legal basis for marrying an animal, several individuals claim to have done so. The [[Sudanese goat marriage incident]] made big headlines in 2006 when a man was forced to marry a goat after being caught in a sexual interaction with the goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550479/Man-marries-goat-captivates-millions.html|title='Man marries goat' captivates millions|last=Staff|first=By Our Foreign|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of marriage include animals such as dogs, cats, frogs and a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3004930.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} South Asia {{!}} Girl weds dog to break 'evil spell'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/11/13/man-in-india-marries-dog-to-atone-for-stoning-to-death-mating-canines.html|title=Man in India Marries Dog to Atone for Stoning to Death Mating Canines|date=2007-11-13|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334993/Joseph-Guiso-marries-dog-Honey-sunset-ceremony.html|title=Sealed with a kiss: Man 'marries' his dog in sunset ceremony - but assures guests 'it's not sexual'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658327.stm|title=BBC News - German man 'marries' his dying cat|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4290761/Seven-year-old-Indian-girls-marry-frogs.html|title=Seven-year-old Indian girls 'marry' frogs|last=Delhi|first=By Dean Nelson in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/01/03/british-woman-marries-dolphin.html|title=British Woman Marries Dolphin|date=2006-01-03|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents of human animal relations took place in 2010, when 18-year-old Balinese man Ngurah Alit was found having sexual intercourse with a cow, who he claimed flirted with him.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/bali-teenager-passes-out-marrying-cow-he-had-sex-with/|title=Bali Teenager Passes Out Marrying Cow He Had Sex With {{!}} Jakarta Globe|work=Jakarta Globe|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Pecaruan ritual, the man was forced to marry the animal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The ceremony was thought to cleanse the village of the immoral act of bestiality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The cow was drowned in the ocean, while Alit was symbolically drowned as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

The '''Institute of the Right of Peace and Development''' ('''IDPD''', [[French language|French]]: ''Institut du droit de la paix et du développemen''t) is a French [[research institute]] in the field of [[international law]] located in [[Nice]], France.  

IDPD was established by [http://www.sfdi.org/internationalistes/rene-jean-dupuy/ René-Jean Dupuy] (former president of Hague Academy of International Law) in 1968, and a brainchild of the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]]. It proposes MA, and Ph.D level programmes in various fields of international law and European law, including [[international security]], functioning of [[international organization]]s, [[law of the sea]] and [[space law]].

Considering the aims it pursues, the Institute works in close collaboration with other international organisations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iihl.org/partnerships/|title=Partnerships - International Institute of Humanitarian Law|work=International Institute of Humanitarian Law|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[International Institute of Humanitarian Law|International Institute of Humanitarian Law, Sanremo]] or [[The Hague Academy of International Law|Hague Academy of International Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6739">{{Judicial interpretation}}
'''Judicial interpretation''' refers to different ways that the [[judiciary]] uses to [[statutory interpretation|interpret]] the [[law]], particularly [[constitution]]al documents and legislation. This is an important issue in some [[common law jurisdictions]] such as the [[Law of the United States|United States]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]] and [[Law of Canada|Canada]], because the [[Supreme court|supreme courts]] of those nations can overturn laws made by their legislatures via a process called [[judicial review]]. 

For example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has decided such topics as the legality of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as in the [[Dred Scott decision]], and [[desegregation]] as in the ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'' decision, and [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] as in the ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' decision. As a result, how justices interpret the constitution, and the ways in which they approach this task has a political aspect. Terms describing types of judicial interpretation can be ambiguous; for example, the term ''judicial conservatism'' can vary in meaning depending on what is trying to be "conserved". One can look at judicial interpretation along a continuum from [[judicial restraint]] to [[judicial activism]], with different viewpoints along the continuum.

==Basis for judicial interpretation==

In the [[United States]], there are different ways to do judicial interpretation:

* ''Balancing'' happens when judges weigh one set of interests or rights against an opposing set, typically used to make rulings in [[First Amendment to the Constitution|First Amendment]] cases. For example, cases involving [[freedom of speech]] sometimes require justices to make a distinction between legally permissible speech and speech that can be restricted or banned for, say, reasons of safety, and the task then is for justices to balance these conflicting claims. The balancing approach was criticized by Supreme Court justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] who argued that the Constitution gives no guidance about how to weigh or measure divergent interests.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs&gt;{{cite book

 |title= Civil Liberties and the Bill of Rights
 |publisher= The Teaching Company
 |chapter= Part I: Lecture 4: The Court and Constitutional Interpretation |pages=52, 53, 54
 |year= 2006
 |accessdate= 2013-01-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doctrinalism considers how various parts of the Constitution have been "shaped by the Court's own jurisprudence", according to Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* Functionalism.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* ''Founders' Intent'' involves judges trying to gauge the intentions of the authors of the Constitution. Problems can arise when judges try to determine which particular Founders or Framers to consult, as well as trying to determine what they meant based on often sparse and incomplete documentation.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* [[Originalism]] involves judges trying to apply the "original" meanings of different constitutional provisions.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt; To determine the original meaning, a constitutional provision is interpreted in its ''original'' context, i.e. the historical, literary, and political context of the framers. From that interpretation, the underlying principle is derived which is then applied to the contemporary situation. Former [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] justice [[Antonin Scalia]] believed that the text of the constitution should mean the same thing today as it did when it had been written. A report in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' suggested that originalism was the "view that the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance with its original meaning — that is, the meaning it had at the time of its enactment."&lt;ref name=twsWashPostJan2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/01/neil-gorsuch-antonin-scalia-and-originalism-explained/?wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpmm=1 |title=Neil Gorsuch, Antonin Scalia and originalism, explained |last=Blake |first=Aaron |date=February 1, 2017 |website= |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=February 1, 2017 |quote=...the view that law laid down by the framers in the Constitution remains binding until we legally change it, such as through the amendment process....}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meaning" based on ''original'' principles.
* [[Prudentialism]] discourages judges from setting broad rules for possible future cases, and advises courts to play a limited role.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* ''Precedent'' is judges deciding a case by looking to the decision of a previous and similar case according to the legal principle of [[stare decisis]], by finding a rule or principle in an earlier case to guide their judgment in a current case.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* [[Strict constructionism]] involves judges interpreting the text only as it was written; once a clear meaning has been established, there is no need for further analysis, based on this way, which advocates that judges should avoid drawing inferences from previous statutes or the constitution and instead focus on exactly what was written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/APGOV_Judiciary.htm "The Judiciary: The Power of the Federal Judiciary"], The Social Studies Help Center&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Justice [[Hugo Black]] argued that the First Amendment's wording in reference to certain civil rights that ''Congress shall make no law'' should mean exactly that: ''no'' law, ''no'' exceptions.
* [[Structuralism]] is a way judges use by searching for the meaning of a particular constitutional principle only by "reading it against the larger constitutional document or context," according to Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt; Judges try to understand how a particular ruling fits within the larger structure of the entire constitution.
* [[Textualism]]  primarily interprets the [[law]] based on the ordinary meaning of the legal text.

A '''Judicial officer''' is a person with the responsibilities and powers to facilitate, arbitrate, preside over, and make decisions and directions in regard to the application of the [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judicial Officer|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/j/judicial-officer/|website=US Legal|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judicial officers are typically categorized as [[judge]]s, [[magistrate]]s, [[puisne]] judicial officers such as [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] or officers of courts of [[limited jurisdiction]]; and [[Notary public|notaries public]] and [[Notary public|commissioners of oaths]]. The powers of judicial officers vary and are usually limited to a certain [[jurisdiction]].

==Sri Lanka==
In [[Sri Lanka]], Judicial officers refer to [[Judge|District judge]]s and [[Magistrate]]s. They are appointed by the [[Judicial Service Commission (Sri Lanka)|Judicial Service Commission]].

==Kuwait==
In [[Kuwait]], Judicial Officers are [[sworn]] [[law enforcement]] agents with the capacity to enforce the law within their speciality, an example would be The [[Environment Public Authority]]'s environmental Judicial Officers, which function, effectively, as an  Environmental judicial police force that enforces the country's environmental law. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3382130|title = Kuwait: Law No. 21 of 1995 Establishing the Public Authority for the Environment|journal = Arab Law Quarterly|volume = 14|issue = 1|pages = 79–87|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2478849&amp;language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''layoff'''&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/layoff |title=layoff noun - definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionary Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the temporary suspension or permanent [[termination of employment]] of an [[employee]] or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff)&lt;ref name=govuk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights/consultation|title=Redundancy: your rights|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing an organization.  Originally, ''layoff'' referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or [[employment]]&lt;ref name="LaborTerm1921"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvard University. Graduate School of Business Administration|title=Labor Terminology|journal=Bulletin of the Bureau of Business Research|date=1921|volume=25|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPQsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English,&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}} requiring the addition of "temporary" to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff is not to be confused with [[Wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]].  ''Laid off workers'' or ''displaced workers'' are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or [[Shift work|shift]] was abolished (Borbely, 2011).&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/lfcharacteristics.htm#displaced|title=Labor force characteristics|date=October 18, 2010|work=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=Glossary|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, W. J., Blinder, A. S. &amp; Wolff, E. N. (2003). Downsizing in America: Reality, Causes and Consequences. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. See also the American Management Association annual surveys since 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sahdev |first1= Kusum|last2=Vinnicombe|first2 = Susan|last3 = Tyson|first3=Shaun|date = 1999|title=Downsizing and the changing role of HR|journal =The International Journal of Human Resource Management|volume = 10|issue =5|pages = 906-923|doi= 10.1080/095851999340224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chorely 2002; Mason 2002; Rogers 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan&lt;ref&gt;Mroczkowski, T. and Hanaoka, M. (1997), ‘Effective downsizing strategies in Japan and America: is there a convergence of employment practices?’, Academy of Management Review, Vol.22, No.1, pp. 226–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmakjian and Robinson 2001&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mellahi, K. and Wilkinson, A. (2004) Downsizing and Innovation Output: A Review of Literature and Research Propositions, BAM Paper 2004, British Academy of Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure.

== Terminology ==
[[Euphemism]]s are often used to "soften the blow" in the process of [[firing]] and being fired.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=A |year=2004 |title= Downsizing, rightsizing and dumbsizing: quality, human resources and sustainability - Total Quality Management |volume= 15 no 8 |url=http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/10072/16844/1/34201_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RedWilk2006&gt;Redman T and Wilkinson A (2006) Downsizing, in T. Redman and A. Wilkinson(eds), Contemporary Human Resource Management,  London: FT/Prentice Hall,  pp.&amp;nbsp;356–381&lt;/ref&gt; The term "layoff" originally meant a temporary interruption in work&lt;ref name="LaborTerm1921"/&gt; (and usually pay). The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that, requiring the addition of "temporary" to refer to the original meaning. Many other euphemisms have been coined for "(permanent) layoff", including "downsizing", "excess reduction", "rightsizing", "leveraging synergies", "[[delayering]]", "smartsizing", "redeployment", "workforce reduction", "workforce optimization", "simplification", "force shaping", "recussion", and "reduction in force" (also called "RIF", especially in the government employment sector).  "Mass layoff" is defined by the [[United States Department of Labor]] as 50 or more workers laid off from the same company around the same time. "Attrition" implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire. "Early retirement" means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later. While "redundancy" is a specific legal term in [[UK labour law]]. When an employer is faced with work of a particular type ceasing or diminishing at a particular location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/redundancy |title=Employers Redundancy procedure, Redundancy Policy, Redundancy compliance |publisher=Citation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be perceived{{By whom|date=March 2011}} as [[obfuscation]]. [[Firing]]s imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer's and employees' control, especially in the face of a recession such as the [[Late 2000s recession|one that began in the late 2000s]].

== Common abbreviations for ''reduction in force'' ==
'''RIF''' - A generic reduction in force, of undetermined method. Often pronounced like the word ''riff'' rather than spelled out. Sometimes used as a verb, as in "the employees were pretty heavily ''riffed''".

'''eRIF''' – Layoff notice by email.

'''IRIF''' - Involuntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did not voluntarily choose to leave the company. This usually implies that the method of reduction involved either layoffs, firings, or both, but would not usually imply resignations or retirements. If the employee is fired rather than laid off, the term "with cause" may be appended to indicate that the separation was due to this employee's performance and/or behavior, rather than being financially motivated.

'''VRIF''' - Voluntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did play a role in choosing to leave the company, most likely through resignation or retirement. In some instances, a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice, perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent, or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package. Conversely, the company is not obliged to accept an employees decision and may not accept every employee who volunteers for a VRIF.

'''WFR''' - Work force reduction.

== Layoffs in the public sector ==
Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recession of 2007-2008]], the [[public sector]] has seen significantly smaller job growth  in employment versus the [[private sector]] and layoffs have been used to ensure sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Čudanov|first1=Mladen|last2=Jaško|first2=Ondrej|last3=Săvoiu|first3=Gheorghe|title=Public and public utility enterprises restructuring: Statistical and quantitative aid for ensuring human resource sustainability|journal=Amfiteatru Economic|date=2012|volume=14|issue=32|pages=307–322|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31686847/Article_1126.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1512052342&amp;Signature=uXsCTUwHwImLMKJJZzloksIrMdY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPublic_and_Public_Utility_Enterprises_Re.pdf|ref=PublicSectorRestructuringSustainability}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the public sector declines the demand for services from the private sector decline as well. Layoffs in the public sector have put limitations on the growth rate of the private sector, inevitably burdening the entire flow of markets.

== Unemployment compensation ==
The risk of being laid off varies depending on the workplace and country a person is working in. Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace typically has two main factors. The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the distribution of unemployment benefits in a workplace outlined in an [[employee handbook]]. The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wonk|first=Kim|date=2010|title=Unemployment Risks and the Origins of Unemployment Compensation|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=45|pages=57|doi=10.1007/s12116-009-9057-9|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Canada, Dorion (1995) states that white-collar workers who have been made redundant receive higher re-employment wages, than those in blue-collar occupations as their job is regarded as being of a higher status than blue collar workers, whereas in France, Margolis (1999, 2002) finds that workers who have been laid off have smaller unemployment periods and higher re-employment earnings in comparison with other unemployed people.&lt;ref name=Okatenko2010&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41219168|title=The Impact of the Reason for Layoff on the Subsequent Unemployment Duration|first=Anna|last=Okatenko|date=1 January 2010|publisher=|journal=Annals of Economics and Statistics|issue=99/100|pages=285–315|via=|doi=10.2307/41219168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of compensation will usually depend on what level the employee holds in the company.

Packages may also vary if the employee is laid off, or voluntarily quits in the face of a layoff (VRIF).  The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee's ability to collect whatever form of [[unemployment compensation]] might be available in their [[jurisdiction]]. In many U.S. states, workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation. Depending on local or state laws, workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits, as are those who are fired for gross misconduct. Also, lay-offs due to a firm's moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits. Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits.&lt;ref name=Lihzis2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://subpay.com/solutions-for-managing-layoffs/sub-pay-plan-legal-precedent-the-origins-and-background |title=SUB-Pay Plan Legal Precedent |publisher=Subpay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331044842/http://subpay.com/solutions-for-managing-layoffs/sub-pay-plan-legal-precedent-the-origins-and-background |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the [[U.S. Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] in the early 1950s, and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the [[IRS]] in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.subpay.com/2011/05/17/what-are-supplemental-unemployment-benefits/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610155850/http://blog.subpay.com/2011/05/17/what-are-supplemental-unemployment-benefits/ |date=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SUB-Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff. By establishing severance payments as SUB-Pay benefits, the payments are not considered wages for [[FICA]], [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|FUTA]], and SUI tax purposes, and employee FICA tax. To qualify for SUB-Pay benefits, the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis.  There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post-downsized ‘anorexic organization’. The benefits, which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing, center on savings in labor costs, speedier decision making, better communication, reduced product development time, enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers (De Meuse et al. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;168). However, some writers draw attention to the ‘obsessive’ pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost cutting, organ failure and an extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient. Hence ‘trimming’ and ‘tightening belts’ are the order of the day.&lt;ref name=TylerWilkinson2007&gt;Tyler M and Wilkinson A (2007) The Tyranny of Corporate Slenderness: Understanding Organizations Anorexically,  Work, Employment and Society,  21: 537-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of layoffs ==
Traditionally, layoffs directly affect the employee. However, the employee terminated is not alone in this. Layoffs affect the workplace environment and the economy as well as the employee. Layoffs have a widespread effect and the three main components of layoff effects are in the workplace, to the employee, and effects to the economy.

'''Effects of layoffs in the workplace:'''  Layoffs have remained the greatest way for a company to cut costs. Although from the employer's perspective a layoff is beneficial for the [[business]], layoffs create an uncertainty in the workplace environment and lowers other employees' [[job security]] as well as creates an apprehension and fear of [[Termination of employment|termination]] for the remaining employees, and subsequently lowers overall motivation in the workplace environment.  According to ''Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations,''&lt;ref name=Noer&gt;{{cite book |url= |last=Noer |first=David |authorlink=David M. Noer |date=2009 |title=Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |doi=10.1002/jts.2490100119 |isbn=9781555425609}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the post-layoff environment, there is a need for empathy, tangibility, self-knowledge, and relentlessly seeking customers among the surviving employees. The remaining employees may have feelings of survivors guilt. In order to diminish negative effects of layoffs, Wayne Cascio suggests alternative approaches to layoff and downsizing as "Responsible restructuring" approach.&lt;ref name="CascioResponsible"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cascio|first1=Wayne|title=Strategies for responsible restructuring|journal=The Academy of Management Executive|date=November 1, 2005|volume=19|issue=4|pages=39–50|doi=10.5465/AME.2005.19417906|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wayne_Cascio/publication/279927986_Strategies_for_responsible_restructuring/links/583cc32a08aeb3987e2f9b55/Strategies-for-responsible-restructuring.pdf|ref=Cascio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism is critical for rebuilding the workplace environment because employees look to their leaders for stability and predictability. No matter the position in an organization, employees will look for job security.

'''Effects of layoffs to the employee:'''  [[Employment|Employees]] (or former employees in this case) can be affected in a couple of different ways. When an employee is laid off, his or her general trust in long-term work may decrease, reducing expectations upon rehire.  After an employee withstands a layoff, the effects can trickle into future employment and attitudes. Layoffs in the workplace often leave the former employee less inclined to trust future employers which can lead to behavioral conflicts among co-workers and [[management]]. Despite new employers not being responsible for a prior circumstances, job performance may still be affected by prior layoffs. Many companies work to make layoffs as minimally burdensome to the employee. At times employers may layoff multiple people at once to soften the impact.

'''Effects of layoffs in the American economy:'''  Layoffs create lower job security overall, and an increased competitiveness for available and opening positions. Layoffs have generally two major effects on the [[Economy of the United States|economy]] and [[stockholders]]. The way layoffs affect the economy varies from the industry that is doing the layoffs and the size of the layoff. If an industry that employs a majority of a [[region]] (freight in the northeast for example) suffers and has to lay employees off, there will be mass unemployment in an economically rich area. This can have leave [[ripple effect]]s nationwide. Unemployment is the biggest effect on the economy that can come from layoffs.

== Layoffs abroad ==
In francophone Belgium, the term [[Procédure Renault]] has become a synonym for the consultation process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s.  When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which is also known as severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave.  If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ending-employment/redundancy/redundancy-pay-and-entitlements|title=Redundancy pay &amp; entitlements|last=Ombudsman|first=Fair Work|website=www.fairwork.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A layoff is also known as a '''retrenchment''' in ([[South African English]]). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called '''[[Redundancy in English law|redundancy]]'''.&lt;ref name=govuk/&gt;  Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between [[Involuntary termination of employment#Termination by mutual agreement|leaving the company of one's own free will]], in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a [[Voluntary redundancy|onetime payment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Involuntary termination of employment#Termination by mutual agreement|leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour]] force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal ''redeployment''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9074">The '''Maysville Road veto''' occurred on May 27, 1830, when United States President [[Andrew Jackson]] vetoed a bill that would allow the federal government to purchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] to [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] on the [[Ohio River]] (Maysville being located approximately 66 miles/106&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Lexington), the entirety of which would be in the state of [[Kentucky]]. Its advocates regarded it as a part of the national [[Cumberland Road]] system. Congress passed a bill in 1830 providing federal funds to complete the project. Jackson vetoed the bill on the grounds that federal funding of intrastate projects of this nature was unconstitutional. He declared that such bills violated the principle that the federal government should not be involved in local economic affairs. Jackson also pointed out that funding for these kinds of projects interfered with paying off the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;Glyndon G. Van Deusen, ''The Jacksonian Era: 1828-1848'' (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1959) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of [[internal improvements]], such as the development of roads and bridges, argued that the federal government had an obligation to harmonize the nation's diverse, and often conflicting, sectional interests into an "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]." Jackson's decision was heavily influenced by his Secretary of State [[Martin Van Buren]]. Some authors have described the motives behind the veto decision as personal, rather than strictly political. The veto has been attributed to a personal grudge&lt;!-- Jackson's or both? --&gt; against [[Henry Clay]], a political enemy and resident of Kentucky, as well as to preserve the trade monopoly of New York's [[Erie Canal]], in Van Buren's case.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wiltse, ''The New Nation: 1800-1845'' (1961)  p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate in Congress==
Supporters of the bill insisted on the project's national significance. This particular project was intended to be a part of a much larger interstate system extending from [[Zanesville, Ohio]], to [[Florence, Alabama]]. If the highway as a whole was of national significance, they argued, surely the individual sections must be as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 433-435 (Sen. Tyler). p. 831-833 (Rep. Polk).&lt;/ref&gt; They looked to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision handed down six years before in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', in which the court confirmed the power to regulate commerce among the states including those portions of the journey which lay within one state or another. Additionally, the road connected the interior of Kentucky to the Ohio River, and therefore served as the main artery for the transportation of goods. Kentucky Representative [[Robert Letcher]] made this argument regarding the road's connection to the rest of the nation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The road designed to be improved is intended to intersect at the great national road in the State of Ohio. It connects itself also on each side with the Ohio River. These two connections most certainly and justly entitle it to the appellation of a national work.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.''  p. 820 (Rep. Letcher)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, the federal government had provided funding for other intrastate projects when they benefited the rest of the nation. As Representative Coleman stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But gentlemen say, every inch of the Maysville road is in the State of Kentucky. How can it be national? I answer, every inch of the Delaware Canal, sixteen miles in length, is in the State of [[New Jersey]]; and every inch of the Louisville Canal is in one county; nay, I believe in one city. How can they be national? Yet, Congress have subscribed for stock in both of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 828 (Rep. Coleman)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arguments were all intended to illustrate the road's overwhelming national significance. Opponents responded that this line of argument would establish that every road was a national road; there would be no limit to federal power.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 831 (Rep. Polk)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jackson's veto==
Jackson believed that federal money should only be spent when carrying out Congress' enumerated powers. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] employed a broad view of the spending power when he carried out the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the construction of the Cumberland Road. In contrast, President [[James Madison]], the "Father of the Constitution”, viewed this type of spending as unconstitutional, as evidenced by his veto of the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]]. Jackson sided with Madison's view and felt that Jefferson's broad view of the spending power was not enough to justify passage of the bill before him.
One of Jackson's main arguments against the bill was the project's provincial nature. It was understood that Congress could only fund projects which benefited the nation as a whole, but the Maysville project was "purely local matter:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has no connection with any established system of improvements; is exclusively within the limits of a State, starting at a point on the Ohio River and running out 60 miles to an interior town, and even as far as the State is interested conferring partial instead of general advantages.{{citation needed}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson was quick to clarify that this did not imply that he would approve of projects which were of "national" character. Even though there is not a constitutional argument to be made against this type of action, it would be unwise to do so at the time, given the public debt. Until the debt was paid off, there would be no surplus to spend on these projects.

Generally, Jackson supported internal improvements. During his first term, he sanctioned federal expenditures for transportation projects at a rate nearly double that of the expenditures under President [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Deusen p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as good policy to spend federal money on national improvements, as long as two conditions were met. First, they should be done pursuant to a general system of improvement, not by ad hoc legislation. Second, the Constitution should be amended to make clear the limits on federal power.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Currie, ''The Constitution in Congress: Democrats and Whigs, 1829-1861'' (U of Chicago Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that Jackson's veto can be seen as largely driven by personal, rather than political motives, particularly given Jackson's approval of internal improvement bills with as much a local nature as the Maysville Road. Jackson's veto may have been one of the many manifestations of the rivalry between Jackson and Henry Clay, who was one of the major proponents of the Maysville Road as part of his [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].

Because the Maysville Road Project was of a local nature, the veto did not encounter resounding opposition in Congress. In fact, the veto would please voters in New York and Pennsylvania who were responsible for financing their own projects, and saw no reason to help fund similar projects in other states. It also appealed to Southern [[states' rights]] supporters who had no need for canals or new roads. For Jackson, this decision underscored his belief that the construction of roads and canals lay more within the realm of the states rather than the federal government. This belief in limiting the federal government's scope of action was to be one of the tenets of [[Jacksonian democracy]].

In 1846 President [[James K. Polk]], an admirer and follower of Jackson, vetoed the [[Rivers and Harbors Bill]] on similar grounds. [[Henry Clay]] and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], in contrast to Jackson, supported both the 1830 and 1846 bills because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), 232–37&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Route 68==
While Henry Clay and the Whig Party lost the argument, the two positions represented by the Maysville Road veto continued to face each other into the future. A route that closely approximated the surveyed right-of-way for the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike received substantial federal aid in the 20th century and would be designated as part of [[U.S. Route 68]]. This aid and designation represented a reversal of the principles set forth by Jackson in his 1830 veto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">An '''onward ticket''' is a proof of a booked train, bus or airline ticket originating from the country about to be entered.

An onward ticket reflects any of these:
* a round-trip [[airline ticket]]
* an airline or train or bus ticket from one country to another 
* a one-way airline ticket to a country with an onward ticket requirement as a stop-over

==When required==
An onward ticket can be required, based on the countries' entry requirements (which may or may not include the onward ticket). Many countries insist a flight ticket be held out from their country, which must be presented upon arrival at immigration. They set this requirement, so that if travellers run out of money, the country is certain that the traveller can depart. In the past, travellers would remain in a country supporting themselves by illicit employment. Without an onward ticket, a traveller may be refused entry to these countries and subsequently placed on the next plane for the destination from where he arrived. 

However, there are also many states that do not operate this policy and are less strict in the application of the law of the countries' customs. To determine which do and do not, [[guide book]]s, websites of the own [[Foreign minister|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] or the relevant [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] and/or other sources may be used.

'''''Ornelas v. United States''''', 517 U.S. 690 (1996), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that held that appellate courts should review [[probable cause]] determinations for warrantless searches [[De novo review|de novo]].&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Allen, J.L. Hoffman, D.A. Livingston &amp; W.J. Stuntz.  ''Comprehensive Criminal Procedure, Second Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York.  2005, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual background==
In December 1992, Detective Pautz of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department was conducting drug interdiction when he noticed a 1981 two door Oldsmobile with California plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Ornelas v. United States|volume=517|page=690|pin=691|year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pautz radioed his dispatcher to check the registration of the car, and he ran the name of the owner, Miguel Ledesma Ornelas, through the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System ([[NADDIS]]).  NADDIS reported that Ornelas was a heroin dealer.  Two more officers arrived on the scene.  An officer asked Ornelas if he had any contraband in the car, and Ornelas responded negatively.  Detective Hurrle requested permission to search the car, and Ornelas consented.  Deputy Luedke searched the car and noticed a loose door panel with a rusty screw.  Deputy Luedke  removed the panel and found two kilograms of cocaine.  Ornelas and his accomplice, Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma, were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''Ornelas'', 517 U.S. at 692-693.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornelas filed a motion to suppress in the District Court.  The court found that the officers had probable cause to remove the door panel and denied the motion.  Ornelas was convicted and appealed to the [[Seventh Circuit]].

==Decision==
===Majority opinion===
Writing for a majority of eight Justices, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that the Supreme Court itself had never expressly deferred to the probable cause determination of lower courts.  The Court reasoned that deferential appellate review could cause varied and inconsistent results, and that it would hinder the clarification of the law.  De novo review would unify precedent and provide clearer guidance for police.&lt;ref&gt;''Ornelas'', 517 U.S. at 696-699.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court held that probable cause determinations for warrantless searches should be reviewed de novo, but also that "an appeals court should give due weight to a trial court's finding that the officer was credible and the inference was reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Ornelas'', 517 U.S. at 700.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ornelas' conviction was vacated and the case was remanded to the Seventh Circuit. 

===Scalia's dissent===
Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that probable cause determinations are necessarily fact intensive and unsuited to de novo review by an appellate court.  Scalia also noted that true de novo review was inconsistent with giving due weight to police inferences.&lt;ref&gt;''Ornelas'', 517 U.S. at 701-705 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent history==
On remand in the Seventh Circuit the court reviewed the probable cause determination de novo and affirmed the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Ornelas |vol=96 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1450 |pinpoint= |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=1996 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/96/1450/503932/ |accessdate=2018-08-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''Ornelas'' was initially viewed as a victory for criminal defendants because de novo review was thought to be more critical and searching than deference to the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Sklansky, ''Traffic Stops, Minority Motorists, and the Future of the Fourth Amendment'', 1997 Sup. Ct. Rev. 271, 300&lt;/ref&gt;  David Sklansky, however, suggests that the "due weight" given police inferences is actually more favorable to law enforcement than a clear error standard for reviewing District Court determinations.&lt;ref&gt;Sklansky at 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LGBT rights}}
'''Paragraph 175''' (known formally as [[German legal citation|§175 StGB]]; also known as '''Section 175''' in [[English language|English]]) was a provision of the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German Criminal Code]] from 15 May 1871 to 10 March 1994. It made [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts between males a crime, and in early revisions the provision also criminalized [[bestiality]] as well as forms of prostitution and underage sexual abuse. All in all, around 140,000 men were convicted under the law.

The statute drew legal influence from previous measures, including those undertaken by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Prussian state]]s. It was amended several times. The [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] broadened the law in 1935; in the prosecutions that followed, thousands died in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] as a widespread [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|social persecution of homosexuals took place]].

==Historical overview==
Paragraph 175 was adopted in 1871, shortly after Germany was unified. Beginning in the 1890s, sexual reformers fought against the "disgraceful paragraph",&lt;ref&gt;For this expression ("disgraceful paragraph") see, among others, [[Kurt Tucholsky]], "Röhm", in ''The Weimar Republic Sourcebook'' University of California Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-520-06775-4}}, p.&amp;nbsp;714: "We oppose the disgraceful paragraph 175 wherever we can; therefore, we may not join voices with the chorus that would condemn a man because he is a homosexual." The essay was originally published (in German) in ''Die Weltbühne'', No. 17 (April 26, 1932) 641.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon won the support of [[August Bebel]], head of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). However, a petition in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] to abolish Paragraph 175 foundered in 1898.&lt;ref name="Magnus"&gt;{{cite book|title=Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom|author=E. Mancini|year=2010|isbn=0230114393}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, a Reichstag Committee decided to broaden the paragraph to make lesbian sexual acts punishable as well, but debates about how to define female sexuality meant the proposal languished and was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Desiring Emancipation: New Women and Homosexuality in Germany, 1890–1933|author=Marti M. Lybeck|pages=110–115|isbn=1438452217|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, another Reichstag Committee decided to repeal Paragraph 175 with the votes of the Social Democrats, the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KPD) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP); however, the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] prevented the implementation of the repeal.&lt;ref name="Magnus"/&gt; Although modified at various times, the paragraph remained part of German law until 1994.&lt;ref name="Magnus"/&gt;

In 1935, the Nazis broadened the law so that the courts could pursue any "lewd act" whatsoever, even one involving no physical contact, such as [[masturbation|masturbating]] next to each other.&lt;ref name="Clayton"&gt;{{cite book|title=Male Homosexuality in West Germany: Between Persecution and Freedom, 1945-69|page=29|year=2012|author=Clayton J. Whisnant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convictions multiplied by a factor of ten to over 8,000 per year by 1937.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;"Statistisches Reichsamt", Jürgen Baumann: ''Paragraph 175'', Luchterhand, Darmstadt 1968, collected in: Hans-Georg Stümke, Rudi Finkler: ''Rosa Winkel, rosa Listen'', Rowohlt TB-V., Juli 1985, {{ISBN|3-499-14827-7}}, S. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Gestapo]] could transport suspected offenders to [[concentration camp]]s without any legal justification at all (even if they had been acquitted or already served their sentence in jail). Thus, over 10,000 homosexual men were forced into concentration camps, where they were identified by the [[pink triangle]]. The majority of them died there.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=We are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics|author=Mark Blasius, Shane Phelan|page=134|year=1997|isbn=0415908590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nazi persecution of homosexuals is reasonably well known today, far less attention has been given to the continuation of this persecution in post-war Germany.&lt;ref name="Clayton"/&gt; In 1945, after the concentration camps were liberated, some homosexual prisoners were recalled to custody to serve out their two-year sentence under Paragraph 175.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasvoice.com/pink-triangle-wwii-gay-victims-nazis-continued-persecuted-1061488.html Pink triangle: Even after World War II, gay victims of Nazis continued to be persecuted]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, East Germany abolished Nazi amendments to Paragraph 175, whereas West Germany kept them and even had them confirmed by its [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]]. About 100,000 men were implicated in legal proceedings from 1945 to 1969, and about 50,000 were convicted.&lt;ref name="Clayton"/&gt; Some individuals accused under Paragraph 175 committed suicide. In 1969, the government eased Paragraph 175 by providing for an [[age of consent]] of 21.&lt;ref name=Tipton&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MCXQlcZNL8C&amp;pg=PA584 |title=A History of Modern Germany Since 1815 |first=Frank B. |last=Tipton |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |page=584 |isbn=978-0-520-24049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent was lowered to 18 in 1973, and finally, in 1994, the paragraph was repealed and the age of consent lowered to 14, the same that is in force for heterosexual acts.&lt;ref name=Tipton/&gt; East Germany had already reformed its more lenient version of the paragraph in 1968, and repealed it in 1988.&lt;ref name=Tipton/&gt;

==Texts of the various versions of Paragraph 175==
===Version of May 15, 1871===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''§&amp;nbsp;175 Unnatural fornication''

Unnatural fornication, whether between persons of the male sex or of humans with beasts, is to be punished by imprisonment; a sentence of loss of civil rights may also be passed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Version of June 28, 1935===
In the statute of 1935 (and that of 1969), there is a recurring phrase with minor variations: in its first appearance it is ''"...mit einem anderen Mann Unzucht treibt oder sich von ihm zur Unzucht mißbrauchen läßt"''. The connotations of this are difficult to render into English for two reasons:

#English has no concise, non-obscene verbal phrase equivalent to ''Unzucht treiben'': in a sexual context, ''Unzucht treiben'' specifically suggests a person doing something ''to'' another.
#The 1935 statute removed the previous qualifier ''widernatürlich'' ("against nature"). In the 1871 statute, in combination with ''widernatürlich'', ''Unzucht'' clearly meant [[anal sex]]. However, ''Unzucht'' without the qualifier could be interpreted in a much broader sense simply as "lewdness", leading to the possibility of punishment for acts as mild as kissing, fondling, or mutual masturbation that previously would not have been considered criminal. This was not merely an aberration of the Nazi era: the courts in the Federal Republic (West Germany) understood the term similarly.

Hence, a relatively close rendering of the recurring phrase would be "commits lewdness (as the active partner) with another man or allows such an abuse to be done to him"; the translation below opts for a slightly less awkward "engages as the active or passive partner in lewdness with another man".

&lt;blockquote&gt;''§&amp;nbsp;175 Lewdness between men''

:I. A man who engages as the active or passive partner in lewdness with another man is to be punished by imprisonment.
:II. With an involved party who at the time of the act had not yet reached the age of twenty-one years, the Court can refrain from punishment in mild cases.

''§&amp;nbsp;175a Severe lewdness (''Schwere Unzucht'')''

A punishment of up to ten years in the penitentiary, and even with mitigating circumstances no less than three months imprisonment for:
:1. a man, who by force or by threat of harm to life and limb forces another man to engage in such an act as either the active or passive partner;
:2. a man, who by abusing a dependency founded in a service-, work-, or employment-based relationship coerces another man into engaging in such an act as either the active or passive partner;
:3. a man over twenty-one years old who entices a male under twenty-one years old to engage in such an act as either the active or passive partner;
:4. a man who professionally offers himself for such an act as either the active or passive partner.

''§&amp;nbsp;175b Bestiality''

Unnatural fornication of a man with a beast is to be punished by imprisonment; a sentence of loss of civil rights may also be passed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German-language title of §&amp;nbsp;175b is ''"Sodomie"'', the modern German-language equivalent of "[[zoophilia|bestiality]]". In modern German, ''Sodomie'' does not carry the meaning [[anal intercourse]] at all. The now-dominant English-language meaning of the word "[[sodomy]]" has been lost during the past centuries and nowadays is completely unknown to a native speaker of German. ''(See German-language article [[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]].)''

===Version of June 25, 1969 (West Germany)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''§&amp;nbsp;175 Fornication between men''

(1) Imprisonment of up to five years shall be the punishment for:
:1. a man over eighteen years old who engages as the active or passive partner in lewdness with another man under the age of twenty-one;
:2. a man, who by abusing a dependency founded in a service-, work-, or employment-based relationship coerces another man into engaging in such an act as either the active or passive partner;
:3. a man who professionally offers himself for such an act as either the active or passive partner.
(2) In the case of paragraph 1 Number 2 the ''attempt'' is punishable.&lt;br&gt;
(3) With an involved party who at the time of the act had not yet reached the age of twenty-one years, the Court can refrain from punishment.
&lt;br&gt;
§&amp;nbsp;175b voided.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Version of November 23, 1973 (West Germany)===
Besides the reduction of the age of consent, the 1973 amendment to the statute changes the wording. In place of ''Unzucht'', it refers to ''sexuelle Handlungen'' ("sexual acts"). The language, although much milder in its connotations, still carries an echo of the previous language about active and passive partners: ''"sexuelle Handlungen ... vornimmt oder ... an sich vornehmen läßt"'' ("commits sexual acts or allows them to be committed"). It also, by its vagueness, is almost as broad as the wording in the 1935 statute.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''§&amp;nbsp;175 Homosexual Acts''

(1) A man over eighteen years old, who commits sexual acts with a man under eighteen years or allows a man under eighteen years to commit such acts with him, will be punished with imprisonment of up to five years.

(2) The Court can refrain from punishment according to this section if
:1. the person who committed the act was at the time of the act less than twenty-one years old or
:2. taking into consideration the conduct of the victim, the wrong of the act is small. "bei Berücksichtigung des Verhaltens desjenigen, gegen den die Tat sich richtet, das Unrecht der Tat gering ist."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Version of March 10, 1994===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''§&amp;nbsp;175 Homosexual Acts'' voided

==Background==
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|Burning of Sodomites outside the walls of [[Zürich]], 1482 ([[Spiezer Schilling]])]] 
Most sodomy-related laws in [[Western civilization]] originated from the growth of Christianity during [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Gaylaw"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=BZTnDgeygHkC&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=history%20of%20sodomy%20laws%20Christianity&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20sodomy%20laws%20Christianity&amp;f=false | title=Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Eskridge, William N. | year=2009 | pages=161| isbn=9780674036581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1532, the [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] produced a foundation for this principle of law, which remained valid in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the end of the 18th century. In the words of Paragraph 116 of that code:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The punishment for fornication that goes against nature. cxvj. When a human commits fornication with a beast, a man with a man, a woman with a woman, they have also forfeited life. And they should be, according to the common custom, banished by fire from life into death.&lt;ref&gt;"Straff der vnkeusch, so wider die Natur beschicht. cxvj. ITem so eyn mensch mit eynem vihe, mann mit mann, weib mit weib, vnkeusch treiben, die haben auch das leben verwürckt, vnd man soll sie der gemeynen gewonheyt nach mit dem fewer vom leben zum todt richten." - ''Die Peinliche Gerichtsordnung Kaiser Karls V (Carolina)'', ed. and comm. by Friedrich-Christian Schroeder (Suttgart: Reclam, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1786 the Austrian-born [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold of Tuscany]] abolished the [[death penalty]] for all crimes (including sodomy) and replaced it with prison and hard labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Barbaric Punishment: Abolishing the Death Penalty|page=49|year=2003|author=Hans Göran Franck, Klas Nyman|isbn=904112151X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794, [[Prussia]] introduced the ''[[Allgemeines Landrecht]]'', a major reform of laws that replaced the death penalty for this offense with a term of imprisonment. Paragraph 143 of that code says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unnatural fornication, whether between persons of the male sex or of humans with beasts, is punished with imprisonment of six months to four years, with the further punishment of a prompt loss of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;1794, Allgemeines Landrecht of Prussia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[France]], the [[French Penal Code of 1791|Revolutionary Penal Code]] of 1791 punished acts of this nature only when someone's rights were injured (i.e., in the case of a non-[[consent|consensual]] act), which had the effect of the complete legalization of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Homosexuality in Modern France|author=Jeffrey Merrick, Bryant T. Ragan|page=82|year=1996|isbn=0195093038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of his conquests, [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] exported the French Penal Code beyond France into a sequence of other states such as the [[Netherlands]]. [[Bavaria]], too, adopted the French model and in 1813 removed from its lawbooks all prohibitions of consensual sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig II King of Bavaria|author=Clara Tschudi|year=2015|page=217|isbn=1329073738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of these developments, two years before the 1871 founding of the [[German Empire]], the Prussian kingdom, worried over the future of the paragraph, sought a scientific basis for this piece of legislation. The Ministry of Justice assigned a ''[[Deputation für das Medizinalwesen]]'' ("Deputation for medical knowledge"), including, among others, the famous [[physician]]s [[Rudolf Virchow]] and [[Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben]], who, however, stated in their appraisal of March 24, 1869 that they were unable to give a scientific grounding for a law that outlawed zoophilia and [[male homosexual intercourse]], distinguishing them from the many other sexual acts that were not even considered as matters of penal law.&lt;ref name="Wie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jens Dobler|title=Wie öffentliche Moral gemacht wird: Die Einführung des § 175 in das Strafgesetzbuch 1871|language=German|year=2014|isbn=3863001869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the draft penal law submitted by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] in 1870 to the [[North German Confederation]] retained the relevant Prussian penal provisions, justifying this out of concern for "[[public opinion]]".&lt;ref name="Wie"/&gt;

On January 1, 1872, exactly one year after it had first taken effect, the penal code of the North German Confederation became the penal code of the entire German Empire.
By this change, sexual intercourse between men became again a punishable offence in Bavaria as well. Almost verbatim from its Prussian model from 1794, the new Paragraph 175 of the imperial penal code specified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unnatural fornication, whether between persons of the male sex or of humans with beasts, is punished with imprisonment, with the further punishment of a prompt loss of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;1872, Imperial Penal Code of Prussia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even in the 1860s, individuals such as [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] and [[Karl Maria Kertbeny]] had unsuccessfully raised their voices against the Prussian paragraph 143.&lt;ref name="Magnus"/&gt; In the Empire, more organized opposition began with the 1897 founding of the sexual-reformist Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee (WhK, [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]), an organization of notables rather than a mass movement, which tried to proceed against Paragraph 175 based on the thesis of the [[Sexual orientation|innate nature of homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="John1974"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Early Homosexual Rights Movement (1864–1935) |author1=John Lauritsen |author2=David Thorstad |year=1974 |isbn=0-87810-027-X |publisher=Times Change Press |location=New York}}.  Revised edition published 1995, {{ISBN|0-87810-041-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was argued, for example, in an 1897 petition drafted by physician and WhK chairman [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], urging the deletion of Paragraph 175; it gathered 6,000 signatories.&lt;ref name="John1974"/&gt; One year later, SPD chairman [[August Bebel]] brought the petition into the Reichstag, but failed to achieve the desired effect. On the contrary, ten years later the government laid plans to extend Paragraph 175 to women as well. Part of their "Scheme for a German Penal Code" (E 1909) reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The danger to family life and to youth is the same.  The fact that there are more such cases in recent times is reliably testified. It lies therefore in the interest of morality as in that of the general welfare that penal provisions be expanded also to women.&lt;ref name="Stumke 1989"&gt;{{cite book|first=Hans-Georg|last=Stümke|title=Homosexuelle in Deutschland : Eine politische Geschichte|location=München|year=1989|isbn=3-406-33130-0|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allowing time for the refinement of the draft, it was set to appear before the Reichstag no earlier than 1917. [[World War I]] and the defeat of the German Empire consigned it to the dustbin.

There was a vigorous grassroots campaign against Paragraph 175 between 1919 and 1929, led by an alliance of the [[Adolf Brand|Gemeinschaft der Eigenen]] and the [[Magnus Hirschfeld|Wissenschaftlich-humanitäre Komitee]]. But, much as during the time of the Empire, during the [[Weimar Republic]] the parties of the left failed to achieve the abolition of Paragraph 175, because they lacked a majority in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].&lt;ref name="Stumke 1989 p65"&gt;Stümke 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans of a center-[[right-wing politics|right]] regime in 1925 to increase the penalties of Paragraph 175 came closer to fruition; but they, too, failed. In addition to paragraph 296 (which corresponded to the old paragraph 175), their proposed reform draft provided for a paragraph 297 to be included. The plan was that so-called "qualified cases" such as homosexual [[prostitution]], sex with young men under the age of 21, and sexual coercion of a man in a service or work situation would be classified as "severe cases", reclassified as [[felony|felonies]] (''Verbrechen'') rather than [[misdemeanor]]s (''Vergehen''). This [[Act of Parliament|act]] would have pertained not only to homosexual intercourse but also to other homosexual acts such as, for example, [[mutual masturbation]].&lt;ref name="Stumke 1989 p65"/&gt;

Both new paragraphs grounded themselves in protection of [[public health]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is to be assumed that it is the German view that sexual relationships between men are an aberration liable to wreck the character and to destroy moral feeling.  Clinging to this aberration leads to the degeneration of the people and to the decay of its strength.&lt;ref name="Stumke 1989 p65"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When this draft was discussed in 1929 by the judiciary committee of the Reichstag, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]], and the left-wing liberal [[German Democratic Party]] at first managed to mobilize a majority of 15 to 13 votes against Paragraph 296. This would have constituted legalization of consensual homosexuality between adult men.&lt;ref name="Duldung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ablehnung – Duldung – Anerkennung|author1=Renate Loos |author2=Horst Lademacher |author3=Simon Groenveld |pages=697–702|isbn=3830961618|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a vast majority{{spaced ndash}}with only three KPD votes dissenting{{spaced ndash}}supported the introduction of the new Paragraph 297 (dealing with the so-called "qualified cases").&lt;ref name="Duldung"/&gt;

However, this partial success{{spaced ndash}}which the WhK characterized as "one step forward and two steps back"&lt;ref name="Sex and Weimar"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and the Weimar Republic|pages=121–122|author=Laurie Marhoefer|isbn=1442626577|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}came to nought. In March 1930, the ''Inter-Parliamentary Committee for the Coordination of Criminal Law Between Germany and Austria'', by a vote of 23 to 21, placed back Paragraph 296 in the reform package. But the latter was never passed, because during the last years of the Weimar Republic, the years of the ''{{ill|Präsidialkabinett|de|lt=Präsidialkabinette}}'', the parliamentary legislative process generally ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="Duldung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Weimar"/&gt;

In 1935 the [[Nazism|Nazis]] strengthened Paragraph 175 by redefining the crime as a felony and thus increasing the maximum penalty from six months' to five years' imprisonment. Further, they removed the longtime tradition that the law applied only to penetrative intercourse. A criminal offense would now exist if "objectively the general sense of shame was offended" and subjectively "the debauched intention was present to excite sexual desire in one of the two men, or a third".&lt;ref&gt;[The quotations are from German [[case law]], RGSt 73, 78, 80 f.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual physical contact was no longer necessary.&lt;ref name="Queer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Queer Identities and Politics in Germany|page=215|author=Clayton Whisnant|year=2016|isbn=1939594103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond that{{spaced ndash}}much as had already been planned in 1925{{spaced ndash}}a new Paragraph 175a was created, punishing "qualified cases" as ''schwere Unzucht'' ("severe lewdness") with no less than one year and no more than ten years in the penitentiary.&lt;ref name="Queer"/&gt; These included:
*homosexual acts forced through violence or threats (male rape),
*sexual relations with a subordinate or employee in a work situation,
*homosexual acts with men under the age of 21,
*male prostitution.
"Unnatural fornication with a beast" was moved to Paragraph 175b.

According to the official rationale, Paragraph 175 was amended in the interest of the moral health of the ''[[Volk]]''{{spaced ndash}}the German people{{spaced ndash}}because "according to experience" homosexuality "inclines toward plague-like propagation" and exerts "a ruinous influence" on the "circles concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethik und Herrschaftsordnung: ein Beitrag zum Problem der Legitimation|author=Georg Geismann|year=1974|page=77|isbn=3165358516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aggravation of the severity of Paragraph 175 in 1935 increased the number of convictions tenfold, to 8,000 annually.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; Only about half of the prosecutions resulted from police work; about 40 percent resulted from private accusations (''Strafanzeige'') by non-participating observers, and about 10 percent were denouncements by employers and institutions. So, for example, in 1938 the [[Gestapo]] received the following anonymous letter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We{{spaced ndash}}a large part of the artists' block [of flats or studios] at Barnayweg{{spaced ndash}}ask you urgently to observe B., living with Mrs. F as a subtenant, who has remarkable daily visits from young men. This must not continue. [...] We ask you cordially to give the matter further observation.&lt;ref name="Pretzel 2000"&gt;Andreas Pretzel: ''"Als Homosexueller in Erscheinung getreten."''

In contradistinction to normal police, the Gestapo were authorized to take gay men into [[preventive detention]] (''Schutzhaft'') of arbitrary duration without an accusation (or even after an [[acquittal]]). This was often the fate of so-called "repeat offenders": at the end of their sentences, they were not freed but sent for additional "re-education" (''Umerziehung'') in a [[concentration camp]]. Only about 40 percent of these [[pink triangle]] prisoners{{spaced ndash}}whose numbers amounted to an estimated 10,000{{spaced ndash}}survived the camps.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; Some of them, after their release by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], were placed back in prison, because they had not yet finished court-mandated terms of imprisonment for homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="vonWahl"&gt;Angelika von Wahl: How Sexuality Changes Agency: Gay Men, Jews, and Transitional Justice.

==After World War II==

===Development in East Germany===
[[File:Victim of fascism.jpg|thumb|Invalidated ("ungültig") OdF identity card: The Magistrate of East Berlin refused any [[pink triangle|pink-triangle prisoner]] the right to receive a pension as a "victim of fascism" (''"Opfer des Faschismus"'', hence ''"OdF"'').]]

In the Soviet Occupied Zone that later became East Germany (''see [[History of Germany since 1945]]''), the development of law was not uniform. &lt;!--The government of [[Thuringia]] moderated Paragraphs 175 and 175a in a manner similar to that contemplated in the draft criminal code of 1925, while in the other states (''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'') the 1935 version of the statute remained in effect without changes. Although in 1946 the ''Committee for Law Examination'' of [[East Berlin]] specifically advised not to include §&amp;nbsp;175 StGB in a new criminal code, this recommendation had no consequences.--&gt; The Provincial High Court in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (''Oberlandesgericht Halle, or OLG Halle'') decided for [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in 1948 that Paragraphs 175 and 175a were to be seen as injustice perpetrated by the Nazis, because a [[Progressivism|progressive]] juridical development had been broken off and even been reversed. Homosexual acts were to be tried only according to the laws of the Weimar Republic.&lt;ref name="Vorbehalt"&gt;{{cite book|title=NS-Opfer unter Vorbehalt: homosexuelle Männer in Berlin nach 1945|language=German|author= Andreas Pretzel|page=191|year=2002|isbn=3825863905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, one year after being reconstituted as the [[German Democratic Republic]], the Berlin Appeal Court (''Kammergericht Berlin'') decided for all of [[East Germany]] to reinstate the validity of the old, pre-1935 form of Paragraph 175.&lt;ref name="Vorbehalt"/&gt; However, in contrast to the earlier action of the OLG Halle, the new Paragraph 175a remained unchanged, because it was said to protect society against "socially harmful homosexual acts of qualified character". In 1954, the same court decided that Paragraph 175a, in contrast to Paragraph 175, did not presuppose acts tantamount to sexual intercourse. Lewdness (''Unzucht'') was defined as any act that is performed to arouse sexual excitement and "violates the moral sentiment of our workers".&lt;ref name="Vorbehalt"/&gt;

A revision of the criminal code in 1957 made it possible to put aside prosecution of an illegal action that represented no danger to [[Socialism|socialist]] society because of lack of consequence. This removed Paragraph 175 from the effective body of the law, because at the same time the East Berlin Court of Appeal (''Kammergericht'') decided that all punishments deriving from the old form of Paragraph 175 should be suspended due to the insignificance of the acts to which it had been applied. On this basis, homosexual acts between consenting adults ceased to be punished, beginning in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Kammer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Die letzte Fahrt mit dem Fahrrad: 19 Gespräche mit Matteo über Mut, Glück und Aufbegehren in der DDR|author=Wilfried Bergholz|year=2016|isbn=3734525055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 1968, the GDR adopted its own code of criminal law. In it §&amp;nbsp;151 StGB-DDR provided for a sentence up to three years' imprisonment or probation for an adult (18 and over) who engaged in sexual acts with a youth (under 18) of the same sex. This law applied not only to men who have sex with boys but equally to women who have sex with girls.&lt;ref&gt;1968, Basic Law of the GDR, §&amp;nbsp;151 StGB-DDR&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1987 the Supreme Court of the GDR struck down a conviction under Paragraph 151 on the basis that "homosexuality, just like heterosexuality, represents a variant of sexual behavior. Homosexual people do therefore not stand outside socialist society, and the civil rights are warranted to them exactly as to all other citizens." One year later, the [[Volkskammer]] (the parliament of the GDR), in its fifth revision of the criminal code, brought the written law in line with what the court had ruled, striking Paragraph 151 without replacement. The act passed into law May 30, 1989. This removed all specific reference to homosexuality from East German criminal law.&lt;ref name="books-RemqUXsMyMsC-253"&gt;Christian Schäfer: ''"Widernatürliche Unzucht"'' (2006), S.&amp;nbsp;253 ({{Google books|RemqUXsMyMsC||page=253}})&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the victorious Allies demanded the abolition of all laws with specifically National Socialist content; however, they left it to [[West Germany]] to decide whether or not the expansion of laws regulating male homosexual relationships falling under Paragraph 175 should be left in place. On May 10, 1957 the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] upheld the decision to retain the 1935 version, claiming that the paragraph was "not influenced by National Socialist [i.e., Nazi] politics to such a degree that it would have to be abolished in a free democratic state".&lt;ref&gt;''"damit sollte nicht ausgeschlossen sein, daß diese ihrerseits zu der Auffassung kamen, gewisse Vorschriften seien so stark von nationalsozialistischem Geist geprägt, daß sie mit dem Rechtssystem eines demokratischen Staates unvereinbar und daher nicht mehr anzuwenden seien."'' [http://www.schwulencity.de/BVerfGE_6_389.html BVerfGE 6, 389 - Homosexuelle], on SchwulenCity.de. Accessed 3 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1945 and 1969, about 100,000 men were indicted and about 50,000 men sentenced to prison. The rate of convictions for violation of Paragraph 175 rose by 44 percent, and in the 1960s, the number remained as much as four times higher than it had been in the last years of the Weimar Republic.&lt;ref name=moeller2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moeller |first1=Robert G. |title=Private Acts, Public Anxieties, and the Fight to Decriminalize Male Homosexuality in West Germany |journal=Feminist Studies |date=Fall 2010 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=528–552 |jstor=27919120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many arrests, lawsuits, and proceedings in Frankfurt in 1950–1951 had serious consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A nineteen-year-old jumped off the [[Goetheturm]] after having received a [[summons]], another fled to South America, another to Switzerland, a dental technician and his friend poisoned themselves with coal gas. In total there were six known suicides. Many of the accused lost their jobs.&lt;ref name="Kraushaar 1997"&gt;Elmar Kraushaar: Unzucht vor Gericht: ''"Die 'Frankfurter Prozesse' und die Kontinuität des §&amp;nbsp;175 in den fünfziger Jahren."'' ("The 'Frankfurt Trials' and the continuity of §&amp;nbsp;175 in the Fifties") In Elmar Kraushaar (ed.): ''Hundert Jahre schwul: Eine Revue''. (One Hundred years of Homosexuality: a revue) Berlin 1997. S. 60–69. {{ISBN|3-87134-307-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar to the thinking during the Nazi Regime, the government argued that there was a difference between a homosexual man and a homosexual woman, and because all men were more aggressive and predatory than women, lesbianism would not be criminalized. While lesbianism violated nature, it did not present the same threat to society as did male homosexuality.&lt;ref name=moeller2010 /&gt;

First convening in 1954, the legal experts in the criminal code commission (Strafrechtskommission) continued to debate the future of Paragraph 175; while the constitutional court ruled it was not unconstitutional, this did not mean it should forever remain in force. It was therefore the commission's job to advise the Ministry of Justice and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer about the new form this law should take. While they all agreed homosexual activity was immoral, they were divided when it came to whether or not it should be allowed to be practiced between consenting adults in private. Due to their belief that homosexuals were not born that way, but rather, they fell victim to seduction, the Justice Ministry officials remained concerned that if freed from criminal penalty, adult homosexuals would intensify their "propaganda and activity in public" and put male youth at risk.&lt;ref name=moeller2010 /&gt;
During the administration of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s government, a draft penal code for West Germany (known as ''Strafgesetzbuch E 1962''; it was never adopted) justified retaining paragraph 175 as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning male homosexuality, the legal system must, more than in other areas, erect a bulwark against the spreading of this vice, which otherwise would represent a serious danger for a healthy and natural life of the people.&lt;ref name="Stumke 1989 p183"&gt;Stümke 1989: p.&amp;nbsp;183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With new national Bundestag (West Germany's parliament) elections coming up, the Social Democratic Party was coming into power, first in 1966 as part of a broad coalition, and by 1969, with a parliamentary majority. With the Social Democrats holding the power, they were finally in a position to make key appointments in the Ministry of Justice and start implementing reform. In addition, demographic anxieties such as fear of declining birth rate no longer controlled the 1960s and homosexual men were no longer seen as a threat for not being able to reproduce. The role of the state was seen as protecting society from harm, and should only intervene in cases that involved force or the abuse of minors.&lt;ref name=moeller2010 /&gt;

On June 25, 1969, shortly before the end of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU){{spaced ndash}}SPD Grand Coalition headed by CDU Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]], Paragraph 175 was reformed, in that only the "qualified cases" that were previously handled in §175a{{spaced ndash}}sex with a man less than 21 years old,  homosexual prostitution, and the exploitation of a relationship of dependency (such as employing or supervising a person in a work situation){{spaced ndash}}were retained.&lt;ref name="Bound"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bound and Unbound: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Genders and Sexualities|pages=141–142|year=2002|author1=Zowie Davy |author2=Julia Downes |author3=Lena Eckert |isbn=1443810851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paragraph 175b (concerning bestiality) also was removed.

With the 1969 reform in place, the acceptance of homosexual acts or homosexual identities for West Germans was far from in place. Most reformers agreed that decriminalizing sexual relations between adult men was not the same as advocating an acceptance of homosexual men. While the old view of "militarized" masculinity may have phased out, "family-centered" masculinity was now grounded in the traditional male, and being a proper man meant being a proper father, which was believed at the time to be a role a homosexual male could not fulfill.&lt;ref name=moeller2010 /&gt;

On November 23, 1973, the social-liberal coalition of the SPD and the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] passed a complete reform of the laws concerning sex and sexuality. The paragraph was renamed from "Crimes and misdemeanors against morality" into "Offenses against sexual self-determination", and the word ''Unzucht'' ("lewdness") was replaced by the equivalent of the term "sexual acts". Paragraph 175 only retained sex with minors as a qualifying attribute; the [[age of consent]] was lowered to 18 (compared to 14 for heterosexual sex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbuch Sexualstraftaten: Die Delikte gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung|author=Klaus Laubenthal|year=2012|isbn=3642255566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] and the first openly gay member of the German parliament tried to remove Paragraph 175 together with Paragraph 182. This would have meant a general age of consent of 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13487885.html|title=Lebensbund besiegelt|date=4 February 1991|accessdate=20 October 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification||Article only mentions a Greens initiative without a date, presumably in 1991, and neither par. 182 nor age of consent|date=October 2016}} This was opposed by the CDU, SPD, and FDP,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and Paragraph 175 remained a part of German law for eight more years.

==Developments after 1990==

===The deletion of Paragraph 175===
[[File:Poster against Paragraph 175.jpg|thumb|upright|''"Down with §175"''&lt;br&gt;Since 1973 the gay movement had openly been demanding the deletion of Paragraph 175. This 1973 poster uses the [[new left]] icon of a raised fist and calls on the reader to fight against discrimination in the family, in the workplace, and in [individuals'] search for housing.]] In the course of reconciling the legal codes of the two German states after 1990, the [[Bundestag]] had to decide whether Paragraph 175 should be abolished entirely (as in the former East Germany) or whether the remaining West German form of the law should be extended to what had now become the eastern portion of the Federal Republic. In 1994, at the end of the period of reconciliation of laws, it was decided{{spaced ndash}}especially in view of the social changes that had occurred in the meantime{{spaced ndash}}to strike Paragraph 175 entirely from the legal code.

According to §&amp;nbsp;176 StGB&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ages of consent in Europe#Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; the absolute minimum age of consent is now 14 years for all sexual acts irrespective of the sex of the participants; in special cases, covered in [[§&amp;nbsp;182 StGB]], an age of 16 years applies.&lt;ref&gt;See German-language article [[:de:§&amp;nbsp;182 StGB|§&amp;nbsp;182 StGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; §&amp;nbsp;182 (2) StGB allows for prosecution as an ''[[Antragsdelikt]]'', a concept in German law according to which certain acts are treated as crimes only if the victim chooses to become a complainant. Further, §&amp;nbsp;182 (3) StGB allows the public prosecutor's office to pursue a case on the basis of the belief that there is a special public interest. Finally, §&amp;nbsp;182 (4) StGB allows the court to refrain from punishment if the wrongness of the accused's behavior appears small.

§&amp;nbsp;182 StGB contains numerous terms without precise legal definitions; critics have raised concerns that families can misuse this law to criminalize socially disapproved sexual relationships (e.g. a family disapproving of a young person's homosexual relationship might be able prosecute their partner).

In Austria, an analogous situation exists: Like the German §&amp;nbsp;175 StGB, the Austrian §&amp;nbsp;209 StGB was stricken from the legal code; like the German §&amp;nbsp;182 StGB, the Austrian §&amp;nbsp;207b StGB is perceived by critics as having potential to be abused as a surrogate for the stricken law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexueller Mißbrauch von Jugendlichen: (§ 182 StGB)|author=Thomas Stephan|page=134|isbn=3828884334|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pardon of the victims===
On May 17, 2002{{spaced ndash}}a date chosen symbolically as "17.5"{{spaced ndash}}the Bundestag passed a supplement to the [[Act of Abolition of National Socialism]] (''NS-Aufhebungsgesetzes'').&lt;ref name="lsvd"&gt;{{de icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20041015180827/http://www.lsvd.de/recht/ns09.html Entwurf des Änderungsgesetzes zum NS-Aufhebungsgesetz - Bundestagdrucksache 14/8276] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; By this supplement to the act, Nazi-era convictions of homosexuals and deserters from the [[Wehrmacht]] were annulled. The right-conservative CSU-politician [[Norbert Geis]] called this general amnesty a "dishonor" referring, however, only to the defectors of the Wehrmacht, not to homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/14/14237.pdf Stenographic report of the Bundestag, 14th legislative period, 237th sitting (2002-05-17)], page 23741 (C)&lt;/ref&gt; Louder criticism came from the lesbian and gay movement, because the Bundestag left post-1945 judgments untouched, although the legal basis from the end of the war to 1969 was the same as in the Nazi era.

The issue of pardoning men convicted in the postwar era remained controversial. On May 12, 2016, [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|Federal Minister of Justice]], [[Heiko Maas]], announced that Germany was investigating the possibility of [[pardon]]ing and compensating all gay men convicted under Paragraph 175.&lt;ref name="GuardianQuash"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/germany-quash-historical-convictions-gay-men-criminalised-law|title=Germany to quash historical convictions of gay men |author=Kate Connelly|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 May 2016|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where victims had died still bearing a conviction, the government will instead make payments to gay rights groups.&lt;ref name="GuardianQuash"/&gt; This was confirmed on October 8, 2016, when Maas laid out the compensation scheme and announced that the government was setting aside €30&amp;nbsp;million to cover claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-pay-convicted-gays-30-million-euros-media/a-35996592|title=Germany to pay convicted gays 30 million euros - media|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=8 October 2016|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law comprises both individual pardons and a collective pardon and the documenting of suffering caused by the law, with the full process expected to take up to five years.&lt;ref name="Zeit21Oct"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-10/paragraf-175-bundesjustizministerium-homosexuelle-entschaedigung|title=Verurteilte Homosexuelle sollen Entschädigung erhalten|date=21 October 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=Die Zeit|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected by the pardon can apply for a "vindication certificate", and relatives can apply for a posthumous pardon.&lt;ref name="Zeit21Oct"/&gt; Each person convicted will receive €3,000 compensation, plus €1,500 for each year spent in custody as a result of a conviction under Paragraph 175 – on average, a conviction carried a two-year sentence.&lt;ref name="Zeit21Oct"/&gt; Bundestag Member [[Volker Beck (politician)|Volker Beck]], who was a key figure in establishing a compensation fund for victims of Nazism, suggested that other losses suffered as a result of conviction under Paragraph 175, such as the loss of a job and resulting reduction in pension, should also be taken into account when deciding how much compensation to offer.&lt;ref name="Zeit21Oct"/&gt; In June 2017, the law was passed in [[Bundestag]] by an overwhelming majority in all parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/germany-to-quash-convictions-of-50000-gay-men-under-nazi-era-law Guardian: Germany to quash convictions of 50,000 gay men under Nazi-era law], June 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Police (Scotland) Act 1857''' (20 &amp; 21 Vict c 72) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was one of the [[Police (Scotland) Acts 1857 to 1890]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation made the establishment of a police force mandatory in the [[Counties of Scotland|counties]] of [[Scotland]], and also allowed existing [[burgh]] police forces to be consolidated with a county force.

==Establishment of County Police Forces==
The [[Commissioners of Supply]] for each county were required to form a '''Police Committee''' to administer a police force for their area. The committee was to consist of not more than 15 commissioners, plus the [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[Sheriff]] of the county (or their deputies). The police force forces were to come into existence on 15 March 1858.

A '''Chief Constable''' was to be appointed to each police force by the committee. It was, however, permitted for two or more adjoining counties to appoint a single chief constable. The chief constable was to run the day-to-day activities of the force, and to appoint and dismiss constables. He was also to appoint a deputy chief constable to act in his absence.

The commissioners of supply were to levy a "police assessment" or special rate to finance the constabulary. They were also permitted to divide a county into Police Districts, with constables allocated to each district, and a separate assessment to be paid in each area.

==Jurisdiction of County Constables==
Constables of a county police force were to have full powers within their county, which was to include for policing purposes any detached parts of other counties locally situate within it. Similar provisions were made in regard to  sherriffs and [[Justice of the Peace|justices of the peace]]. They had jurisdiction in all harbours, lochs and bays, and in burghs within the county, and in any adjoining county.

Constables in [[Berwickshire]], [[Dumfriesshire]] and [[Roxburghshire]] were permitted to serve warrants in the counties of [[Cumberland]] and [[Northumberland]] across the English border.

==Inspector of Constabulary==
{{main|Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland}}
An [[Inspector of Constabulary (Scotland)|Inspector of Constabulary]] was to be appointed to ensure that an efficient police system was being operated by the various forces in Scotland. He was to certify annually that each force was being effectively, making it eligible to payment of one quarter of its costs by the treasury.

According to the Inspector's first report in 1859, 32 counties and 57 burghs had established police forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/haynin/haynin0207.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burgh Police Forces==
A number of burghs had established police forces, either under the [[Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1833]] or by local Acts. The magistrates and town council of a burgh could agree with the commissioners of supply of a county to consolidate the burgh force with the county police. One or more members of the town council would be appointed to the county police committee in this case.

Conversely, the Act allowed any burgh which had not yet established a police force to do so within six months of the passing of the Act.

Burgh forces were also to be subject to inspection, but those unconsolidated burghs with a population of 5,000 or less were not permitted to avail of central government funds.

==Exceptions==
The Act did not automatically extend to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], although it could be applied by [[Order in Council]] on the request of the Sheriff of the county.

The Act did not affect any police forces employed by railway or canal companies, or established by local act of parliament.

'''''Saadi v Italy''''' was a case of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) decided in February 2008, in which the Court unanimously reaffirmed and extended principles established in  ''[[Chahal v United Kingdom]]'' regarding the absolute nature of the principle of [[non-refoulement]] and the obligations of a state under [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR).

In particular the Court addressed the role of an [[exchange of notes]] between [[Italy]] (the state which sought to deport Saadi) and [[Tunisia]] (the receiving state, to which he would be deported) and ruled that it was inadequate to protect against the risk that Saadi would be ill-treated, as Tunisia had only restated Tunisian law and had not made the diplomatic assurances against ill-treatment requested by Italy. The ruling did not directly address in its ''ratio'' whether diplomatic assurances could constitute adequate protection in general when such assurances were provided by states known to practice torture, but reiterated in ''dicta'' that even if Italy had received such assurances, the Court would still have examined them for reliability.

==Background==
Nassim Saadi, a [[Tunisia]]n citizen, had resided in Italy since the late 1990s and held a residence permit from the [[Bologna]] police. Saadi was arrested in Italy on charges of conspiracy to commit acts of violence with the aim of spreading terror, falsification of documents, receiving stolen goods, and aiding and abetting illegal entry. At trial before Milan [[Corte d'Assise]], he was found guilty of a downgraded charge of criminal conspiracy on 9 May 2005 and sentenced to four-and-a-half years imprisonment followed by deportation to Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McMahon|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Saadi's [[trial in absentia]] before a military tribunal in [[Tunis]] concluded and resulted in a conviction for [[incitement]] to terrorism and membership in a terrorist organisation, with a sentence of twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentili|2010|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saadi was released on 9 August 2006, but the [[Italian Minister of the Interior]] made a deportation order against him the following day. In [[municipal law]], appeal from the deportation order laid to the {{ill|Regional Administrative Tribunal|it|Tribunale Regionale delle acque pubbliche}} and to the [[Italian Council of State|Council of State]], but execution of the deportation order would not be [[stay of execution|stayed]] whilst the appeal was pending. Saadi's request for [[political asylum]] was also denied on the national security grounds. As such, Saadi lodged his appeal to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) on 14 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentili|2010|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submissions by the parties==

Saadi argued that his deportation to Tunisia created a "real risk" that he would be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment and that the deportation would thus contravene Article 3 of the Convention. He further argued that deportation would abrogate his right to a fair trial under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] (due to his conviction in absentia in Tunisia), and that it would deprive his wife and son of his support and thus contravene [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]]. Italy argued that it had received diplomatic assurances from Tunisia that Saadi would not be subject to torture and that its receipt of such assurances fulfilled its Article 3 obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentili|2010|p=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom as [[intervention (law)|intervenor]] urged the Court to modify the "real risk" standard established in ''Chahal v. United Kingdom'' to allow the risk of torture to be balanced against consideration of the individual's dangerousness. The United Kingdom had repeatedly criticised the "absolute ban" established in Chahal and was an intervenor in two other Article 3 cases simultaneously pending before the ECtHR, namely ''Ramzy v the Netherlands'' and ''A v the Netherlands''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentili|2010|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
In the unanimous decision, the Grand Chamber accepted Saadi's argument that Italy was in violation of Article 3. Addressing the United Kingdom's arguments submitted as intervenor, the Court ruled that the threat that Saadi posed to Italy did not reduce the risk of ill-treatment in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentili|2010|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court was faced with the question of assessing whether there existed a risk of Saadi facing torture or ill treatment were he to be deported to Tunisia. This was a different question than a [[standard of proof]] for an event that had already occurred, as it involved forecasting the likelihood of a future event.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Černič|2008|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court adopted the test of "whether substantial grounds have been shown for believing that there is a real risk of treatment incompatible with Article 3", which English courts have subsequently referred to as the "''Saadi'' test".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|2017}}, citing {{cite case|litigants=Lord Advocate v Zain Taj Dean|vol={{bracket|2017}}|reporter=UKSC|opinion=44|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0212-judgment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not reach Saadi's Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 8 (right to family life) arguments, ruling that since "there was no reason to doubt" that Italy would comply with the Court's order in relation to Article 3, there was no need to address the more complicated issue of whether an expulsion or potential expulsion could constitute a violation of the right to a fair trial. In its jurisprudence up to 2008 the Court had never addressed that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moeckli|2008|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ECtHR addressed the persuasiveness of diplomatic assurances again in ''Beh Khemais v Italy'' shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentili|2010|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saadi'' was soon after applied in the English courts in {{cite case|litigants=AS &amp; DD v Secretary of State for the Home Department|vol={{bracket|2008}}|reporter=EWCA Civ|opinion=289|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/289.html}} to bar the deportation to [[Libya]] of the two applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Londras|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saadi'' was hailed as a "landmark" case by human rights organisations including [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], and the [[International Commission of Jurists]] despite that the ruling seemed a foregone result given earlier case law. The case's significance lay in that it rejected repeated calls for a "balancing test" to be introduced in response to the new "international climate" of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moeckli|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some commentators compared and contrasted the case with the earlier ''[[Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] did not categorically reject deporting an individual to a state where he or she could face the risk of torture, but instead applied such a balancing test.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Černič|2008|p=489}} and {{harvnb|Moeckli|2008|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In light of the bar against deportation which ''Saadi'' reiterated, parties to the ECHR were left to look into other methods of protecting the public from dangerous individuals who could not be returned to their countries of origin. One scholar subsequently argued that civil detention following completion of criminal sentence could be justified under [[Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 15 of the ECHR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McMahon|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Hong Kong}}
{{History of Hong Kong}}
The '''Sino–British Joint Declaration''' is an international [[bilateral treaty]] signed between the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[United Kingdom]] on 19 December 1984 in Beijing.&lt;ref name ="HKSAR"&gt;Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the HKSAR. [http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm "The Joint Declaration"] and following pages, 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration stipulates the sovereign and administrative arrangement over Hong Kong after 1 July 1997, when the lease of the [[New Territories]] was set to expire according to the [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]].

The Declaration was signed by Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) on behalf of their respective governments. It entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985, and was registered by the PRC and UK governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985. In the Joint Declaration, the PRC Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Kowloon Peninsula|Kowloon]], and the [[New Territories]]) with effect from 1 July 1997, and the UK Government declared that it would hand over Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. The PRC Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong in the document.

In accordance with the "[[one country, two systems]]" principle agreed between the UK and the PRC, the socialist system of PRC would not be practised in the Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years until 2047. The Joint Declaration provides that these basic policies should be stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and that the socialist system and socialist policies shall not be practised in HKSAR. However, with the start of the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014, a campaign against the perceived infringements in the HKSAR by mainland China, the British Foreign Office announced that Chinese officials now treat the Joint Declaration as "void".

==Background==
[[File:Acquisition of Hong Kong.svg|thumb|left|200px|Great Britain acquired [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1842, [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860, and leased the [[New Territories]] in 1898 for 99 years.]]
The background of the Sino–British Joint Declaration was the pending expiration of the lease of the New Territories on 1 July 1997.&lt;ref name=hearings&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | isbn = 0160556651 | last = United States | title = Hong Kong's reversion to the People's Republic of China: hearing before the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, One Hundred Fifth Congress, first session, February 13, 1997 | location = Washington | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3VFXMorS0uUC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lease was negotiated between the UK and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] of China, and was for a period of 99 years starting from 1 July 1898 under the [[Second Convention of Peking]]. At the time of the lease signing, Hong Kong Island had already been ceded to the UK in perpetuity under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] in 1842 after the [[First Opium War]], and the southern part of the Kowloon Peninsula as well as the Stonecutters Island had also been ceded to the UK in perpetuity under the [[Convention of Beijing]] in 1860 after the [[Second Opium War]].

In the early 1980s the territory and its business community grew concerned about the future of Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 9780191533082 | pages = 168‒185 | editors = Andrew Simpson (ed.) | last = Simpson | first = Andrew | title = Language and National Identity in Asia | chapter = Hong Kong | location = Oxford; New York | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns, regarding the status of property rights and contracts, were spurred by political uncertainty surrounding the scheduled reversion of the New Territories to the PRC.&lt;ref name="tsang" /&gt; In March 1979, the [[Governor of Hong Kong]], [[Murray MacLehose]], visited Beijing.  During this visit, informal talks about the future of Hong Kong began. Upon his return, MacLehose attempted to allay investors' worries about the scheduled reversion, but reiterated that the PRC asserted its intention to regain sovereignty over Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="tsang" /&gt; The first formal negotiations began with chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] during the visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, to China in September 1982.&lt;ref name=tsang&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B. Tauris &amp; Co. | isbn = 9780857714817| last = Tsang | first = Steve | title = A Modern History of Hong Kong, 1841–1997 | location = London | accessdate = 2013-03-29 | year = 2005 | url = http://public.eblib.com/EBLPublic/PublicView.do?ptiID=677108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the following discussions, where the Governor of Hong Kong took part in every round of formal talks as a member of the British delegation, it became clear that the continuation of British administration after 1997 would not be acceptable to China in any form.&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Columbia University Press | isbn = 9780231106306 | last = Tucker | first = Nançy Bernkopf | title = China Confidential: American Diplomats and Sino-American Relations, 1945–1996 | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Government has consistently taken the view that the whole of Hong Kong should be Chinese territory, due to them being acquired through the [[unequal treaty|inequality of historical treaties]].&lt;ref name=mushkat&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Hong Kong University Press | isbn = 9622094279 | last = Mushkat | first = Roda | title = One country, two international legal personalities: the case of Hong Kong | location = Hong Kong | series = HKU Press law series | year = 1997| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RuXPvRHXUKkC | accessdate = 2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the two sides discussed possible measures besides continued British administration, and came up with the concept of Hong Kong as a Special Administration Region of the PRC. In April 1984, the two sides concluded the initial discussion of these matters, and arranged that Hong Kong would retain a high degree of autonomy under Chinese sovereignty with the preservation of the maintained lifestyle in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="tucker" /&gt; By 18 September 1984, both sides had approved the English and Chinese texts of the documents and the associated Exchange of [[Memoranda]].

The signing of the Joint Declaration caused some controversy in Britain because UK's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] was agreeing with the [[Communist Party of China|China's Communist government]] represented by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. However, political analysts believe she had no choice to agree because "the alternative to acceptance of the present agreement [was] to have no agreement",&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~pchksar/JD/jd-full1.htm|title=Sino–British Joint Declaration|publisher=[[Hong Kong Baptist University]]|page=29|accessdate=8 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208081141/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~pchksar/JD/jd-full1.htm|archivedate=8 December 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unacceptable situation considering Britain's weak negotiating position. As Hong Kong was not militarily defensible and relied on [[Guangdong]] province in [[mainland China]] to supply most of its food and water,&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; the economic feasibility of dividing Hong Kong (with Britain retaining control of [[Hong Kong Island]] and [[Kowloon]] while the New Territories returning to the PRC) was impracticable. Furthermore, there was an urgency to make an agreement because there were fears that without a treaty the [[Economy of Hong Kong|economy in Hong Kong]] would collapse in the 1980s. Concerns about land ownership in the leased New Territories also added to the problem. Although discussions on the future of Hong Kong had started in the late 1970s, the final timing of the Joint Declaration was more affected by property and economic factors rather than geopolitical necessities.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

==Treaty contents==

===Joint Declaration===
The Sino–British Joint Declaration consists of eight paragraphs, three Annexes about the Basic Policies regarding Hong Kong, the [[Sino–British Joint Liaison Group]] and the Land Leases as well as the two Memoranda of the two sides. Each part has the same status, and  ''"The whole makes up a formal international agreement, legally binding in all its parts. An international agreement of this kind is the highest form of commitment between two sovereign states."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~pchksar/JD/jd-full1.htm Sino–British Joint Declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208081141/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~pchksar/JD/jd-full1.htm |date=8 December 2003 }}, para. 19. Retrieved 8 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Within these declarations the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be directly under the authority of the Central People's Government of the PRC and shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy except for foreign and defence affairs. It shall be allowed to have executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The Basic Law explains that in addition to Chinese, English may also be used in organs of government and that apart from the national flag and national emblem of the PRC the HKSAR may use a regional flag and emblem of its own. It shall maintain the capitalist economic and trade systems previously practised in Hong Kong.  
The third paragraph lists the PRC's basic policies regarding Hong Kong:
* National unity and territorial integrity shall be upheld and a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The [HKSAR] will be directly under the authority of the Central People's Government of the [PRC  and] will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs." "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The [HKSAR] will be vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The Government of the [HKSAR] will be composed of local inhabitants. The chief executive will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally. Principal officials will be nominated by the chief executive of the [HKSAR] for appointment by the Central People's Government. Chinese and foreign nationals previously working in the public and police services in the government departments of Hong Kong may remain in employment. British and other foreign nationals may also be employed to serve as advisers or hold certain public posts in government departments of the [HKSAR]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style. Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law in the [HKSAR]. Private property, ownership of enterprises, legitimate right of inheritance and foreign investment will be protected by law."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The [HKSAR] will retain the status of a free port and a separate customs territory. It can continue the free trade policy, including free movement of goods and capital." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The [HKSAR] will retain the status of an international financial centre" with free flow of capital and the Hong Kong dollar remaining freely convertible. The HKSAR may authorise designated banks to issue or continue to issue Hong Kong currency under statutory authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.7&lt;/ref&gt;
* It will have independent finances with its own budgets and final accounts, but reporting it to the Central People's Government. Additionally, "the Central People's Government will not levy taxes on [it]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.8&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The HKSAR may establish mutually beneficial economic relations with the United Kingdom and other countries [...]" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm The Joint Declaration] Paragraph 3.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name used for international relations will be 'Hong Kong, China'. In doing so it may maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and agreements with states, regions and relevant international organisations on its own and it may issue travel documents for Hong Kong. International agreements to which the PRC is not a party but Hong Kong is may remain implemented in the HKSAR.
* The government of the HKSAR is responsible for the maintenance of public order. Military forces sent by the Central People's Government, stationed in HKSAR, for the purpose of defence shall not interfere in the internal affairs in the HKSAR.
* Those basic policies will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the PRC by the [[National People's Congress]] and will remain unchanged for 50 years.

The Government of the United Kingdom will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong with the object of maintaining and preserving its economic prosperity and social stability until 30 June 1997 and the Government of the PRC will give its co-operation in this connection.

Furthermore, this declaration regulates the right of abode, those of passports and immigration. All Chinese nationals who were born or who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of seven years or more are qualified to obtain permanent identity cards. Those cardholders can also get a passport of the HKSAR, which is valid for all states and regions. But the entry into the HKSAR of persons from other parts of China shall continue to be regulated in accordance with the present practice.

===The PRC's basic policies regarding Hong Kong (Annex I)===
This Annex is called the ''Elaboration by the government of the People's Republic of China of its basic policies regarding Hong Kong''. It is partly mentioned in the summary above and deals in detail with the way Hong Kong will work after 1 July 1997. The annexe consist of following sections:
(1) Constitutional arrangements and government structure; (II) the laws; (III) the judicial system; (IV) the public service; (V) the financial system; (VI) the economic system and external economic relations; (VII) the monetary system, (VIII) shipping, (IX) civil aviation; (X) education; (XI) foreign affairs; (XII) defence, security and public order; (XIII) basic rights and freedoms; (XIV) right of abode, travel and immigration.

===Sino–British Joint Liaison Group (Annex II)===
Annex II set up the Sino–British Joint Liaison Group. That Group came into force at 1 July 1988 and continued its work until 1 January 2000. Its functions were
:a) to conduct consultations on the implementation of the Joint Declaration
:b) to discuss matters relating to the smooth transfer of government in 1997
:c) to exchange information and conduct consultations on such subjects as may be agreed by the two sides.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the HKSAR. [http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/joint2.htm#3 "The Joint Declaration and its Implementation], 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Group was an organ for liaison and not of power, where each side could send up to 20 supporting staff members. It should meet at least once in each of the three locations (Beijing, London and Hong Kong) in each year. From 1 July 1988 onwards it was based in Hong Kong. It should also assist the HKSAR to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude agreements on these matters with states, regions and relevant international organisations and could therefore set up specialist sub-groups. Between 1985 and 2000 the Joint Liaison Group held 47 plenary meetings whereof 18 were held in Hong Kong, 15 in London and 14 in Beijing.

One of the main achievements had been to ensure the continuity of the independent judiciary in Hong Kong, including agreements in the areas of law of Merchant Shipping, Civil Aviation, Nuclear Material, Whale Fisheries, Submarine Telegraph, Outer Space and many others. Furthermore, it agreed to a network of bilateral agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Within those agreements were reached on the continued application of about 200 international conventions to the HKSAR after 30 June 1997. Hong Kong should also continue to participate in various international organisations after the handover.

===Land Leases (Annex III)===
According to the Land Leases all leased lands, granted by the British Hong Kong Government, which extend beyond 30 June 1997 and all rights in relation to such leases shall continue to be recognised and protected under the law of the HKSAR for a period expiring not longer than 30 June 2047. Furthermore, a Land Commission shall be established with equal number of officials from the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the PRC which was dissolved on 30 June 1997. This commission was established in 1985 and met in Hong Kong for 35 formal meetings and agreed on 26 legal documents, within the granting of the land required for the new airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]] in 1994.

===United Kingdom Memorandum===
In this memorandum the Government of the United Kingdom declared that all persons who hold [[British Dependent Territories citizen]]ship (BDTCs) through an affiliation with Hong Kong would cease to be BDTCs on 1 July 1997.  After the declaration, the Hong Kong Act, 1985 and the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986 created the category [[British National (Overseas)]]. BDTCs were allowed to apply for British National (Overseas) status until July 1997, but this status does not in of itself grant the [[right of abode]] anywhere, including the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.  After the handover, most former BDTCs became citizens of the People's Republic of China.  Any who were ineligible for PRC citizenship and who had not applied for BN(O) status automatically became [[British Overseas citizen]]s.

{{see also|British nationality law and Hong Kong|British nationality law}}

===Chinese Memorandum===
''"Under the National Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport' or not, are Chinese nationals."''  Those people who use travel documents issued by the Government of the United Kingdom are permitted to use them for the purpose of travelling to other states and regions, but they will not be entitled to British consular protection in the HKSAR and other parts of the PRC.

==Aftermath==
===Early years===
After signing of the declaration, the [[Sino–British Joint Liaison Group]] was set up according to the Annex II of the declaration.

The transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong (referred to as the "return" or "handover" by the Chinese and British press respectively) occurred as scheduled on 1 July 1997. Since the return just a few things changed, such as the flag of Hong Kong and the [[Prince of Wales Building]] being renamed into the People's Liberation Army Building. Post boxes were repainted green, as per the practice in China. Street names have remained unchanged and the [[Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club]] has kept its "Royal" prefix, although the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]] and other institutions have given up this title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1996/0610/061096.intl.intl.2.html A Battle Royal Rocks Imperial Yacht Club], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 June 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 the Hong Kong measures were taken with the full co-operation of the Chinese government. This did not mean that the Chinese government dictated what to do and therefore still follows the points of the declaration.&lt;ref name="Mc"&gt;McLaren, Robin. [http://www.hkjournal.org/PDF/2007_fall/5.pdf  "Hong Kong 1997–2007: a personal perspective"], retrieved at 17 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Despite the autonomy, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region sometimes sought the suggestions from the Chinese government. In 1999 the government of the HKSAR asked China's State Council to seek an interpretation of a provision in the Basic Law by the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]]. The Chinese government said that a decision by the [[Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal]] would allow 1.6 million mainland immigrants to enter Hong Kong. As a result, the Chinese authorities obliged and the Hong Kong judgment was overturned.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Ching, Frank. [http://www.hkjournal.org/archive/ching.html  "The System Works – More or Less"], 1 January 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414023353/http://www.hkjournal.org/archive/ching.html |date=14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressures from the mainland government were also apparent, for example in 2000, after the election of pro-independence candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]] as [[Taiwan]]'s president, a senior mainland official in Hong Kong warned journalists not to report the news. Another senior official advised businessmen not to do business with pro-independence Taiwanese.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;

With this and other changes,&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; ten years after the return, in 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that on the one hand, "nothing has changed since the handover to China 10 years ago", but this was in comparison to the situation before the last governor [[Chris Patten]] had introduced [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|democratic reforms]] three years before the handover. A chance for democracy had been lost as Hong Kong had just begun to develop three vital elements for a western-style democracy (the [[rule of law]], official accountability and a political class outside the one-party system) but the Sino–British deal had prevented any of these changes to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= 1 July 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/thepriceofthestatusquo |title=Hong Kong's business as usual|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wu Bangguo]], the chairman of the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] stated in a conference in Beijing 2007, that "Hong Kong had considerable autonomy only because the central government had chosen to authorize that autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bradsher, 7 June 2007, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E2D61E30F934A35755C0A9619C8B63&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=sino-british%20joint%20declaration&amp;st=cse "World Briefing.

===Waning influence===
In 2014, against the backdrop of [[Umbrella Revolution]], the British [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] was banned by China from entering Hong Kong on their planned visit in December as part of their inquiry into progress of the implementation of the Sino–British Joint Declaration. In an emergency parliamentary debate about the unprecedented ban, the chairman on the committee [[Richard Ottaway]] revealed that Chinese officials consider the Joint Declaration "now void and only covered the period from the signing in 1984 until the handover in 1997."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China says British complaints over Hong Kong visit ban 'useless'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1654603/china-says-british-complaints-over-hong-kong-visit-ban-useless|date=3 December 2014|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[Caroline Wilson (diplomat)|Caroline Wilson]], who was the British Consul-General to Hong Kong and Macao, said the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] was a violation of the Joint declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E5%90%B3%E8%8B%A5%E8%98%AD-%E6%B8%AF%E7%8D%A8%E4%B8%8D%E5%88%87%E5%AF%A6%E9%9A%9B-%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E8%A2%AB%E5%B8%B6%E8%BF%94%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%B8%E9%A6%96%E9%81%95%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E/|title=吳若蘭：港獨不切實際　李波被帶返大陸首違聯合聲明 - 立場報道 - 立場新聞|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern Television broadcast interruption''' was a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|broadcast interruption]] through the [[Hannington transmitting station|Hannington transmitter]] of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] in the [[United Kingdom]] at 5:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 November 1977. The broadcast message is generally considered to be a hoax, but the identity of the hijacker is unknown.

==Description==
A speaker interrupted transmissions for six minutes and claimed to be a representative of an "Intergalactic Association". Reports of the incident vary, some calling the speaker "Vrillon"&lt;ref name=Vrillon&gt;{{cite book

The voice, which was disguised and accompanied by a deep buzzing, broke into the broadcast of the local [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] station [[Southern Television]], overriding the [[UHF]] audio signal of the early-evening news being read by [[Andrew Gardner (newsreader)|Andrew Gardner]] from [[Independent Television News|ITN]] to warn viewers that "All your weapons of evil must be removed" and "You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace."

The interruption ceased shortly after the statement had been delivered, transmissions returning to normal shortly before the end of a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon. Later in the evening, Southern Television apologised for what it described as "a breakthrough in sound" for some viewers. ITN also reported on the incident in its own late-evening Saturday bulletin.

The broadcast took over the sound only, leaving the video signal unaltered, aside from some picture distortion.

==Explanation==
At that time, the Hannington [[Ultra High Frequency|UHF]] television transmitter was unusual in being one of the few transmitters which rebroadcast an off-air signal received from another transmitter (Southern Television's [[Rowridge transmitting station|Rowridge transmitter]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]), rather than being fed directly by a landline. As a consequence it was open to this kind of signal intrusion, as even a relatively low-powered transmission very close to the receiver could overwhelm its reception of the intended signal, resulting in the unauthorised transmission being amplified and rebroadcast across a far wider area. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] stated to carry out a hoax would take "a considerable amount of technical know-how"&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;"From outer space at short range", ''The Guardian'', 28 November 1977, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a spokesman for Southern Television confirmed "A hoaxer jammed our transmitter in the wilds of North Hampshire by taking another transmitter very close to it."&lt;ref name=Collegian&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They never discovered the identity of the intruder.

==Public and media response==
The incident caused some local alarm and attracted publicity in the next day's Sunday newspapers,&lt;ref name="Sunday Express"&gt;''Sunday Express'', 27 November 1977, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; with the IBA announcing the broadcast was a hoax.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;"Mystery Voice Loses Its Loophole", ''Los Angeles Times'', 30 November 1977, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt; The IBA confirmed it was the first time such a hoax transmission had been made.&lt;ref name="Times report"&gt;"Source of hoax space broadcast stays a mystery", ''The Times'', 28 November 1977, p. 2, col.

The broadcast became a footnote in [[ufology]] as some chose to accept the supposed "alien" broadcast at face value, questioning the explanation of a transmitter hijack. Within two days of the incident's report in ''[[The Times]]'', a letter to the editor published on 30 November 1977 asked, "[How] can the IBA – or anyone else – be sure that the broadcast was a hoax?"&lt;ref name="Times followup"&gt;"Fact or science fiction?", ''The Times'', 30 November 1977, Letters to the Editor, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of one American local newspaper—the ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]''—commented, "Nobody seemed to consider that 'Asteron' may have been for real."&lt;ref name=Eugene&gt;{{Citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the voice of Asteron. I am an authorised representative of the Intergalactic Mission, and I have a message for the planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the [[Age of Aquarius|period of Aquarius]] and there are many corrections which have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace... or leave the galaxy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Fortean Times'' article went on to criticise reports of the incident appearing in newspapers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inexplicably the News Of The World and D. Mail call the owner of the voice "Gillon, of the Ashdown Galactic Command" and that he said: "Unless the weapons of Earth are laid down, destruction from outer space invasion will quickly follow." I hope their regular news reportage is more accurate than that, for the indication is that they've simply invented a more shocking message.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speaking on British commercial radio on 6 December 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bob Holness interviews John Whitmore |url=http://radio.bufvc.ac.uk/lbc/index.php/segment/0018800437019|date=6 December 1977|work=Space message on Southern TV |publisher=LBC Archive|accessdate=21 September 2009|quote=I'd first like to refer to the recording itself of the complete message, one thing that struck me was that there was in fact nothing threatening whatsoever on the tape, and I was aware that most of the newspaper reports said it was threatening and frightening and so on, and so forth, and I just want to point out that that's sort-of a projection of the fears onto the material itself rather than the reality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John Whitmore also questioned newspaper reporting of the incident, referring to a recording of the complete broadcast which appeared to exist at the time.

A complete transcript of the message reads:&lt;ref&gt;2012 A Family Brief: ''The Science is all in'' By Robert L. Horton&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New Age of Aquarius. The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides at present operating on your world. They will suck your energy from you – the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return. Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn to be sensitive to the voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all we can to help you. Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth. We of the Ashtar Galactic Command thank you for your attention. We are now leaving the planes of your existence. May you be blessed by the supreme love and truth of the cosmos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage in popular culture==
Author [[Nelson Algren]] included a variation of the message in his 1983 book ''The Devil's Stocking'', a fictionalised account of the trial of [[Rubin Carter]], a real-life prize-fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. In the book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character 'Kenyatta' gives a speech closely mirroring the ''Fortean Times'' transcript of the Southern Television interruption:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission," Kenyatta finally disclosed his credentials. "I have a message for the Planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius. Many corrections have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace" – here he paused to gain everybody's attention – "you must live in peace or leave the galaxy!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Design standards''', '''reference standards''' and '''performance standards''' are familiar throughout business and industry, virtually for anything that is definable.  [[Sustainable design]], taken as reducing our impact on the earth and making things better at the same time, is in the process of becoming defined.   There are also lots of well organized specific methodologies that are used by different communities of people for different purposes.

== Design standards ==
One of the better known is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) green building rating system, which uses a diverse group of hard measures of environmental quality and impacts to define a holistic approach to sustainable building and assign ratings to individual projects.

Sustainable design is really just a more determined effort to consider the whole range of impacts on our environment in making any decision. A more complete design guide, guided more by whole project impact measures, is the model offered by the U.S. cooperating agencies in the [http://www.wbdg.org/ "Whole Building Design Guide"].

Green construction codes and standards are beginning to emerge on the national code stage. The standards go beyond energy standards such as [[ASHRAE 90.1]] and the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC) to cover additional areas such as site sustainability, [[water efficiency]], indoor [[environmental quality]] and materials and resources. The first is [[ASHRAE 189.1]], Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, published by ASHRAE in January 2010 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Illuminating Engineering Society]]. Standard 189.1 provides criteria by which a building can be judged as “green,” written in model code language that jurisdictions can use to develop a green building construction code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several organizations have developed their own ways of setting goals for energy reductions, such as [[Architecture 2030]] and for qualifying performance toward them such as [[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle to Cradle]].

Developing real methods for how to discover the design opportunities that would allow you to meet or exceed the standards was one of the objectives of the environmental design movement in architectural schools in the 1960s and '70s, but though some of the issues introduced then are still an important part of the process, not much actually changed about the methods of design.  Now with the combination of many more interactive tools and much higher stakes in the outcome, and long gestating rethinking about natural systems in general, a dramatic new revolution in methodology seems inevitable.

BIM (building information modeling) allows designers to work with many remote consultants on the same data file that represents all the decisions being made by the team.  That same file is available to the [[climate and energy]] and environmental impact analysis and cost analysis tools and consultants, ... and of course to the prospective contractors and the regulators.   Along with this new integrated access to the model there in needed a new way to integrate the conversation of so many people, each with some interest in reviewing each other's comments on the progress with the central design model.  That is likely to involve development of wiki tools for the process.  One such very early impliementation of a Wiki SD tool called [https://web.archive.org/web/20081007000010/http://www.connection.metadot.net/ "4Dsustainability"] organizes the project design evolution around the general learning process of '''how you define the problem''' by exploring its environment, and following that through the project.

The main difference between sustainable design methods and conventional design is incorporating the entire environment of the project's stakeholders on the design team, essentially, and that calls for new ways to explore connections and for more people and perspectives to be taken into account.  Other methods that recognize this requirement are the [http://www.aia.org/liv_sdat "AIA SDAT"] (sustainable design assessment team) program and the [http://www.scenariosforsustainability.org/index.php "Scenarios for sustainability"] process design tools.

'''The Humble Guys''' ('''THG''') were a [[software cracking|cracking]] group for the [[IBM PC]] during the late 1980s founded by two friends known by the [[pseudonym]]s Candyman and Fabulous Furlough. The group was also noticed in the [[demoscene]] for some of their [[cracktro]]s.

THG was the first group to make use of the [[.nfo|NFO]] file as a means for [[documentation|documenting]] their releases before packaging and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/online-software-piracy-of-the-last-millennium-1_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first release to contain an .NFO file was Nova Logic's remake of the [[arcade game|arcade classic]] [[Bubble Bobble]] in 1989. This has since spawned an entire generation of [[ASCII art]]ists devoted solely to creating [[art]]work for the purpose of decorating NFO files for [[warez]] groups. To put things into perspective, there are now entire websites explicitly devoted to the collection and archival of NFO files, such as [[The iSONEWS]].

==Software contributions==
[[Image:READTHG - The Humble Thug cracktro.png|right|thumb|320px|Screenshot from the THG [[cracktro]] &lt;tt&gt;READTHG.EXE&lt;/tt&gt; featuring ''The Humble Thug''.]]
THG also was one of the first groups to release an "intro tool" for the [[IBM]] [[Personal computer|PC]] [[demoscene]], released by their coding subsidiary, ''THG F/X'', called the THG IntroMaker. The THG IntroMaker would allow one to create a self-contained executable program which played music and displayed graphics on screen without the need for any knowledge of [[computer programming]]. A much more advanced and highly sophisticated extension of this today would be [[Farbrausch]]'s ''.werkkzeug''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tXBdOoZ-faYC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=werkkzeug&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to THG's arrival on the [[warez scene]] the IBM world did not have anything other than text based intros usually quoting song lyrics. THG members brought the experience from the C64 and AMIGA warez scene bringing the first animated and graphical intros to the IBM scene.

In December 1991 , the "F/X division" of The Humble Guys released a first and only copy of an [[diskmag|electronic magazine]] called "The Humble Review" featuring game reviews and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/the-humble-review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402004738/http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/the-humble-review |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=The Humble Review |publisher=Defacto2 |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is a non-controversial claim for which a self published source is acceptable --&gt;  Writer and weblogger [[Justin Hall]] would have his first article published in the Humble Review; a film review of [[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]] by "Fusty".

Members of THG also had their own custom [[bulletin board system|BBS]] software, originally a "forum hack", called L.S.D. BBS (Lush Software Designs) which was first introduced on June 1, 1990, written by The Slavelord and others. The original source code for this was Emulex/2, which was acquired by a THG member who's alias was Tripin Face. The source code was referred to as 'Jani' in some communities at the time. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.bbsdocumentary.com/IBM/DOS/LSDBBS/ |title=The BBS Software Directory |publisher=Software.bbsdocumentary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the news==
On the evening of October 27, 1992, [[NBC]] [[television]] aired an episode about [[computer]] [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] on [[Dateline NBC|Dateline]] titled "''Are Your Secrets Safe?''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totse.com/en/zines/cud_a/cud454.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212002627/http://www.totse.com/en/zines/cud_a/cud454.html |archivedate=2005-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This show prominently displayed [[advertising|ads]] for several warez BBSes, including one for The Slave Den BBS which was operated by a senior member and spokesperson of THG. As a result of this undesired exposure, The Slavelord voluntarily retired from his activities within the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textfiles.com/piracy/i_retire.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2006, David J. Francis, known by his username "Candyman" died in his hometown of St. Louis Missouri, of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/STLToday/DeathNotices.asp?Page=LifeStory&amp;PersonID=19145167 |title=David J.

On October 4th, 2015, Pierre Barkett, known by his username "The PieMaN" died in Florida of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesunion/obituary.aspx?n=PIERRE-BARKETT&amp;pid=176039492}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
&lt;!--[[Image:PITSACD2 ANS.png|right|width|240px|ANSI art advertisement for The Pits BBS.]]--&gt;

THG redefined the manner in which the PC Warez Scene worked when they entered the scene in 1989. Prior to THG, warez releases were haphazard, with multiple groups releasing the same title, usually after the title had been available in retail stores for weeks. Often games were released to BBSes without being cracked. THG changed this by releasing titles days before the software made it to retail chains such as [[GameStop|Babbage's]]. They did this by establishing relationships with the major wholesale software distributors, and ordering games with overnight shipping. For those cases where overnight shipping wasn't enough, THG found people who lived near the software companies, who could go to the company, and buy the game the day it was released. This beat the overnight shipping method by 2 days in most cases. Also, an advantage that they possessed was that most other warez groups were run by teens, who attended school during the day. THG was run by professional men, who were available each day "by 10:30" when FedEx, or UPS delivered. The other groups had to "wait until they got home" in the afternoons. A decided advantage considering most "cracks" were done in less than an hour, and releases complete shortly thereafter.

THG had members who worked for morning TV shows. Software companies, ever eager for free advertising, would send a box of new, or in some cases "about to be released" software to a TV show, for just a simple phone call. They also understood the "progression" of software. Once a title was completed, the box, manual, and final version of the game, were shipped to a "duplication house" to copy the software for sale in stores. THG had contacts in these duplication houses, where they could get the games weeks before they would show up at the store. Activision's F-14 Tomcat was one such title, along with all titles from Microprose.

At the height of their power, THG had game suppliers in the US, UK, France, Germany, and many parts of Asia.

THG introduced the concept of couriers in an effort to plaster their releases on their competitors' BBSes. The THG couriers were often told to make sure that the various groups received the latest crack on their HQ's BBS before other THG BBSes. The combination of using software wholesalers and couriers turned the PC Warez Scene upside down in 1990, but these are considered normal practice now. The fierce competition within the current warez and video scenes are directly descended from THG.

As a result of the fierce competition from THG, the majority of older, well established, warez groups disappeared from the scene.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Of the four or five groups that were around prior to THG's arrival in December, 1989, the only group that survived the onslaught from THG was the [[International Network of Crackers]] (INC).

One of THG's greatest competitors in the IBM PC cracking scene was the [[International Network of Crackers]] (INC). The file header of the [[executable]] THG cracktro, &lt;tt&gt;READTHG.EXE&lt;/tt&gt; (displayed above), contains text which reads: "''Cool Hand [[anal sex|but fuck]]s his dog and Phantom from INC''" ([[sic]]), an insulting reference towards the vice-president and courier coordinator of their rival organization, INC.

After Candyman shut down his BBS (Candyland - originally run on CNET BBS and ''first setup and up by The Bandit (this is untrue)'', setup, development and maintenance was continued by The Maker including unique customization, who was on hand from day one, for Candyman.) After Candyman left the United States, Fabulous Furlough took over the reins of the group. After political infighting among the remaining members of the group led to problems within the organization, several of the newer members of THG splintered off and formed a new group called USA ([[United Software Association]]) which included several noteworthy members such as Genesis and The Humble Babe (who changed her name to The NotSoHumble Babe upon her departure from THG). USA released a few games, most of them coming from one of THG's suppliers in Illinois, whom USA had managed to "turn". After the bust of The Not So Humble Babe on credit card fraud charges in Michigan, USA teamed up the European PC warez division of [[Fairlight (group)|Fairlight]] and were cooperatively known as "USA/FLT". This inevitably lead to the two groups USA and THG warring with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defacto2.net/file/detail/a73d55 ]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the USA/FLT fiasco, several of the original members of The Humble Guys left the group in an effort to once again capture lightning in a bottle. However, by the fall of 1992 several other groups, such as [[Razor 1911]] had joined the scene and this new group, while having some brief success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textfiles.com/piracy/NFO/term2029.nfo |title=Terminator 2029 - Yes, that's right! Term 2029! |publisher=Originally Funny Guys |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}{{Self-published source|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was never as successful as THG. The new group fell apart shortly after The Slavelord shut down his BBS after the Dateline story.

During 1992 though early 1994, many THG releases were supplied by the UK branch which compromised mostly of Hi.T.Moonweed, Bryn Rogers and Hydro who struggled to keep the group together due to US burnout. The UK BBS's, The Flying Teapot and The Demons Forge (ran by Hi.T and Bryn respectively) became the UK's major landmarks.

By 1994, most of the founding members of The Humble Guys were no longer involved with the warez scene, and the group was just a shadow of its former self. After the Pits BBS in New York was shut down by [[Novell]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/11/pr95259.html |title=Novell Software Piracy Investigation Leads to Court- Ordered Shut Down of Pits Bulletin Board System |publisher=Novell.com |date=1995-11-06 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group moved to IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and had a presence on many different servers with the name #THG. They focused on distribution rather than cracking. The Humble Guys disbanded in the early 2000s when the last founding member left.

'''''Town of Greece v. Galloway''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the court decided that the [[Town of Greece]], New York may permit volunteer chaplains to open each legislative session with a prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Town of Greece v.

==Question before the court==
Does the town of Greece, New York, impose an impermissible establishment of religion by opening its monthly board meetings with a prayer?

==Decision of the court==

===Majority opinion===

By a 5-4 vote, the Court ruled that the town's practice did not violate the Establishment Clause. The majority opinion authored by Justice Kennedy stated: "The town of Greece does not violate the First Amendment by opening its meetings with prayer that comports with our tradition and does not coerce participation by nonadherents."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-696_4f57.pdf Opinion of the Court, page 24.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The court concluded that the town's practice of opening its town board meetings with a prayer offered by members of the clergy does not violate the Establishment Clause when the practice is consistent with the tradition long followed by Congress and state legislatures, the town does not discriminate against minority faiths in determining who may offer a prayer, and the prayer does not [[Coercion test|coerce]] participation with non-adherents.&lt;ref name="Howe20140505"&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Amy|title=Tradition!

The majority held that sectarian prayers at government meetings are permissible under the Constitution.&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20140505" /&gt; “To hold that invocations must be non-sectarian would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts deciding these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,” Kennedy wrote for himself and the conservative members on the court.&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt; Lawmakers and judges would otherwise have to police prayer, he wrote, involving “government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.”&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt; This means that prayers are allowed to invoke particular religious affiliations without running afoul of the First Amendment prohibition against endorsement of religion at federal, state or local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufmann|first=Scott|title=Florida town’s choice: Violate Supreme Court ruling or open meeting with Satanic prayer|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/05/09/florida-towns-choice-violate-supreme-court-ruling-or-open-meeting-with-satanic-prayer/|accessdate=May 11, 2014|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy stated that U.S. Constitution doesn't require the town of Greece to search outside the town for chaplains from other faiths as long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination. He however included a restraint on legislature prayers by stating that "[t]he purpose of legislative prayer is to lend gravity” to sessions where “the divisive business of governing” will take place.&lt;ref name="Walsh20140405" /&gt; Noting that legislature prayer (in this context) should be “solemn and respectful in tone”,&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt; Kennedy went on to state that when legislative prayers are used as an opportunity to condemn or try to convert people who are not members of a particular religion, then these prayers would not conform with the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt; He added in general: "Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-696_4f57.pdf Syllabus opinion, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Kennedy wrote: “Legislative bodies do not engage in impermissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer they would rather not hear and in which they need not participate.”&lt;ref name="NYT20140505" /&gt; According to the majority legislative prayers might be impermissible if they “denigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion,” or if the prayer giver is chosen in a religiously discriminatory way.&lt;ref name="WPVolokh20140505"&gt;{{cite news|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|title=The Supreme Court’s city council prayer decision|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/05/the-supreme-courts-city-council-prayer-decision/|accessdate=May 8, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurring opinions===
Justice Thomas wrote in his separate opinion (which was joined in part by Justice Scalia) that the case should be dismissed because the Establishment Clause doesn't apply to the states and its subdivisions, but only to Congress. He also stated that the Constitution would have only been violated if “actual legal coercion” like imposing taxes to pay for the church is used.&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20140505Adler" /&gt; Justice Alito wrote a separate concurring opinion (which was joined in part by Justice Scalia) in which he dealt with points raised by Justice Kagan in her dissent.&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20140505Adler" /&gt; In Alito's view “the logical thrust of many of [Justice Kagan's] arguments is that prayer is never permissible prior to meetings of [[Local government in the United States|local government]] legislative bodies.”&lt;ref name="WP20140505Adler"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Jonathan H.|title=Breaking — Supreme Court upholds legislative prayer in Town of Greece v. Galloway|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/05/breaking-supreme-court-upholds-legislative-prayer-in-town-of-greece-v-galloway/?tid=up_next|accessdate=May 8, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting opinions===

Justice Breyer filed a dissent that focused on the case facts&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt; and argued that the town must do more to make its legislative prayer inclusive of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Town of Greece v. Galloway|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2013/2013_12_696|work=The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|publisher=The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main dissent was authored by Justice Kagan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Noah|title=Justice Kennedy has us all in his prayers|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/justice-kennedy-has-us-all-in-his-prayers/article_f95abade-d327-5f07-b390-999cf4d97d5d.html|accessdate=May 19, 2014|newspaper=The St.Louis Post-Dispatch|date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Sotomayor.&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt; Kagan noted three key differences between the case before the court and ''[[Marsh v. Chambers|Marsh]]'' (1983):&lt;ref name="Howe20140505" /&gt; 
# The Greece Town Council is not only a legislature, but also a place where the local government interacts with the local residents.
# The prayers in Greece were not directed to lawmakers, but instead also to the local residents seeking to do business with the government.
# The prayers in Greece were sectarian in nature. 
Noting these differences, Kagan wrote: "So month in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public, commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute government benefits. In my view, that practice does not square with the First Amendment’s promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government."&lt;ref name="WP20140505Adler" /&gt; According to Kagan the providing equal treatment would have been easy: town council members could tell the chaplains that the prayers should be non-denominational, or they could have invited clergy from all different faiths to give the prayers, rather than focusing almost exclusively on Christian ministers.&lt;ref name="WPVolokh20140505" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20140505Adler" /&gt; However, the town didn’t employ either of those measures.&lt;ref name="WP20140505Adler" /&gt;

==Reaction to ruling==
The reactions to the court's ruling were diverse. Christian conservatives and others who feel that religious expression has been overly curtailed in public settings were happy with the ruling. Eric Rassbach, deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, called the court's decision "a great victory for religious liberty."&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt; Along with their supporters, the Jewish and atheist women who filed suit against the town of Greece were disappointed by the court's ruling.&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt; A number of Jewish organizations, including the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]], had filed [[amici curiae]] briefs in support of the respondents, and expressed disappointment with the majority's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish groups pan US Supreme Court prayer ruling  Read more: Jewish groups pan US Supreme Court prayer ruling|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-groups-pan-us-supreme-court-prayer-ruling/|accessdate=9 May 2014|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular groups were also disappointed. Daniel Mach, director of the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, for example stated: “We are disappointed by today’s decision. Official religious favoritism should be off-limits under the Constitution. Town-sponsored sectarian prayer violates the basic rule requiring the government to stay neutral on matters of faith.”&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt; Ira Lupu, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University who specializes in the First Amendment, called the court's ruling "a very bad decision" because it undermined the Establishment Clause. Lupu explained that the court decision "does not insist on any [...] reasonable effort to make prayer nonsectarian or to push for diversity. The majority faith in a particular community can dictate the prayers and minority faiths could be left out if they don’t step up and say, ‘Hey, what about us?'"&lt;ref name="WP20140505" /&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pointed out that the decision divided the justices along religious lines, as well as ideological ones. All five justices in the majority were Catholics, and three out of the four dissenters were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-supreme-court-religion-catholics-jews-20140505-story.html |title=Prayer case divides Supreme Court justices along religious lines |author=David G. Savage |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional prescription for legislative prayers==
According to [[Lyle Denniston]] the constitutional prescription for legislative prayers is based on eight factors. These factors are:&lt;ref name="Denniston20140505" /&gt;

# Legislative prayers are not confined to meetings of Congress or state legislatures, but may also be recited in the more intimate and familiar setting of local government meetings.
# The prayer portion of the meeting must be conducted only during a ceremonial part of the government body’s session, not mixed in with action on official policy.
# The body may invite anyone in the community to give a prayer and (if it has the money) could have a paid chaplain. The officials on the body may also join in the prayer by bowing their heads or showing other signs of religious devotion, such as crossing themselves.
# The body may not dictate what is in the prayers and what may not be in the prayers. A prayer may invoke the deity or deities of a given faith, and need not embrace the beliefs of multiple or all faiths.
# In allowing “sectarian” prayers, the body’s members may not “proselytize” i.e. promoting one faith as the true faith, and may not require persons of different faith preferences, or of no faith, to take part, and may not criticize them if they do not take part.
# The “sectarian” prayers may not disparage or discriminate against a specific faith, but officials need not go to extra lengths to make sure that all faiths do get represented in the prayer sessions — even if that means one faith winds up as the dominant message.
# Such prayers are permissible when most, if not all, of the audience is made up of adults.
# A court, in hearing a challenge to a prayer practice, is confined to examining “a pattern of prayers,” and does not have the authority to second-guess the content of individual prayer utterances. In judging such a pattern, the proper test is not whether it tends to put forth predominantly the beliefs of one faith, but whether it has the effect of coercing individuals who do not share that faith.

The Z-Wave protocol was developed by Zensys, a Danish company based in [[Copenhagen]], in 2001.&lt;ref name="awestervelt"&gt;Amy Westervelt, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/amywestervelt/2012/03/21/could-smart-homes-keep-people-healthy/#73991a0b579a "Could Smart Homes Keep People Healthy?"] ''Forbes'', March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dehrlich"&gt;David Ehrlich, [https://gigaom.com/2008/12/18/sigma-designs-buying-smart-network-chipmaker-zensys/ "Sigma Designs Buying Smart Network Chipmaker Zensys,"] [[GigaOm]], December 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Zensys introduced a consumer light-control system, which evolved into Z-Wave as a proprietary [[system on a chip]] (SoC) home automation protocol on an unlicensed frequency band in the 900 MHz range.&lt;ref name="ohersent"&gt;Olivier Hersent, David Boswarthick and Omar Elloumi, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yGRW-6tlHRAC&amp;pg=PT186&amp;lpg=PT186&amp;dq=Zensys+Z-Wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3S7AYCXASk&amp;sig=rqmHJ8cxMl7byl5UOfN3cCG0xQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv4dWYgITUAhVi5YMKHXLxAzQ4FBDoAQg2MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zensys%20Z-Wave&amp;f=false The Internet of Things: Key Applications and Protocols]'', West Sussex: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], chapter 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its 100 series chip set was released in 2003, and its 200 series was released in May 2005,&lt;ref name="okaven"/&gt; with the ZW0201 chip offering a high performance at a low cost.&lt;ref name="pmannion"&gt;Patrick Mannion, [http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1161000 "Intel funds Z-Wave developer Zensys,"] ''[[EE Times]]'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Its 500 series chip, also known as Z-Wave Plus, was released in March 2013, with four times the memory, improved wireless range, and improved battery life.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brown, [http://www.techhive.com/article/2031180/sigma-designs-announces-next-gen-z-wave-home-control-product-family.html "Sigma Designs announces next-gen Z-Wave home-control product family,"] TechHive, March 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The technology began to catch on in North America around 2005, when five companies, including [[Danfoss]], [[Ingersoll-Rand]] and [[Leviton|Leviton Manufacturing]], adopted Z-Wave.&lt;ref name="dehrlich"/&gt; They formed the Z-Wave Alliance, whose objective is to promote the use of Z-Wave technology, with all products by companies in the alliance interoperable.&lt;ref name="awestervelt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dehrlich"/&gt; In 2005, [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] led a $16 million third seed round for Zensys.&lt;ref name="dehrlich"/&gt; In May 2006, [[Intel Capital]] announced that it was investing in Zensys, a few days after Intel joined the Z-Wave Alliance.&lt;ref name="pmannion"/&gt; In 2008, Zensys received investments from [[Panasonic]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Palamon Capital Partners]] and Sunstone Capital.&lt;ref name="dehrlich"/&gt;

Z-Wave was acquired by [[Sigma Designs]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="dehrlich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hometech.fm/shows/151|title=Episode 151 - Discussing Z-Wave with Executive Director Mitch Klein|work=HomeTech.fm|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisition, Z-Wave's US headquarters in [[Fremont, California]] were merged with Sigma's headquarters in [[Milpitas, California]].&lt;ref name="dehrlich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J.

In 2005, six products on the market used Z-Wave technology. By 2012, as smart home technology was becoming increasingly popular, there were approximately 600 products using Z-Wave technology available in the US.&lt;ref name="awestervelt"/&gt; By May 2017, over 1,700 products have been certified by the Z-Wave Alliance.&lt;ref name="rpink"/&gt; As of April 18, 2018, there were over 2,400 interoperable Z-Wave products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.silabs.com/2018-04-18-Silicon-Labs-Completes-Acquisition-of-Sigma-Designs-Z-Wave-Business|title=Silicon Labs Completes Acquisition of Sigma Designs' Z-Wave Business|work=Silicon Labs|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interoperability==
Z-Wave's interoperability layer ensures that devices can share information and allows all Z-Wave hardware and software to work together. Its wireless mesh networking technology enables any node to talk to adjacent nodes directly or indirectly, controlling any additional nodes. Nodes that are within range communicate directly with one another. If they aren’t within range, they can link with another node that is within range of both to access and exchange information.&lt;ref name="lfrenzel"/&gt; In September 2016, certain parts of the Z-Wave technology were made publicly available, when Sigma Designs released a public version of Z-Wave's interoperability layer, with the software added to Z-Wave's open-source library. The open-source availability allows software developers to integrate Z-Wave into devices with fewer restrictions. Z-Wave's S2 security, Z/IP for transporting Z-Wave signals over IP networks, and Z-Ware middleware are all open source as of 2016.&lt;ref name="jmorra"&gt;James Morra, [http://www.electronicdesign.com/iot/z-wave-specifications-go-open-source "Z-Wave Specifications Go Open-Source,"] ''Electronic Design'', September 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and the Z-Wave Alliance==
The Z-Wave Alliance was established in 2005 as a consortium of companies that make connected appliances controlled through apps on smartphones, tablets or computers using Z-Wave wireless mesh networking technology. The alliance is a formal association focussed on both the expansion of Z-Wave and the continued interoperability of any device that utilises Z-Wave.&lt;ref name=digitaltrends031216/&gt;&lt;ref name="awestervelt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian X. Chen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/technology/smartphones-can-now-run-consumers-lives.html "Smartphones Become Life's Remote Control,"] ''New York Times'', January 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2013, Sigma Designs and the Z-Wave Alliance announced a new protocol and interoperability certification program called Z-Wave Plus, based upon new features and higher interoperability standards bundled together and required for the 500 series [[system on a chip]] (SoC), and including some features that had been available since 2012 for the 300/400 series SoCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://z-wavealliance.org/sigma-designs-z-wave-alliance-introduce-new-z-wave-plus-certification-program/|title=Sigma Designs and Z-Wave Alliance Introduce New Z-Wave Plus™ Certification Program - Z-Wave Alliance|date=22 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the first product was certified by Z-Wave Plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://products.z-wavealliance.org/products/953|title=Leak Gopher Z-Wave Valve Controller|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance aims to create for the smart home a secure mesh network that works across different platforms.&lt;ref name="lhamilton"&gt;Laura Hamilton, [https://www.cedmagazine.com/news/2016/12/z-wave-alliance-announces-board-member-and-new-security-mandate "Z-Wave Alliance Announces Board Member and New Security Mandate,"] ''CED Magazine'', December 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Z-Wave is designed to achieve reliable communication and operation between devices and sensor-enabled objects from various manufacturers in the Z-Wave Alliance, which consists of over 450 members.&lt;ref name="rpink"/&gt; Members of the alliance include Intermatic, [[Leviton]], Techniku, [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier]], [[ADT Corporation]], FAKRO, [[Ingersoll Rand]], Jasco, [[LG Uplus]], Nortek Security &amp; Control, [[Sigma Designs]], [[SmartThings]], [[Honeywell]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Belkin]], Zipato, August Home and [[Black &amp; Decker]].&lt;ref name="okaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name=digitaltrends031216/&gt;&lt;ref name="jmorra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave_alliance_member_companies/|title=Member Companies of the Z-Wave Alliance - Z-Wave Alliance|website=Z-Wave Alliance|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Abent, [https://www.slashgear.com/august-home-joins-z-wave-alliance-for-smart-lock-pro-04480791/ "August Home joins Z-Wave Alliance for Smart Lock Pro,"] Slash Gear, April 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical characteristics==
=== Radio frequencies ===
Z-Wave is designed to provide reliable, low-latency transmission of small data packets at data rates up to 100kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=About Z-Wave Technology
|date=March 2013
|accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The throughput is 40kbit/s (9.6kbit/s using old chips) and suitable for control and sensor applications,&lt;ref name="eetimes1"/&gt; unlike [[Wi-Fi]] and other [[IEEE 802.11]]-based [[wireless LAN]] systems that are designed primarily for high data rates. Communication distance between two nodes is about 30 meters (40 meters with 500 series chip), and with message ability to hop up to four times between nodes, it gives enough coverage for most residential houses. [[Modulation]] is by [[Manchester code|Manchester channel encoding]].&lt;ref name="eetimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embedded.com/design/connectivity/4025721/Catching-the-Z-Wave|title=Catching the Z-Wave &amp;#124; Embedded|date=2006-10-02|publisher=embedded.com|author=Mikhail T. Galeev|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Z-Wave uses the Part 15 unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical ([[ISM band|ISM]]) band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sigmadesigns.com/zwave_frequency_coverage.php|title=Z-Wave : Home control|last=Online|first=Sigma Designs|website=www.sigmadesigns.com|access-date=2016-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717060540/http://www.sigmadesigns.com/zwave_frequency_coverage.php|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates at 868.42&amp;nbsp;MHz in Europe, at 908.42&amp;nbsp;MHz in the North America and uses other frequencies in other countries depending on their regulations.&lt;ref name="lfrenzel"/&gt; This band competes with some [[cordless telephone]]s and other consumer electronics devices, but avoids interference with [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] and other systems that operate on the crowded {{nowrap|[[ISM band|2.4 GHz]]}} band.&lt;ref name=digitaltrends031216&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/smarten-dumb-house-z-wave-automation/|title=Smarten up your dumb house with Z-Wave automation|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower layers, MAC and PHY, are described by [[ITU-T]] G.9959 and fully backwards compatible. In 2012, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) included the Z-Wave PHY and MAC layers as an option in its G.9959 standard for wireless devices under 1 GHz. Data rates include 9600 bps and 40 kbps, with output power at 1 mW or 0 dBm.&lt;ref name="lfrenzel"/&gt; The Z-Wave transceiver chips are supplied by Sigma Designs and [[Mitsumi]].

===Network setup, topology and routing===
Z-Wave uses a [[source routing|source-routed]] [[Mesh networking|mesh network]] architecture. Mesh networks are also known as '''[[wireless ad hoc network]]s'''. In such networks, devices use the wireless channel to send control messages which are then relayed by neighboring devices in a wave-like fashion. The source device wanting to transmit is therefore known as the initiator. Hence, the name source-initiated mesh ad hoc routing. There were several source-initiated mesh routing protocols proposed in the period early 1990s. The earlier ones were [[Associativity-Based Routing]] (ABR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Chai-Keong |last=Toh |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008812928561|title=Associativity-Based Routing for Ad Hoc Mobile Networks |journal=Wireless Personal Communications |date=March 1997 |volume=4 |issue=2 |p=103–139 |access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Dynamic Source Routing]] (DSR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4728 |title=RFC 4728: The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for IPv4 | date=February 2007 |publisher=[[IETF]] | author=Johnson, D. |author2=Y. Hu |author3=D. Maltz |access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Devices can communicate to one another by using intermediate nodes to actively route around and circumvent household obstacles or radio dead spots that might occur in the [[multipath propagation|multipath]] environment of a house.&lt;ref name="eetimes1"/&gt; A message from node A to node C can be successfully delivered even if the two nodes are not within range, providing that a third node B can communicate with nodes A and C. If the preferred route is unavailable, the message originator will attempt other routes until a path is found to the C node. Therefore, a Z-Wave network can span much farther than the radio range of a single unit; however, with several of these hops a slight delay may be introduced between the control command and the desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loughlin|first=Thomas|title=Z-Wave Christmas Lights|url=http://thomasloughlin.com/z-wave-christmas-lights/|publisher=Thomas Loughlin|accessdate=3 December 2012|quote=Any further and I would see a slow down in the control of any device on the network.  We did get it to work at about 130 feet but it took about 3 minutes for the device to get the on/off message.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest network is a single controllable device and a primary controller. Additional devices can be added at any time, as can secondary controllers, including traditional hand-held controllers, key-fob controllers, wall-switch controllers and PC applications designed for management and control of a Z-Wave network. A Z-Wave network can consist of up to 232 devices, with the option of [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] networks if more devices are required.&lt;ref name="lfrenzel"/&gt;

A device must be "included" to the Z-Wave network before it can be controlled via Z-Wave. This process (also known as "pairing" and "adding") is usually achieved by pressing a sequence of buttons on the controller and on the device being added to the network. This sequence only needs to be performed once, after which the device is always recognized by the controller. Devices can be removed from the Z-Wave network by a similar process. The controller learns the signal strength between the devices during the inclusion process, thus the architecture expects the devices to be in their intended final location before they are added to the system. Typically, the controller has a small internal [[battery backup]], allowing it to be unplugged temporarily and taken to the location of a new device for pairing.  The controller is then returned to its normal location and reconnected.

Each Z-Wave network is identified by a Network ID, and each device is further identified by a Node ID. The Network ID (also called Home ID) is the common identification of all nodes belonging to one logical Z-Wave network. The Network ID has a length of 4 bytes (32 bits) and is assigned to each device, by the primary controller, when the device is "included" into the Network. Nodes with different Network IDs cannot communicate with each other. The Node ID is the address of a single node in the network. The Node ID has a length of 1 byte (8 bits) and must be unique in its network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vesternet.com/understanding-z-wave-networks |title=Understanding Z-Wave Networks, Nodes &amp; Devices |publisher=Vesternet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213015518/http://www.vesternet.com/understanding-z-wave-networks |archivedate=2012-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Z-Wave chip is optimized for battery-powered devices, and most of the time remains in a power saving mode to consume less energy, waking up only to perform its function.&lt;ref name="ohersent"/&gt; With Z-Wave mesh networks, each device in the house bounces wireless signals around the house, which results in low power consumption, allowing devices work for years without needing to replace batteries.&lt;ref name="jmorra"/&gt; For Z-Wave units to be able to route unsolicited messages, they cannot be in sleep mode. Therefore, battery-operated devices are not designed as repeater units. Mobile devices, such as remote controls, are also excluded since Z-Wave assumes that all repeater capable devices in the network remain in their original detected position.

===Security===
Z-Wave is based on a proprietary design, with Sigma Designs as its primary chip vendor.&lt;ref name="lfrenzel"/&gt; In 2014, Mitsumi became a licensed second source for Z-Wave 500 series chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmadesigns.com/news/z-wave-becomes-multi-sourced-standard-as-home-control-market-heats-up-globally/ "Z-Wave Becomes Multi-Sourced Standard as Home Control Market Heats Up Globally,"] sigmadesigns.com, January 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been a number of academic and practical security researches on home automation systems based on [[Zigbee]] and [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] protocols, research is still in its infancy to analyze the Z-Wave protocol stack layers, requiring the design of a radio packet capture device and related software to intercept Z-Wave communications.&lt;ref name="sensep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scapy-radio"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Picod-Bringing-Software-Defined-Radio-To-The-Penetration-Testing-Community-WP.pdf |title= Bringing Software Defined Radio to the Penetration Testing Community |publisher= BlackHat USA |date= 2014 |first1= Jean-Michel |last1= Picod |first2= Arnaud |last2= Lebrun |first3= Jonathan-Christofer |last3= Demay }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early vulnerability was uncovered in AES-encrypted Z-Wave door locks that could be remotely exploited to unlock doors without the knowledge of the encryption keys, and due to the changed keys, subsequent network messages, as in "door is open", would be ignored by the established controller of the network. The vulnerability was not due to a flaw in the Z-Wave protocol specification but was an implementation error by the door-lock manufacturer.&lt;ref name="sensep"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20Z-Wave_WP.pdf |title= Security Evaluation of the Z-Wave Wireless Protocol |publisher= Sense Post |date= 2013 |first1= Behrang |last1= Fouladi |first2=Sahand |last2=Ghanoun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2016, the Z-Wave Alliance announced stronger security standards for devices receiving Z-Wave Certification as of April 2, 2017. Known as Security 2 (or S2), it provides advanced security for smart home devices, gateways and hubs.&lt;ref name="lhamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Wong, [http://www.electronicdesign.com/communications/qa-s2-s-impact-z-wave-and-iot-security "Q&amp;A: S2's Impact on Z-Wave and IoT Security,"] ''Electronic Design'', January 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It shores up encryption standards for transmissions between nodes, and mandates new pairing procedures for each device, with unique PIN or [[QR codes]] on each device. The new layer of authentication is intended to prevent hackers from taking control of unsecured or poorly-secured devices.&lt;ref&gt;Ry Crist, [https://www.cnet.com/news/z-wave-smart-home-gadgets-announce-new-iot-security-standards/ "Z-Wave smart-home gadgets announce new IoT security standards,"] [[CNET]], November 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ry Crist, [https://www.cnet.com/news/your-z-wave-smart-home-gadgets-just-got-more-secure/ "Your Z-Wave smart home gadgets just got more secure,"] CNET, April 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Z-Wave Alliance, the new security standard is the most advanced security available on the market for smart home devices and controllers, gateways and hubs.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Briodagh, [http://www.iotevolutionworld.com/smart-home/articles/430956-mandatory-security-implementation-z-wave-iot-devices-takes.htm "Mandatory Security Implementation for Z-Wave IoT Devices Takes Effect,"] IoT Evolution, April 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardware ===
The chip for Z-Wave nodes is the ZW0500, built around an [[Intel MCS-51]] [[microcontroller]] with an internal system clock of 32&amp;nbsp;MHz. The RF part of the chip contains an [[GFSK|GisFSK]] transceiver for a software selectable frequency. With a power supply of 2.2-3.6 volts, it consumes 23mA in transmit mode.&lt;ref name="eetimes1"/&gt; Its features include AES-128 encryption, a 100kbps wireless channel, concurrent listening on multiple channels, and USB VCP support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aeotec.com/z-wave-500-series-module-chip "Z-Wave 500 series,"] Aeotc.com. Accessed July 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to other protocols===
For smart-home wireless networking, there are numerous technologies competing to become the standard of choice. [[Wi-Fi]] consumes a lot of power, and [[Bluetooth]] is limited in signal range and number of devices. Other network standards competing with Z-Wave include [[Insteon]], [[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]] and [[ZigBee]]. Of the three, Z-Wave has the longest open-air operating range at 300 feet (outdoor) and 80+ feet (indoor). Insteon has the largest number of maximum devices capability at 17.7 million (to ZigBee's 65,000 and Z-Wave's 232). Thread has the fastest data transmission rate at 250 kbps. Z-Wave has better interoperability than ZigBee, but ZigBee has a faster data transmission rate. Thread operates on the busy Wi-Fi standard frequency of 2.4 GHz, while Z-Wave operates at 908 MHz in the US, which has reduced noise and a greater coverage area. ZigBee operates on both 915 MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies. All three are mesh networks.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Parrish, [http://www.tomsguide.com/us/smart-home-wireless-network-primer,news-21085.html "ZigBee, Z-Wave, Thread and WeMo: What's the Difference?"] Tom's Guide, July 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blewis"&gt;Brandon Lewis, [http://embedded-computing.com/articles/z-wave-opens-up-as-smart-home-connectivity-battle-closes-in/ "Z-Wave opens up as smart home connectivity battle closes in,"] Embedded Computing Design, September 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Z-Wave MAC/PHY is globally standardized by the International Telecommunications Union as ITU 9959 radio, and the Z-Wave Interoperability, Security (S2), Middleware and Z-Wave over IP specifications were all released into the public domain in 2016, making Z-Wave highly accessible to Internet of Things developers.&lt;ref name="blewis"/&gt;
