      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1314">'''Andrew Bell''' (5 September 1803 – 27 September 1856) was a Presbyterian minister who was born in London, England, moved to Scotland and emigrated to [[Upper Canada]] with his family in 1817.

Bell and his family settled at [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]] where his father was a minister. He studied under his father until 1823 and then pursued divinity courses in Scotland. He returned to Upper Canada in 1826, his formal studies not completed.

Bell had a successful career within the Presbyterian Church. However, some of his most important contributions to Canada came through his hobby, geology. He served on an advisory committee of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] where he helped shape the work of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] and, more particularly, the work of [[William Edmond Logan]], who had helped establish that body. His son, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]], became the director of the survey at a later date.

The '''aphotic zone''' (aphotic from [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} + {{lang|grc|φῶς}} "without light") is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. Consequently, [[bioluminescence]] is essentially the only light found in this zone. Most food in this zone comes from [[Marine snow|dead organisms sinking]] to the bottom of the lake or ocean from overlying waters.

The depth of the aphotic zone can be greatly affected by such things as [[turbidity]] and the season of the year. The aphotic zone underlies the [[photic zone]], which is that portion of a lake or ocean directly affected by sunlight.

==The ocean==
Depending on how aphotic zone is defined, the aphotic zone of the ocean begins between depths of roughly {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and extends to the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Earle, Sylvia A. |author2=Thorne-Miller, Boyce | title=The living ocean: understanding and protecting marine biodiversity | year=1999 | publisher=Island Press | location=Washington, D.C. | isbn=1-55963-678-5 | pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kunich | first=John C. | title=Killing our oceans: dealing with the mass extinction of marine life | year=2006 | publisher=Praeger Publishers | location=Westport, CT | isbn=978-0-275-98878-4 | pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Williams | first=Linda Meyer | title=Earth science demystified | year=2004 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=London | isbn=0-07-143499-2 | pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures can range from roughly {{convert|0|C|0}} to {{convert|6|C|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Unusual and unique creatures dwell in this expanse of pitch black water, such as the [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulper eel]], the [[giant squid]], the [[anglerfish]], and the [[vampire squid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">'''Arthur Erich Haas''' (April 30, 1884 in [[Brno]] &amp;ndash; February 20, 1941 in [[Chicago]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[physicist]], noted for a 1910 paper&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Arthur Erich (1884-1941) Uber die elektrodynamische Bedeutung des Planckschen Strahlungsgesetzes und uber eine neue Bestimmung des elektrischen Elementarquantums und der dimension des wasserstoffatoms. Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien. 2a, 119 pp 119-144 (1910). Haas AE. Die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Satzes von der Erhaltung der Kraft. Habilitation Thesis, Vienna, 1909. Hermann, A. Arthur Erich Haas, Der erste Quantenansatz für das Atom. Stuttgart, 1965 [contains a reprint].&lt;/ref&gt; he submitted in support of his [[habilitation]] as ''[[Privatdocent]]'' at the [[University of Vienna]] that outlined a treatment of the hydrogen atom involving quantization of electronic orbitals, thus anticipating the [[Bohr model]] (1913) by three years.

Haas’ paper, however, was initially rejected and even ridiculed. As noted in his autobiography, Haas recalls "When I lectured to the Chemical-Physical Society of Vienna ... Lecher ... referred to the presentation during open discussion as a carnival joke" (the lecture was held during carnival time in Austria, February 1910). Soon thereafter, however, by September 1911 at a physical science convention in Karlsruhe, former detractors of Haas' work acknowledged it with greater enthusiasm as noted in a footnote: "We do not know what caused [a] change of mind in 1911 and can merely suggest the general trend of thinking at the time: 1910 saw the beginning of a universal shift of opinion of the quantum concept."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Armin (1974) Claude W. Nash (tr.) ''The Genesis of Quantum Theory (1899-1913)''. The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England, Ch. 5. {{ISBN|0-262-08047-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of Haas' work lay in the establishment of a relationship between [[Planck's constant]] and atomic dimensions, having been first to correctly estimate the magnitude of what is today known as the [[Bohr radius]].

'''Ball Glacier''' is a small glacier separating [[Redshaw Point]] from [[Hamilton Point]], flowing north-east to [[Markham Bay (Antarctica)|Markham Bay]] on the south-east side of [[James Ross Island]]. It was named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-names Committee]] in 1995 after [[H. William Ball]] (b. 1926), Keeper of Paleontology, [[British Museum (Natural History)]], 1966&amp;ndash;86, and author of [[Falklands Islands Dependencies Survey]] Scientific Report No. 24 on fossils from the James Ross Island area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''Batoni''' ({{lang-ka|ბატონი}}) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] word for "[[lord]]", or "[[Master (form of address)|master]]". It is derived from ''patroni'' (პატრონი), the earlier term of similar meaning, and appears in common usage in the 15th century.

*In [[Feudalism in Georgia|Georgian feudal]] hierarchy, "batoni" may denote the supreme [[suzerain]] (i.e., [[monarch]]), [[Lord|seigneur]], or any secular or clerical who owned ''qma'', i.e., "[[slave]]" or "[[serf]]". The word sometimes appears as a part of the royal and nobiliary titulature. For example, the title of the Princes of [[Mukhrani]] was batoni ([[House of Mukhrani|Mukhran-batoni]]), and the early [[List of sovereigns of Kakheti#Kings of Kakheti|kings]] of [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] were likewise referred to by that title in some Georgian sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1949–51).

*In modern usage, ''batoni'' is an [[honorific]] used for a [[man]], an equivalent of both [[Mr.]] and [[sir]]. The equivalent [[female]] title is ''k'albatoni'' (ქალბატონი). It can be used with the full name as well as either the last or first name. When addressing someone directly, the word is used in a [[vocative case]] ''(k'al)batono'' ([ქალ]ბატონო), and precedes either the first name (more commonly) or the last name, but it can also be used by itself in direct address.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Friederike (1998), ''Terms of address: problems of patterns and usage in various languages and cultures'', pp. 106-113.

'''Bimkom''' - Planners for Planning Rights ({{lang-he|במקום}}) is an [[Israel]]i non-profit organization established in May 1999 by [[Land use planning|planners]] and architects seeking to address human rights concerns in their spatial and urban designs. Bimkom's goals include retroactively legalizing [[illegal construction]] in Arab neighborhoods&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/j-lem-municipality-advancing-plan-to-build-1-900-apartments-for-arabs-1.230076 Jerusalem advancing building plan for Arabs&lt;/ref&gt; and promoting greater public involvement in the planning process. Its strategies include community-planning activities, educational activities, and public out-reach activities.

Bimkom has undertaken projects in the [[Negev Desert]] of southern Israel to aid [[Bedouin]] living in unrecognized villages. A plan for building 1,900 housing units in the Arab village of [[Isawiya]], northwest of the road to [[Ma'ale Adumim]] was approved by the Jerusalem Municipality in 2005. According to then Jerusalem mayor [[Uri Lupolianski]], it is one of 50 plans under way for improving the status of [[East Jerusalem]] residents and providing a solution for the acute housing shortage. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/907562.html J'lem municipality advancing plan to build 1,900 apartments for Arabs - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Wansink''' is an American former researcher and professor who worked in the fields of [[consumer behavior]] and [[marketing research]]. He is the former executive director of the [[USDA]]'s [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] ([[CNPP]]) (2007–2009) and held the John S. Dyson Endowed Chair in the Applied Economics and Management Department at [[Cornell University]], where he directed the Cornell Food and Brand Lab.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.dyson.cornell.edu/vita/Wansink-vita.pdf|title=Wansink Vita|last=Wansink|first=Brian|date=June 7, 2017|website=Dyson Cornell SC Johnson School of Business|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wansink's lab researched people's food choices and ways to improve those choices. Starting in 2017, problems with Wansink's papers and presentations were brought to wider public scrutiny. These problems included conclusions not supported by the data presented, data and figures duplicated across papers, questionable data including [[GRIM test|impossible values]] and incorrect and inappropriate [[statistical analyses]], and data manipulation via "[[p-hacking]]".&lt;ref name=NYM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; The lab had thirteen papers retracted (one twice) and had 15 corrections issued.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed2018-02"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Stephanie M.|title=Sliced And Diced: The Inside Story Of How An Ivy League Food Scientist Turned Shoddy Data Into Viral Studies|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking|work=BuzzFeed|date=February 25, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RW2018-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=buzzfeed2018-03/&gt; On September 20, 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from research and teaching, limiting his activity to cooperating with further investigation of his papers; he resigned effective June 30, 2019.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed2018-03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920200402/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-retired-cornell|title=Cornell Just Found Brian Wansink Guilty Of Scientific Misconduct And He Has Resigned|date=2018-09-20|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Brian Wansink was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="healthcorps"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthcorps.org/staff/brian-wansink/|title=Brian Wansink Ph.D.|work=HealthCorps|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a blue-collar family and is the older brother of Craig Wansink,&lt;ref name="chitrib"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jenkins |first1=Robin Mather |title=The wizard of why |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-03-30/entertainment/0503300278_1_food-and-brand-lab-brian-wansink-food-psychologist |website=www.chicagotribune.com |publisher=Tribune Digital |accessdate=16 July 2018 |language=en |date=30 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; a professor and chair of the Department of Religious Studies at [[Virginia Wesleyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiggetts|first1=Jennifer|title=Teaching, preaching: Norfolk man has two callings|url=https://pilotonline.com/news/article_6e581a4d-708d-5533-80f8-22a1e6475d28.html|website=Virginian-Pilot|accessdate=20 April 2018|language=en|date=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wansink received a B.S. in Business Administration from [[Wayne State College]] (Nebraska) in 1982 and an M.A. in Journalism and Mass Communication from [[Drake University]] in 1984, followed by a Ph.D. in Marketing (Consumer Behavior) in 1990 from [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

Wansink is married and has three daughters. His wife is a trained chef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Butler |first1=Kiera |title=This fast-food-loving, organics-hating Ivy League prof will trick you into eating better |url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/03/brian-wansink-cornell-junk-food-health/ |website=Mother Jones |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:ConsumerCampKids.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cornell Food and Brand Lab outreach]]
Wansink's first academic appointment was to the faculty of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College (1990–1994). He taught at the Wharton Graduate School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania (1995–1997), and was a marketing, nutritional science, advertising, and agricultural economics professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (1997–2005) before moving to the Department of Applied Economics and Management in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University in 2005.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

He set up a nonprofit foundation to support his work in 1999.&lt;ref name=healthcorps/&gt;&lt;ref name=chitrib/&gt;

Wansink's research focuses on ways people make choices – for example, how portion sizes affect food intake. Some of his work led to the introduction of mini-size packaging.&lt;ref name="NYT2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Severson|first1=Kim|title=Seduced by Snacks? No, Not You|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/dining/11snac.html |work=The New York Times|date=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another of his papers found that people who eat with someone who is fat will make worse food choices, which the UK NHS described as "not wholly convincing and does not prove this phenomenon exists in the general population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind the Headlines: Eating with a fat friend 'makes you eat more'|url=https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/eating-with-a-fat-friend-makes-you-eat-more/|work=National Health Service|date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, Wansink's lab published experimental findings in a paper titled, "Bottomless bowls: why visual cues of portion size may influence intake". In the "bottomless bowls study", an apparatus was built which contained a tube that pumped soup into the bottom of a bowl at a steady rate as the participant ate. Participants who ate from the bottomless bowl consumed more soup than those whose bowls were  filled manually (thus were aware of the amount they consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Associative learning and conditioning theory: human and non-human applications |last=Schachtman |first= Todd |last2=Reilly |first2=Steve |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199735969 |oclc=664352638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/business/02leonhardt.html |title=Your Plate Is Bigger Than Your Stomach |last=Leonhardt |first=David |date=2007-05-02 |work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Wansink received the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[Nutrition]] for the "bottomless bowls" study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ig Nobel Prizes Stranger Than Fiction|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2007/10/ig-nobel-prizes-stranger-fiction|work=Science|date=5 October 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment's data and analysis were challenged as part of the review of Wansink's body of work that started in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etchells|first1=Pete|last2=Chambers|first2=Chris|title=Mindless eating: is there something rotten behind the research?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/feb/16/mindless-eating-brian-wansink-is-there-something-rotten-behind-the-research|work=the Guardian|date=16 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, Wansink published ''Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think''.&lt;ref name="NYT2006"/&gt; It was described as a [[popular science]] book combined with a [[Self-help book|self-help diet book]], as each chapter ends with brief advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Madeline K.B.|title=Why Do I Keep Super Sizing Me?|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/10/25/why-do-i-keep-super-sizing/|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=October 25, 2006|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book details Wansink's research into what, how much, and when people eat.&lt;ref name="NYT2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Jack L.|title=Joplin Independent: Mindless Eating is a nourishing read |url=http://www.joplinindependent.com/display_article.php/jkennedy1162333800 |work=Joplin Independent|date=October 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was cited by the [[National Action Against Obesity]] as being helpful in effort to curb [[obesity in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MeMe Roth And National Action Against Obesity Name 2006 Heroes and Villains in U.S. Fight Against Obesity|url=http://www.prweb.com//releases/obesity/trans-fat/prweb491541.htm |website=PRWeb |accessdate=1 April 2018|date=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wansink was appointed as the executive director of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] from November 2007 through January 2009. He was responsible for oversight of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, [[MyPyramid.gov]], and various other food-related programs administered by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Susan S.|title=Wansink accepts 14-month appointment as executive director of USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion : Cornell Chronicle|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2007/11/wansink-head-usda-center-nutrition-policy-and-promotion|work=Cornell Chronicle|date=November 20, 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Wansink was elected to a one-year-term as president of the [[Society for Nutrition Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Presidents|url=https://www.sneb.org/sneb-past-presidents/|publisher=SNEB|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 2009 paper, a team led by Wansink described their finding that calorie counts in ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'' had gone up around 44% since the cookbook's first edition in 1936, and related this to the obesity epidemic. Over time this finding became a shorthand way to refer to the unhealthy [[western pattern diet]].  The publisher of ''Joy of Cooking'', John Becker, noticed that Wansink's sample size was small, consisting of only 18 recipes out of about 4500 that were published during the study time interval, and did his own analysis of changes in calories in the recipes. In 2017, after news of Wansink's research practices became widely discussed in the media, Becker sent his results to several statisticians, including James Heathers, a behavioral scientist at Northeastern University.  Heathers found Wansink's conclusions to be invalid, and found a number of problems with Wansink's paper, including counting a whole cake as a "serving" and comparing a recipe for a clear chicken soup with one for [[gumbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosner|first1=Helen|title=The Strange, Uplifting Tale of “Joy of Cooking” Versus the Food Scientist|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-strange-uplifting-tale-of-joy-of-cooking-versus-the-food-scientist|work=New Yorker|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Resnick|first1=Brian|last2=Belluz|first2=Julia|title=Why the Joy of Cooking is going after a Cornell researcher|url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/2/28/17061828/joy-of-cooking-brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking|work=Vox|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wansink's second book, ''Slim by Design'' was released in 2014. During 2014 he ran a [[Kickstarter]] campaign and raised around $10,000 to fund a coaching program based on the book; as of February 2018 the program had not been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Stephanie|title=An Ivy League Scientist Raised $10,000 On Kickstarter For A Weight-Loss Program That Never Launched|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-kickstarter-weight-loss|work=BuzzFeed|date=February 23, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wansink's research came under scrutiny in 2017, leading to several retractions and an investigation by Cornell into the integrity of his work. In September 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct, and removed him from all teaching and research positions; he was restricted solely to cooperating with people investigating his publications.  He also resigned from the university, effective June 30, 2019.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed2018-03"/&gt;  After the announcement of the findings and his resignation, in an email exchange with ''Buzzfeed'', Wansink acknowledged some problems with his published work and also wrote: "There was no fraud, no intentional misreporting, no plagiarism, or no misappropriation."&lt;ref name=buzzfeed2018-03/&gt;

== Retractions and corrections ==
===Pizza papers===
[[File:Xkcd-significant-panel.png||thumb|right|Panel from a 2011 ''[[xkcd]]'' cartoon explaining [[p hacking]], in which scientists look for relationships between many colors of jelly beans and acne, and find a p value &lt;0.05 only for green ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Significant|url=https://xkcd.com/882/|publisher=xkcd|date=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Cited in New York Magazine piece about Wansink lab's p hacking.&lt;ref name=NYM/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]
In January 2017, the validity of research from Wansink's labs was called into question by Jordan Anaya, Nicholas J L Brown, and Tim van der Zee, after Wansink had written a blog post about asking a graduate student to "salvage" conclusions from a study which had [[null result]]s, subsequently producing five papers from it, all published with Wansink as co-author.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Grady|first1=Cathleen|title=“Mindless Eating,” or how to send an entire life of research into question|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/the-peer-reviewed-saga-of-mindless-eating-mindless-research-is-bad-too/|work=Ars Technica|date=24 April 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Zee, Anaya, and Brown analysed four of the five papers (referred to as "the pizza papers"), and found conclusions not supported by the data presented, and a total of 150 questionable numbers, such as [[GRIM test|impossible values]], incorrect [[ANOVA]] results, and dubious [[p-value]]s.&lt;ref name=NYM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; According to the critics, requests for access to the original data were denied by Wansink, who cited privacy issues over the anonymity of the participants. A February 2017 article in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' described the pizza papers as "shockingly unprofessional" and expressed concern over the journals that published them.&lt;ref name="NYM"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/02/cornells-food-and-brand-lab-has-a-major-problem.html|title=A Popular Diet-Science Lab Has Been Publishing Really Shoddy Research|last=Singal|first=Jesse|date=2017-02-08|work=|newspaper=New York magazine|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response, Wansink announced an in-depth review of the four disputed papers, after locating some of the original datasets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Tom|title=Spoiled Science|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Spoiled-Science/239529|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a detailed response in March 2017.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;  A few days later, Cornell released a statement confirming that the university administration had conducted a preliminary investigation of Wansink's four pizza papers, and had not found evidence of scientific misconduct. The investigation did find multiple cases of [[self-plagiarism]] and confirmed "numerous instances of inappropriate data handling and statistical analysis", requiring Wansink to hire independent, external statistical experts to check and reanalyze his own review of the papers.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cornell University Statement Regarding Questions About Professor Brian Wansink's Research {{!}} Cornell Chronicle |url=http://news.cornell.edu/media-relations/advisories/cornell-university-statement-regarding-questions-about-professor-brian |website=news.cornell.edu |accessdate=16 July 2018 |language=en |date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further corrections and retractions follow===
Later in 2017, Anaya and his colleagues found errors in six other papers published by members of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab. As of December 2017, six papers had been retracted and 14 corrections had been issued.&lt;ref name="RW2017-12"&gt;{{cite news|title=Another retraction to appear for Cornell food scientist Brian Wansink|url=https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/28/another-retraction-appear-cornell-food-scientist-brian-wansink/|work=Retraction Watch|date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By March 2018, two more papers had been retracted and an additional correction made, bringing the totals to 7 (one of them retracted twice, so technically 8) and 15, respectively.&lt;ref name="RW2018-03"&gt;{{cite news|title=Caught Our Notice: Retraction eight as errors in Wansink paper are “too voluminous” for a correction|url=https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/19/caught-our-notice-retraction-eight-as-errors-in-wansink-paper-are-too-voluminous-for-a-correction/|work=Retraction Watch|date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] (Journal of the American Medical Association)'' issued a "Notice of Expression of Concern" about all six articles authored by Wansink in JAMA and JAMA network specialty journals, to alert the scientific community of concerns about the validity of Wansink's research; the notice included a request for Cornell to have the validity of the papers independently assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Bauchner |first=Howard |title=Expression of Concern: Wansink B, Cheney MM.

'''Buck''' is a crater in the [[Navka Planitia|Navka]] region of [[Venus]]. It has the terraced walls, flat radar-dark floor, and central peak that are characteristic of craters classified as "complex". The central peak on its floor is unusually large. Flow-like deposits extend beyond the limits of the coarser rim deposits on its west and southwest. Like about half of the craters mapped by ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' to date, it is surrounded by a local, radar-dark halo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2758">In [[centrifugation]] the '''clearing factor''' or '''k factor''' represents the relative pelleting efficiency of a given centrifuge rotor at maximum rotation speed. It can be used to estimate the time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (in hours) required for [[sedimentation]] of a fraction with a known [[sedimentation coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (in [[svedberg]]s):

: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{k}{s} &lt;/math&gt;

The value of the clearing factor depends on the maximum [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; of a centrifuge (in rad/s) and the minimum and maximum [[radius]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Turbine|rotor]]:

: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{\ln(r_{\rm{max}} / r_{\rm{min}})}{\omega^2} \times \frac{10^{13}}{3600}&lt;/math&gt;

As the rotational speed of a centrifuge is usually specified in [[revolutions per minute|RPM]], the following formula is often used for convenience:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleparmer.com/techinfo/techinfo.asp?htmlfile=basic-centrifugation.htm&amp;ID=30 "Basics of Centrifugation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2.53 \cdot 10^5 \times \ln(r_{\rm{max}} / r_{\rm{min}})}{(\rm{RPM}/1000)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Centrifuge]] manufacturers usually specify the minimum, maximum and average radius of a rotor, as well as the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; factor of a centrifuge-rotor combination.

For runs with a rotational speed lower than the maximum rotor-speed, the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; factor has to be adjusted:

: &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm{adj}} = k \left( \frac{\mbox{maximum rotor-speed}}{\mbox{actual rotor-speed}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

The K-factor is related to the sedimentation coefficient &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{K}{S}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the time to pellet a certain particle in hours. Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a constant for a certain particle, this relationship can be used to interconvert between different rotors.

&lt;math&gt; \frac{T_1}{K_1} = \frac{T_2}{K_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is the time to pellet in one rotor, and &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; is the K-factor of that rotor. &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; is the K-factor of the other rotor, and &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, the time to pellet in the other rotor, can be calculated. In this manner, one does not need access to the exact rotor cited in a protocol, as long as the K-factor can be calculated. [http://www.google.com/search?q=centrifuge%20calculator Many online calculators] are available to perform the calculations for common rotors.

'''Colin Eden''' was a professor in [[management science]] and [[operations research]] at [[Strathclyde University]].&lt;ref name="Colin_Retires"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.strath.ac.uk/feeds/news.aspx?id=519 |title=Professor Colin Eden retires |accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==

Eden worked as an operational researcher in engineering upon bagging a [[doctorate]]. He then proceeded to academia, first working at the [[University of Bath]] Management School as a senior lecturer, then, as a reader.&lt;ref name="Colin_Retires"/&gt;

He then assumed a professorship at [[Strathclyde University]] in [[management science]]. He subsequently became head of department at the Strathclyde Business School. And then Director of the Graduate School of Business at Strathclyde, and then finally Vice Dean.&lt;ref name="Colin_Retires"/&gt;

His research interests is in business strategy, [[project management]], and operations research.&lt;ref name="Google_Scholar"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=iEYUdaYAAAAJ |title=Google Scholar Page |accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is widely published in respected management, project management and management science journals such as: [[Journal of Management Studies]]; and [[European Journal of Operational Research]].  His significant contributions are i) in the development of SODA as a problem structuring method; setting out a clear view of the nature Action Research in the study of management and organisations; iii) the development and theoretical grounding for strategy development as negotiation.

He has been awarded many accolades including lifetime achievement awards from the OR Society (Beale Medal 2007)and from INFORMS GND Section (2008).

'''David M. Jones''' (December 18, 1913 – November 25, 2008) was a [[United States Air Force]] pilot and general officer who served with distinction during [[World War II]].  He was one of the [[Doolittle Raid]]ers whose exploits in April 1942 were dramatized in the film ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]''.  He then flew combat missions over North Africa, where he was shot down.  He was a German prisoner of war for two and a half years &amp;mdash; helping with the April 1944 mass escape at [[Stalag Luft III]] .&lt;ref name=ArizonaStarDaily_Sottosanti_20081130/&gt;  

In his last assignment with the Air Force, Jones was the commander of the Air Force Eastern Test Range in [[Cape Canaveral|Cape Kennedy]], Florida as well as the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Manager for Manned Space Flight Support Operations. He retired from the Air Force in 1973.

==Early years; education==
David Mudgett Jones was born on December 18, 1913 in [[Marshfield, Oregon]], the son of David Arthur (Dade) Jones and Grace Mudgett. His father Dade Jones, the son of Welsh immigrants, homesteaded land in Meadow Lake Township, North Dakota in 1896 before marrying Grace and moving to Oregon.

David Jones enlisted in the [[Arizona National Guard]] while he was attending the [[University of Arizona]] at [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], from 1932 to 1936.  His later education included three major [[U.S. military|Armed Forces]] schools: [[Command and General Staff School]] in [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, 1946; [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 1948; and the [[National War College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], 1956.

Jones was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. Cavalry]] arm of the [[Arizona Army National Guard]], where he served one year of active duty before transferring to the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] and entering pilot training in June 1937. After earning his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|wings]] in June 1938, he served as a [[Northrop A-17]] pilot with the [[95th Reconnaissance Squadron|95th Attack Squadron]] of the  [[17th Bombardment Group|17th Attack Group]], based at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]], California. 

In 1939 the 17th was re-designated a medium bombardment group and transferred to [[McChord Air Force Base|McChord Field]], Washington. By September 1941 it became the first unit of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] to be fully equipped with the new [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] medium bomber.

==World War II==

===Doolittle Raid===

Eugene F. McGurl, navigator; Lt. [[Denver V. Truelove]], bombardier; Sgt. Joseph W. Manske, flight engineer/gunner.]]
In early 1942, Jones volunteered for the Doolittle Project &amp;mdash; a secret bombing raid to be launched on Japan in retaliation for the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=AFLink_20081202&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the training phase of this project, he acted as navigation and intelligence officer for the ad hoc squadron of B-25 bombers.  On April 18, 1942, the [[Doolittle Raid]] launched from the [[United States Navy]]'s aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8}}, dropping their bombs on [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]] and four other Japanese cities.&lt;ref name=AFLink_20081202/&gt; This raid was the first good news that the Americans had from the [[Pacific War|Pacific front]].

Lacking the fuel to make a safe landing after the raid, Jones bailed out over [[China]], where he was assisted by the Chinese people in evading capture. He received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his participation as a flight commander in the planning, training and completion of the mission. After escaping capture, Jones was flown to India, where he spent three months with the [[22d Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron|22nd Bomb Squadron]] flying further B-25 missions against the Japanese.

===North Africa and Stalag Luft III===
[[File:Sagan harry-3.jpg|thumb|left|Scene of the "Harry" tunnel in Stalag Luft III.]]
In September 1942, Jones was assigned to the new [[319th Bombardment Group]], preparing for combat in [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]]. He was assigned to develop low-level bombing tactics and techniques due to his experience with the Doolittle project and his belief in low-level bombing tactics. On December 4, 1942, he was shot down over [[Bizerte]], North Africa, and spent two and a half years as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Stalag Luft III]].&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt; As a result of his constant agitation and harassment of the enemy, he was selected for the "escape committee" by fellow prisoners. The committee reviewed escape plans and directed escapes.&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt;  Jones led the digging team on tunnel "Harry" used in the ''Great Escape'', chronicled in the [[Paul Brickhill]]'s  [[The Great Escape (book)|autobiographical book]], and portrayed in the [[The Great Escape (film)|1963 film]].&lt;ref name=ArizonaStarDaily_Sottosanti_20081130&gt;

==Post-World War II==
In July 1946, Jones was assigned as an air inspector at Headquarters [[Air Training Command]].  He followed this with attendance at the Armed Forces Staff College, which he completed in 1948.  During this time, the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] was disestablished and his commission was transferred to the newly established [[United States Air Force]].  He then served as Director of War Plans at Headquarters [[Tactical Air Command]] at [[Langley AFB]], Virginia, followed by an assignment as Director of Combat Operations for the [[Ninth Air Force]]; then as Commander of the [[47th Bombardment Group]], until February 1952.

He was then the commander of the [[47th Bombardment Wing]] (a [[B-45 Tornado]] jetbomber wing) at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia and at [[RAF Sculthorpe]], England until July 1955.&lt;ref name=AFbio/&gt;

===Test pilot===
[[File:B-58 Hustler.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;B-58 Hustler&lt;/center&gt;]]
Jones began working in [[research and development]] in 1956 when he was the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations for the [[Air Proving Ground Command]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida. His experience in bombardment-type aircraft and previous command staff assignments in research and development resulted in his being selected director of the [[B-58 Hustler|B-58]] Test Force, organized in February 1958 at [[Carswell Air Force Base]], Texas. The B-58 Hustler was the first operational jet [[bomber]] capable of Mach 2 [[supersonic]] flight.  During this time, Jones continued to maintain his flight status in the B-58, [[F-102 Delta Dagger|TF-102]], and [[T-33 Shooting Star|T-33]] aircraft;  participating in design speed dashes, low-level penetrations, night, weather, formation and inflight refueling missions. He had more supersonic time testing the [[B-58 Hustler|B-58]] than any senior U.S. Air Force pilot.

In September 1960, he became vice commander of the Wright Air Development Division at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio.  In October 1961, he was named program manager of the [[GAM-87]] "Skybolt" at [[Air Force Systems Command]]'s Aeronautical Systems Division. When that project was cancelled, he became ASD deputy for systems management and later vice commander.

In August 1964, he became deputy chief of staff for systems at Headquarters [[Air Force Systems Command]] at [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland, which had responsibility for all USAF research, development, and weapon system acquisition.

===NASA===
In December 1964, Jones became Deputy Assistant Administrator for Manned Space Flight with the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).&lt;ref name=NASA_part2a/&gt; In July 1965, he was given responsibility for development of the [[S-IVB]] Orbital Workshop and spent-stage experiment support module (SSESM) &amp;mdash; a concept of "in-orbit" conversion of a spent S-IVB stage to a shelter.&lt;ref name=NASA_part2a/&gt; In August 1965, he took on the additional duties as of the Saturn/Apollo Applications (SAA) Acting Director.&lt;ref name=NASA_part2a&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 3, 2008

Then, in May 1967, he assumed duties as commander of the [[Air Force Eastern Test Range]], [[Patrick AFB]] and [[Cape Canaveral AFS|Cape Kennedy AFS]], Florida.

==Retirement; death==
Jones retired at the rank of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] on May 31, 1973. He was one of five Doolittle Raiders who later became [[general officer]]s;&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 6, 2008

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29574">{{Docking glossary}}
In the field of [[molecular modeling]], '''docking''' is a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule to a second when [[binding (molecular)|bound]] to each other to form a stable [[supramolecular chemistry|complex]].&lt;ref name="pmid8804827"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lengauer T, Rarey M | title = Computational methods for biomolecular docking | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 402–6 | date = Jun 1996 | pmid = 8804827 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-440X(96)80061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of the preferred orientation in turn may be used to predict the strength of association or [[dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|binding affinity]] between two molecules using, for example, [[Scoring functions for docking|scoring functions]].

[[File:Docking representation 2.png|thumb|340x340px|Schematic illustration of docking a small molecule ligand (green) to a protein target (black) producing a stable complex.]]

[[File:Docking GPCR example.webm|thumb|344x344px|Docking of a small molecule (green) into the [[crystal structure]] of the [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|beta-2 adrenergic]] [[G protein–coupled receptor|G-protein coupled receptor]] ({{PDB|3SN6}})]]
The associations between biologically relevant molecules such as [[proteins]], [[peptide]]s, [[nucleic acids]], [[carbohydrates]], and [[lipids]] play a central role in [[signal transduction]].  Furthermore, the relative orientation of the two interacting partners may affect the type of signal produced (e.g., [[agonist|agonism]] vs [[antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonism]]).  Therefore, docking is useful for predicting both the strength and type of signal produced.

Molecular docking is one of the most frequently used methods in [[Drug design|structure-based drug design,]] due to its ability to predict the binding-conformation of [[small molecule]] ligands to the appropriate target [[binding site]]. Characterisation of the binding behaviour plays an important role in [[rational drug design|rational design of drugs]] as well as to elucidate fundamental biochemical processes.&lt;ref name="pmid15520816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitchen DB, Decornez H, Furr JR, Bajorath J | title = Docking and scoring in virtual screening for drug discovery: methods and applications | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 935–49 | date = Nov 2004 | pmid = 15520816 | doi = 10.1038/nrd1549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of problem ==
One can think of molecular docking as a problem of ''“lock-and-key”'', in which one wants to find the correct relative orientation of the ''“key”'' which will open up the ''“lock”''  (where on the surface of the lock is the key hole, which direction to turn the key after it is inserted, etc.).  Here, the protein can be thought of as the “lock” and the ligand can be thought of as a “key”.  Molecular docking may be defined as an optimization problem, which would describe the “best-fit” orientation of a ligand that binds to a particular protein of interest.  However, since both the ligand and the protein are flexible, a ''“hand-in-glove”'' analogy is more appropriate than ''“lock-and-key”''.&lt;ref name="pmid1719636"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorgensen WL | title = Rusting of the lock and key model for protein-ligand binding | journal = Science | volume = 254 | issue = 5034 | pages = 954–5 | date = Nov 1991 | pmid = 1719636 | doi = 10.1126/science.1719636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the course of the docking process, the ligand and the protein adjust their conformation to achieve an overall "best-fit" and this kind of conformational adjustment resulting in the overall binding is referred to as '''"induced-fit"'''.&lt;ref name="pmid15046985"&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei BQ, Weaver LH, Ferrari AM, Matthews BW, Shoichet BK | title = Testing a flexible-receptor docking algorithm in a model binding site | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 337 | issue = 5 | pages = 1161–82 | date = Apr 2004 | pmid = 15046985 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2004.02.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular docking research focuses on computationally simulating the [[molecular recognition]] process. It aims to achieve an optimized conformation for both the protein and ligand and relative orientation between protein and ligand such that the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] of the overall system is minimized.

== Docking approaches ==

Two approaches are particularly popular within the molecular docking community. One approach uses a matching technique that describes the protein and the ligand as complementary surfaces.&lt;ref name="Wipke_2000"&gt;{{cite_journal |vauthors=Goldman BB, Wipke WT | title = QSD quadratic shape descriptors. 2. Molecular docking using quadratic shape descriptors (QSDock) | journal = Proteins | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–94 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10651041 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(20000101)38:1&lt;79::AID-PROT9&gt;3.0.CO;2-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meng_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meng EC, Shoichet BK, Kuntz ID | title = Automated docking with grid-based energy evaluation | journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 505–524 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1002/jcc.540130412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris GM, Goodsell DS, Halliday RS, Huey R, Hart WE, Belew RK, Olson AJ | title = Automated docking using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm and an empirical binding free energy function | journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry | volume = 19 | issue = 14 | pages = 1639–1662 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-987X(19981115)19:14&lt;1639::AID-JCC10&gt;3.0.CO;2-B  | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.5900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second approach simulates the actual docking process in which the ligand-protein pairwise interaction energies are calculated.&lt;ref name="pmid14648625"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feig M, Onufriev A, Lee MS, Im W, Case DA, Brooks CL | title = Performance comparison of generalized born and Poisson methods in the calculation of electrostatic solvation energies for protein structures | journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–84 | date = Jan 2004 | pmid = 14648625 | doi = 10.1002/jcc.10378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches have significant advantages as well as some limitations. These are outlined below.

=== Shape complementarity ===

Geometric matching/ shape complementarity methods describe the protein and ligand as a set of features that make them dockable.&lt;ref name="Shoichet_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shoichet BK, Kuntz ID, Bodian DL | title = Molecular docking using shape descriptors | journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 380–397 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1002/jcc.540130311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features may include [[Van der Waals surface|molecular surface]] / [[complementary surface]] descriptors. In this case, the receptor’s molecular surface is described in terms of its [[solvent-accessible surface area]] and the ligand’s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique.&lt;ref name="pmid11858640"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cai W, Shao X, Maigret B | title = Protein-ligand recognition using spherical harmonic molecular surfaces: towards a fast and efficient filter for large virtual throughput screening | journal = Journal of Molecular Graphics &amp; Modelling | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 313–28 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11858640 | doi = 10.1016/S1093-3263(01)00134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15728116"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris RJ, Najmanovich RJ, Kahraman A, Thornton JM | title = Real spherical harmonic expansion coefficients as 3D shape descriptors for protein binding pocket and ligand comparisons | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 2347–55 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15728116 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17337005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahraman A, Morris RJ, Laskowski RA, Thornton JM | title = Shape variation in protein binding pockets and their ligands | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 368 | issue = 1 | pages = 283–301 | date = Apr 2007 | pmid = 17337005 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands in a matter of seconds and actually figure out whether they can bind at the protein’s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.

=== Simulation ===
Simulating the docking process is much more complicated. In this approach, the protein and the ligand are separated by some physical distance, and the ligand finds its position into the protein’s active site after a certain number of “moves” in its conformational space. The moves incorporate rigid body transformations such as translations and rotations, as well as internal changes to the ligand’s structure including torsion angle rotations. Each of these moves in the conformation space of the ligand induces a total energetic cost of the system. Hence, the system's total energy is calculated after every move.

The obvious advantage of docking simulation is that ligand flexibility is easily incorporated, whereas shape complementarity techniques must use ingenious methods to incorporate flexibility in ligands. Also, it more accurately models reality, whereas shape complimentary techniques are more of an abstraction.

Clearly, simulation is computationally expensive, having to explore a large energy landscape. Grid-based techniques, optimization methods, and increased computer speed have made docking simulation more realistic.

== Mechanics of docking ==
[[File:Overview docking.png|thumb|340x340px|Docking flow-chart overview]]
To perform a docking screen, the first requirement is a structure of the protein of interest. Usually the structure has been determined using a biophysical technique such as [[x-ray crystallography]] or [[Protein NMR|NMR spectroscopy]], but can also derive from [[homology modeling]] construction. This protein structure and a database of potential ligands serve as inputs to a docking program. The success of a docking program depends on two components: the [[search algorithm]] and the [[molecular mechanics|scoring function]].

=== Search algorithm ===

{{main|Searching the conformational space for docking}}
The [[Candidate solution|search space]] in theory consists of all possible orientations and [[Chemical conformation|conformations]] of the protein paired with the ligand. However, in practice with current computational resources, it is impossible to exhaustively explore the search space—this would involve enumerating all possible distortions of each molecule (molecules are dynamic and exist in an ensemble of conformational states) and all possible [[Flight dynamics|rotational]] and translational orientations of the ligand relative to the protein at a given level of [[granularity]]. Most docking programs in use account for the whole conformational space of the ligand (flexible ligand), and several attempt to model a flexible protein receptor. Each "snapshot" of the pair is referred to as a '''pose'''.

A variety of conformational search strategies have been applied to the ligand and to the receptor.  These include:

* systematic or [[stochastic]] [[dihedral angle|torsional]] searches about rotatable bonds
* [[molecular dynamics]] simulations
* [[genetic algorithm]]s to "evolve" new low energy conformations and where the score of each pose acts as the fitness function used to select individuals for the next iteration.

==== Ligand flexibility ====

Conformations of the ligand may be generated in the absence of the receptor and subsequently docked&lt;ref name="pmid7876901"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kearsley SK, Underwood DJ, Sheridan RP, Miller MD | title = Flexibases: a way to enhance the use of molecular docking methods | journal = Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 565–82 | date = Oct 1994 | pmid = 7876901 | doi = 10.1007/BF00123666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or conformations may be generated on-the-fly in the presence of the receptor binding cavity,&lt;ref name="pmid15027865"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friesner RA, Banks JL, Murphy RB, Halgren TA, Klicic JJ, Mainz DT, Repasky MP, Knoll EH, Shelley M, Perry JK, Shaw DE, Francis P, Shenkin PS | title = Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 1.

Peptides are both highly flexible and relatively large-sized molecules, which makes modeling their flexibility a challenging task. A number of methods were developed to allow for efficient modeling of flexibility of peptides during protein-peptide docking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciemny M, Kurcinski M, Kamel K, Kolinski A, Alam N, Schueler-Furman O, Kmiecik S | title = Protein-peptide docking: opportunities and challenges | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1530–1537 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29733895 | doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2018.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Receptor flexibility ====

Computational capacity has increased dramatically over the last decade making possible the use of more sophisticated and computationally intensive methods in computer-assisted drug design. However, dealing with receptor flexibility in docking methodologies is still a thorny issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Antunes DA, Devaurs D, Kavraki LE | title = Understanding the challenges of protein flexibility in drug design | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 1301–13 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26414598 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2015.1094458 | hdl = 1911/88215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason behind this difficulty is the large number of degrees of freedom that have to be considered in this kind of calculations. Neglecting it, however, in some of the cases may lead to poor docking results in terms of binding pose prediction.&lt;ref name="pmid18618708"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cerqueira NM, Bras NF, Fernandes PA, Ramos MJ | title = MADAMM: a multistaged docking with an automated molecular modeling protocol | journal = Proteins | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 192–206 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18618708 | doi = 10.1002/prot.22146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple static structures experimentally determined for the same protein in different conformations are often used to emulate receptor flexibility.&lt;ref name="pmid18302984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Totrov M, Abagyan R | title = Flexible ligand docking to multiple receptor conformations: a practical alternative | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–84 | date = Apr 2008 | pmid = 18302984 | pmc = 2396190 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2008.01.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively [[Conformational isomerism#Protein rotamer libraries|rotamer libraries]] of amino acid side chains that surround the binding cavity may be searched to generate alternate but energetically reasonable protein conformations.&lt;ref name="pmid18704939"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartmann C, Antes I, Lengauer T | title = Docking and scoring with alternative side-chain conformations | journal = Proteins | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 712–26 | date = Feb 2009 | pmid = 18704939 | doi = 10.1002/prot.22189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12926007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor RD, Jewsbury PJ, Essex JW | title = FDS: flexible ligand and receptor docking with a continuum solvent model and soft-core energy function | journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry | volume = 24 | issue = 13 | pages = 1637–56 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 12926007 | doi = 10.1002/jcc.10295 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.147.1131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scoring function ===
{{main|Scoring functions for docking}}
Docking programs generate a large number of potential ligand poses, of which some can be immediately rejected due to clashes with the protein. The remainder are evaluated using some scoring function, which takes a pose as input and returns a number 
indicating the likelihood that the pose represents a favorable binding interaction and ranks one ligand relative to another.

Most scoring functions are physics-based [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]]s that estimate the energy of the pose within the binding site. The various contributions to binding can be written as an additive equation:

&lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup G_{bind} = \bigtriangleup G_{solvent} + \bigtriangleup G_{conf} + \bigtriangleup G_{int} + \bigtriangleup G_{rot} + \bigtriangleup G_{t/t} + \bigtriangleup G_{vib}&lt;/math&gt;

The components consist of solvent effects, conformational changes in the protein and ligand, free energy due to protein-ligand interactions, internal rotations, association energy of ligand and receptor to form a single complex and free energy due to changes in vibrational modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murcko MA | title = Computational Methods to Predict Binding Free Energy in Ligand-Receptor Complexes | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 26 | pages = 4953–67 | date = Dec 1995 | pmid = 8544170 | doi = 10.1021/jm00026a001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A low (negative) energy indicates a stable system and thus a likely binding interaction.

An alternative approach is to derive a knowledge-based statistical potential for interactions from a large database of protein-ligand complexes, such as the [[Protein Data Bank]], and evaluate the fit of the pose according to this inferred potential.

There are a large number of structures from [[X-ray crystallography]] for complexes between proteins and high affinity ligands, but comparatively fewer for low affinity ligands as the later complexes tend to be less stable and therefore more difficult to crystallize.  Scoring functions trained with this data can dock high affinity ligands correctly, but they will also give plausible docked conformations for ligands that do not bind.  This gives a large number of [[false positive]] hits, i.e., ligands predicted to bind to the protein that actually don't when placed together in a test tube.

One way to reduce the number of false positives is to recalculate the energy of the top scoring poses using (potentially) more accurate but computationally more intensive techniques such as [[Implicit solvation#Generalized Born|Generalized Born]] or [[Implicit solvation#Poisson-Boltzmann|Poisson-Boltzmann]] methods.&lt;ref name="pmid14648625" /&gt;

== Docking assessment ==

The interdependence between sampling and scoring function affects the docking capability in predicting plausible poses or binding affinities for novel compounds. Thus, an assessment of a docking protocol is generally required (when experimental data is available) to determine its predictive capability. Docking assessment can be performed using different strategies, such as:
* docking accuracy (DA) calculation;
* the correlation between a docking score and the experimental response or determination of the enrichment factor (EF);&lt;ref name = "Huang_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang N, Shoichet BK, Irwin JJ | title = Benchmarking sets for molecular docking | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 23 | pages = 6789–801 | date = Nov 2006 | pmid = 17154509 | pmc = 3383317 | doi = 10.1021/jm0608356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the distance between an ion-binding moiety and the ion in the active site;
* the presence of induce-fit models.

=== Docking accuracy ===

Docking accuracy&lt;ref name="pmid26682916"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ballante F, Marshall GR | title = An Automated Strategy for Binding-Pose Selection and Docking Assessment in Structure-Based Drug Design | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–72 | date = Jan 2016 | pmid = 26682916 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bursulaya BD, Totrov M, Abagyan R, Brooks CL | title = Comparative study of several algorithms for flexible ligand docking | journal = Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 755–63 | date = Nov 2003 | pmid = 15072435 | doi = 10.1023/B:JCAM.0000017496.76572.6f }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents one measure to quantify the fitness of a docking program by rationalizing the ability to predict the right pose of a ligand with respect to that experimentally observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ballante|first=Flavio|date=2018|title=Protein-Ligand Docking in Drug Design: Performance Assessment and Binding-Pose Selection|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=1824|pages=67–88|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-8630-9_5|issn=1940-6029|pmid=30039402|isbn=978-1-4939-8629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enrichment factor ===

Docking screens can be also evaluated by the enrichment of annotated ligands of known binders from among a large database of presumed non-binding, “[[decoy]]” molecules.&lt;ref name = "Huang_2006"/&gt; In this way, the success of a docking screen is evaluated by its capacity to enrich the small number of known active compounds in the top ranks of a screen from among a much greater number of decoy molecules in the database. The area under the [[Receiver operating characteristic|receiver operating characteristic (ROC)]] curve is widely used to evaluate its performance.

=== Prospective ===

Resulting hits from docking screens are subjected to pharmacological validation (e.g. [[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;  [[Ligand (biochemistry)|affinity]] or [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] measurements). Only prospective studies constitute conclusive proof of the suitability of a technique for a particular target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irwin JJ | title = Community benchmarks for virtual screening | journal = Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design | volume = 22 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 193–9 | date = 2008-02-14 | pmid = 18273555 | doi = 10.1007/s10822-008-9189-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benchmarking ===

The potential of docking programs to reproduce binding modes as determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] can be assed by a range of docking benchmark sets.

For small molecules, several benchmark data sets for docking and virtual screening exist e.g. ''Astex Diverse Set'' consisting of high quality protein−ligand X-ray crystal structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartshorn MJ, Verdonk ML, Chessari G, Brewerton SC, Mooij WT, Mortenson PN, Murray CW | title = Diverse, high-quality test set for the validation of protein-ligand docking performance |  journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 726–41 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17300160 | doi = 10.1021/jm061277y }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Directory of Useful Decoys'' (DUD) for evaluation of virtual screening performance.&lt;ref name="Huang_2006"/&gt;

An evaluation of docking programs for their potential to reproduce peptide binding modes can be assessed by ''Lessons for Efficiency Assessment of Docking and Scoring'' (LEADS-PEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauser AS, Windshügel B | title = A Benchmark Data Set for Assessment of Peptide Docking Performance | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | date = Dec 2015 | pmid = 26651532 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00234 | volume=56 | issue = 1 | pages=188–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

A binding interaction between a [[small molecule]] ligand and an [[enzyme]] protein may result in activation or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the enzyme.  If the protein is a receptor, ligand binding may result in [[agonist|agonism]] or [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonism]].  Docking is most commonly used in the field of [[drug design]] — most drugs are small [[Organic compound|organic]] molecules, and docking may be applied to:
* hit identification – docking combined with a [[Scoring functions for docking|scoring function]] can be used to quickly screen large databases of potential drugs [[in silico]] to identify molecules that are likely to bind to protein target of interest (see [[virtual screening]]).
* lead optimization – docking can be used to predict in where and in which relative orientation a ligand binds to a protein (also referred to as the binding mode or pose).  This information may in turn be used to design more potent and selective analogs.
* [[Bioremediation]] – Protein ligand docking can also be used to predict pollutants that can be degraded by enzymes.&lt;ref name="pmid17606396"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suresh PS, Kumar A, Kumar R, Singh VP | title = An in silico [correction of insilico] approach to bioremediation: laccase as a case study | journal = Journal of Molecular Graphics &amp; Modelling | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 845–9 | date = Jan 2008 | pmid = 17606396 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmgm.2007.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Equatorial Vortex Experiment (EVEX)''' is a [[NASA]]-funded [[sounding rocket]] mission to better understand and predict the electrical storms in Earth's upper atmosphere.  As part of this experiment, two rockets were launched for a twelve-minute journey through the equatorial ionosphere above the South Pacific. These rockets were launched from [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands during a period of April 27 to May 10, 2013.

The principal investigator for this mission is Erhan Kudeki of the University of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sounding-rockets/news/evex.html Equatorial Vortex Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this experiment is to study what disrupts [[Radio waves]].

A NASA [[Terrier Oriole]] sounding rocket was launched at 3:39&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT on 7 May 2013 from Roi Namur, Republic of the Marshall Islands. Ninety seconds later a [[Terrier Malemute|Terrier-Improved Malemute]] sounding rocket also was launches successfully.

This experiment will help scientists better understand and predict the electrical storms in Earth's upper atmosphere. The electrical storms can interfere with satellite communication and global positioning signals. Payload for each rocket included two canisters of [[samarium]] and a dual frequency RF Beacon  ([[United States Naval Research Laboratory|NRL]] [[Coherent electromagnetic radio tomography|CERTO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ies2015.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/120-Caton-Slides.pdf Payloads used in experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two rockets released vapor clouds of lithium (trimethyl aluminum),and were observed from various locations in the area. All scientific instruments on the rockets worked as planned. These two rockets were the second and third rockets of four planned for launch during 2013's campaign in the Marshall Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112841173/second-third-sounding-rockets-launched-marshall-islands-050813/ Launching of 2nd and 3rd rockets]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, a Terrier-Improved Malemute two-stage sounding rocket was launched from NASA's [[Wallops Flight Facility]] in [[Virginia]]. The artificial clouds released by this rocket helped scientists track the movement of Earth's [[Ionosphere]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/37340-nasa-launch-makes-colorful-artificial-clouds.html NASA Sounding Rocket Releases Colorful Morning Cloud Show] - Retrieved from Space.com on 6 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eyach virus''''' (EYAV) is a viral infection (genus [[Coltivirus]]) in the [[Reoviridae]] family transmitted by a [[tick]] vector. It has been isolated from ''Ixodes ricinus'' and ''I. ventalloi'' ticks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Attoui|first=Houssam|last2=Jaafar|first2=Fauziah Mohd|last3=Micco|first3=Philippe de|last4=Lamballerie|first4=Xavier de|title=Coltiviruses and Seadornaviruses in North America, Europe, and Asia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1111.050868|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|language=en-us|volume=11|issue=11|pages=1673–1679|doi=10.3201/eid1111.050868|pmc=3367365|pmid=16318717}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[Colorado tick fever virus]], the type virus of Coltivirus.

== Transmission and clinical syndromes ==
Eyach virus is acquired by tick bite. The tick gets infected after a blood meal from a vertebrate host, which is suspected to be the European rabbit ''O. cunniculus.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chastel|first=C.|last2=Main|first2=A.

'''The Farm Animal Welfare Committee''' ('''FAWC''') is an independent advisory body established by the Government of [[Great Britain]] in 2011. It replaced the '''Farm Animal Welfare Council'''  which was an independent advisory body established in 1979. The Council published its Final Report before its closure and replacement on 31 March 2011.

==Farm Animal Welfare Council==
The Farm Animal Welfare Council terms of reference were to keep under review the welfare of [[livestock|farm animals]] on agricultural land, at market, in transit and at the place of slaughter and advise Government of any changes that may be necessary. The council comprised various Standing Committees and Working Groups that consulted widely and openly about the issues FAWC considered relevant to the welfare of farmed animals and to prepare recommendations for the Council's consideration. Once agreed, the recommendations formed the basis for advice given to Government. Copies of FAWC's Reports and other advice are available on the FAWC website.

The Council's major strength lay in its independence to investigate any topic falling within its remit and to communicate freely with outside bodies, including the [[European Commission]] and the public, while maintaining the independence to publish its advice.

The council also established the [[Five Freedoms]] for farm animals. These freedoms serve as a basic outline for regulations concerning livestock, poultry, etc.

'''Flaminio Baudi di Selve''' (7 July 1821, [[Savigliano]] – 26 June 1901, [[Genoa]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Coleoptera]] but also [[Heteroptera]].

He wrote Europae et circummediterraneae Faunae [[Tenebrionidae|Tenebrionidum]] specierum, quae Comes Dejean in suo Catalogo, editio 3, consignavit, ejusdem collectione in R. Taurinensi Musaeo asservata, cum auctorum hodierne recepta denominatione collatio. Pars tertia. ''Dtsch. Entomol. Z''. 20: 225-267  (1876), ''Catalogo dei coleotteri del Piemonte'' Torino, Tip. e. Lit. Camilla E. Bertolero (1889) and very many shorter works on beetles.He described many new [[species]].

His insect collection, mainly [[Palearctic]] is shared between [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova]], [[Turin Museum of Natural History]] and [[Museo Regionale di Scienze Naturali Regione Piemonte]]

Herbert Walter was born in [[Burke, Vermont]] in 1867.  He attended the Lyndon Institute, and then graduated from [[Bates College]] in Maine in 1892.  He next received a M.A. from [[Brown University]] in 1893 and then studied at the [[University of Freiburg]].  From 1894 to 1904 he taught biology. In 1906 He received a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]].  Walter came to Brown as assistant professor of biology. He was promoted to associate professor in 1913 and professor in 1923.  Walter published many books, including, ''Studies in Animal Life'', (1901), ''Genetics: An Introduction To the Study of Heredity'' (1913), ''The Human Skeleton'' (1913), and ''Biology of the Vertebrates''. With his wife, Alice Hall Lyndon, he wrote ''Wild Birds in City Parks''. Walter was director of research for the Federal Bureau of Fisheries at Woods Hole, and conducted a course in field zoology for teachers of biology at the Marine Biological Institute of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island. He was assistant director of the Institute from 1917 to 1926.  [[List of Brown University buildings|Walter Hall]] was named after the Professor in 1959 it is now home to the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology on the Brown campus at 80 Waterman Street.

== Background ==
ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance (IIJIF) is a reputable academic journal dedicated to publish high quality research in all the relevant fields of Islamic economics and finance. It is published by the [[International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance]] (ISRA), which has been vested the task to promote applied Shari’ah research in the niche area of Islamic finance. As part of its fervent devotion to Islamic finance, the publication of IIJIF is yet another endeavor of ISRA to further the excellence in leading scholastic as well as practical research.

IIJIF has been published since December 2009. It is a fully peer-reviewed and refereed journal, aiming at a wider readership interested to learn more about [[Islamic economics]], [[finance]] and other relevant disciplines. It aspires to publish original and unpublished work within the areas of, but not limited to, [[Sharia]] ([[Islamic law]]), [[Islamic economics]], banking, [[capital markets]], [[takaful]] ([[Islamic Insurance]]), etc.

IIJIF considers the research with academic rigour as a fuelling-factor for the development and growth of the Islamic finance industry. This consideration is reflected in the IIJIF’s section of ‘Academic Articles’. However, beside academic research, IIJIF also appreciates the significance of hands-on experience of the Islamic finance industry professionals and is keen to offer them an opportunity to share their ideas and views through its dedicated section of ‘Practitioners’ Article’. This section is devoted to publish the articles that are written by various industry players. In this way, each issue of IIJIF represents a fine blend of research from both academic and practical aspects. Moreover, it also introduces research work which is currently carried on by Islamic finance researchers in the section titled ‘Research Notes’.

IIJIF is published semi-annually (in June and December) in both printed and electronic forms. Each issue of IIJIF consists of 4 academic articles, 1 practitioners’ article and 5 research notes.

IIJIF has set high standards of publication ethics since its inception and has been observing the policy of ‘no compromise’ on ethics in publication. It conscientiously encourages integrity in research publication.

IIJIF enjoys the privilege of having a highly reputable International Editorial Advisory Board comprising renowned Shari’ah scholars and distinguished academics. It greatly benefits from those esteemed members in terms of their vast knowledge and experience. Those members contribute in IIJIF by refereeing the submitted articles; offering advice to the Editorial Committee; and contributing articles to IIJIF.

'''[[Physics]]''' (Greek: [[physis]]–φύσις meaning "nature") is the [[natural science]] which examines basic concepts such as [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], [[matter]]&lt;ref name = "feynman"&gt;[[R. P. Feynman]], [[R. B. Leighton]], [[Matthew Sands|M. Sands]] (1963), ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', {{ISBN|0-201-02116-1}} Hard-cover. p.1-1 Feynman begins with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms–little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" vol. '''I''' p. I–2&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and all that derives from these, such as [[energy]], [[force]] and [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1878), [https://books.google.com/books?id=noRgWP0_UZ8C&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=matter+and+motion&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 ''Matter and Motion'']. New York: D. Van Nostrand. p.1: "Nature of Physical Science–Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature." | accessdate=2008-11-04&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, it is the general analysis of [[nature]], conducted in order to understand how the [[world]] and [[universe]] behave.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Young &amp; R.A. Freedman, ''University Physics with Modern Physics'': 11th Edition: International Edition (2004), Addison Wesley. Chapter 1, section 1.1, page 2 has this to say: "Physics is an ''experimental'' science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns and principles that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical theories or, when they are very well established and of broad use, physical laws or principles." &lt;br&gt; Steve Holzner, ''Physics for Dummies'' (2006), Wiley. Chapter 1, page 7 says: "Physics is the study of your world and the world and universe around you." See [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0764554336 Amazon Online Reader: Physics For Dummies (For Dummies(Math &amp; Science))], retrieved 24 Nov 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">'''K correction''' is a correction to an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] object's [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] (or equivalently, its [[flux]]) that allows a measurement of a quantity of light from an object at a [[redshift]] ''z'' to be converted to an equivalent measurement in the [[rest frame]] of the object. If one could measure all the light from an object at all [[wavelength]]s (a bolometric flux), a K correction would not be required. If one measures the light emitted in an [[emission line]], a K-correction is not required. The need for a K-correction arises because an astronomical measurement through a single [[filter (optics)|filter]] or a single bandpass only sees a fraction of the total [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], redshifted into the frame of the observer. So if the observer wants to compare the measurements through a red filter of objects at different redshifts, the observer will have to apply estimates of the K corrections to these measurements to make a comparison.

One claim for the origin of the term "K correction" is [[Edwin Hubble]], who supposedly arbitrarily chose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; to represent the reduction factor in magnitude due to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effects of Red Shifts on the Distribution of Nebulae | authorlink=Edwin Hubble | first=Edwin | last=Hubble | date=1936 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=84 | pages=517–554 | doi=10.1086/143782 | bibcode=1936ApJ....84..517H| pmc=1076828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kinney et al., in footnote 7 on page 48 of their article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Template ultraviolet spectra to near-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and their application to K-corrections | first1=Anne | last1=Kinney | date=1996 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=467 | pages=38–60 | doi=10.1086/177583 | last2=Calzetti | first2=Daniela | last3=Bohlin | first3=Ralph C. | last4=McQuade | first4=Kerry | last5=Storchi-Bergmann | first5=Thaisa | last6=Schmitt | first6=Henrique R. | bibcode=1996ApJ...467...38K}}&lt;/ref&gt; note an earlier origin from [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]] (1918),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asna.19182061302 | first=V.C. | last=Wirtz | title=Über die Bewegungen der Nebelflecke | date=1918 | journal=[[Astronomische Nachrichten]] | volume=206 | issue=13 | pages=109|bibcode = 1918AN....206..109W }}&lt;/ref&gt; who referred to the correction as a ''Konstante'' (German for "constant"), hence K-correction.

The K-correction can be defined as follows

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1) - K_{Corr}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

I.E. the adjustment to the standard relationship between [[Absolute magnitude|absolute]] and [[Apparent magnitude|apparent]] magnitude required to correct for the redshift effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogg|first=David|title=The K Correction|url=http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminosity distance]] measured in [[parsecs]].

The exact nature of the calculation that needs to be applied in order to perform a K correction depends upon the type of filter used to make the observation and the shape of the object's spectrum. If multi-color [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements are available for a given object thus defining its spectral energy distribution ([[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]]), K corrections then can be computed by [[Curve fitting|fitting]] it against a theoretical or empirical [[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]] template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0606170|title=K-corrections and filter transformations in the ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared|journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]]|volume=133|issue=2|pages=734|bibcode=2007AJ....133..734B|author1=Blanton|first1=Michael R.|last2=Roweis|first2=Sam|date=2007|doi=10.1086/510127}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that K corrections in many frequently used broad-band filters for low-redshift [[Galaxy|galaxies]] can be precisely approximated using two-dimensional [[polynomial]]s as functions of a [[redshift]] and one observed [[Color index|color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1002.2360|title=Analytical approximations of K-corrections in optical and near-infrared bands|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=405|pages=1409|bibcode=2010MNRAS.405.1409C|author1=Chilingarian|first1=Igor V.|last2=Melchior|first2=Anne-Laure|last3=Zolotukhin|first3=Ivan Yu.|date=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is implemented in the K corrections calculator web-service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcor.sai.msu.ru|title=K-corrections calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kumeyaay astronomy or cosmology''' ([[Kumeyaay language|Kumeyaay]]: ''My Uuyow'', "sky knowledge") comprises the [[Astronomy|astronomical]] knowledge of  the [[Kumeyaay people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedges|first=K.|date=1981-01-01|title=Winter solstice observatory sites in Kumeyaay Territory, San Diego County, California.|bibcode=1981aram.conf..151H|pages=151–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deeply rooted cosmological belief system was developed and followed by the Kumeyaay civilization based on this knowledge including the computing of time (Kumeyaay Mat’taam).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.museumofman.org/exhibits/kumeyaay-native-californians/|title=Kumeyaay: Native Californians - San Diego Museum of Man|newspaper=San Diego Museum of Man|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first evidence of astronomical observations and visual registration was discovered in the [[El Vallecito]] archeological zone. The "Men in a square" rupestric painting located at El Diablito area of El Vallecito depicted a square that aligns with sunlight on the [[Equinox|Fall equinox]]. These paintings were made by the nomadic(?) Kumeyaay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/es/boletines/4995-el-inah-identifica-evento-arqueoastronomico-en-pintura-rupestre-de-el-vallecito|title=El INAH identifica evento arqueoastronómico en pintura rupestre de El Vallecito (INAH identified archeoastronomic event in cave paintings at El Vallecito)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.inah.gob.mx|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray A. Williamson|title=Living the Sky: The Cosmos of the American Indian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MryjN_Z8z0QC|year=1987|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|isbn=978-0-8061-2034-8| pages = 272–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumeyaay sand paintings and rock art modeled the passage of the sun, moon, and constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Carrico, (ed) ''Strangers in a Stolen Land: Indians of San Diego County from Prehistory to the New Deal'', Sunbelt Publications, 2008, {{ISBN|9780932653826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observation areas were made by the Kumeyaay to watch and register astronomical events. However many were destroyed by vandals before protection measures were instituted.&lt;ref&gt;As it can be read in the information card about Kumeyaay astronomy at the San Diego Museum of Man. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Atlantic&amp;ndash;Pacific crossover hurricane''' is a tropical cyclone that develops in the Atlantic Ocean and moves into the Pacific Ocean, or vice versa. Since reliable records began in 1851, a total of eighteen tropical cyclones have done this. It is more common for the remnants of a [[North Atlantic hurricane]] to redevelop into a different storm in the Pacific; in such a scenario, they are not considered the same system.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

===Other storms===
There were several other tropical cyclones that formed in one basin, dissipated, and re-developed. In addition, there were tropical cyclones that developed and entered another basin briefly or at a weak intensity, however, they were not recognized as an Atlantic-Pacific crossover hurricane. In chronological order from most recent to earliest, they are:
*The remnants of [[Hurricane Janet]] in [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season|1955]] later led to the formation of an unnamed tropical storm in the East Pacific on October&amp;nbsp;1;&lt;ref name=adv&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletins and Advisories Issued by Weather Bureau Airport Station, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Weather Bureau Office, Miami, Florida, and Weather Bureau Office, New Orleans, Louisiana on Hurricane "Janet"|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/hurricanes/Qc9452j26b81955.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=April 28, 2013|author=United States Department of Commerce|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; the newly generated tropical cyclone later brought rains to the southwestern United States.&lt;ref name="Tech Memo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effects of Tropical Cyclones on the Southwestern United States|journal=NOAA Technical Memorandum|date=August 1986|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NWS/NWS_WR/TM_NWS_WR_197.pdf|accessdate=July 1, 2013|publisher=National Weather Service Western Region}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hurricane Hattie]] in 1961 developed in the Atlantic, and crossed into the Pacific, eventually re-developing into Tropical Storm Simone in the Pacific. It also appeared that remnants of Simone re-emerged into the Atlantic basin to develop into Tropical Storm Inga. However, the viewpoint of U.S. Weather Bureau Office was that "the remnants of Hattie developed into neither Simone nor Inga.&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/090/mwr-090-03-0107.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1971 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Chloe|Tropical Storm Chloe]] in 1971 made landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula and dissipated soon after. Its remnants continued into the Eastern Pacific and developed into [[Hurricane Lily (1971)|Hurricane Lily]], which made landfall in southwest Mexico.
*[[Hurricane Cosme (1989)|Hurricane Cosme]] in 1989 crossed from the Pacific and dissipated over northern Mexico. Its remnants contributed to the development of [[Tropical Storm Allison (1989)|Tropical Storm Allison]] in the Atlantic.
*[[Tropical Storm Bret (1993)|Tropical Storm Bret]] from 1993 retained its circulation and was designated Tropical Depression Eight-E upon reaching the Pacific. The depression dissipated, reorganized, and became [[1993 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Greg|Hurricane Greg]].
*[[Tropical Depression Nine (2001)|Tropical Depression Nine]] in 2001 made landfall in Nicaragua and degenerated into a tropical wave. The wave later regenerated into a tropical depression that became [[Hurricane Juliette (2001)|Hurricane Juliette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence and Michelle M. Mainelli |publisher=National Hurricane Center |date=November 30, 2001 |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |title=Hurricane Juliette Tropical Cyclone Report |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001juliette.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006122021/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001juliette.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hurricane Iris]] of 2001 in the Atlantic Ocean triggered the formation of [[2001 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Manuel|Tropical Storm Manuel]] in the Pacific.
*[[Tropical Storm Earl (2004)|Tropical Storm Earl]] in 2004 dissipated in the southeast Caribbean Sea, but regenerated into [[2004 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Frank|Hurricane Frank]] in the East Pacific.
*[[Tropical Storm Alma]] of 2008 formed off of the West Coast of Costa Rica, made landfall in Nicaragua with speeds up to {{convert|100|km/h}}. The storm soon dissipated.  A day later the storm's remnants after encountering a pair of two [[tropical wave]]s regenerated on Nicaragua's east coast into [[Tropical Storm Arthur (2008)|Tropical Storm Arthur]] with sustained winds of {{convert|75|km/h|abbr=on}} and again made landfall in Nicaragua.  It is not considered as crossover over as the initial storm had dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al01/al012008.discus.001.shtml|title=Tropical Storm ARTHUR|website=www.nhc.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2012 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Ernesto|Hurricane Ernesto]] of 2012 developed near the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The system weakened to a low-pressure area in Mexico and its remnants moved into the eastern Pacific and developed into [[2012 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Hector|Tropical Storm Hector]].
*[[Hurricane Barbara (2013)|Hurricane Barbara]] of 2013 made landfall in southwest Mexico and dissipated before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The remnants of Barbara and a cyclonic gyre led to the formation of a broad area of low pressure, which later became [[Tropical Storm Andrea (2013)|Tropical Storm Andrea]] over the central Gulf of Mexico.
*[[Tropical Storm Trudy (2014)|Tropical Storm Trudy]] of 2014 made landfall in southern [[Mexico]], its remnants emerged into the Bay of Campeche and subsequently developed into [[Tropical Storm Hanna (2014)|Tropical Storm Hanna]] in the Atlantic.
*The remnant moisture from [[Hurricane Earl (2016)|Hurricane Earl]] of 2016 interacted with a disturbance on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which contributed to the formation of [[2016 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Javier|Tropical Storm Javier]] in the eastern Pacific.
*The remnants of [[Tropical Storm Bret (2017)|Tropical Storm Bret]] of 2017 traversed over Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific, which led to the formation of [[2017 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Dora|Hurricane Dora]].
*Also in 2017, [[Hurricane Franklin]] made landfall in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]]; its remnants moved across Mexico during the following day and emerged into the eastern Pacific, later developing into [[2017 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm|Tropical Storm Jova]].
*Later that year, [[Hurricane Katia (2017)|Hurricane Katia]] made landfall in Mexico and was then downgraded to a remnant low; its remnants crossed into the Pacific Ocean, where it regenerated into [[2017 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Otis|Hurricane Otis]].

==Naming conventions==
{{main|History of tropical cyclone naming}}
Prior to 2000, storms were renamed after crossing from the Gulf of Mexico into the Eastern Pacific. At the 22nd hurricane committee in 2000 it was decided that tropical cyclones that moved from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed.&lt;ref name="HC 2000"&gt;{{cite report |format=PDF |url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Reports/FINAL%20REP-2000-HC-22.pdf |title=RA IV Hurricane Committee 24th Session |type=Final Report |date=2000 |archivedate=June 30, 2013 |author=RA IV Hurricane Committee |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HlyVPYLf?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030519153637/http%3A//www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Reports/FINAL%20REP-2000-HC-22.pdf |page=5 |accessdate=April 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Otto (2016)|Hurricane Otto]] in 2016 was the first storm to cross from one basin to another to apply under this rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32320">Forty-nine of the fifty [[U.S. state]]s that make up the [[United States|United States of America]] have one or more '''state songs''', which are selected by each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and/or state governor, as a symbol (or emblem) of that particular U.S. state. [[New Jersey]] has no official state song, while [[Virginia]]'s previous state song, "[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]", adopted in 1940,&lt;ref name="RJo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Roger R.|title=State Songs|url=http://www.welcometoamerica.us/info/songs.html|publisher=Welcome to America|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was rescinded due to its racist language by the [[Virginia General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.virginiastatesong.com/ | title= Official State Song of the Commonwealth of Virginia | accessdate= 2007-02-06 | year= 2006 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070429004929/http://www.virginiastatesong.com/ | archive-date= 2007-04-29 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, "[[Our Great Virginia]]" was made the new state song of Virginia.&lt;ref name="Patch"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/listen-virginia-now-has-2-state-songs | title= Listen: Virginia Now Has 2 State Songs | accessdate= 2015-04-02 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. states have more than one official state song, and may refer to some of their official songs by other names; for example, [[Arkansas]] officially has two state songs, plus a state anthem, and a state historical song. [[Tennessee]] has the most state songs, with 9 official state songs and an official bicentennial rap.

[[Arizona]] has a song that was written specifically as a state anthem in 1915, as well as the 1981 country hit "Arizona", which it adopted as the alternate state anthem in 1982.&lt;ref name=RJo/&gt;

Two individuals, [[Stephen Foster]], and [[John Denver]], have written or co-written two state songs. Foster's two state songs, "[[Old Folks at Home]]" (better known as "Swanee Ribber" or "Suwannee River") (for adopted by Florida), and "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" are among the best-known songs in the U.S. On March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit "Rocky Mountain High" one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, "Where the Columbines Grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official State Song|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm |accessdate=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make Denver's "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" one of four official state songs of West Virginia. Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed the resolution into law on March 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm|title=Colorado State Song Rocky Mountain High composed by John Denver|author=|date=|website=www.netstate.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other well-known state songs include "[[Yankee Doodle]]", "[[You Are My Sunshine]]", "[[Rocky Top]]", and "[[Home on the Range]]"; a number of others are popular standards, including "[[Oklahoma]]!" (from the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical), [[Hoagy Carmichael]]'s "[[Georgia on My Mind]]", "[[Tennessee Waltz]]", "[[Missouri Waltz]]", and "[[On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away]]". Many of the others are much less well-known, especially outside the state.

Maryland ("[[Maryland, My Maryland]]") and Iowa ("[[The Song of Iowa]]") use the tune from the song "[[O Tannenbaum]]" as the melody to their official state songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-state-song-20160315-story.html "Maryland, my meh song"], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Baltimore, 15 March 2016.

;[[Apgar score]]
:Invented in 1952 by [[Virginia Apgar]].

;[[Disposable diapers]]
The first disposable diaper was invented in 1946 by [[Marion Donovan]], a professional-turned-housewife who wanted to ensure her children's cloth diapers remained dry while they slept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Blattman | first = Elissa | title = "Three Every-day Items Invented by Women" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2013 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/three-every-day-items-invented-women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan patented her design (called 
'Boaters') in 1951. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years, until Procter &amp; Gamble used Donovan's design ideas to create [[Pampers]].

Another diaper design was created by [[Valerie Hunter Gordon]] (née de Ferranti), who patented it in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Paddi|publisher=paddi.org.uk|url=http://www.paddi.org.uk/Paddi-History.php|accessdate=August 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404192409/http://www.paddi.org.uk/Paddi-History.php|archivedate=April 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC – Radio4|title=Home truth – Nappy days|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/20050228_nappy_inventor.shtml|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

;[[Pertussis]]
:A pioneering female American [[Physician|doctor]], [[medical researcher]] and an outspoken voice in the pediatric community, the supercentenarian [[Leila Alice Denmark]] (1898–2012) is credited as co-developer of the [[pertussis]] (whooping cough) [[vaccine]].

==Astronomy and astrophysics==
;[[Stellar classification#Harvard spectral classification|Harvard Stellar Classification Scheme]]
:The first classification of stars based on their temperature, created by [[Annie Jump Cannon]], used in publications up to 1924.

;[[Pulsars]]
:Rapidly rotating [[neutron star]]s discovered by [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] in 1967.

;[[galaxy rotation problem|The Galaxy Rotation Problem]]
:A major piece of evidence for the presence of [[dark matter]] in the Universe, discovered by [[Vera Rubin]] from observations of galactic [[rotation curves]] in the 1970s.

;[[Stars]] [[luminosity]]
:[[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] was an American astronomer who discovered the relation between the [[luminosity]] and the [[period (physics)|period]] of [[Cepheid]] [[variable stars]] at the beginning of 20th century.

;[[Radio astronomy]]
:[[Ruby Violet Payne-Scott]] was an Australian pioneer in [[radiophysics]] and [[radio astronomy]] as well as the first female [[radio astronomer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Under the radar : the first woman in radio astronomy : Ruby Payne-Scott|date=2010|author1=Goss, W. M. (William Miller)|author2=McGee, Richard X|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-03140-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovering Type I and Type III solar radio bursts.

;[[Stars]] are  primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
:[[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] found in her 1925 PhD thesis that stars are primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].  Thus, her thesis established that hydrogen is the most abundant [[Chemical element|element]] in the Universe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

:When Payne's dissertation was reviewed, astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]] dissuaded her from concluding that the composition of the Sun was predominantly hydrogen and thus very different from that of the Earth, as it contradicted the accepted wisdom at the time. She consequently described the result in her thesis as "spurious".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=We Need to Talk About Kelvin|last=Chown|first=Marcus|publisher=faber and faber|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=99–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell realized she was correct four years later after having derived the same result by different means and publishing it in 1929. He acknowledged Payne's work and discovery admiringly in his paper but he is often credited for the conclusions they both reached.&lt;ref name='russell'&gt;

;[[Radiation]]
:[[Marie Curie]] (born Maria Salomea Skłodowska) was the first woman to receive a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] prize for her works on [[radiations]] and, up until today,{{when|date=May 2018|maybe use an {{as of}} template?}} the only woman to receive two Nobel prizes (among them, one Nobel prize in [[chemistry]] for discoveries on [[Polonium]] and [[Radium]]). She is the sole [[laureate]] to be recognized within two distinct [[scientific]] areas.

: [[Fanny Gates]] further investigated the properties of radiation.  Together with [[Ernest Rutherford]], she amassed evidence that radioactivity was not the result of any simple chemical or physical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in chemistry : their changing roles from alchemical times to the mid-twentieth century|last=F.|first=Rayner-Canham, Marelene|date=1998|publisher=American Chemical Society|others=Rayner-Canham, Geoffrey.|isbn=978-0841235229|location=Washington, DC|oclc=38886653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Gates showed that radioactivity could not be destroyed by heat or ionization due to chemical reactions, and that radioactive materials differ from phosphorescent [[materials]] both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;

;[[Hearing the shape of a drum| You can't hear the shape of a drum. ]]

In 1966 [[Mark Kac]] asked whether the shape of a drum could be determined by the sound it makes (whether a [[Riemannian manifold]]

[[John Milnor]] observed that a theorem due to Witt implied the existence of a pair of 16-dimensional tori that have the same spectrum but different shapes. However, the problem in two dimensions remained open until 1992, when [[Carolyn S. Gordon]] with coauthors [[David Webb (mathematician)|Webb]] and Wolpert, constructed a pair of regions in the Euclidean plane that have different shapes but identical eigenvalues  (see figure on right). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-199706|title=American Mathematical Society|website=www.ams.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[QR algorithm]]

In [[numerical linear algebra]], the '''QR algorithm''' is an [[eigenvalue algorithm]]: that is, a procedure to calculate the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The QR algorithm was developed in the late 1950s by [[John G. F. Francis]] and by [[Vera N. Kublanovskaya]], working independently.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.F.

;[[recursion theory|Recursion Theory]]

[[Rózsa Péter]] was one of the founders of [[recursion theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], of [[computer science]], and of the [[theory of computation]] that originated in the 1930s with the study of [[computable function]]s and [[Turing degree]]s. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, recursion theory overlaps with [[proof theory]] and [[effective descriptive set theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Morris|first1=Edie|last2=Harkleroad|first2=Leon|title=Rózsa Péter: recursive function theory's founding mother|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|date=1990|volume=12|issue=1|pages=59–64|doi=10.1007/BF03023988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rozsa Peter: Founder of Recursive Function Theory|url=http://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/peter.html|website=Women in Science: A Selection of 16 Contributors|publisher=San Diego Supercomputer Center|accessdate=23 August 2017|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Hilbert's tenth problem]]

'''Hilbert's tenth problem''' is the tenth on the [[Hilbert's problems|list of mathematical problems]] that the German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed in 1900.  It is the challenge to provide a general [[algorithm]] which, for any given [[Diophantine equation]] (a [[polynomial]] equation with [[integer]] coefficients and a finite number of unknowns) can decide whether the equation has a solution with all unknowns taking integer values. 

For example, the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;3x^2-2xy-y^2z-7=0&lt;/math&gt; has an integer solution: &lt;math&gt;x=1,\ y=2,\ z=-2&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt; has no such solution.

Hilbert's tenth problem has been solved, and it has a negative answer: such a general algorithm does not exist. This is the result of combined work of [[Martin Davis]], [[Yuri Matiyasevich]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Julia Robinson]] which spans 21 years, with Yuri Matiyasevich completing the theorem in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Barry Cooper]], ''Computability theory'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is now known as [[Matiyasevich's theorem]] or the MRDP theorem.

;[[Optimal design]]
In the [[design of experiments]], '''optimal designs''' (or '''optimum designs'''&lt;ref&gt;The adjective "optimum" (and not "optimal") "is the slightly older form in English and avoids the construction 'optim(um) + al´—there is no 'optimalis' in Latin" (page x in ''Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS'', by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias).&lt;/ref&gt;) are a class of [[design of experiments|experimental designs]] that are [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] with respect to some [[statistical theory|statistical]] [[objective function|criterion]]. The creation of this field of statistics has been credited to Danish statistician [[Kirstine Smith]].&lt;ref name=GL2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guttorp |first=P. |last2=Lindgren |first2=G. |title= Karl Pearson and the Scandinavian school of statistics |journal= International Statistical Review |volume=77 |year=2009 |page=64 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00069.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.8328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KS1918&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Kirstine |title=On the standard deviations of adjusted and interpolated values of an observed polynomial function and its constants and the guidance they give towards a proper choice of the distribution of observations |journal=Biometrika |volume=12 |year=1918 |page=1 |doi=10.2307/2331929|jstor=2331929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Three-gap theorem]]
The three-gap theorem states that if one places ''n'' points on a circle, at angles of ''&amp;theta;'', 2''&amp;theta;'', 3''&amp;theta;'' ... from the starting point, then there will be at most three distinct distances between pairs of points in adjacent positions around the circle. When there are three distances, the larger of the three always equals the sum of the other two.{{r|automatic}} Unless ''&amp;theta;'' is a rational multiple of {{pi}}, there will also be at least two distinct distances.

This result was conjectured by [[Hugo Steinhaus]], and proved in the 1950s by [[Vera T. Sós]], {{ill|János Surányi|hu|Surányi János (matematikus)}}, and [[Stanisław Świerczkowski]]. Its applications include the study of plant growth and musical tuning systems, and the theory of [[Sturmian word]]s. &lt;ref name=sos&gt;{{citation

;[[Noether normalization lemma]]

The Noether normalization lemma is a result of [[commutative algebra]], introduced by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that for any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', and any [[Finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] commutative [[algebra over a field|''k''-algebra]] ''A'', there exists a nonnegative integer ''d'' and [[algebraically independent]] elements ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' 
such that ''A'' is a finitely generated module over  the polynomial ring ''S'':=''k''[''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;].

The theorem has a geometric interpretation. Suppose ''A'' is integral. Let ''S'' be the [[coordinate ring]] of the ''d''-dimensional [[affine space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb A^d_k&lt;/math&gt;, and ''A'' as the coordinate ring of some other ''d''-dimensional [[affine variety]] ''X''.  Then the [[inclusion map]] ''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A'' induces a surjective [[finite morphism]] of [[affine varieties]] &lt;math&gt;X\to \mathbb A^d_k&lt;/math&gt;. The conclusion is that any [[affine variety]] is a [[branched covering]] of affine space.

The [[Noether normalization lemma]] is an important step to proving Hilbert's [[Nullstellensatz]].

;[[Noether's theorem]]

'''Noether's''' ('''first''')&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Noether's second theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''theorem''' states that every [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of the [[action (physics)|action]] of a physical system has a corresponding [[conservation law]]. The theorem was proven by mathematician [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and published in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noether E | year = 1918 | title = Invariante Variationsprobleme | journal = Nachr. D. König. Gesellsch. D. Wiss. Zu Göttingen, Math-phys. Klasse | volume = 1918 | pages = 235–257 |url= https://eudml.org/doc/59024}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a special case was proven by [[Eugène_Cosserat|E. Cosserat]] &amp; [[François_Cosserat|F. Cosserat]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cosserat E., Cosserat F. |year = 1909 | title = Théorie des corps déformables | publisher = Hermann | place = Paris | url = http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=06420001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of a physical system is the [[time integral|integral over time]] of a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function (which may or may not be an [[integral over space]] of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density function]]), from which the system's behavior can be determined by the [[principle of least action]].

Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. A generalization of the formulations on [[constants of motion]] in Lagrangian and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g. systems with a [[Lagrangian_mechanics#Extensions_to_include_non-conservative_forces|Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative]] systems with [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] need not have a corresponding conservation law.

Noether's theorem can be stated informally

{{quote|If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thompson, W.J. |title=Angular Momentum: an illustrated guide to rotational symmetries for physical systems |publisher=Wiley |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-471-55264-2 |volume=1 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O25fXV4z0B0C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;[[Noether's second theorem]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], '''Noether's second theorem''' relates symmetries of an [[action (physics)|action]] [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] with a system of [[differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |last=Noether  |first=Emmy  |year=1918  |title=Invariante Variationsprobleme  |url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Invariante_Variationsprobleme  |journal=Nachr.

;[[isomorphism theorems]]

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[abstract algebra]], the '''isomorphism theorems''' are three [[theorem]]s that describe the relationship between [[quotient]]s, [[homomorphism]]s, and [[subobject]]s.  Versions of the theorems exist for [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[vector space]]s, [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[Lie algebra]]s, and various other [[algebraic structure]]s.  In [[universal algebra]], the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.

The isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by [[Emmy Noether]] in her paper ''Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern'' which was published in 1927 in [[Mathematische Annalen]].  Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of [[Richard Dedekind]] and previous papers by Noether.

Three years later, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. van der Waerden]] published his influential ''Algebra,'' the first [[abstract algebra]] textbook that took the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]-[[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]-[[Field (mathematics)|fields]] approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on [[group theory]] and [[Emil Artin]] on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], [[Otto Schreier]], and van der Waerden himself on [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called ''homomorphism theorem'', and ''two laws of isomorphism'' when applied to groups, appear explicitly.

;[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Lasker–Noether theorem''' states that every [[Noetherian ring]] is a '''Lasker ring''', which means that every ideal can be decomposed as an intersection, called '''primary decomposition''', of finitely many ''[[primary ideal]]s'' (which are related to, but not quite the same as, powers of [[prime ideal]]s).  The theorem was first proven by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emanuel Lasker|first=Emanuel|last= Lasker|year= 1905}} for the special case of [[polynomial ring]]s and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emmy Noether|first=Emmy |last=Noether|year= 1921}}.

The Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and more generally the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem plays an important role in [[algebraic geometry]], by asserting that every [[algebraic set]] may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of [[irreducible component]]s.

;[[Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem]]

In [[algebraic number theory]], the '''Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem''' states that a [[central simple algebra]] over an [[algebraic number field]] ''K'' which splits over every [[local field|completion]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[matrix ring|matrix algebra]] over ''K''. The theorem is an example of a [[local-global principle]] in [[algebraic number theory]] and 
leads to a complete description of finite-dimensional [[division algebras]] over algebraic number fields in terms of their [[Hasse invariant of an algebra|local invariants]]. It was proved independently by [[Richard Brauer]], [[Helmut Hasse]], and [[Emmy Noether]] and by [[Abraham Adrian Albert]].

[[Verrucous carcinoma]] is a type of [[squamous cell carcinoma]] that may be associated with HPV infection (may be subtypes 16 or 18, but types 6 and 11 have also been reported, as have HPV negative variants).  Several subtypes of verrucous carcinoma have been described.  Treatment of verrucous carcinoma with radiation therapy should be avoided due to the risk of anaplastic transformation.

The '''M2''' is a [[motorway]] in [[Kent]], England.  It is 25.7 miles (41.4&amp;nbsp;km) long and acts as a bypass of the section of the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]] which runs through the [[Medway Towns]], [[Sittingbourne]] and [[Faversham]]. It provides an alternative route to the port of Dover, supplementing that of the M20.

==Route==
The M2 starts west of [[Strood]], Kent at Three Crutches, diverging southeastwards from the A2 road that heads [[boxing the compass|ESE]] from Central London, one of five roads of dual carriageway width or greater reaching into the southern half of Greater London. From Junction 1 it has four lanes each way that slope into the [[Medway Valley]] south of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. On the west bank of the [[River Medway]] is Junction 2 intersecting the [[A228 road|A228]] between Strood and [[West Malling]], a junction where the master exit roundabout passes under the [[HS1]] track and which retains, by footbridge and tunnel, the [[North Downs Way]] (a public footpath).

By this point the road is mounted on the [[Medway Viaduct]], passing over the [[Medway Valley Line|Medway Valley]] railway and the river.  On the east (right) [[bank (geography)|bank]] are Wouldham marshes, south, and north are the elevated suburbs of the three conjoined [[Medway Towns]] including [[Borstal, Kent|Borstal]], a village nationally synonymous with its prototype [[HM Prison Rochester|1902-founded Young Offenders' Institution]].

The M2 ascends a steep stream valley to [[Blue Bell Hill]] (under which HS1 runs in tunnel) using split-levels to reach Junction 3 (for Medway Towns &amp; [[Maidstone]]) by [[Walderslade]]. It takes the north of the [[escarpment]] of the [[North Downs]] becoming a conventional three lanes, and runs northeast across Cossington Fields, Westfield Sole, [[Lidsing]], and [[Bredhurst]] towards Junction 4 where the road becomes two lanes to Junction 7.

Continuing east, passing Medway Service area, it crosses the [[A249 road|A249]] over the Stockbury Viaduct at Junction 5 (for [[Sheerness]] and Maidstone East).  It then takes the unusually gentle coastal lower slopes of the North Downs, below which {{convert|2|mi}} before its end, is [[Faversham]] north of Junction 6. It ends at Junction 7, allowing traffic to continue on either of two dual carriageways: the [[A299 road|A299]] for six coastal towns including four on [[Thanet District|Thanet]] or the upgraded [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] towards [[Canterbury]] and [[Dover]] as far as [[Lydden]], {{convert|2|mi}} from the edge of Dover which then mainly reduces to one operational lane each way.

==History==

===Original construction===

[[File:M2 motorway junction 5.jpg|thumb|right|Junction 5 of the M2]]
[[File:M2 Motorway, Kent - 010613.jpg|thumb|right|The widened section approaching the lane drop at Junction 4]]

The initial section of the motorway (junctions 2 to 5) was opened by the then Transport Minister [[Ernest Marples]] on 29 May 1963,&lt;ref name="ha201305"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/press-releases/golden-anniversary-for-the-m2/|title=Golden anniversary for the M2|publisher=[[Highways Agency]]|accessdate=29 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831230251/http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/press-releases/golden-anniversary-for-the-m2/|archive-date=31 August 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder being constructed in 1965. It was opened in three stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m2/timeline.shtml |title=Motorway Database – M2 Timeline |publisher=CBRD |accessdate=27 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212023335/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m2/timeline.shtml |archivedate=12 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Junctions 2 to 5 in 1963
*Junctions 5 to 7 in 1965

It was planned to extend the M2 to London and Dover, making it the main route between London and the [[English channel|channel]] [[port]]s, but this extension never materialised due to a lack of traffic demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jul/15/m2-dover|title=M2, Dover|author=[[Michael Heseltine]]|date=15 July 1970|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the A2 was dualled and improved from Brenley Corner to Dover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1970/jul/15/m2-motorway-brenley-corner-dover|title=M2 Motorway (Brenley Corner – Dover)|author=[[Michael Heseltine]]|date=15 July 1970|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1970/dec/16/m2-motorway-extension|title=M2 Motorway (Extension)|author=[[Michael Heseltine]]|date=16 December 1970|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The M2 was originally to be designated as the A2(M), but as a result of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reporting it as the M2, the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] adopted this, and later decided upon the [[M20 motorway|M20]] designation for the main London-Channel Ports link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathetic.org.uk/features/numbering/part3.shtml |title=Copy of Civili Service minute |publisher=Pathetic Motorways |accessdate=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m2/ |title=Motorway Database » M2 |publisher=CBRD |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junction amendments===
Aside from retrofitting central crash barriers, like all early motorways, the alignment of the M2 did not significantly change until the late 1990s. Traffic using it decreased when the [[M20 motorway|M20]] was completed from London to [[Folkestone]] in May 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1995/oct/16/road-schemes#column_77w|title=Road Schemes|date=16 October 1995|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the M2 continued to Canterbury and the North [[Kent]] ports of Sheerness and Ramsgate. Junction 1 was altered when the [[A289 road|A289]] ''Wainscott Northern bypass'' was built in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2002/oct/21/new-road-schemes|title=New Road Schemes|date=21 October 2002|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widening===
The M2 was still busy between Junctions 1 and 4, and suffered from HGVs blocking the outside lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1980/jul/22/m2-heavy-vehicles|title=M2 (Heavy Vehicles)|author=[[Kenneth Clarke]]|date=22 July 1980|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 work began on widening the M2 from two lanes to four lanes. A joint venture between [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Skanska]] and [[Mowlem]] (CSM) created the company that would undertake the project. The project required the redesign of Junction 2 and Junction 3, and a second Medway Bridge. The existing bridge was converted to a four lane eastbound carriageway (including a hard shoulder). The new bridge formed the westbound carriageway. The entire stretch was lit with [[Street light|streetlights]] (the old section was not lit). The old Medway Bridge was physically narrowed by removing part of the footpath. High-pressure water cutting equipment was used to cut the concrete into manageable sections for disposal. There is only one path open to the public now.

Spoil from the [[North Downs Tunnel]] was used to form the new embankment for the London bound traffic between Junction 2 and the Nashenden Valley.

The widening was completed in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4028.aspx |title=Route Management Stratergy – A2/M2/A249 |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=27 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926071817/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4028.aspx |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service area===
The M2 opened with a single service area between Junctions 4 and 5, named Farthing Corner Services and operated by Top Rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1964/feb/17/motorways-catering-facilities#column_985|title=Motorways (catering facilities)|date=17 February 1964|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the services are known as [[Medway services]] and are operated under the Moto brand with a Travelodge hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorwayservices.info/medway_services_m2|title=Medway Services M2|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The services have an access road to the local network for service and delivery vehicles that is not, like some [[motorway service area]]s, restricted with a gate or barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goo.gl/maps/dMj11|title=Google Maps : Medway Services (Streetview)|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to local businesses using the services as an unofficial exit from the motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartlipplace.co.uk/Directions%20to%20hartlip%20Place.html|title=Directions to Hartlip Place|year=2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junctions==
Data from [[driver location signs]] are used to provide distance (in kilometres) and carriageway identifier information. Where junctions extend over several hundred metres and the data are available, values are given for the start and end points of the junction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''Master of IT in Business (MITB)''' is a master's degree emphasizing on the application of [[information technology]] to create business impact and value. The MITB degree originated in the early [[21st century]] as the [[digital transformation]] of businesses took place leaving industries to compete with each other on their technological capacity and advancement. The MITB is typically a sandwich course of two distinct horizontals targeted at providing a holistic view and understanding of both [[technology]] and [[management]] alike. The MITB offers a more specialized and niche course selection for [[technology]] and [[business]] education aspirants alike. Students on completion of such degrees typically pursue careers in various verticals leveraging [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbs.rutgers.edu/ |title=Rutgers MBS |publisher=Rutgers University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jcu.edu.sg/courses-and-study/courses/course/master-of-information-technology-business-informatics |title=James Cook MITBI |publisher=James Cook University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgrad.com.sg/master-of-it-in-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109110054/http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/mc200/#pageId=overview |title=RMIT MBIT |publisher=RMIT University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/programs-courses/postgraduate-coursework/agsm-master-business-technology-mbt |title=UNSW MBT |publisher=UNSW |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many programs base their admission decisions in a very similar fashion to the [[MBA]] programs, on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work, and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole. The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MITB programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MITB programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission.

The '''Neelanjali Ruby''', at 1,370 [[Carat (unit)|carats]] (274 g), is the world's largest double-star [[ruby]].

A ruby is known as a star ruby if it contains an [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] (distinctive star-shaped light refraction) in the gem. The Neelanjali Ruby is the world's largest star ruby with a 12-point asterism, which is commonly denoted as a double-star ruby.

The ''Neelanjali'' ruby, along with the Rajarathna ruby'','' was used as a [[Shiva lingam]] and was worshipped for centuries in the home of the family which owned it. The ruby belongs to G. Vidyaraj, the scion of the [[Aravidu dynasty]] which was the last of the four imperial lineages to rule the [[Vijayanagara empire]]. It is reported to be in safe keeping in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].

'''Panguana''' is a biological [[research station]], founded in 1968 and since 2011 it is also a private [[protected area|conservation area]] extending over almost 10&amp;nbsp;km² of tropical primary forest in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="Panguana"&gt;[http://www.panguana.com Panguana web page]. Retrieved on 20 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and Biodiversity==

Panguana is located in the low land [[rainforest]] at the western foothill of the [[El Sira Communal Reserve|El Sira]] mountain range east to the Andes. It was named after a common native [[tinamou]] species (''[[Crypturellus undulatus]]''). The station is located at 230 m asl next to the Rio [[Yuyapichis District|Yuyapichis]], a tributary to the Rio [[Pachitea Province|Pachitea]]. It can be accessed by crossing the Pachitea at the village of [[Yuyapichis District|Yuyapichis]] and a 1 1/2h foot march over pastures and through forests or a 2h boat ride upstream the Rio [[Yuyapichis District|Yuyapichis]].&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BdW"&gt;[http://www.bild-der-wissenschaft.de/bdw/bdwlive/heftarchiv/index2.php?object_id=32705136 Gunnar Henze - "Paradies Panguana"]. Bild der Wissenschaft 08/2011. Retrieved on 20 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The research area terrain is slightly hilly and contains various water bodies, non-flooded terra firme, swamp, alluvial and secondary forests, and also some plantations and pastures in the western border areas. 
	
In the east, the area borders the territory of the indigenous people of the [[Asháninka]]. Their area stretches to the [[El Sira Communal Reserve|Sira]] mountains, which are about 40&amp;nbsp;km away and almost 2500 m high. It is only extensively used and largely covered by primary rainforest. About 4&amp;nbsp;km east of the station is a central village of the people with a school, where the [[Asháninka]] children from the area go to. Panguana supports this school to teach the local people the value of their rainforest.
	
The annual average temperature is 24.5&amp;nbsp;°C, but temperatures of over 40&amp;nbsp;°C or more are quite frequent during the [[dry season]] (May - September).&lt;ref name="Römbke"&gt;J. Römbke, M. Verhaagh: ''About earthworm communities in a rain forest and an adjacent pasture in Peru''. Amazoniana 1992, 12:29-49, cited after Rainer Hutterer, Manfred Verhaagh, Juliane Diller, Richard Podloucky: ''An inventory of mammals observed at Panguana biological station, Amazonian Peru'' Ecotropica 1995/1&lt;/ref&gt; Annual [[precipitation]] amounts to 2,000 to 3,000&amp;nbsp;mm with around 180 rain days.&lt;ref name="Römbke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt; The [[rainy season]] usually extends from October to April, followed by a [[dry season]].&lt;ref name="Römbke"/&gt; Within the forest, there is a constant [[humidity]] of about 90% throughout the year.&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt;
	
Large parts of the Panguana conservation area are still covered by primary Amazon rainforest, and thus show a very high [[biodiversity]], which has been explored only fragmentarily. So far, 500 [[tree]] [[species]] and 16 species of [[Palm (plant)|palm]] trees were identified on an area of 2 square kilometers, and over 670 different [[vertebrates]], including 360 [[bird]], 115 [[mammalian]], 78 [[reptile]], 76 [[amphibian]] and 34 [[fish]] species were documented.&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt; In the 1980s, the head of the station studied the 52 [[bat]] species found in Panguana. Meanwhile, 57 species are known. For comparison, there are only about 27 bat species documented for [[Europe]], and  only around 254 breeding [[birds]] live all over [[Germany]] with an area of around 357,000&amp;nbsp;km². The [[insect]] [[fauna]] is extraordinarily rich in diversity and only known in the beginning. Manfred Verhaagh from the [http://www.smnk.de/en/ State Museum of Natural History] in [[Karlsruhe]] was able to find about 500 species of [[ants]] in Panguana, which is one of the highest number of species recorded worldwide.&lt;ref name="Verhaagh"&gt;Verhaagh, M. 1986 ''Panguana - Wald und Wasser im tropischen Südamerika'', {{ISBN|3-925631-05-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 250 [[butterfly]] species have been found. Moths and small butterflies that have so far hardly been explored are estimated to be between 10,000 and 12,000 species.&lt;ref name="BdW"/&gt;

==Research station==
[[File:Panguana-Camp-2008-1.jpg|thumb|View of the station in 2008, meanwhile new buildings were added.]]

The aim of the [[research station]] Panguana is to explore the [[biodiversity]] of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and study their ecological relationships. In addition, a unique [[ecosystem]] is protected and preserved.
	
Through continuous scientific work, the diverse flora and fauna can be explored, systematically assigned and the different ways of life and biological relationships documented. Numerous diploma and doctoral studies were made in Panguana and many international expeditions were held there. To date, more than 180 scientific [[publications]] have been published on the research results in this area.&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt; After consultation with the head of the station, [[Juliane Diller]], scientists can work at the research station Panguana.
	
For better observation, over 20&amp;nbsp;km of paths were cut into the jungle. The station has three guest houses with a laboratory for about 14 people, a round house for dinning and workshops, several boats and a [[photovoltaic]] system for electricity and the operation of a well pump. By now, even an internet connection via wifi is available. It is guarded and supervised by the owner of the neighboring farm Carlos Vásquez "Moro" Módena, and his family.&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Panguana-1971.jpg|thumb|The Panguana station in the year 1971]]

The biological research station Panguana was founded in 1968 by the biologists [[Maria Koepcke]] and [[Hans-Wilhelm Koepcke]] &lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt; and was originally only designed for a period of 5 years of field research.&lt;ref name="Römbke"/&gt; As accommodation originally served a wooden cabin, which was abandoned by locals. It was standing on stilts, with a roof of palm leaves (see picture) and an additional kitchen hut next to it. Later it was replaced by a larger house and another was added.&lt;ref name="Panguana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Verhaagh"/&gt; Since 2000, her daughter, [[Juliane Diller]], has been running the station.&lt;ref name="BdW"/&gt; In her absence, the manager, Moro, is her representative.&lt;ref&gt;Juliane Koepcke, ''Als ich vom Himmel fiel'' Malik, München 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-8902-9389-9}}, S. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, there has been a co-operation between the Zoological State Collection Munich, where [[Juliane Diller]] works, and the Natural History Museum in Lima, Peru.&lt;ref name="aviso"&gt;Juliane Diller, Ernst-Gerhard Burmeister, ''Panguana – ein peruanischer Vogelname für eine bayerische Urwaldforschungsstation'', aviso 2007-01, S. 46–49&lt;/ref&gt; Through sponsoring by the "[[Hofpfisterei]]" in [[Munich]], the area of the station has been enlarged several times over the past few years by the acquisition of adjacent lands.&lt;ref name="Panguana"/&gt;
	
In the 1970s, [[Hans-Wilhelm Koepcke]]'s unsuccessfully tried to promote Panguana as a nature conservation area&lt;ref name="BdW"/&gt; and in 1972 the area became an official scientific research area (zona de estudio científico del Ministerio de Agricultura, Direccíon forestal, de caza y Tierras).&lt;ref name="Hutterer"&gt;Rainer Hutterer, Manfred Verhaagh, Juliane Diller, Richard Podloucky: ''An inventory of mammals observed at Panguana biological station, Amazonian Peru'' Ecotropica 1995/1&lt;/ref&gt; Finally at the end of 2011, the newly created Peruvian Ministry of Environment declared Panguana as a private conservation area (Area de Conservación Privada) in order to protect the area permanently from clearing, hunting and colonization.&lt;ref name="Panguana" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacetajuridica.com.pe/servicios/normaspdf_2011/Diciembre/28-12-2011.pdf RESOLUCIÓN MINISTERIAL N° 300-2011-MINAM] (PDF; 2,3&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pareto distribution''', named after the Italian [[civil engineer]], [[economist]], and sociologist [[Vilfredo Pareto]], is a [[power-law]] [[probability distribution]] that is used in description of [[social sciences|social]], [[scientific]], [[geophysical]], [[actuarial science|actuarial]], and many other types of observable phenomena. Originally applied to describing the [[distribution of wealth]] in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population, the Pareto distribution has colloquially become known and referred to as the [[Pareto principle]], or "80-20 rule", and is sometimes called the "[[Matthew principle]]".&lt;!-- can we find a better reference than https://youtu.be/5WX9UEYZsR8 at 2'10". --&gt;  This rule states that, for example, 80% of the wealth of a society is held by 20% of its population. However, the Pareto distribution only produces this result for a particular power value, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;5&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.16). While &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is variable, empirical observation has found the 80-20 distribution to fit a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena and human activities.

==Definition==
If ''X'' is a [[random variable]] with a Pareto (Type I) distribution,&lt;ref name=arnold&gt;{{cite book |author=Barry C. Arnold |year=1983 |title=Pareto Distributions |publisher=International Co-operative Publishing House |isbn= 0-89974-012-X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the probability that ''X'' is greater than some number ''x'', i.e. the [[survival function]] (also called tail function), is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F}(x) = \Pr(X&gt;x) = \begin{cases}
\left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{x}\right)^\alpha &amp; x\ge x_\mathrm{m}, \\
1 &amp; x &lt; x_\mathrm{m},
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the (necessarily positive) minimum possible value of ''X'', and ''α'' is a positive parameter. The Pareto Type I distribution is characterized by a scale parameter ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and a shape parameter ''α'', which is known as the ''tail index''. When this distribution is used to model the distribution of wealth, then the parameter ''α'' is called the [[Pareto index]].

==Properties==

===Cumulative distribution function===
From the definition, the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a Pareto random variable with parameters ''α'' and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;F_X(x) = \begin{cases}
1-\left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{x}\right)^\alpha &amp; x \ge x_\mathrm{m}, \\
0 &amp; x &lt; x_\mathrm{m}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===Probability density function===
It follows (by [[Derivative|differentiation]]) that the [[probability density function]] is

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(x)= \begin{cases} \frac{\alpha x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha}{x^{\alpha+1}} &amp; x \ge x_\mathrm{m}, \\ 0 &amp; x &lt; x_\mathrm{m}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

When plotted on linear axes, the distribution assumes the familiar J-shaped curve which approaches each of the orthogonal axes [[asymptotically]]. All segments of the curve are self-similar (subject to appropriate scaling factors). When plotted in a [[log-log plot]], the distribution is represented by a straight line.

===Moments and characteristic function===
* The [[expected value]] of a [[random variable]] following a Pareto distribution is
:
:: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(X)= \begin{cases} \infty &amp; \alpha\le 1, \\
\frac{\alpha x_\mathrm{m}}{\alpha-1} &amp; \alpha&gt;1.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[variance]] of a [[random variable]] following a Pareto distribution is

:: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)= \begin{cases}
\infty &amp; \alpha\in(1,2], \\
\left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{\alpha-1}\right)^2 \frac{\alpha}{\alpha-2} &amp; \alpha&gt;2.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

: (If ''α'' ≤ 1, the variance does not exist.)
* The raw [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] are

:: &lt;math&gt;\mu_n'= \begin{cases} \infty &amp; \alpha\le n, \\ \frac{\alpha x_\mathrm{m}^n}{\alpha-n} &amp; \alpha&gt;n. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[Moment-generating function|moment generating function]] is only defined for non-positive values ''t''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 as

::&lt;math&gt;M\left(t;\alpha,x_\mathrm{m}\right) = \operatorname{E} \left [e^{tX} \right ] = \alpha(-x_\mathrm{m} t)^\alpha\Gamma(-\alpha,-x_\mathrm{m} t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;M\left(0,\alpha,x_\mathrm{m}\right)=1.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] is given by

:: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t;\alpha,x_\mathrm{m})=\alpha(-ix_\mathrm{m} t)^\alpha\Gamma(-\alpha,-ix_\mathrm{m} t),&lt;/math&gt;

: where Γ(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is the [[incomplete gamma function]].

===Conditional distributions===
The [[conditional probability distribution]] of a Pareto-distributed random variable, given the event that it is greater than or equal to a particular number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; exceeding &lt;math&gt;x_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt;, is a Pareto distribution with the same Pareto index&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; but with minimum&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;x_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

===A characterization theorem===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, X_3, \dotsc&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent identically distributed]] [[random variable]]s whose probability distribution is supported on the interval &lt;math&gt;[x_\text{m},\infty)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x_\text{m}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the two random variables &lt;math&gt;\min\{X_1,\dotsc,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(X_1+\dotsb+X_n)/\min\{X_1,\dotsc,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt; are independent. Then the common distribution is a Pareto distribution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Geometric mean===
The [[geometric mean]] (''G'') is&lt;ref name=Johnson1994&gt;Johnson NL, Kotz S, Balakrishnan N (1994) Continuous univariate distributions Vol 1. Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; G = x_\text{m} \exp \left( \frac{1}{\alpha} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Harmonic mean===
The [[harmonic mean]] (''H'') is&lt;ref name="Johnson1994"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H = x_\text{m} \left( 1 + \frac{ 1 }{ \alpha } \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Pareto distribution hierarchy is summarized in the next table comparing the [[survival function]]s (complementary CDF).

When ''μ'' = 0, the Pareto distribution Type II is also known as the [[Lomax distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lomax | first1 = K. S. | year = 1954 | title = Business failures.

The shape parameter ''α'' is the [[tail index]], ''μ'' is location, ''σ'' is scale, ''γ'' is an inequality parameter. Some special cases of Pareto Type (IV) are

::&lt;math&gt; P(IV)(\sigma, \sigma, 1, \alpha) = P(I)(\sigma, \alpha),&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; P(IV)(\mu, \sigma, 1, \alpha) = P(II)(\mu, \sigma, \alpha),&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; P(IV)(\mu, \sigma, \gamma, 1) = P(III)(\mu, \sigma, \gamma).&lt;/math&gt;

The finiteness of the mean, and the existence and the finiteness of the variance depend on the tail index ''α'' (inequality index ''γ''). In particular, fractional ''δ''-moments are finite for some ''δ'' &gt; 0, as shown in the table below, where ''δ'' is not necessarily an integer.

===Feller–Pareto distribution===
Feller&lt;ref name=jkb94/&gt;&lt;ref name=feller/&gt; defines a Pareto variable by transformation ''U''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 of a [[beta distribution|beta random variable]] ''Y'', whose probability density function is

:&lt;math&gt; f(y) = \frac{y^{\gamma_1-1} (1-y)^{\gamma_2-1}}{B(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)}, \qquad 0&lt;y&lt;1; \gamma_1,\gamma_2&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''(&amp;nbsp;) is the [[beta function]]. If

:&lt;math&gt; W = \mu + \sigma(Y^{-1}-1)^\gamma, \qquad \sigma&gt;0, \gamma&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''W'' has a Feller–Pareto distribution FP(''μ'', ''σ'', ''γ'', ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;U_1 \sim \Gamma(\delta_1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_2 \sim \Gamma(\delta_2, 1)&lt;/math&gt; are independent [[Gamma distribution|Gamma variables]], another construction of a Feller–Pareto (FP) variable is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chotikapanich |first=Duangkamon |title=Modeling Income Distributions and Lorenz Curves |chapter=Chapter 7: Pareto and Generalized Pareto Distributions |pages=121–22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUJZZLj1kbwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and we write ''W'' ~ FP(''μ'', ''σ'', ''γ'', ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Special cases of the Feller–Pareto distribution are

==Applications==
[[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] originally used this distribution to describe the [[Distribution of wealth|allocation of wealth]] among individuals since it seemed to show rather well the way that a larger portion of the wealth of any society is owned by a smaller percentage of the people in that society. He also used it to describe distribution of income.&lt;ref&gt;Pareto, Vilfredo, ''Cours d'Économie Politique: Nouvelle édition par G.-H. Bousquet et G. Busino'', Librairie Droz, Geneva, 1964, pp. 299–345.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the [[Pareto principle]] or the "80-20 rule" which says that 20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.&lt;ref&gt;For a two-quantile population, where approximately 18% of the population owns 82% of the wealth, the [[Theil index]] takes the value 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 80-20 rule corresponds to a particular value of ''α'', and in fact, Pareto's data on British income taxes in his ''Cours d'économie politique'' indicates that about 30% of the population had about 70% of the income.&lt;!--Fact borrow'd from article "Pareto index"--&gt; The [[probability density function]] (PDF) graph at the beginning of this article shows that the "probability" or fraction of the population that owns a small amount of wealth per person is rather high, and then decreases steadily as wealth increases. (Note that the Pareto distribution is not realistic for wealth for the lower end. In fact, [[net worth]] may even be negative.) This distribution is not limited to describing wealth or income, but to many situations in which an equilibrium is found in the distribution of the "small" to the "large". The following examples are sometimes seen as approximately Pareto-distributed:

==Relation to other distributions==

===Relation to the exponential distribution===
The Pareto distribution is related to the [[exponential distribution]] as follows. If ''X'' is Pareto-distributed with minimum ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and index&amp;nbsp;''α'', then

: &lt;math&gt; Y = \log\left(\frac{X}{x_\mathrm{m}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

is [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] with rate parameter&amp;nbsp;''α''. Equivalently, if ''Y'' is exponentially distributed with rate&amp;nbsp;''α'', then

: &lt;math&gt; x_\mathrm{m} e^Y&lt;/math&gt;

is Pareto-distributed with minimum ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and index&amp;nbsp;''α''.

This can be shown using the standard change-of-variable techniques:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pr(Y&lt;y) &amp; = \Pr\left(\log\left(\frac{X}{x_\mathrm{m}}\right)&lt;y\right) \\
&amp; = \Pr(X&lt;x_\mathrm{m} e^y) = 1-\left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{x_\mathrm{m}e^y}\right)^\alpha=1-e^{-\alpha y}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The last expression is the cumulative distribution function of an exponential distribution with rate&amp;nbsp;''α''.

===Relation to the log-normal distribution===
The Pareto distribution and [[log-normal distribution]] are alternative distributions for describing the same types of quantities. One of the connections between the two is that they are both the distributions of the exponential of random variables distributed according to other common distributions, respectively the [[exponential distribution]] and [[normal distribution]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Relation to the generalized Pareto distribution===
The Pareto distribution is a special case of the [[generalized Pareto distribution]], which is a family of distributions of similar form, but containing an extra parameter in such a way that the support of the distribution is either bounded below (at a variable point), or bounded both above and below (where both are variable), with the [[Lomax distribution]] as a special case. This family also contains both the unshifted and shifted [[exponential distribution]]s.

The Pareto distribution with scale &lt;math&gt;x_m&lt;/math&gt; and shape &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the generalized Pareto distribution with location &lt;math&gt;\mu=x_m&lt;/math&gt;, scale &lt;math&gt;\sigma=x_m/\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and shape &lt;math&gt;\xi=1/\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Vice versa one can get the Pareto distribution from the GPD by &lt;math&gt;x_m = \sigma/\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1/\xi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Relation to Zipf's Law===
The Pareto distribution is continuous probability distribution. [[Zipf's law]], also sometimes called the [[zeta distribution]], is a discrete distribution, separating the values into a simple ranking. Both are a simple power law with a negative exponent, scaled so that their cumulative distributions equal 1.  Zipf's can be derived from the Pareto distribution if the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; values (incomes) are binned into &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; ranks so that the number of people in each bin follows a 1/rank pattern. The distribution is normalized by defining &lt;math&gt;x_m&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\alpha x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha = \frac{1}{H(N,\alpha-1)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H(N,\alpha-1)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Harmonic_number#Generalized_harmonic_numbers|generalized harmonic number]]. This makes Zipf's probability density function derivable from Pareto's.

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{\alpha x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha}{x^{\alpha+1}} = \frac{1}{x^s H(N,s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;s = \alpha-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an integer representing rank from 1 to N where N is the highest income bracket.  So a randomly selected person (or word, website link, or city) from a population (or language, internet, or country) has &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; probability of ranking &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

===Relation to the "Pareto principle"===
The "[[80-20 law]]", according to which 20% of all people receive 80% of all income, and 20% of the most affluent 20% receive 80% of that 80%, and so on, holds precisely when the Pareto index is&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(5)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log(5)/log(4), approximately 1.161. This result can be derived from the [[Lorenz curve]] formula given below. Moreover, the following have been shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardy |first1=Michael |year=2010 |title=Pareto's Law |journal=[[Mathematical Intelligencer]] |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=38–43 |doi=10.1007/s00283-010-9159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be mathematically equivalent:
* Income is distributed according to a Pareto distribution with index ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.
* There is some number 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1/2 such that 100''p'' % of all people receive 100(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')% of all income, and similarly for every real (not necessarily integer) ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, 100''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' % of all people receive 100(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; percentage of all income.

This does not apply only to income, but also to wealth, or to anything else that can be modeled by this distribution.

This excludes Pareto distributions in which&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, which, as noted above, have infinite expected value, and so cannot reasonably model income distribution.

===Relation to Price's Law===
[[Derek_J._de_Solla_Price#Scientific_contributions|Price's square root law]] is sometimes offered as a property of or as similar to the Pareto distribution. However, the law only holds in the case that &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;. Note that in this case, the total and expected amount of wealth are not defined, and the rule only applies asymptotically to random samples. The extended Pareto Principle mentioned above is a far more general rule.

==Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient==
[[File:ParetoLorenzSVG.svg|thumb|325px|Lorenz curves for a number of Pareto distributions. The case ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ corresponds to perfectly equal distribution (''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and the ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 line corresponds to complete inequality (''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1)]]

The [[Lorenz curve]] is often used to characterize income and wealth distributions. For any distribution, the Lorenz curve ''L''(''F'') is written in terms of the PDF ''f'' or the CDF ''F'' as

:&lt;math&gt;L(F)=\frac{\int_{x_\mathrm{m}}^{x(F)}xf(x)\,dx}{\int_{x_\mathrm{m}}^\infty xf(x)\,dx} =\frac{\int_0^F x(F')\,dF'}{\int_0^1 x(F')\,dF'}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''(''F'') is the inverse of the CDF. For the Pareto distribution,

:&lt;math&gt;x(F)=\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{(1-F)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the Lorenz curve is calculated to be

:&lt;math&gt;L(F) = 1-(1-F)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\alpha\le 1&lt;/math&gt; the denominator is infinite, yielding ''L''=0. Examples of the Lorenz curve for a number of Pareto distributions are shown in the graph on the right.

According to [[Oxfam]] (2016) the richest 62 people have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=62 people own the same as half the world, reveals Oxfam Davos report|url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2016-01-18/62-people-own-same-half-world-reveals-oxfam-davos-report|publisher=Oxfam|date=Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can estimate the Pareto index that would apply to this situation. Letting ε equal &lt;math&gt;62/(7\times 10^9)&lt;/math&gt; we have:
:&lt;math&gt;L(1/2)=1-L(1-\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}}=\epsilon^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--:&lt;math&gt;\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})=(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})\ln\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})=(\ln\epsilon/\ln 2)(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})=-(\ln\epsilon/\ln 2)\ln((1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})\approx(\ln\epsilon/\ln 2)(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})\exp(-\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}}))\approx -\ln\epsilon/\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\ln(1-(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}})\approx W(-\ln\epsilon/\ln 2)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''W'' is the [[Lambert W function]]. So
:&lt;math&gt;(1/2)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}}\approx 1-\exp(-W(-\ln\epsilon/\ln 2))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{1-\frac{1}{\alpha}}\approx -\ln(1-\exp(-W(-\ln\epsilon/\ln 2)))/\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx 1/(1+\ln(1-\exp(-W(-\ln\epsilon/\ln 2)))/\ln 2)&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;The solution is that ''α'' equals about 1.15, and about 9% of the wealth is owned by each of the two groups. But actually the poorest 69% of the world adult population owns only about 3% of the wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Wealth Report 2013|url=https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=BCDB1364-A105-0560-1332EC9100FF5C83|publisher=Credit Suisse|page=22|date=Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gini coefficient]] is a measure of the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the equidistribution line which is a line connecting [0,&amp;nbsp;0] and [1,&amp;nbsp;1], which is shown in black (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞) in the Lorenz plot on the right. Specifically, the Gini coefficient is twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the equidistribution line. The Gini coefficient for the Pareto distribution is then calculated (for &lt;math&gt;\alpha\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;) to be

:&lt;math&gt;G = 1-2 \left (\int_0^1L(F)dF \right ) = \frac{1}{2\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt;

(see Aaberge 2005).

==Parameter estimation==
The [[likelihood function]] for the Pareto distribution parameters ''α'' and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, given an independent [[sample (statistics)|sample]] ''x'' =&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), is

: &lt;math&gt;L(\alpha, x_\mathrm{m}) = \prod_{i=1}^n \alpha \frac {x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha} {x_i^{\alpha+1}} = \alpha^n x_\mathrm{m}^{n\alpha} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac {1}{x_i^{\alpha+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the logarithmic likelihood function is

: &lt;math&gt;\ell(\alpha, x_\mathrm{m}) = n \ln \alpha + n\alpha \ln x_\mathrm{m} - (\alpha + 1) \sum_{i=1} ^n \ln x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that &lt;math&gt;\ell(\alpha, x_\mathrm{m})&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, the greater the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the greater the value of the likelihood function. Hence, since ''x'' ≥ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, we conclude that

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat x_\mathrm{m} = \min_i {x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

To find the [[estimator]] for ''α'', we compute the corresponding partial derivative and determine where it is zero:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \alpha} = \frac{n}{\alpha} + n \ln x_\mathrm{m} - \sum _{i=1}^n \ln x_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the [[maximum likelihood]] estimator for ''α'' is:

Malik (1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. J. Malik |year=1970 |title=Estimation of the Parameters of the Pareto Distribution |journal=Metrika |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the exact joint distribution of &lt;math&gt;(\hat{x}_\mathrm{m},\hat\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; is Pareto with scale parameter ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and shape parameter ''nα'', whereas &lt;math&gt;\hat\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has an [[inverse-gamma distribution]] with shape and scale parameters ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and ''nα'', respectively.

==Graphical representation==
The characteristic curved '[[long tail]]' distribution when plotted on a linear scale, masks the underlying simplicity of the function when plotted on a [[log-log graph]], which then takes the form of a straight line with negative gradient: It follows from the formula for the probability density function that for ''x'' ≥ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\log f_X(x)= \log \left(\alpha\frac{x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha}{x^{\alpha+1}}\right) = \log (\alpha x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha) - (\alpha+1) \log x.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''α'' is positive, the gradient −(''α''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) is negative.

==Random sample generation==
Random samples can be generated using [[inverse transform sampling]]. Given a random variate ''U'' drawn from the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] on the unit interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1], the variate ''T'' given by

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{U^{1/\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

is Pareto-distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tanizaki |first=Hisashi |title=Computational Methods in Statistics and Econometrics |year=2004 |page=133 |publisher=CRC Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOGAUcn13fMC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''U'' is uniformly distributed on [0,&amp;nbsp;1), it can be exchanged with (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''U'').

The bounded (or truncated) Pareto distribution has three parameters: ''α'', ''L'' and ''H''. As in the standard Pareto distribution ''α'' determines the shape. ''L'' denotes the minimal value, and ''H'' denotes the maximal value.

The [[probability density function]] is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha L^\alpha x^{-\alpha - 1}}{1-\left(\frac{L}{H}\right)^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''L''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''H'', and ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

====Generating bounded Pareto random variables====
If ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0,&amp;nbsp;1), then applying inverse-transform method &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~mps042/invtransnote.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{1 - L^\alpha x^{-\alpha}}{1 - (\frac{L}{H})^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \left(-\frac{U H^\alpha - U L^\alpha - H^\alpha}{H^\alpha L^\alpha}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

is a bounded Pareto-distributed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Symmetric Pareto distribution===
The symmetric Pareto distribution can be defined by the [[probability density function]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Financial Returns Have Finite or Infinite Variance?

== Epistemology ==

Pure sociology explains social life with its [[social geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald.  2000.  "Dreams of Pure Sociology."  Sociological Theory 18:343.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social life refers to any instance of human behavior—such as [[law]], [[suicide]], [[gossip]], or [[art]] — while the [[social geometry]] of a behavior, also called its [[social structure]], refers to the social characteristics of those involved—such as their degree of past interaction or their level of wealth.  To some extent this approach draws from aspects of earlier [[sociology|sociological]] work, ranging from [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim's]] emphasis on social explanations for individual behavior to later work in the variation of police (and other legal) behavior.

== Differences ==

Virtually all sociology explains the behavior of people—whether groups or individuals—with some reference to their mental constructs ([[psychology]]) or the purposes of their action ([[teleology]]). But pure sociology reconceptualizes human behavior as social life—something that does not exist in the mind, is not explainable by the aims of actions, and is supraindividual. Pure sociology, then, can be distinguished from other sociological paradigms by what is absent from it:  psychology, teleology, and even people as such.  Pure sociology's focus on a unique social reality may sound [[Durkheim]]ian, but Black views the approach as "more Durkheimian than Durkheim."&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald.  1995.  "The Epistemology of Pure Sociology."  Law and Social Inquiry 20:850.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
In [https://www.amazon.com/Behavior-Law-Donald-Black/dp/0121026523 ''The Behavior of Law], published in 1976, [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]] introduced the first example of pure sociology—a general theory of law, or governmental social control.  This theory seeks to explain variation in law, and one aspect of [[legal behavior|legal variation]] is the amount of law attracted to a case of conflict.  A conflict is a situation where one person has a grievance against another, such as where an assault has occurred or a contract has been broken, and the offended parties may or may not appeal to the police or to the civil courts to resolve it.  Cases may attract law or not, then, and when they do attract law, there may be more or less of it.  When the police make an arrest in an assault case, for instance, there is more law when there is merely a call to the police, and when someone is convicted and sentenced there is more law than when there is merely an arrest.  The pure sociology of law explains this variation by identifying a number of sociological variables that are associated with variation in the quantity of law.  These include various forms of social status (such as wealth, integration, culture, conventionality, organization, and respectability) as well as various forms of social distance (such as relational distance and cultural distance).  These are aspects of the social structures of cases, then, and so cases where the disputants are both high in status have different social structures—and are handled differently—than cases involving low-status disputants.  Whether the disputants are socially close to or distant from one another also determines the amount of law the case attracts.  For example, one of the theory’s predictions is that within a society, law varies directly with relational distance.  Relational distance refers to the amount and intensity of interaction between the parties, so the theory predicts that there is more law in conflicts between strangers than in those between intimates.  This aspect of the theory explains numerous facts, such as why those who kill strangers are punished more severely than those who kill intimates&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Mark.  2009.  Is Killing Wrong?  A Study in Pure Sociology.  Charlottesville:  University of Virginia Press.  156-170.&lt;/ref&gt; and why women who are raped by strangers are more likely to report it to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, L. S.  1984.  "The Classic Rape:  When Do Victims Report?"  Social Problems 31:459-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of [https://www.amazon.com/Behavior-Law-Donald-Black/dp/0121026523 ''The Behavior of Law''], Black and other pure sociologists have applied the theoretical strategy to numerous other subjects.  Most notably, Black has developed a general theory of social control that goes beyond law to explain more generally the handling of all human conflicts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  Most conflicts are handled without appealing to the legal system, and the theory thus explains not just law but [[conflict avoidance|avoidance]], [[gossip]], [[therapy]], [[feud]]ing, and numerous other forms of non-governmental social control.  In addition to extending the subject matter, this later work also extends the theory to focus not just on the social characteristics of the initial disputants in a conflict, but also of third parties (all those with knowledge of a conflict).  For example, [http://uga.edu/soc/people/faculty/cooney_mark.php Mark Cooney] examines how third party behavior shapes [[violence]].  Whether and how third parties involve themselves in a conflict can determine not only the likelihood of violence, but also the form the violence takes.  For example, social configurations characterized by close and distant group ties are conducive to feud-like behavior where violence occurs back and forth between groups over a long period of time.  In this situation, third parties are members of groups, and they are relationally close to fellow group members but distant from others.  When conflicts between groups occur, they thus support one side and oppose the other, and they may join in retaliatory violence against members of rival groups.  Other social configurations are conducive to other forms of violence or even to peace.  For example, where there are cross-cutting ties, such as where people are relationally close to members of other groups, third parties are more likely to promote peace.&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Mark.  1998.  Warriors and Peacemakers:  How Third Parties Shape Violence.  New York:  New York University Press.  67-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Black has moved beyond the study of how conflicts are handled to examine the origin of conflict itself.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20110628195043/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Sociology/TheoryMethods/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199737147 ''Moral Time''] identifies the causes of clashes of right and wrong in human relationships.  In doing so, this theory invokes a new explanatory concept—the idea of movement in ''social time'' — and thus extends the pure sociological approach.

Black and others have also moved beyond conflict and social control to develop explanations of ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald.  2000.  "Dreams of Pure Sociology."  Sociological Theory 18:343-367.&lt;/ref&gt; predation,&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Mark.  2006.  "The Criminological Potential of Pure Sociology."  Crime, Law and Social Change 46:58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[welfare]],&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, Joseph H.  2003.  "Financial Altruism or Unilateral Resource Exchanges?  Toward a Pure Sociology of Welfare."  Sociological Theory 21:341-358&lt;/ref&gt; [[research]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, Scott and Richard Wright.  2008.  "Intimacy with Outlaws:  The Role of Relational Distance in Recruiting, Paying, and Interviewing Underworld Research Participants."  Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 45:22-38.&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of social life.  For example, Black’s theory of ideas explains the content of ideas with their social structures.  Just as each conflict has a social structure that consists of the social characteristics of the disputants and third parties, every idea—every statement about reality—has a social structure consisting of the characteristics of the source, subject, and audience.  For example, the subject of an idea may be intimate or distant from the source:  People have ideas about family members and friends as well as strangers.  The subject may also be high or low in social status:  People have ideas about [[senate|senators]] and [[businessperson|businessmen]] as well as [[skid row]] vagrants.  But ideas vary depending on their social structures.  Black’s explanation of voluntarism and [[determinism]], for example, states that ideas about high status subjects are more likely to be voluntaristic (to invoke [[free will]]).  The theory would predict, then, that people would offer voluntaristic explanations of [[senate|senators]] and [[businessperson|businessmen]] and deterministic explanations of [[skid row]] vagrants.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald.  2000.  "Dreams of Pure Sociology."  Sociological Theory 18:356-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Sociology 29:704-709.&lt;/ref&gt; has responded generally to critics' claims and provided an extensive defense of the pure sociological approach.

Noting the ideological nature of many of the attacks, [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Black]] says that his theory is in fact "politically and morally neutral."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Black, Donald.  1995.  "The Epistemology of Pure Sociology."  Law and Social Inquiry 20:867.&lt;/ref&gt;  But according to [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Black]], it nonetheless attracts politicized hostility due to its unconventionality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"My work is shocking not because it is [[politically incorrect]], but because it is epistemologically incorrect.  It violates conventional conceptions of social reality in general and legal and moral reality in particular.  It therefore shocks — epistemologically shocks — many on whom it is inflicted.  If I disturb your universe I may be worthy of contempt.  I may appear to be your favorite political enemy, a [[conservatism|conservative]] if you are [[political radicalism|radical]], a [[political radicalism|radical]] if you are [[conservatism|conservative]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Donald Black (sociologist)|Black]] also discusses the aims of the approach.  While it is unconventional [[sociology]], it is conventional [[science]], striving to provide [[simplicity|simple]], general, [[testability|testable]], valid, and [[originality|original]] explanations of [[reality]].  And it is by these criteria alone, [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Black]] maintains, that it should be judged:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If you wish to criticize my work, tell me you can predict and explain legal and related behavior better than I can.  Tell me my work is not as testable as something else, tell me it is not as general as something else, tell me it is less elegant than something else, tell me that it has already been published, or just tell me it is wrong.  Tell me something relevant to what I am trying to accomplish — something scientific."&lt;ref&gt;Black, Donald.  1995.  "The Epistemology of Pure Sociology."

Reeve's "telescopes and microscopes had a worldwide reputation for accuracy.

In August 1664 Pepys purchased a microscope from him, "the best he knows in England, and he makes the best in the world." 5 pounds 10 shillings is "a great price," but Reeve throws in a Scotoscope ([[camera obscura]]), "and a curious curiosity it is to [see] objects in a dark room with."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Reeve [http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/574/ Retrieved 27 July 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Reeve's son, also an instrument maker{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} was known as Richard Reeve Jr (''fl''. 1680). The man referred to as "Young" Reeve in Pepys' entry of 23 March 1659/60, would be the older Richard's son John, who took over the family business in 1679 and ran it until about 1710.&lt;ref&gt;(Companion entry and Glossary, plus the "Shorter Pepys.")&lt;/ref&gt; The older Richard was arrested in 1664 for murdering his wife, but secured a royal pardon, probably at great cost.&lt;ref&gt;https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/how-to-murder-your-wife-and-get-away-from-it-first-become-a-famous-successful-telescope-maker/ Retrieved 27 July 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About-distinguish|Skunkworks|SCO Skunkware}}

A '''skunkworks project''' is a [[project]] developed by a small and loosely structured group of people who [[research and development|research and develop]] a project primarily for the sake of radical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skunk%20works | title=Skunk works | work= The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] of the English Language'', Fourth Edition | publisher= reference.com | accessdate= October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated with [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s World War II ''[[Skunk Works]]'' project.

==Definition==
[[File:Skunkworks-logo.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Skunk Works]] hangar in Palmdale, California]]
[[Everett Rogers]] defined ''skunkworks'' as an "enriched environment that is intended to help a small group of individuals design a new idea by escaping routine organizational procedures."&lt;ref name="rogers109"&gt;Rogers E. (2003) ''Diffusion of Innovations'', 5th ed., p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated during [[World War II]] when the [[P-80 Shooting Star]] was designed by Lockheed’s Advanced Development Projects Division in Burbank, California, under similar circumstances. A closely guarded incubator was set up in a [[circus tent]] next to a plastics factory in Burbank. The strong smells that wafted into the tent made the Lockheed R&amp;D workers think of the foul-smelling  “Skonk Works” factory in Al Capp’s ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="econ2008"/&gt; 

Since its origination with [[Skunk Works]], the term was generalized to apply to similar high-priority [[R &amp; D]] projects at other large organizations which feature a small team removed from the normal working environment and given freedom from management constraints.&lt;ref name="econ2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| url= http://www.economist.com/node/11993055 | title= Idea: Skunkworks| journal= The Economist| date= August 25, 2008 | accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term typically refers to technology projects developed in semi-secrecy, such as [[Google X Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Brad|title=Inside Google's Secret Lab|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/inside-googles-secret-lab|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BusinessWeek|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daft|first=Richard|author-link=Richard L. Daft|title=Management|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285068657|pages=361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdcWAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=Google%20X%20lab%20skunkworks&amp;pg=PA361#v=onepage&amp;q=Google%20X%20lab%20skunkworks&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other famous skunkworks were Microsoft Research, special teams at Boeing, and the lab of about 50 people established by [[Steve Jobs]] to develop the [[Macintosh|Macintosh computer]], located behind the Good Earth Restaurant in Cupertino.&lt;ref name="rogers109"/&gt;

==Evolution of the idea==
''[[The Economist]]'' notes that the expectations for the products developed by skunkworks have changed in the 21st century from "something that makes their competitors say 'Wow'" to "something that makes their competitors' customers say 'Wow'". Rather than sequestering skunkworks, the companies now tend to promote communication between them and marketing, design, and accounting departments.&lt;ref name="econ2008"/&gt;

'''''The Passions of the Mind''''' is a 1971 novel by  American author [[Irving Stone]]. It is a [[biographical novel]] about the psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]] and covers his life from when he was a student to when he is forced to leave Austria to escape the growing influence of the Nazis. It covers many aspects of the subject's life, including his hospital work, his relationship with his parents, his marriage to [[Martha Bernays]], and his support for his successor, [[Carl Jung]]. The book is notable for going into great detail of Freud's theories, especially the [[Oedipus Complex]].

Irving Stone is best renowned for his several biographical novels, the best known being ''[[Lust for Life (novel)|Lust for Life]]'' and ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (novel)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'' (about the artists [[Vincent Van Gogh]] and [[Michelangelo]], respectively), which were both adapted into major Hollywood productions. Though less well known, ''Passions of the Mind'' was an American bestseller upon its release, spending 13 weeks at the top of the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]] (fiction) in the spring of 1971, and nearly 30 weeks in the top 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bear]], ''The #1 ''New York Times'' Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 ''New York Times'' bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theano''' is a Python library and optimizing compiler for manipulating and evaluating mathematical expressions, especially matrix-valued ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergstra|first=J. |author2=O. Breuleux |author3=F. Bastien |author4=P. Lamblin |author5=R. Pascanu |author6=G. Desjardins |author7=J. Turian |author8=D. Warde-Farley |author9=Y. Bengio|title=Theano: A CPU and GPU Math Expression Compiler|journal=Proceedings of the Python for Scientific Computing Conference (SciPy) 2010|date=30 June 2010|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/theano_scipy2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Theano, computations are expressed using a [[NumPy]]-esque syntax and [[Compiler|compiled]] to run efficiently on either CPU or [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPU]] architectures.

Theano is an [[Open-source model|open source]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Github Repository|url=https://github.com/Theano/Theano/}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily developed by a Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deeplearning.net/|title=deeplearning.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2017, Pascal Lamblin posted a message from [[Yoshua Bengio]], 
Head of MILA:  major development would cease after the 1.0 release due to competing offerings by strong industrial players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/theano-users/7Poq8BZutbY |title=MILA and the future of Theano |date=28 September 2017 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |mailing-list=theano-users |last=Lamblin |first=Pascal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theano 1.0.0 was then released on 15 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/NEWS.html|title=Release Notes – Theano 1.0.0 documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample code==
The following code is the original Theano's example. It defines a computational graph with 2 scalars ''a'' and ''b'' of type ''double'' and an operation between them (addition) and then creates a python function ''f'' that do the actual computation.&lt;ref name="LISA Lab"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theano Documentation Release 1.0.0 |url=http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/theano.pdf |publisher=LISA lab, University of Montreal |accessdate=31 August 2018 |pages=22 |date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
import theano
from theano import tensor

# declare two symbolic floating-point scalars
a = tensor.dscalar()
b = tensor.dscalar()

# create a simple expression
c = a + b

# convert the expression into a callable object that takes (a,b)
# values as input and computes a value for c
f = theano.function([a,b], c)

# bind 1.5 to 'a', 2.5 to 'b', and evaluate 'c'
assert 4.0 == f(1.5, 2.5)

'''Warranting theory''' is a theory adapted by [[Joseph Walther|Joseph B. Walther]] and [[Malcolm Parks]] from the works of Stone.&lt;ref name="Stone1995"&gt;Stone, A. R. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The adapted construct of warranting suggests that in the presence of anonymity, a person may potentially misrepresent information about his or her self.  The greater the potential for such misrepresentation, the more likely observers are to be skeptical of the presented information.  Warrants in this manner are cues that an observer uses to gauge the accuracy of a person's given information or profile.

==Seminal article==
Walther and Parks (2002)&lt;ref name="Cues filtered out, cues filtered in: Computer-mediated communication and relationships"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph|author2=Malcolm Parks |title=Cues filtered out, cues filtered in: Computer-mediated communication and relationships|journal=Handbook of interpersonal communication|year=2002|volume=3rd edition|pages=529–563|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239489124_Cues_Filtered_Out_Cues_Filtered_In_Computer-Mediated_Communication_and_Relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt;  observed a [[phenomenon]] in which people met offline after having first met online.  Sometimes these experiences were positive, and other times they were negative.  Walther and Parks (2002) were dissatisfied with existing theories' ability to explain these phenomena.  To fill in the [[theory|theoretical]] gap, Walther and Parks (2002) adapted the original concept of warranting presented by Stone (1995), describing connections between one's self and self-presentation as a continuum rather than a [[Binary number|binary]], moderated by [[anonymity]]. They suggested that the potential for anonymity resulted in the potential for a discrepancy along this continuum. The greater this potential discrepancy, the more compelling it is for observers to be skeptical of information provided by the individual about the self (Walther &amp; Parks, 2002).  Warrants, as described by Walther and Parks (2002), are perceived reliable cues that observers use to gauge how one's true identity matches that which is presented online. 

However, not all of these cues are weighted equally; rather, warrants possess a warranting value (Walther &amp; Parks, 2002). This value is defined as the extent to which the cue is perceived to be unaltered by the target. Warrants that are very difficult to manipulate by the user are considered high in warranting value, while those that are easily changed have a low warranting value and are therefore much more questionable in terms of accuracy (Walther &amp; Parks, 2002). For example, an article written about an individual has a higher warranting value than a social profile created by the same individual.

Walther and Parks (2002) speculated that being able to obtain information from a partner's [[social network]] would increase the warrants within an online relationship. Because information from others is of high warranting value, it stands to reason that those invested in a potential online relationship would use available resources, in this case social networks, to alleviate any skepticism about the accuracy of claims made by a relational partner.

Warrants do not necessarily have to be provided or controlled by others. Walther and Parks (2002) introduced the concept of partial warranting. This is information that, though provided by the user, contains easily verifiable facts. For example, the presentation of one's given name is a partial warrant, as this information can be used to look up public records or link to other profiles the user may possess. Providing [[Number|numerical]] information, such as height, weight, age, or address, also constitutes as partial warranting, as these figures are easily checked and provide little room for gray area.

==Existing research==

===Others-generated warrants===
Much of the existing research regarding warranting examined how perception and judgments about an individual are influenced by others-generated information. Walther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, and Tong (2008),&lt;ref name="The Role of Friends' Appearance and Behavior on Evaluations of Individuals on Facebook: Are We Known by the Company We Keep?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph|author2=Van Der Heide|author3=Kim|author4=Westerman|author5=Tong|title=The Role of Friends' Appearance and Behavior on Evaluations of Individuals on Facebook: Are We Known by the Company We Keep?|journal=Human Communication Research|date=January 2008|volume=34|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; used fake [[Facebook]] profiles to assess if the attractiveness of friends, as well as what these friends said on an individual's profile, had an effect on social attraction. Profiles that were neutral in content displayed two comments from friends. The small profile pictures of commenting friends were either attractive or unattractive, and the comments suggested either socially desirable or socially undesirable behaviors (Walther et al., 2008).

It was found that social attractiveness was positively [[correlated]] with the physical attractiveness of commenting friends (Walther et al., 2008). This indicates that the simple observable presence of others in one's social network may be enough to make social judgments. Mixed results were found regarding actual content of friend's comments (Walther et al., 2008). A significant effect was found, although these effects depended on the gender of the profile owner. This confirms the assertion in warranting theory that comments made by others do indeed warrant judgments, but adds that these judgments may be moderated by the initial claims made by the target.

This study admittedly left a gap that required further research. While it confirmed that perceptions are influenced by others, the claims made by a user were very limited and purposefully neutral (Walther et al., 2008). Therefore, the authors were unable to make assertions about the power of others-generated cues over self-generated claims. A follow-up study addressed this issue.

Walther, Van Der Heide, Hamel, and Shulman, (2009)&lt;ref name="Self-Generated Versus Other-Generated Statements and Impressions in Computer-Mediated Communication A Test of Warranting Theory Using Facebook"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph|author2=Brandon Van Der Heide |author3=Lauren M. Hamel |author4=Hillary C. Shulman |title=Self-Generated Versus Other-Generated Statements and Impressions in Computer-Mediated Communication A Test of Warranting Theory Using Facebook|journal=Communication Research|date=2009-01-28|volume=36|issue=2|pages=229–253|url=http://crx.sagepub.com/content/36/2/229.short|accessdate=24 April 2012|doi=10.1177/0093650208330251}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tested the effects of self-generated information against information generated by others. Walther et al. (2009) compared subjects reactions to fake Facebook profiles and their judgments of [[extroversion]] and [[introversion]]. Profiles contained either self-generated information suggesting the profile owner was introverted or extroverted, and others-generated statements suggesting the owner was introverted or extroverted. Information suggesting introversion was considered negative while information suggestion extroversion was considered to be positive. Walther et al. (2009) found that while others-generated statements do indeed have an effect on observer judgments, the effect did not override self-generated information or negativity effects.

Taking a further look at the effects of positive and negative statements with self versus others-generated information, Walther, Van Der Heide, Hamel, and Shulman (2009) replaced statements of introversion and extroversion with physical attractiveness. Subjects judged physical attractiveness of subjects based on information in the owner's profile and comments made by the owner's friends; pictures of owners were either male or female and were pre-tested to be at a neutral level of attractiveness.

Walther et al. (2009) found that when asked to make judgments of attractiveness, results were strongly in line with predictions made by warranting theory. Walther et al. (2009) explain the discrepancies in results between the two experiments by posing that perhaps more is going on when making judgments of internal versus external characteristics. It is possible that friend's judgments about personality are deemed less accurate than ones made by the person his or herself. This is likely due to the assumption that a person would know his or herself best, and may still perform activities associated with another temperament while still claiming to be the opposite; for example, a true introvert may still elect
to go out with friends on occasion (Walther et al., 2009).

===Social triangulation and partial warranting===
Despite the introduction of partial warranting in the seminal article, very little research focusing on this construct exists. Gibbs, Ellison, and Lai (2010) were the closest to studying partial warranting, or verifiable claims provided by the target, in isolation. Gibbs et al. (2010) studied warranting in the context of online dating profiles.

The study found that people in online dating situations tended to utilize web resources outside of the dating website to confirm partial warrants. For example, if a real full name was provided by a potential relational partner, users typed this information into search engines in order to retrieve public records or links to additional social-network site (SNS) profiles (Gibbs et al., 2010). This type of fact-checking was introduced as "social triangulation" (Gibbs et al., 2010). The authors speculated that this strategy would be common when "true warrants", or information uncontrolled by the user, are not available (Gibbs, et al., 2010).&lt;ref name="First Comes Love, Then Comes Google: An Investigation of Uncertainty Reduction Strategies and Self-Disclosure in Online Dating"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=Jennifer |author2=Nicole B. Ellison |author3=Chih-Hui Lai|title=First Comes Love, Then Comes Google: An Investigation of Uncertainty Reduction Strategies and Self-Disclosure in Online Dating|journal=Communication Research|date=February 2011|volume=38|issue=1|pages=70–100|url=http://crx.sagepub.com/content/38/1/70.refs|accessdate=24 April 2012|doi=10.1177/0093650210377091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deception===
Since the introduction of warranting theory, two studies have examined how [[deceptive]] a person may be in terms of information they may present and the degree of verifiability of their warrants.

Parks and Archey-Ladas (2003)&lt;ref name="Communicating self through personal homepages: Is identity more than screen deep?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parks|first=Malcolm|author2=Tonjia Archy-Ladas |title=Communicating self through personal homepages: Is identity more than screen deep?|journal=ICA conference paper|year=2003|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=ed004b29-4f31-4f31-a387-9e2a32b33f15%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=19&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=ufh&amp;AN=16028634|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined a sample of 200 personal home pages, and coded the information provided by the users. To examine the data, Parks and Archey-Ladas (2003) looked at warrants (easily verified information) and constraining information (information that is not easily verified but restricts identity. Items include political activity and hobbies). Parks and Archey-Ladas (2003) found that despite the freedom afforded to users to create identities online, people quite frequently had many linkages between their online and [[offline]] lives on their personal home pages. While it is suggested by Parks and Archey-Ladas (2003) that people present verifiable information online, it is assumed that the
information is honest, as Parks and Archey-Ladas did not actually follow up with an attempt to contact owners of pages. As such, this study only demonstrates people present verifiable information, but did not actually find out to what extent the present information was actually true.

Warkentin, Woodsworth, Hancock, and Cormier (2010)&lt;ref name="Warrants and deception in computer mediated communication"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warkentin|first=Darcy|author2=Michael Woodworth |author3=Jeffrey Hancock |author4=Nicole Cormier |title=Warrants and deception in computer mediated communication|journal=CSCW|year=2012|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/connect/CSCW_10/docs/p9.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  wondered if warranting potential in a medium influenced the presence of deceptive practices. They suspected that users of online media would be more truthful if others could easily catch them in a lie. A simple [[Correlation and dependence|correlational]] study was conducted in which self-report survey answers regarding deception across mediums were compared to the warranting potential of each medium (Warkentin et al., 2010).

The [[hypotheses]] were confirmed. SNSs, which were found to have the highest warranting potential, also featured the least amount of self-reported deception. [[Synchronous]] chat, which scored the lowest in warranting potential, was reported to be the largest source of deceptive practices (Warkentin et al., 2010). From this study, it appears that people have an awareness of warranting by others, and act accordingly. Because this was a correlational study, these findings could have an alternate explanation.

===Parks' boundary conditions===
Parks (2011)&lt;ref name="Boundary Conditions for the Application of Three Theories of Computer-Mediated Communication to MySpace"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parks|first=Malcolm|title=Boundary Conditions for the Application of Three Theories of Computer-Mediated Communication to MySpace|journal=Journal of Communication|date=August 4, 2011|volume=61|issue=4|pages=557–574|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01569.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01569.x/full|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented three boundary conditions that must be present for
true warranting to exist:

# The target must simply make a claim regarding identity.
# Members of the target's social network must be able to publicly comment on this claim.
# Observers must be able to compare the claim and comment in a meaningful way.

Warranting capacity is not medium-specific, but instead may occur anywhere where these three conditions are met. Still, it is often assumed that certain types of computer-mediated communication (CMC) lend themselves more easily to these
criteria than others. For example, [[Social networking websites|SNSs]] have been at the epicenter of studies on warranting, suggesting that they are the ideal avenue for the examination of the theory. To explore this notion, Parks (2011) used a longitudinal study to explore whether a popular SNS, [[Myspace]], met the three requirements.

Overwhelmingly, Myspace failed to satisfy even one of the boundary conditions (Parks, 2011). Members posted very little about their identity, made few social connections, and received few to no comments on their profiles (Parks, 2011). Although it could be argued that Myspace is becoming more of a business avenue than SNSs (Parks, 2011), this study still cautions against a medium-based understanding of warranting. Instead, individual cases should be measured against qualifying criterion.

== Overview ==
[[File:CICB's Laboratory.jpg|thumb|[[China Medical University (Taiwan)]]'s Laboratory]]
A '''wet lab''' is a type of [[laboratory]] in which a wide range of experiments are performed, for example, characterizing of [[enzymes]] in [[biology]], [[titration]] in [[chemistry]], [[diffraction]] of [[light]] in [[physics]], etc. - all of which may sometimes involve dealing with [[hazardous substances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agsci.psu.edu/students/careers/career-resources/laboratory-research-skills|title=Laboratory/Research Skills (Current Students)|website=Current Students (Penn State College of Ag Sciences)|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of these experiments, the proper ventilation and appropriate arrangement of safety equipment are of great importance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/space-types/laboratory-wet|title=Laboratory: Wet {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The safety of occupants must be ensured by placing eye washers/baths and personnel showers in easily reachable positions, installing fire alarms, having [[fire extinguishers]] and blankets near the door, having vinyl floors and a ceiling which is inert, and paint on the wall that is easy to clean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://formaspace.com/articles/laboratory-furniture/dos-donts-wet-lab-dry-lab-users/|title=What are the Do’s and Don’ts for Wet Lab &amp; Dry Lab Users {{!}} Formaspace|date=2016-08-17|work=Formaspace|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There should also be view panels on doors to ensure that the risk of accident or injury to occupants whilst entering/leaving the lab is mitigated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55867/|title=Laboratory Facilities|last=Laboratory|first=National Research Council (US) Committee on Prudent Practices in the|date=2011|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The researchers (the occupants) are required to know basic laboratory techniques including safety procedures and techniques related to the experiments that they perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ehs.research.uiowa.edu/52-general-laboratory-safety-procedures|title=5.2   General Laboratory Safety Procedures {{!}} Environmental Health and Safety|website=ehs.research.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory design ==
At the present, lab design tends to focus on increasing the interactions between researchers through the use of open plans, allowing the space and opportunity for researchers exchange ideas, share equipment, and share storage space; increasing productivity and efficiency of experiments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/trends-lab-design|title=Trends in Lab Design {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of design has been proposed to support team-based work, though more compartmentalised or individual spaces are still important for some types of processes which require separate/isolated space such as [[electron microscope|electron microscopes]], [[tissue culture lab|tissue cultures]], work/workers that may be disturbed by noise levels, etc. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Flexibility of laboratory design should also be promoted, for example, the wall and ceiling should be removable in case of expansion or contraction, the pipes, tubes and [[fume hoods]] should also be removable for future expansion, reallocation and change of use. A well thought-through design will ensure that a lab can be adjusted for any future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://property.mq.edu.au/space_types/lab_spaces|title=Lab spaces - Property Design Guidelines|website=property.mq.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability of resources is also a concern, so the amount of resources and energy used in the lab should be reduced where possible to save the environment, but still yield the same products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.labdesignnews.com/article/2015/06/modern-trends-lab-design|title=Modern trends in lab design|date=2015-06-04|work=Laboratory Design News|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a laboratory consists of many areas such as wet lab, dry lab and office areas, wet labs should be separated from other spaces using controlling devices or dividers to prevent cross-contamination or spillage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the nature of processes undergone in wet labs, the environmental conditions may need to be carefully considered and controlled using a [[cleanroom]] system.
