      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1658">The '''1993 North Korea Census''' was a [[census]] conducted by the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (North Korea)|Central Bureau of Statistics]] on 31 December 1993.

The population of the country, according to this census, was 21,213,478. The life expectancy at birth was of 70.7 years (67.8 for males and 73.9 for females).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.washington.edu/Msd/norestriction/b64084875.pdf |title=Analysis of Democratic People's Republic of Korea 1993 Population Census Data and Population Projections |author=Arjun Adlakha and Loraine West |date=October 1997 |publisher=[[US Bureau of the Census]] |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The census was inconsistent internally and in comparison to previous censuses. According to Nicholas Eberstadt: "Quotation marks should attend the '1993' census because that enumeration was not actually conducted in 1993, but rather in early 1994, with respondents replying to questions about their circumstances as of year-end 1993; needless to say, such a procedure is highly unorthodox."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eberstadt|first=Nicholas|title=The North Korean Economy: Between Crisis and Catastrophe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHQ3-Y9-AQYC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2009|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick|isbn=978-1-4128-0947-4|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''91''' ('''ninety-one''') is the [[natural number]] following [[90 (number)|90]] and preceding [[92 (number)|92]].

{{wiktionary|ninety-one}}

==In mathematics==
91 is:

* the twenty-seventh distinct [[semiprime]] and the second of the form (7.q).
* a [[triangular number]].
* a [[hexagonal number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000384|title=Sloane's A000384 : Hexagonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the few such numbers to also be a [[centered hexagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A003215|title=Sloane's A003215 : Hex (or centered hexagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[centered nonagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A060544|title=Sloane's A060544 : Centered 9-gonal (also known as nonagonal or enneagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[centered cube number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005898|title=Sloane's A005898 : Centered cube numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[square pyramidal number]], being the sum of the squares of the first six [[integer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000330|title=Sloane's A000330 : Square pyramidal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the smallest positive integer expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways if negative roots are allowed (alternatively the sum of two cubes and the difference of two cubes): {{nowrap|1=91 = 6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + (−5)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (See [[1729 (number)|1729]] for more details). This implies that 91 is the second [[cabtaxi number]].
* the smallest positive integer expressible as a sum of six distinct squares: {{nowrap|1=91 = 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The only other ways to write 91 as a sum of distinct squares are: {{nowrap|1=91 = 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=91 = 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* the smallest [[pseudoprime]] satisfying the congruence {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 3 mod ''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Erich. [http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html What's Special About This Number?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[repdigit]] in base 9 (111&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;).
* palindromic in bases 3 (10101&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 9 (111&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), and 12 (77&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).
* the fourth composite number in the 11-aliquot tree. The [[aliquot sum]] of 91 is 21 within the aliquot sequence (91,21,11,1,0).

The decimal equivalent of the fraction {{Frac|91}} can be obtained by using powers of 9.

'''Adaptive Redaction''' is an intelligent version of [[redaction]] whereby sensitive parts of a document are automatically removed based on [[policy]]. It is primarily used in next generation [[Data loss prevention software|Data Loss Prevention]] (DLP) solutions.

==Content and Context==
The policy is a set of rules based on content and on context.

Context can include:
* Who is sending (or uploading) the information.
* Who is receiving the information (including a web site if uploading or downloading).
* The communication channel (e.g. email, web, copy to removable media).

Content can be 'visible' information, such as that you see on the screen. It can also be 'invisible' information such as that in document properties and revision history, and it can also be 'active' content which has been embedded in an electronic document, such as a macro.

==Purpose==
'''Adaptive Redaction''' is designed to alleviate "False Positive" events created with [[Data loss prevention software]] (DLP) security solutions.

False positives occur when a DLP policy triggers and prevents legitimate outgoing communication. In the majority of cases this is caused through oversight by the sender.

==Examples==
Sending unprotected [[credit card]] information outside an organization breaches the [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS regulations). Many organizations accept credit card information through [[email]], however a reply to an email containing such information would send out the prohibited information. This would cause a breach of policy. '''Adaptive Redaction''' can be used to remove just the credit card number but allow the email to be sent.

'Invisible' information can be found in documents and has created embarrassment for several governments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/28/federal-police-mistakenly-publish-metadata-from-criminal-investigations/ Federal police mistakenly publish metadata from criminal investigations]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23327">{{Lie groups|Homogeneous spaces}}

In [[mathematics]], '''Borel–de Siebenthal theory''' describes the closed connected subgroups of a [[compact Lie group]] that have ''maximal rank'', i.e. contain a [[maximal torus]]. It is named after the Swiss mathematicians [[Armand Borel]] and Jean de Siebenthal who developed the theory in 1949. Each such subgroup is the [[identity component]] of the [[centralizer]] of its center. They can be described recursively in terms of the associated [[root system]] of the group. The subgroups for which the corresponding homogeneous space has an invariant complex structure correspond to [[parabolic subgroup]]s in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of the compact Lie group, a [[reductive algebraic group]].

==Connected subgroups of maximal rank==
Let ''G'' be connected compact Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. [[Heinz Hopf|Hopf]] showed that the centralizer of a torus ''S'' ⊆ ''T'' is a connected closed subgroup containing ''T'', so of  ''maximal rank''. Indeed, if ''x'' is in C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S''), there is a maximal torus containing both ''S'' and ''x'' and it is contained in C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borel and de Siebenthal proved that the connected closed subgroups of maximal rank are precisely the [[identity component]]s of the centralizers of their centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their result  relies on a fact from representation theory. The weights of an irreducible representation of a connected compact semisimple group ''K'' with highest weight λ can be easily described (without their multiplicities): they are precisely the saturation under the [[Weyl group]] of the [[dominant weight]]s obtained by subtracting off a sum of simple roots from λ. In particular, if the [[irreducible representation]] is trivial on the center of ''K'' (a finite abelian group), 0 is a weight.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981}}
*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1997}}
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove the characterization of Borel and de Siebenthal, let ''H'' be a closed connected subgroup of ''G'' containing ''T'' with center ''Z''. The identity component ''L'' of C&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(Z) contains ''H''. If it were strictly larger, the restriction of the adjoint representation of ''L'' to ''H'' would be trivial on ''Z''. Any irreducible summand, orthogonal to the Lie algebra of ''H'', would provide non-zero weight zero vectors for ''T'' / ''Z'' ⊆ ''H'' / ''Z'', contradicting the maximality of the torus ''T'' / ''Z'' in ''L'' / ''Z''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank==
Borel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed connected subgroups of maximal rank of a connected compact Lie group.

The general classification of connected closed subgroups of maximal rank can be reduced to this case, because any connected subgroup of maximal rank is contained in a finite chain of such subgroups, each maximal in the next one. Maximal subgroups are the identity components of any element of their center not belonging to the center of the whole group.

The problem of determining the maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank can be further reduced to the case where the compact Lie group is simple. In fact the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of a connected compact Lie group ''G'' splits as a direct sum of the ideals

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{z} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_1\oplus \cdots \oplus \mathfrak{g}_m,}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the center and the other factors &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_i&lt;/math&gt; are simple. If ''T'' is a maximal torus, its Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; has a corresponding splitting

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{t}=\mathfrak{z} \oplus \mathfrak{t}_1\oplus \cdots \oplus \mathfrak{t}_m,}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}_i&lt;/math&gt; is maximal abelian in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_i&lt;/math&gt;. If ''H'' is a closed connected of ''G'' containing ''T'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, the complexification of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of the complexification of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; and a number of one-dimensional weight spaces, each of which lies in the complexification of a factor &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_i&lt;/math&gt;. Thus if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}_i=\mathfrak{h}\cap\mathfrak{g}_i,} &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{z} \oplus \mathfrak{h}_1\oplus\cdots \oplus \mathfrak{h}_m.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''H'' is maximal, all but one of the &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_i&lt;/math&gt;'s coincide with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_i&lt;/math&gt; and the remaining one is maximal and of maximal rank. For that factor, the closed connected subgroup of the corresponding simply connected simple compact Lie group is maximal and of maximal rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''G'' be a connected simply connected compact simple Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; be the Lie algebra of ''G'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; that of ''T''. Let Δ be the corresponding [[root system]]. Choose a set of positive roots and corresponding simple roots α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the highest root in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and write

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\alpha_0=m_1 \alpha_1 + \cdots + m_n\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 1. (The number of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to 1 is equal to |''Z''| – 1, where ''Z'' is the center of ''G''.)

The ''Weyl alcove'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A=\{T\in\mathfrak{t}:\, \alpha_1(T)\ge 0, \dots,\alpha_n(T)\ge 0, \alpha_0(T)\le 1\}.}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Élie Cartan]] shouwed that it is a [[fundamental domain]] for the [[affine Weyl group]]. If ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''G'' / ''Z'' and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T'' / ''Z'', it follows that the exponential mapping from &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; to ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; carries 2π''A'' onto ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Weyl alcove ''A'' is a [[simplex]] with vertices at

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{v_0=0,\,\, v_i=m_i^{-1} X_i,}&lt;/math&gt;

where α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) = δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The main result of Borel and de Siebenthal is as follows.

[[File:Affine-Dynkin-Diagram-Labelled.png|thumb|300px|[[Affine Dynkin diagram|Extended Dynkin diagrams]] for the simple complex Lie algebras]]
The structure of the corresponding subgroup ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be described in both cases. It is semisimple in the second case with a system of simple roots obtained by replacing α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by −α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In the first case it is the direct product of the circle group generated by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and a semisimple compact group with a system of simple roots obtained by omitting α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

This result can be rephrased in terms of the [[Affine Dynkin diagram|extended Dynkin diagram]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; which adds an extra node for the highest root as well as the labels ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The maximal subalgebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; of maximal rank are either non-semisimple or semimsimple. The non-semisimple ones are obtained by deleting two nodes from the extended diagram with coefficient one. The corresponding unlabelled diagram gives the Dynkin diagram semisimple part of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, the other part being a one-dimensional factor.  The Dynkin diagrams for the semisimple ones are obtained by removing one node with coefficient a prime. This leads to the following possibilities:

* A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: A&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; × A &lt;sub&gt;''n'' − ''p'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''' (non-semisimple)
* B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or B&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; × D&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − ''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (semisimple), B&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''' (non-semisimple)
* C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; × C&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − ''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (SS), A&lt;sub&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''' (NSS)
* D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: D&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; × D&lt;sub&gt;''n'' - ''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (SS), D&lt;sub&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''', A&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''' (NSS)
* E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SS), D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''' (NSS)
* E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (SS), E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; × '''T''' (NSS)
* E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;: D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (SS)
* F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SS)
* G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (SS)

All the corresponding homogeneous spaces are symmetric, since the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 2, apart from G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and all the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; spaces other than E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In all these exceptional cases the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 3, except for E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;×A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; where the automorphism has period 5. The homogeneous spaces are then called [[weakly symmetric spaces]].

To prove the theorem, note that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity component of the centralizer of an element exp ''T'' with ''T'' in 2π ''A''. Stabilizers increase in moving from a subsimplex to an edge or vertex, so ''T'' either lies on an edge or is a vertex. If it lies on an edge than that edge connects 0 to a vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, which is the first case. If ''T'' is a vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has a non-trivial factor ''m'', then ''mT'' has a larger stabilizer than ''T'', contradicting maximality. So ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must be prime. Maximality can be checked directly using the fact that an intermediate subgroup  ''K'' would have the same form, so that its center would be either (a) '''T''' or (b) an element of prime order. If the center of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is ''''T''', each simple root with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; prime is already a root of ''K'', so (b) is not possible; and if (a) holds, α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the only root that could be omitted with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, so ''K'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the center of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is of prime order, α&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a root of ''K'' for ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, so that (a) is not possible; if (b) holds, then the only possible omitted simple root is α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that ''K'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Kane|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closed subsystems of roots==
A subset Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ Δ is called a '''closed subsystem''' if whenever α and β lie in Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with α + β in Δ, then  α + β lies in Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Two subsystems Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be ''equivalent'' if σ( Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = Δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for some σ in ''W'' = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') / ''T'', the [[Weyl group]]. Thus for a closed subsystem

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{t}_{\mathbf{C}} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in \Delta_1} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
 
is a subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}_{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt;; and conversely any such subalgebra gives rise to a closed subsystem. Borel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed subsystems up to equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2001|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|quote='''THEOREM.''' '''Up to equivalence the closed root subsystems are given by''' ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 '''with simple roots all''' α&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; '''with''' ''j'' ≠ ''i'' '''or by''' ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 '''prime with simple roots''' −α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; '''and all''' α&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; '''with''' ''j'' ≠ ''i''.}}
{{clear}}

This result is a consequence of the Borel–de Siebenthal theorem for maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank. It can also be proved directly within the theory of root systems and reflection groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to symmetric spaces of compact type==
Let ''G'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of ''G'' of period 2 and ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; the fixed point subgroup of σ.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''G'' lying between ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''G'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; admits a decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{p},}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of σ and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; the –1 eigenspace.
If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; contains no simple summand of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on ''G'' / ''K'', with ''G'' acting by isometries. Under such an inner product, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal. ''G'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetric space or the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently the identity component of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; or  ''K'') is irreducible on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to the maximality of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; as a subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; and ''K''-invariant subspaces 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus \mathfrak{p}_1,\,\,\,\ \mathfrak{p}_1=\mathfrak{h}\cap \mathfrak{p}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Any orthogonal symmetric algebra  (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378–379}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\oplus_{i=1}^N \mathfrak{g}_i,}&lt;/math&gt;

which are permuted by the automorphism σ. If σ leaves an algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt; invariant, its eigenspace decomposition coincides with its intersections with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. So the restriction of σ to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible. If σ interchanges two simple summands, the corresponding pair is isomorphic to a diagonal inclusion of ''K'' in ''K'' × ''K'', with ''K'' simple, so is also irreducible. The involution σ just swaps the two factors
σ(''x'',''y'')=(''y'',''x'').

This decomposition of an orthogonal symmetric algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''G'' / ''K'' when ''G'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''G''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is automatically connected (this is no longer true, even for inner involutions, if ''G'' is not simply connected).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; For simply connected ''G'', the symmetric space ''G'' / ''K'' is the direct product of the two kinds of symmetric spaces ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''H'' × ''H'' / ''H''. Non-simply connected symmetric space of compact type arise as
quotients of the sinply connected space ''G'' / ''K'' by finite abelian groups. In fact if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{G/K=G_1/K_1\times \cdots\times G_s/K_s,}&lt;/math&gt;

let

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Gamma_i=Z(G_i)/Z(G_i)\cap K_i}&lt;/math&gt;

and let Δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the subgroup of Γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; fixed by all automorphisms of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; preserving ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. automorphisms of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra). Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Delta=\Delta_1\times \cdots\times\Delta_s}&lt;/math&gt;

is a finite abelian group acting freely on ''G'' / ''K''. The non-simply connected symmetric spaces arise as quotients by subgroups of Δ. The subgroup can be identified with the [[fundamental group]], which is thus a finite abelian group.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010|pp=244,263–264}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of compact symmetric spaces or pairs (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) thus reduces to the case where ''G'' is a connected simple compact Lie group. There are two possibilities: either the automorphism σ is inner, in which case ''K'' has maximal rank and the theory of Borel and de Siebenthal applies; or the automorphism σ is outer, so that, because σ preserves a maximal torus, the rank of ''K'' is less than the rank of ''G'' and σ corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram modulo inner automorphisms. {{harvtxt|Wolf|2010}} determines directly all possible σ in the latter case: they correspond to the symmetric spaces
SU(''n'')/SO(''n''), SO(''a''+''b'')/SO(''a'')×SO(''b'') (''a'' and ''b'' odd), E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Kac]] noticed that all finite order automorphisms of a simple Lie algebra can be determined using the corresponding [[affine Lie algebra]]: that classification, which leads to an alternative method of classifying pairs (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ), is described in {{harvtxt|Helgason|1978}}.

==Applications to hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==
The equal rank case with ''K'' non-semisimple corresponds exactly to the [[Hermitian symmetric space]]s ''G'' / ''K'' of compact type.

In fact the symmetric space has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric if and only if there is a linear map ''J'' with ''J''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −''I'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''. In this case ''J'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and exp ''Jt'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, then by the invariance of the inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}&lt;/math&gt;

Define a linear map δ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''T'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking ''X'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If on the other hand ''G'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''G'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From the theorem of Borel and de Siebenthal, the involution σ is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of a torus ''S''. It follows that ''G'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G'' such that ''G'' / ''K'' = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''G'' / ''K'' and the action of ''G'' is holomorphic.

In general any compact hermitian symmetric space is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simple. The irreducible ones are exactly the non-semisimple cases described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8456">The '''Canadian Mathematical Olympiad'''&lt;ref name="cmosite"&gt;[https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/CMO/ Canadian Mathematical Olympiad (CMO) official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; (CMO) is Canada's top mathematical problem-solving competition. It is run by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]]. The Olympiad plays several roles in Canadian [[mathematics competition]]s, most notably being Canada's main team selection process for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

==Qualification==
Approximately 70 to 80 people qualify for and are invited to write the CMO each year.  Students must not have written the [[Putnam Competition]] and must meet age, full-time school enrollment, and Canadian Citizenship (or permanent residency) requirements.  Students do not have to be living in Canada, as long as they are Canadian citizens (although only those in Canada are eligible for cash prizes and the championship cup).

Participants are invited to write the CMO usually because of excellent results at the [[Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge|Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge (COMC)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/COMC/ Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge (COMC) official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately the top 50 students from the COMC earn invitations to the CMO.  A Qualifying Repêchage&lt;ref&gt;[https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/REP/ CMO Qualifying Repêchage (CMOQR) official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; (CMOQR) is offered as a "second chance" for the next highest 50 - 75 students from the COMC.  About 10-15 students are chosen from the Repêchage and are then invited to the CMO.

Top students in certain other top Canadian competitions may also be considered for invitations.  The organizing committee may also invite participants based on their earlier CMO experience or their performance at [[Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad|APMO]] or [[USAMO]] competitions.

==Competition Layout==
The competition is three hours long.
There are five questions on the CMO, each worth seven marks, for a total of 35 points. Each problem is graded the same way as it is on the IMO.

From 1969 to 1972, the CMO was ten questions long. In the 1970s, the exam length changed a number of times before finally stabilizing to five questions in 1979.

The [[Canadian Mathematical Society|CMS]] does not formally disclose its marking procedure, however in the past the following model was used:
:*Two graders grade the questions. If there is a dispute between the graders by more than one point, they will reconsider the problem until a consensus is reached.
:*If no work was done or very insignificant progress was made, the answer is graded zero.
:*If significant progress is made, marks of 1, 2, or 3 will be given, depending on the amount progress toward solving the problem.
:*Marks of 4 or 5 are given for answers that are essentially correct, but are poorly presented or lack showing of work in some areas.
:*If the solution has a minor error that can be trivially fixed, it is given a 6.
:*An absolutely perfect solution is awarded a mark of 7. This might be given if there is an error in the writing that does not affect the solution in any meaningful way.

==Awards==
There are several different types of rewards for doing well on the CMO:

*Six to eight of the top CMO participants are selected each year for Math Team Canada&lt;ref&gt;[https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/IMO/ Math Team Canada official web site].&lt;/ref&gt; They are trained and sent to represent Canada at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the pinnacle of [[high school]] mathematical competition. 
*For students who write in Canada, cash prizes are awarded to the top performers.  If there are no "ties", then $2000 goes to 1st place, $1500 to 2nd, $1000 to 3rd, and $500 for Honourable Mention (typically there are up to six people receiving Honourable Mention). When there are ties, prize money is pooled upwards (e.g. a tie for first means the co-winners share $3500 and no one gets "2nd").
*The top student in Canada is recognized as the CMO Champion and his or her name is engraved on the CMO Championship Cup.
*Top students are identified on the official web site to certify their high performance

==Definition==
In one-dimensional [[complex dynamics]], the '''connectedness [[locus (mathematics)|locus]]''' is a  [[subset]] of the parameter space of [[Rational function|rational functions]], which  consists of those parameters for which the corresponding [[Julia set]] is [[Connected space|connected]].

==Examples==
Without doubt, the most famous connectedness locus is the [[Mandelbrot set]], which arises from the family of [[complex quadratic polynomial]]s : 
:&lt;math&gt;f_c(z) = z^2+c\,&lt;/math&gt;

The connectedness loci of the higher-degree unicritical families,
:&lt;math&gt; z\mapsto z^d+c\,&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;d\geq 3\,&lt;/math&gt;) are often called '[[Multibrot set]]s'. 

For these families, the [[bifurcation locus]] is the boundary of the connectedness locus. This is no longer true in settings, such as the full parameter space of cubic polynomials, where there is more than one free [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]. For these families, even maps with disconnected Julia sets may display nontrivial dynamics. Hence here the connectedness locus is generally of less interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[order theory]], a '''containment order''' is the [[partial order]] that arises as the [[subset]]-containment relation on some collection of objects.  In a simple way, every [[partially ordered set|poset]] ''P'' = (''X'',≤) is ([[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to) a containment order (just as every group is isomorphic to a permutation group - see [[Cayley's theorem]]).  To see this, associate to each element ''x'' of ''X'' the set

:&lt;math&gt; X_\leq(x) = \{ y \in X | y \leq x\} ; &lt;/math&gt;

then the transitivity of ≤ ensures that for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', we have

:&lt;math&gt; X_\leq(a) \subseteq X_\leq(b) \mbox{ precisely when } a \leq b . &lt;/math&gt;

There can be sets &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of [[cardinal number|cardinality]] less than &lt;math&gt;|X|&lt;/math&gt; such that ''P'' is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the containment order on S. The size of the smallest possible ''S'' is called the [[Order dimension#k-dimension and 2-dimension|2-dimension]] of ''S''.

Several important classes of poset arise as containment orders for some natural collections, like the [[Boolean lattice]] ''Q&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', which is the collection of all 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; subsets of an ''n''-element set, the '''interval-containment orders''', which are precisely the orders of [[order dimension]] at most two, and the dimension-''n'' orders, which are the containment orders on collections of ''n''-boxes anchored at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].  Other containment orders that are interesting in their own right include the '''circle orders''', which arise from disks in the plane, and the '''angle orders'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3931">In [[mathematics]], one [[normed vector space]] is said to be '''continuously embedded''' in another normed vector space if the [[inclusion function]] between them is [[continuous function|continuous]]. In some sense, the two norms are "almost equivalent", even though they are not both defined on the same space. Several of the [[Sobolev inequality|Sobolev embedding theorems]] are continuous embedding theorems.

==Definition==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two normed vector spaces, with norms ||·||&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ||·||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, such that ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''Y''. If the [[identity function|inclusion map (identity function)]]

:&lt;math&gt;i : X \hookrightarrow Y : x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;

is continuous, i.e. if there exists a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\| x \|_Y \leq C \| x \|_X&lt;/math&gt;

for every ''x'' in ''X'', then ''X'' is said to be '''continuously embedded''' in ''Y''.  Some authors use the hooked arrow &amp;ldquo;&amp;#x21aa;&amp;rdquo; to denote a continuous embedding, i.e. &amp;ldquo;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x21aa;&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;''X'' and ''Y'' are normed spaces with ''X'' continuously embedded in ''Y''&amp;rdquo;.  This is a consistent use of notation from the point of view of the [[category of topological vector spaces]], in which the [[morphism]]s (&amp;ldquo;arrows&amp;rdquo;) are the [[continuous linear map]]s.

==Examples==

* A finite-dimensional example of a continuous embedding is given by a natural embedding of the [[real line]] ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R''' into the plane ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where both spaces are given the Euclidean norm:

::&lt;math&gt;i : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^2 : x \mapsto (x, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

:In this case, ||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; for every real number ''X''.  Clearly, the optimal choice of constant ''C'' is ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

* An infinite-dimensional example of a continuous embedding is given by the [[Rellich–Kondrachov theorem]]: let Ω&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; be an [[open set|open]], [[bounded set|bounded]], [[Lipschitz domain]], and let 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''. Set

::&lt;math&gt;p^{*} = \frac{n p}{n - p}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Then the Sobolev space ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;Omega;;&amp;nbsp;'''R''') is continuously embedded in the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;Omega;;&amp;nbsp;'''R''').  In fact, for 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, this embedding is [[compactly embedded|compact]].  The optimal constant ''C'' will depend upon the geometry of the domain &amp;Omega;.

* Infinite-dimensional spaces also offer examples of ''discontinuous'' embeddings.  For example, consider

::&lt;math&gt;X = Y = C^0 ([0, 1]; \mathbf{R}),&lt;/math&gt;

:the space of continuous real-valued functions defined on the unit interval, but equip ''X'' with the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm and ''Y'' with the [[supremum norm]].  For ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''N''', let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[continuous function|continuous]], [[piecewise linear function]] given by

::&lt;math&gt;f_n (x) = \begin{cases} - n^2 x + n , &amp; 0 \leq x \leq \tfrac 1 n; \\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:Then, for every ''n'', ||''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;||''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'', but

::&lt;math&gt;\| f_n \|_{L^1} = \int_0^1 | f_n (x) | \, \mathrm{d} x = \frac1{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Hence, no constant ''C'' can be found such that ||''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''C''||''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and so the embedding of ''X'' into ''Y'' is discontinuous.

The '''differential analyser''' is a mechanical [[analogue computer]] designed to solve [[differential equation]]s by [[integral|integration]], using wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irwin|first=William|url=http://amg.nzfmm.co.nz/differential_analyser_explained.html|title=The Differential Analyser Explained|work=|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=Auckland Meccano Guild|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first advanced computing devices to be used operationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The original machines could not add, but then it was noticed that if the two wheels of a rear differential are turned, the drive shaft will compute the average of the left and right wheels. A simple gear ratio of 1:2 then enables multiplication by two, so addition (and subtraction) are achieved. Multiplication is just a special case of integration, namely integrating a [[constant function]].&lt;ref&gt;John von Neumann, ''The Computer and the Brain'', Part 1, p.3, Yale University Press, The Silliman Memorial Lectures Series, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on solutions for differential equations using mechanical devices, discounting [[planimeter]]s, started at least as early as 1836, when the French physicist [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] designed a mechanical device to integrate [[differential equation]]s of the first order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gaspard-Gustave |last= Coriolis| authorlink=Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/ConsulterElementNum?O=NUMM-16380&amp;Deb=11&amp;Fin=15&amp;E=PDF |title=Note sur un moyen de tracer des courbes données par des équations différentielles |journal=[[Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées]] |series=series I 1 |pages=5–9 |year=1836|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first description of a device which could integrate differential equations of any order was published in 1876 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], who was born in [[Belfast]] in 1822, but lived in [[Scotland]] from the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomson, James |title=An Integrating Machine having a new Kinematic Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=24 |issue= 164–170|pages=262–5 |year=1876 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1875.0033 }} Reprinted in {{cite book | last = Thomson | first = James | title = Collected Papers in Physics and Engineering by James Thomson | editor=Joseph Larmor &amp; James Thomson | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1912 | pages = xvii, 452–7| url = https://archive.org/details/collectedpapersi00thomrich | isbn = 0-404-06422-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Thomson called his device an "integrating machine", it is his description of the device, together with the additional publication in 1876 of two further descriptions by his younger brother, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], which represents the invention of the differential analyser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One of the earliest practical uses of Thomson's concepts was a [[tide-predicting machine]] built by Kelvin starting in 1872-3. On Lord Kelvin's advice, Thomson's integrating machine was later incorporated into a [[fire-control system]] for naval gunnery being developed by [[Arthur Pollen]], resulting in an electrically driven, mechanical analogue computer, which was completed by about 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollen |first=Anthony |title=The Great Gunnery Scandal – The Mystery of Jutland |publisher=Collins |year=1980 |page=23 |isbn=0-00-216298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian mathematician [[Ernesto Pascal]] also developed [[integraph]]s for the mechanical integration of differential equations and published details in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Miei Integrafi per Equazioni Differenziali |last= Pascal |first= Ernesto |year= 1914 |publisher= B. Pellerano |location= Naples |language=it}} See also [[Integraph]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first widely practical general purpose differential analyser was constructed by [[Harold Locke Hazen]] and [[Vannevar Bush]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], 1928–1931, comprising six mechanical integrators.&lt;ref&gt;Karl L. Wildes and Nilo A.

The output of each integrator was intended to drive other parts of the machine; however, the output was too feeble to do so. Hazen recognized that a "torque amplifier", which had been invented in 1925 by Henry W. Nieman and which was intended to allow workers to control heavy machinery, could be used to provide the necessary power.  See:  Stuart Bennett, ''A History of Control Engineering 1930-1955'' (London, England:  Peter Peregrinus Ltd., 1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103 page 103].

[[Douglas Hartree]] of [[Manchester University]] brought Bush's design to England, where he constructed his first "[[proof of concept]]" model with his student, Arthur Porter, during 1934: as a result of this, the university acquired a full scale machine incorporating four mechanical integrators in March 1935, which was built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], and was, according to Hartree, "[the] first machine of its kind in operation outside the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tim (June 2005), ''op. cit.'', Hartree, D.R.

In [[Norway]], the locally built [[Oslo Analyzer|Oslo Analyser]] was finished during 1938, based on the same principles as the MIT machine. This machine had 12 integrators, and was the largest analyser built for a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holst, P.A. |title=Svein Rosseland and the Oslo analyzer |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=16–26 |date=Oct–Dec 1996 |doi=10.1109/85.539912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, further differential analysers were built at the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] in [[Maryland]] and in the basement of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania during the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Randell|Randell, Brian]] (ed.), ''The Origins of Digital Computers Selected Papers'' (3rd edition, 1982), Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 297.

At [[Osaka Imperial University]] (present-day [[Osaka University]]) around 1944, 
a complete differential analyser machine was developed (illustrated) to calculate the movement of an object and other problems with mechanical components, and then draws graphs on paper with a pen. It was later transferred to the [[Tokyo University of Science]] and has been displayed at the school’s Museum of Science in Shinjuku Ward. Restored in 2014  is one of only two still operational differential analyzers produced before the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="KABATA"&gt;HISATOSHI KABATA (2014), "[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sci_tech/technology/AJ201412020060 Early computer dating to 1944 solving complex equations again after long 'reboot']", [[The Asahi Shimbun]]/Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, a differential analyser was constructed at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1948 by [[Beatrice Helen Worsley]], but it appears to have had little or no use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campbell, Scott M. |title=Beatrice Helen Worsley: Canada's Female Computer Pioneer |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=53–4 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |date=October-December 2003 |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/scampbell/campbell03.pdf |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253890 |accessdate=2010-07-24 |quote= [Worsley's] research was suggested by Samuel H.

Constructed from about CAD$75 worth of Meccano, the analyzer was minimally modified from the original design but offered slight improvements to the electrical power distribution system, the design of the torque amplifiers, and the output pen support. Unfortunately, there is no information regarding what use, if any, the analyzer was put to or why Worsley built it}} For more on Beatrice Worsley, see [[UTEC#UTEC|UTEC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A differential analyser may have been used in the development of the [[bouncing bomb]], used to attack [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, William (2009-07). ''Op. cit.'' "It is rumoured that a differential analyser was used in the development of the "bouncing bomb" by Barnes Wallis for the "Dam Busters" attack on the Ruhr valley hydroelectric dams in WW2. This was first mentioned in [[Museum of Transport and Technology|MOTAT]] [New Zealand] literature in 1973. However after extensive enquiries and literature searches over the last few years, no evidence can be found that the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3031/object/955 differential analyser held by MOTAT], nor any other differential analyser, was used for this purpose. Considering the secrecy surrounding war time activities at the time it could still be possible, but most people from that era are now deceased. Two remaining personalities still alive from that era were consulted, namely Arthur Porter and [[Maurice Wilkes]], but neither could substantiate the rumour."&lt;/ref&gt; Differential analysers have also been used in the calculation of [[soil erosion]] by river control authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Electronic Brains: Stories from the Dawn of the Computer Age|first=Mike|last=Hally|publisher=Granta|year=2005|isbn=9781862076631|page=xx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differential analyser was eventually rendered obsolete by [[electronic analogue computer]]s and, later, digital computers.

In 1948, this machine was bought by Professor [[Harry Whale]] of Auckland, for 100 pounds sterling, and he then took it to Auckland for use at the Seagrave Radio Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tim (June 2005), ''op. cit.'': Robinson states that "[Prof. Whale] had earlier used the Meccano model in his Ph.D. studies". {{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3031/object/955|title=Differential Analyser|work=|accessdate=2010-07-21|publisher=NZMuseums|date=}} {{cite web|url=http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/tech/7627BB58BAFE998DCC257317001AA6D1|title=Meccano ‘Dam Busters’ computer stars at MOTAT|publisher=computerworld.co.nz|date=2007-07-16|accessdate=2007-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817020213/http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/tech/7627BB58BAFE998DCC257317001AA6D1|archivedate=2007-08-17|df=}}

"It is estimated by Garry Tee of Auckland University that about 15 Meccano model Differential Analysers were built for serious work by scientists and researchers around the world."

An example is the differential analyser built at [[Marshall University]], which is now used for educational purposes, in that a student not only solves a differential equation but also becomes the "calculator" by operating the machine, and so develops a better understanding of what a differential equation is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.marshall.edu/mu-advance/news-MU-Differential-Analyzer-Grand-Opening.asp |title=MU Differential Analyzer Grand Opening |work= |accessdate=2010-07-22 |publisher=Marshall University |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606104651/http://www.marshall.edu/mu-advance/news-MU-Differential-Analyzer-Grand-Opening.asp |archivedate=2010-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">'''Doris Cohen''' was  a twentieth-century American mathematician and aerodynamicist.  She worked at the [[Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA, a precursor to [[NASA]]).  In 1941, a research report she published made her NACA's first female author.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/05/hidden-figures-black-female-scientists-african-americans-margot-lee-shetterly-space-race|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Margot Lee|last=Shetterly|authorlink=Margot Lee Shetterly|title=The hidden history of Nasa’s black female scientists|date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to, and worked with, aerodynamicist [[Robert Thomas Jones (engineer)|R. T. Jones]].  With him, she co-founded [[Vega Instrument]] Co., a telescope manufacturing company, in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/99/jonesobit.html|title=Aerodinamics pioneer R.

'''Erik D. Demaine''' (born 28 February 1981) is a [[professor]] of [[Computer Science]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and a former [[child prodigy]].

== Early life and education ==
Demaine was born in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], to artist sculptor [[Martin L. Demaine]] and Judy Anderson. From the age of 7, he was identified as a child prodigy and spent time traveling across  [[North America]] with his father.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101327,00.html|title=Calculating Change: Why Origami Is Critical to New Drugs: The Folded Universe|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-09-04|publisher=TIME|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] during that time span until entering university at the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F1C278D90533407&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Road Scholar Finds Home at MIT|last=Barry|first=Ellen|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2002-02-17|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/demaine-0226.html|title=Prodigy prof skipped school until he started college at 12|last=Nadis|first=Steve|publisher=New Scientist|date=2003-01-18|accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demaine completed his [[bachelor's degree]] at 14 years old at [[Dalhousie University]] in Canada, and completed his [[PhD]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] by the time he was 20 years old.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/science/15origami.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=7c6938eb4b440672&amp;ex=1266210000&amp;partner=rssuserland|title=Origami as the Shape of Things to Come|last=Wertheim|first=Margaret|publisher=The New York Times|date=2005-02-15|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=IRTI000020050819e18j00023|title= Commercial origami starts to take shape|last=O'Brien|first=Danny|publisher=Irish Times|date=2005-08-19|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional accomplishments ==
[[File:Erik Demaine et al 2005 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Erik Demaine (left), Martin Demaine (center), and Bill Spight (right) watch [[John Horton Conway]] demonstrate a card trick (June 2005)]]
Demaine's [[doctorate|PhD]] dissertation, a work in the field of [[computational origami]], was completed at the University of Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=2852|title= National honour for Demaine|publisher=[[University of Waterloo]]|date=2003-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was awarded the Canadian [[Governor General's Academic Medal|Governor General's Gold Medal]] from the [[University of Waterloo]] and the [[NSERC]] Doctoral Prize (2003) for the best [[thesis|PhD thesis]] and research in Canada. The content of this thesis was later incorporated into a collection of academic works on [[Mathematics of paper folding|geometric folding]] published in 2007.&lt;ref name="GFALOP"&gt;
{{Cite book| last1 = Demaine| first1 = Erik| last2 = O'Rourke| first2 = Joseph| authorlink2 = Joseph O'Rourke (professor)| title = Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra| publisher = Cambridge University Press| date = July 2007| location =| pages = Part II| url = http://www.gfalop.org| doi =| isbn = 978-0-521-85757-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demaine joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2001 at age 20, reportedly the youngest professor in the history of MIT,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Sandra|title=Knowing when to fold|journal=American Scholar|date=2006-09-22|volume=75|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to full professorship in 2011. Demaine is a member of the [[theory of computation|Theory of Computation]] group at [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].

[[Mathematical origami]] artwork by Erik and Martin Demaine was part of the ''Design and the Elastic Mind'' exhibit at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 2008, and has been included in the MoMA permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erikdemaine.org/curved/ Curved Origami Sculpture], Erik and Martin Demaine.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was one of the featured artists in ''[[Between the Folds]]'', an international documentary film about origami practitioners which was later broadcast on [[PBS]] television.  He is president of the board of directors of [[Gathering 4 Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gathering4gardner.org/about/|title=About Gathering 4 Gardner Foundation|journal=Gathering 4 Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
In 2003, Demaine was awarded the [[MacArthur Fellowship]], the so-called "genius grant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neal|first1=Rome|title=Behind The 'Genius Grants'|journal=CBS News|date=October 4, 2003|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/behind-the-genius-grants/|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Demaine received the EATCS [[Presburger Award]] for young scientists. The award citation listed accomplishments including his work on the [[carpenter's rule problem]], [[hinged dissection]], [[prefix sum]] data structures, [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive analysis]] of [[binary search tree]]s, [[graph minor]]s, and computational [[origami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/1512-presburger-award-2013|title=Presburger Award 2013| accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was awarded a fellowship by the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/17377-erik-demaine |title=Erik Demaine at the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430160156/http://www.gf.org/fellows/17377-erik-demaine |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work on [[bidimensionality]], he was the winner of the [[Nerode Prize]] in 2015 along with his co-authors Fedor Fomin, Mohammad T. Hajiaghayi, and Dimitrios Thilikos. The work was the study of a general technique for developing both [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] exact algorithms and [[approximation algorithm]]s for a class of algorithmic problems on graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/hajiaghayi-wins-2015-nerode-prize|title=Hajiaghayi Wins 2015 Nerode Prize|date=May 8, 2015|publisher=University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies|accessdate=2015-09-03}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he became a fellow at the [[Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery|Association for Computing Machinery]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Fellows":[https://awards.acm.org/award-winners/DEMAINE_4859765 Erik Demaine]&lt;/ref&gt; He was given an honorary doctorate by [[Bard College]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2017/02/22/congressman-john-lewis-will-deliver-commencement-address-at-bard/|newspaper=Hudson Valley One|title=Congressman John Lewis will deliver commencement address at Bard|date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10499">The term '''figurate number''' is used by different writers for members of different sets of numbers, generalizing from [[triangular numbers]] to different shapes (polygonal numbers) and different dimensions (polyhedral numbers). The term can mean

* polygonal number
* a number represented as a discrete r-dimensional regular [[geometry|geometric]] pattern of r-dimensional [[Ball (mathematics)|balls]] such as a [[polygonal number]] (for r = 2) or a '''polyhedral number''' (for r = 3).
* a member of the subset of the sets above containing only triangular numbers, pyramidal numbers, and their analogs in other dimensions.&lt;ref name=Dickson&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Leonard Eugene Dickson | first = L. E. | last = Dickson | title = History of the Theory of Numbers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

Some kinds of figurate number were discussed in the 16th and 17th centuries under the name "figural number".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor1-last = Simpson | editor1-first = J. A. | editor2-last = Weiner | editor2-first = E. S. C. | encyclopedia = The Compact Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | location = Oxford, England | publisher = Clarendon Press | date = 1992 | page = 587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In historical works about [[Greek mathematics]] the preferred term used to be ''figured number''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = A history of Greek Mathematics by | authorlink = Thomas Little Heath | first = T. | last = Heath }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Greek Mathematical Philosophy | first = E. A. | last = Maziarz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a use going back to [[Jakob Bernoulli]]'s [[Ars Conjectandi]],&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt; the term ''figurate number'' is used for [[Triangular_number|triangular]] numbers made up of successive integers, [[tetrahedral number]]s made up of successive triangular numbers, etc. These turn out to be the [[binomial coefficients]]. In this usage the square numbers  4, 9, 16, 25 would not be considered figurate numbers when viewed as arranged in a square.

A number of other sources use the term ''figurate number'' as synonymous for the [[polygonal number]]s, either just the usual kind or both those and the [[centered polygonal number]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==History==

The mathematical study of figurate numbers is said to have originated with [[Pythagoras]], possibly based on Babylonian or Egyptian precursors. Generating whichever class of figurate numbers the Pythagoreans studied using [[Gnomon (figure)|gnomons]] is also attributed to Pythagoras. Unfortunately, there is no trustworthy source for these claims, because all surviving writings about the Pythagoreans&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Theoretic Arithmetic of the Pythagoreans | first = Thomas | last = Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; are from centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = A History of Mathematics | edition = Second | first1 = Carl B. | last1 = Boyer | first2 = Uta C. | last2 = Merzbach|author2-link= Uta Merzbach | page = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to be certain that the fourth triangular number of ten objects, called [[tetractys]] in Greek, was a central part of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean religion]], along with several other figures also called tetractys.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Figurate numbers were a concern of Pythagorean geometry.

The modern study of figurate numbers goes back to [[Fermat]], specifically the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]]. Later, it became a significant topic for [[Euler]], who gave an explicit formula for all [[Square triangular number|triangular numbers that are also perfect squares]], among many other discoveries relating to figurate numbers.

Figurate numbers have played a significant role in modern recreational mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kraitchik | first1=Maurice | title=Mathematical Recreations| edition = Second Revised  | publisher=[[Dover Books]] | isbn=978-0-486-45358-3 | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In research mathematics, figurate numbers are studied by way of the [[Ehrhart polynomial]]s, [[polynomial]]s that count the number of integer points in a polygon or polyhedron when it is expanded by a given factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Triangular numbers==

The [[triangular number]]s for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are the result of the juxtaposition of the linear numbers (linear gnomons) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...:

|}

These are the binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt; n+1 \choose 2 &lt;/math&gt;. This is the case ''r''=2 of the fact that the  ''r''th diagonal of [[Pascal's triangle#Patterns and properties|Pascal's triangle]] for &lt;math&gt; r \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; consists of the figurate numbers for the ''r''-dimensional analogs of triangles (''r''-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]).

The simplicial polytopic numbers for r = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are:
*&lt;math&gt;P_1(n) = \frac{n}{1} = {n+0 \choose 1}&lt;/math&gt; (linear numbers),
*&lt;math&gt;P_2(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = {n+1 \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; ([[triangular number]]s),
*&lt;math&gt;P_3(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} = {n+2 \choose 3}&lt;/math&gt; ([[tetrahedral number]]s),
*&lt;math&gt;P_4(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24} = {n+3 \choose 4}&lt;/math&gt; (pentachoric numbers, [[pentatopic number]]s, 4-simplex numbers),
&lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;P_r(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)...(n+r-1)}{r!} = {n+r-1 \choose r}&lt;/math&gt; (r-topic numbers, r-[[simplex]] numbers).

The terms ''[[square number]]'' and ''[[cubic number]]'' derive from their geometric representation as a [[Square (geometry)|square]] or [[cube (geometry)|cube]]. The difference of two positive triangular numbers is a [[trapezoidal number]].

==Gnomon==
The '''gnomon''' is the piece added to a figurate number to transform it to the next larger one.

For example, the gnomon of the square number is the [[odd number]], of the general form 2''n'' + 1, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... .  The square of size 8 composed of gnomons looks like this:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp; 8 &amp;nbsp; 8
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 7
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 6
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 5
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; 4
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; 3
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; 2 &amp;nbsp; 2
&lt;br/&gt;8 &amp;nbsp; 7 &amp;nbsp; 6 &amp;nbsp; 5 &amp;nbsp; 4 &amp;nbsp; 3 &amp;nbsp; 2 &amp;nbsp; 1

&lt;/center&gt;

To transform from the ''n-square'' (the square of size ''n'') to the (''n'' + 1)-square, one adjoins 2''n'' + 1 elements: one to the end of each row (''n'' elements), one to the end of each column (''n'' elements), and a single one to the corner.  For example, when transforming the 7-square to the 8-square, we add 15 elements; these adjunctions are the 8s in the above figure.

This gnomonic technique also provides a [[mathematical proof]] that the sum of the first ''n'' odd numbers is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; the figure illustrates 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64 = 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10793">In [[mathematics]], more specifically [[abstract algebra]], a '''finite ring''' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] that has a finite number of elements.
Every [[finite field]] is an example of a finite ring, and the additive part of every finite ring is an example of an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[finite group]], but the concept of finite rings in their own right has a more recent history.

Although rings have more structure than groups, the theory of finite rings is simpler than that of finite groups.  For instance, the [[classification of finite simple groups]] was one of the major breakthroughs of 20th century mathematics, its proof spanning thousands of journal pages.  On the other hand, it has been known since 1907 that any finite [[simple ring]] is isomorphic to the ring &lt;math&gt;M_n(\mathbb{F}_q)&lt;/math&gt; of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over a finite field of order ''q'' (as a consequence of Wedderburn's theorems, described below).

The number of rings with ''m'' elements, for ''m'' a natural number, is listed under {{OEIS2C|A027623}} in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]].

==Finite field==
{{Main|Finite field|Finite field arithmetic}}
The theory of [[finite fields]] is perhaps the most important aspect of finite ring theory due to its intimate connections with [[algebraic geometry]], [[Galois theory]] and [[number theory]]. An important, but fairly old aspect of the theory is the classification of finite fields {{Harv|Jacobson|1985|p=287}}:

* The order or number of elements of a finite field equals ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] called the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field, and ''n'' is a positive integer.
* For every prime number ''p'' and positive integer ''n'', there exists a finite field with ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; elements.
* Any two finite fields with the same order are [[isomorphic]].

Despite the classification, finite fields are still an active area of research, including recent results on the [[Kakeya conjecture]] and open problems regarding the size of smallest [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root]]s (in number theory).

A finite field ''F'' may be used to build a [[vector space]] of n-dimensions over ''F''. The [[matrix ring]] ''A'' of ''n'' × ''n'' matrices with elements from ''F'' is used in [[Galois geometry]], with the [[projective linear group]] serving as the [[multiplicative group]] of ''A''.

==Wedderburn's theorems==
{{Main|Wedderburn's little theorem|Artin–Wedderburn theorem}}
[[Wedderburn's little theorem]] asserts that any finite [[division ring]] is necessarily commutative:

: If every nonzero element ''r'' of a finite ring ''R'' has a multiplicative inverse, then ''R'' is commutative (and therefore a [[finite field]]).

[[Nathan Jacobson]] later discovered yet another condition which guarantees commutativity of a ring: if for every element ''r'' of ''R'' there exists an integer {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}} such that {{nowrap|1=''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''}}, then ''R'' is commutative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jacobson|year = 1945|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; More general conditions which guarantee commutativity of a ring are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=J. |last=Pinter-Lucke |title=Commutativity conditions for rings: 1950–2005 |journal=Expositiones Mathematicae |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=165–174 |date=May 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.exmath.2006.07.001 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S072308690600034X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another theorem by Wedderburn has, as its consequence, a result demonstrating that the theory of finite [[simple ring]]s is relatively straightforward in nature. More specifically, any finite simple ring is isomorphic to the ring &lt;math&gt;M_n(\mathbb{F}_q)&lt;/math&gt; of ''n'' by ''n'' matrices over a finite field of order ''q''.  This follows from two theorems of [[Joseph Wedderburn]] established in 1905 and 1907 (one of which is Wedderburn's little theorem). On the other hand, the [[classification of finite simple groups]] was one of the major breakthroughs of twentieth century mathematics, its proof spanning thousands of journal pages. Therefore, in some respects, the theory of finite rings is simpler than that of finite groups.

==Enumeration==
(Warning: the enumerations in this section include rings that do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity, sometimes called [[rng (algebra)|rng]]s.) In 1964 [[David Singmaster]] proposed the following problem in the [[American Mathematical Monthly]]: "(1) What is the order of the smallest non-trivial ring with identity which is not a field?  Find two such rings with this minimal order.  Are there more?  (2) How many rings of order four are there?"
One can find the solution by D.M. Bloom in a two-page proof &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=David |last=Singmaster |first2=D. M. |last2=Bloom |title=E1648 |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=918–920 |date=October 1964 |jstor=2312421 |doi=10.2307/2312421}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there are eleven rings of order&amp;nbsp;4, four of which have a multiplicative identity. Indeed, four-element rings introduce the complexity of the subject. There are three rings over the [[cyclic group]] C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and eight rings over the [[Klein four-group]]. There is an interesting display of the discriminatory tools ([[nilpotent]]s, [[zero-divisor]]s, [[idempotent (ring theory)|idempotent]]s, and left- and right-identities) in Gregory Dresden's lecture notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gregory |last=Dresden |title=Rings with four elements |year=2005 |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~dresdeng/smallrings/handnotes.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of ''[[non-commutativity]]'' in finite rings was described in {{harv|Eldrige|1968}} in two theorems: If the order m of a finite ring with 1 has a cube-free factorization, then it is [[commutative ring|commutative]]. And if a [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative]] finite ring with 1 has the order of a prime cubed, then the ring is isomorphic to the upper triangular 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2 matrix ring over the Galois field of the prime.
The study of rings of order the cube of a prime was further developed in {{harv|Raghavendran|1969}} and {{harv|Gilmer|Mott|1973}}. Next Flor and Wessenbauer (1975) made improvements on the cube-of-a-prime case. Definitive work on the isomorphism classes came with {{harv|Antipkin|Elizarov|1982}} proving that for ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, the number of classes is 3''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;50.

There are earlier references in the topic of finite rings, such as Robert Ballieu&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Robert |last=Ballieu |title=Anneaux finis; systèmes hypercomplexes de rang trois sur un corps commutatif |journal=Ann. Soc. Sci. Bruxelles, Sér. I |volume=61 |pages=222–7 |year=1947 |mr=0022841 |zbl=0031.10802}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scorza.&lt;ref&gt;Scorza (1935), see review of Ballieu by [[Irving Kaplansky]] in [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These are a few of the facts that are known about the number of finite rings (not necessarily with unity) of a given order (suppose ''p'' and ''q'' represent distinct prime numbers):
*There are two finite rings of order ''p''.
*There are four finite rings of order ''pq''.
*There are eleven finite rings of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*There are twenty-two finite rings of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''q''.
*There are fifty-two finite rings of order eight.
*There are 3''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;50 finite rings of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,  ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.

The number of rings with ''n'' elements are (with {{nowrap|1=''a''(0) = 1}})
:1, 1, 2, 2, 11, 2, 4, 2, 52, 11, 4, 2, 22, 2, 4, 4, 390, 2, 22, 2, 22, 4, 4, 2, 104, 11, 4, 59, 22, 2, 8, 2, &gt;18590, 4, 4, 4, 121, 2, 4, 4, 104, 2, 8, 2, 22, 22, 4, 2, 780, 11, 22, ... {{OEIS|id=A027623}}

[[File:X87 FPUs.jpg|Collection of the x87 family of math coprocessors by Intel.|thumb|180px]]

A '''floating-point unit''' ('''FPU''', colloquially a '''math coprocessor''') is a part of a [[computer]] system specially designed to carry out operations on [[floating point number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last1=Anderson |author-first1=Stanley F. |author-last2=Earle |author-first2=John G. |author-last3=Goldschmidt |author-first3=Robert Elliott |author-last4=Powers |author-first4=Don M. |date=January 1967 |title=The IBM System/360 Model 91: Floating-Point Execution Unit |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392016/ |journal=[[IBM Journal of Research and Development]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=34–53 |doi=10.1147/rd.111.0034 |issn=0018-8646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[square root]], and [[bitshift]]ing. Some systems (particularly older, [[microcode]]-based architectures) can also perform various [[transcendental function]]s such as [[Exponential function|exponential]] or [[trigonometric]] calculations, though in most modern processors these are done with software library routines.

In general purpose [[computer architecture]]s, one or more FPUs may be integrated as [[execution unit]]s within the [[central processing unit]]; however many [[embedded processor]]s do not have hardware support for floating-point operations (while they increasingly have them as standard, at least 32-bit ones).

When a CPU is executing a program that calls for a floating-point operation, there are three ways to carry it out:

* A floating-point unit emulator (a floating-point library)
* Add-on FPU
* Integrated FPU

== History ==

Historically systems implemented floating [[radix point|point]] via a [[coprocessor]] rather than as an integrated unit (but now in addition to the CPU, e.g. [[graphics processing unit|GPUs]]{{snd}} that are coprocessors not always built into the CPU{{snd}} have FPUs as a rule, while first generations of GPUs didn't). This could be a single [[integrated circuit]], an entire [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] or a cabinet. Where floating-point calculation hardware has not been provided, floating point calculations are done in software, which takes more processor time but which avoids the cost of the extra hardware. For a particular computer architecture, the floating point unit instructions may be [[Emulator|emulated]] by a library of software functions; this may permit the same [[object code]] to run on systems with or without floating point hardware.  Emulation can be implemented on any of several levels: in the CPU as [[microcode]] (not a common practice), as an [[operating system]] function, or in [[user space]] code. When only integer functionality is available the [[CORDIC]] floating point emulation methods are most commonly used.

In most modern computer architectures, there is some division of floating-point operations from [[integer]] operations. This division varies significantly by architecture; some, like the [[X86 architecture|Intel x86]] have dedicated [[floating-point register]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/x86-fpu.html|title=11.13. Using the FPU|website=www.freebsd.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some take it as far as independent [[computer clock|clocking]] schemes.

Floating-point operations are often [[instruction pipelining|pipelined]]. In earlier [[superscalar]] architectures without general [[out-of-order execution]], floating-point operations were sometimes pipelined separately from integer operations.

Since the early 1990s, many microprocessors for desktops and servers have more than one FPU.

The modular architecture of [[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer microarchitecture]] uses a special FPU named FlexFPU, which uses [[simultaneous multithreading]]. Each physical integer core, two per module, is single threaded, in contrast with Intel's [[Hyperthreading]], where two virtual simultaneous threads share the resources of a single physical core.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn3.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AMD-Steamroller-vs-Bulldozer.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2010/10/28/amd-unveils-flex-fp/1|title=AMD unveils Flex FP - bit-tech.net|author=|date=|website=bit-tech.net|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikibooks|Floating Point/Soft Implementations}}
{{wikibooks|Embedded Systems/Floating Point Unit}}

Some floating-point hardware only supports the simplest operations{{snd}} addition, subtraction, and multiplication. But even the most complex floating-point hardware has a finite number of operations it can support{{snd}} for example, none of them directly support [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]].

When a CPU is executing a program that calls for a floating-point operation that is not directly supported by the hardware, the CPU uses a series of simpler floating-point operations. In systems without any floating-point hardware, the CPU [[Emulator|emulate]]s it using a series of simpler [[fixed-point arithmetic]] operations that run on the integer [[arithmetic logic unit]].

The software that lists the necessary series of operations to emulate floating-point operations is often packaged in a floating-point [[library (computing)|library]].

== Integrated FPUs ==
In some cases, FPUs may be specialized, and divided between simpler floating-point operations (mainly addition and multiplication) and more complicated operations, like division. In some cases, only the simple operations may be implemented in hardware or [[microcode]], while the more complex operations are implemented as software.

In some current architectures, the FPU functionality is combined with units to perform [[SIMD]] computation; an example of this is the augmentation of the [[x87]] instructions set with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction set in the [[x86-64]] architecture used in newer Intel and AMD processors.

== Add-on FPUs ==
{{Main|Coprocessor}}
In the 1980s, it was common in [[IBM PC]]/compatible [[microcomputers]] for the FPU to be entirely separate from the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and typically sold as an optional add-on. It would only be purchased if needed to speed up or enable math-intensive programs.

The IBM PC, [[IBM Personal Computer XT|XT]], and most compatibles based on the 8088 or 8086 had a socket for the optional 8087 coprocessor. The [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|AT]] and [[80286]]-based systems were generally socketed for the [[80287]], and [[80386]]/[[80386SX]] based machines for the [[80387]] and [[80387SX]] respectively, although early ones were socketed for the 80287, since the 80387 did not exist yet. Other companies manufactured co-processors for the Intel x86 series.  These included [[Cyrix]] and [[Weitek]].

Coprocessors were available for the [[Motorola 68000 family]], the [[Motorola 68881|68881 and 68882]]. These were common in [[Motorola 68020]]/[[68030]]-based [[workstation]]s like the [[Sun 3]] series. They were also commonly added to higher-end models of Apple [[Macintosh]] and Commodore [[Amiga]] series, but unlike IBM PC-compatible systems, sockets for adding the coprocessor were not as common in lower end systems.

There are also add-on FPUs coprocessor units for [[microcontroller]] units (MCUs/µCs)/[[single-board computer]] (SBCs), which serve to provide floating-point [[arithmetic]] capability. These add-on FPUs are host-processor-independent, possess their own programming requirements ([[Mathematical operation|operations]], [[instruction set]]s, etc.) and are often provided with their own [[integrated development environment]]s (IDEs).

'''Georg Nees''' (23 June 1926 – 3 January 2016) was a German academic who was a pioneer of [[computer art]] and [[Generative art|generative graphics]]. He studied mathematics, physics and philosophy in [[Erlangen]] and [[Stuttgart]] and was scientific advisor at the [[Semiosis|SEMIOSIS]], International Journal of semiotics and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Semiosis, http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/kuenstler/nees/biografie/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he was appointed Honorary Professor of [[Computer science|Applied computer science]] at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]]&lt;ref&gt;Arbeitsberichte des Instituts für Informatik Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg, 2003  [https://www.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/wp-content/uploads/Jahresberichte/JB_2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Nees is one of the "3N" computer pioneers, an abbreviation that has become acknowledged for [[Frieder Nake]], Georg Nees and [[A. Michael Noll]], whose computer graphics were created with digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Klütsch (2007, Juli): Computergrafik: Ästhetische Experimente zwischen zwei Kulturen. Springer, 2007, Page 20, {{ISBN|9783211394090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst'', Staatsgalerie Stuttgart In: Katalog, 1972, Page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and studies ==
George Nees was born in 1926 in [[Nuremberg]], where he spent his childhood. He showed scientific curiosity and interest in art from a young age and among his favorite pastimes were viewing art postcards and looking through a microscope. He attended a school in [[Schwabach]] near Nuremberg, graduating in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwv-net.de/index.php?art=Grenzzeichen&amp;mod=Onlineshop&amp;view=Artikel&amp;abid=129 Autorenvita] auf der Webseite des Deutschen Wissenschafts-Verlags.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1945 to 1951, he studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Erlangen]] then worked as an [[Applied mathematics|industry mathematician]] for the [[Siemens-Schuckert|Siemens Schuckertwerk]] in Erlangen from 1951 to 1985. There he started to write his first programs in 1959.&lt;ref name="on1.zkm.de"&gt;http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$5255&lt;/ref&gt; The company was later incorporated into the [[Siemens AG]].

From 1964 onwards, he studied philosophy at the [[University of Stuttgart|Technische Hochschule Stuttgart]] (since 1967 the [[University of Stuttgart]]), under [[Max Bense]]. He received his doctorate with his thesis on [[Generative art|Generative Computergraphik]] under Max Bense in 1969. His work is considered one of the first theses on [[Generative art|Generative Computer Graphics]]. In 1969, his thesis was published as a book entitled "Generative Computergraphik" and also included examples of program code and graphics produced thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Generative Computergraphik, Siemens AG, Berlin, München, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement in 1985 Nees worked as an author and in the field of [[computer art]].

== Computer Art ==
In February 1965, Nees showed - as works of art - the world's first [[Generative art|computer graphics]] created with a [[digital computer]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart'' In: ''Katalog'', 1972, Page 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition, titled ''computer graphik'' took place at the public premises of the "Study Gallery of Stuttgart College".&lt;ref&gt;computer grafik, edition rot 19, Max Bense und Elisabeth Walther, Stuttgart, 1965,  {{ISBN|3874510190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he started to work on "computer-sculptures".&lt;ref name="Franke"&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart'' In: ''Katalog'', 1972, Page. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalog of the [[Kunsthalle Nürnberg|Biennale 1969 Nuremberg]], Nees describes how the computer program controlled the milling machine so that instead of a workpiece, a sculpture was created. Three painted wooden sculptures and several graphics were shown at the Biennale 1969 Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Computerkunst'', in: Katalog, Konstruktive Kunst: Elemente + Prinzipien, Biennale Nürnberg, 1969, No page numbers in the catalog&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 at the 35th [[Venice Biennale]] his work was part of the special exhibition "Research and Design. Proposals for an experimental exposure" and showcased his sculptures and graphics of art and architectural design.

[[File:Automatisches Zeichengeraet ZUSE Z64 ubt.JPG|thumb|Flatbed drawing machine ZUSE Z64, Photograph by Tomasz Sienicki (one work)]]
In 1963, Nees was instrumental in the purchase of a [[flatbed plotter]], the Zuse Graphomat Z64 designed by [[Konrad Zuse]], for the data center at the Schuckertwerke in Erlangen.&lt;ref&gt;http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$5232&lt;/ref&gt; At the exhibition ''Georg Nees – The Great Temptation'' at the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]] Nees said: ″There it was, the great temptation for me, for once not to represent something technical with this machine but rather something ‘useless’ – [[Geometric patterns|geometrical patterns]].″&lt;ref name="on1.zkm.de"/&gt;

Using the [[ALGOL]] language, Nees created drawings and graphics for production, art and architectural drawings. He wrote the new graphics libraries G1, G2 and G3 with ALGOL, for controlling the Z64 and [[random number generator|random number generation]].&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W. (1971), "Computers and visual art", Leonardo 4 (4): Page 331–338, {{doi|10.2307/1572504}}, {{JSTOR|1572504}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 Nees experimented with random numbers and [[Arc (geometry)|circle arcs]] (''Kreisbögen''). The graphic ''Kreisbogengewirre'' (Arc confusion)&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: "Generative Computergraphik", Siemens AG, Berlin, München, 1969, Page 236-239.&lt;/ref&gt; was a graphic of this series, also known as ''Locken''. [[Frieder Nake]] explains how this graphic was created: ″In fact, the picture does consist of one continuous path of arcs. … The length and radius of the individual arcs are randomly chosen within the limits defined by the programmer  … The picture in it present form is due to a fairly serious programming error … It was designed to be less complex and it had to be ended manually because of the error.″&lt;ref&gt;Frieder Nake: Computer Art: Where‘s the Art?; Bilder Images Digital. Computerkünstler in Deutschland 1986. München, Barke, 1986, de, en, Page 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Nees worked with the ''Siemens System 2002''&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Siemens 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; to create aesthetic graphics, such as the graphic ″gravel ″ (''Schotter'') in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Computerkunst'', in: Katalog, Konstruktive Kunst: Elemente + Prinzipien, Biennale Nürnberg, 1969.No page numbers in the catalog&lt;/ref&gt; This artwork is well known and can be seen on the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref&gt;https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O221321/schotter-print-nees-georg/.&lt;/ref&gt; When writing the program Nees introduced commands for random numbers, which produced from a designated point on the resulting chaos. This causes the graphic to develop from order to disorder or vice versa, if the graphic is turned through 180 degrees (upside down).

Robert J. Krawczyk wrote in his text ''A Shattered Perfection'': Crafting a Virtual Sculpture: ″Georg Nees’s Gravel Stones … What attracted me to this piece was the simplicity of the concept and the overall interpretation of transforming order into disorder. … What intrigues me with this "ancient" piece was the use of exact mathematical computations to model a chaotic image and the progression from the ordered to the disordered.″&lt;ref&gt;http://mypages.iit.edu/~krawczyk/rjkiv02.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer designed architecture ===
The first computer graphic produced in architecture by Nees was the motive ''corridor'' (''Flur'') in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf Herzogenrath (Hsgr.), Barbara Nierhoff-Wielk: Ex Machina - Frühe Computergrafik bis 1979: Die Sammlungen Franke und weitere Stiftungen in der Kunsthalle Bremen. Herbert W. Franke zum 80.Geburtstag. Deutscher Kunstverlag, Bremen, 2007, Page 440-443, {{ISBN|9783422066892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 started his collaboration with the architect Ludwig Rase for the Siemens Pavilion at the [[Hannover Messe|Hannover Industrial Fair]] in 1970. The drawings of the [[truss| truss roof]] was first calculated with the System 2002 and drawn with the Graphomat Z64. For the Hannover fair in 1970 the drawings were created with the modern System 4004 again. One of the drawings was printed as a poster for the Hannover Fair and for the 35th [[Venice Biennale]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf Herzogenrath (Hsgr.), Barbara Nierhoff-Wielk: Ex Machina - Frühe Computergrafik bis 1979: Die Sammlungen Franke und weitere Stiftungen in der Kunsthalle Bremen. Herbert W. Franke zum 80.Geburtstag. Deutscher Kunstverlag, Bremen, 2007, Page 443, {{ISBN|9783422066892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also computer drawings for fair pavilions of the Siemens AG, such as the "German Industry Exhibition" in [[São Paulo]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf Herzogenrath (Hsgr.), Barbara Nierhoff-Wielk: Ex Machina - Frühe Computergrafik bis 1979: Die Sammlungen Franke und weitere Stiftungen in der Kunsthalle Bremen. 2007, Page 440-443, {{ISBN|9783422066892}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[fair pavilion, São Paulo, http://www.tu-cottbus.de/projekte/de/great-engineers/ingenieure/mengeringhausen-max-1903-1988/erfindungen.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db-bauzeitung.de/allgemein/max-mengeringhausen/ fair pavilion, São Paulo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Rase experimented based on the [[cuboctahedron]] for residential dwellings and urban design&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Rase: ''Computerdesign für Raum und Fläche''. In: NOVUM Gebrauchsgraphik Heft 8, 1972, S. 48-56&lt;/ref&gt; with Nees creating the computer aided design plans for the project. The graphic "Cuboctahedron" developed during this was used for the cover and poster of the exhibition ''Computer art. nees rase'' in the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jul/5/prosthetic-knowledge-picks-algorists/ Ludwig Rase, Georg Nees: Kuboktaeder, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From 1985 on ===
Nees retired in 1985 and started his research and experiments again. He devoted his time solely to semiotics and aesthetics for media and design. He published the results from 1995 onwards in several books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;''Formel, Farbe, Form: Computerästhetik für Medien und Design'', Springer, Berlin, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Grenzzeichen. Bilder und Gedanken zu einer constraint-orientierten Ästhetik'', Deutscher Wissenschaftsverlag, Baden-Baden, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Alex Kempkens]] asked Nees whether he wished to participate in the exhibition ''Bilder Images Digital'' in the ″Gallery of the Artist″&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Galerie der Künstler|Gallery of the Artist]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Munich]], which was planned for October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Giloth, Copper; Pocock-Williams, Lynn (1990), "A Selected Chronology of Computer Art: Exhibitions, Publications, and Technology", Art Journal 49 (3): Page 292, {{doi|10.2307/777121}}, {{JSTOR|777121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helga Biesel: [http://www.computerwoche.de/a/ausstellung-digital-belebte-kunstwelt,1166909 ''Berufsverband Bildender Künstler entdeckt Computer als Handwerkszeug. Ausstellung: Digital belebte Kunstwelt.''] In: [[Computerwoche]] vom 14. November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; He said yes and created a new series of computer graphics. These graphics have a special position within the oeuvre by Nees. To generate the graphics he gave the [[Artificial intelligence|AI engine]] simple, [[Philosophy|philosophical]] as well as [[Mythology|mythical]] commands. Based on the commands, the computer produced different graphics. He wrote the programs in the Lisp language and a System 7000 calculated the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: Künstliche Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz, In: Bilder Images Digital, Barke Verlag, 1986, de, en, Page 112, {{ISBN|3-926167-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nees wrote in the exhibition catalog: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;My own computer graphics in the spring of 1986, I understand as studies on ambience, as they could be synthesized by perhaps a future Reagiblen machines. An essential part task in the design of such machines is thinking out sample dialogues, which one would like to perform with the finished instrument. The following dialog could then be feasible: ″Show me a [[sphere]].″ The automaton would respond with the production of the image ″sphere north-west-nadir.″ The dialog would continue with ″Add on the context, [[Mythology|myth]]; visualize the contrast between [[law]] and [[coincidence]].″; The response would be the image, ″Apollo and Dionysius″.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Künstliche Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz'', In: ''Bilder Images Digital'', Barke Verlag, 1986, de, en, Page 112, {{ISBN|3-926167-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The art critic Eva Karcher wrote in the interpretation of his graphics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The automaton as &gt;creativity stimulant&lt;?  A mental concept which one can only consider cautiously and which however can call in question all the hitherto binding definitions of the inviolability of the human creative capacity.Looking at the multi-patterned constructions in Nees' graphics, with their floating ellipsoids, crystalloid spheres and bizarre forms, one cannot help but acknowledge and appreciate their atmospheric and inspiration-inducing effects.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Künstliche Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz'', In: ''Bilder Images Digital'', Barke Verlag, 1986, de, en, Page 114, {{ISBN|3-926167-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nees died on 3 January 2016 at the age of 89.&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/agent/15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Modern generative graphic design ===

{{main|Generative Design}}
Georg Nees was not only a pioneer of computer art, but also one of the grandfathers of computer supported design processes – the [[Generative Design]].
In 1963, the Zuse Graphomat Z64 was used to draw technical plans, which are required for the manufacture of parts and products. As he said, he thought also of his ideas - to make experimental and generative design. The reason for him to write the book "Formel - Farbe - Form", 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783642633850&lt;/ref&gt; was to convey his knowledge about "Computer aesthetics of Media and Design" - based on generative design - to the next generation of designers. The current generation of designers uses as professional title for example "generative design" and operates under the concept of generative Design, data driven art or computational design. Nees also makes it one of the progenitors of today's generative design for art, advertising and animation – based on his Ph.D. thesis ''Generative Computergraphik'' and the book ''Generative Computergraphik'' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: "Generative Computergraphik", Siemens AG, Berlin, München, 1969.

[[File:Glide reflection.svg|right|thumb|300px|Example of a glide reflection: A composite of a reflection across a line and a translation parallel to the line of reflection]]
[[File:Krok_6.png|300px|thumb|A glide reflection will map a set of left and right footprints into each other]]
In 2-dimensional [[geometry]], a '''glide reflection''' (or '''transflection''') is a type of [[opposite isometry]] of the [[Euclidean plane]]: the composition of a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a line and a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] along that line.

A single glide is represented as [[frieze group]] p11g. A glide reflection can be seen as a limiting [[rotoreflection]], where the rotation becomes a translation.  It can also be given a [[Schoenflies notation]] as S&lt;sub&gt;2∞&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Coxeter notation]] as [∞&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and [[orbifold notation]] as ∞×.

==Description==
The combination of a reflection in a line and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel line. However, a glide reflection cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with ''any'' translation is a glide reflection, with as special case just a reflection. These are the two kinds of indirect [[Euclidean group#Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions|isometries in 2D]].

For example, there is an isometry consisting of the reflection on the ''x''-axis, followed by translation of one unit parallel to it. In coordinates, it takes

:(''x'', ''y'') → (''x'' + 1, −''y'').

It fixes a system of parallel lines.

The [[isometry group]] generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite [[cyclic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Transformation Geometry: An Introduction to Symmetry|series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|first=George E.|last=Martin|publisher=Springer|year=1982|isbn=9780387906362|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KW4EwONsQJgC&amp;pg=PA64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining two equal glide reflections gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even powers of the glide reflection form a translation group.

In the case of '''glide reflection symmetry''', the [[symmetry group]] of an object contains a glide reflection, and hence the group generated by it. If that is all it contains, this type is [[frieze group]] p11g.

Example pattern with this symmetry group:
:[[File:Frieze example p11g.png]]

Frieze group nr. 6 (glide-reflections, translations and rotations) is generated by a glide reflection and a rotation about a point on the line of reflection. It is isomorphic to a [[semi-direct product]] of '''Z''' and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Example pattern with this symmetry group:
:[[File:Frieze example p2mg.png]]

A typical example of glide reflection in everyday life would be the track of footprints left in the sand by a person walking on a beach.

For any symmetry group containing some glide reflection symmetry, the translation vector of any glide reflection is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide reflection is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide reflection symmetry reduces to a combination of [[reflection symmetry]] and [[translational symmetry]].

Glide reflection symmetry with respect to two parallel lines with the same translation implies that there is also translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to these lines, with a translation distance which is twice the distance between glide reflection lines. This corresponds to [[wallpaper group]] pg; with additional symmetry it occurs also in pmg, pgg and p4g.

If there are also true reflection lines in the same direction then they are evenly spaced between the glide reflection lines. A glide reflection line parallel to a true reflection line already implies this situation. This corresponds to wallpaper group cm. The translational symmetry is given by oblique translation vectors from one point on a true reflection line to two points on the next, supporting a [[rhombus]] with the true reflection line as one of the diagonals. With additional symmetry it occurs also in cmm, p3m1, p31m, p4m and p6m.

In 3D the glide reflection is called a '''[[glide plane]]'''. It is a reflection in a plane combined with a translation parallel to the plane.

== Wallpaper groups ==
In the [[Euclidean plane]] 3 of 17 [[wallpaper group]]s require glide reflection generators. p2gg has orthogonal glide reflections and 2-fold rotations. cm has parallel mirrors and glides, and pg has parallel glides. (Glide reflections are shown below as dashed lines)

==Glide reflection in nature and games==
Glide symmetry can be observed in nature among certain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]]; the [[machaeridian]]s; and certain [[palaeoscolecid]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Waggoner | first1 = B.

==Studies==

===Cognitive impact===
Around 1987, Anna Sierpińska introduced Grandi's series to a group of 17-year-old precalculus students at a [[Warsaw]] [[lyceum]]. She focused on humanities students with the expectation that their mathematical experience would be less significant than that of their peers studying mathematics and physics, so the [[epistemology|epistemological]] obstacles they exhibit would be more representative of the obstacles that ''may'' still be present in lyceum students.

Sierpińska initially expected the students to balk at assigning a value to Grandi's series, at which point she could shock them by claiming that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a result of the geometric series formula. Ideally, by searching for the error in reasoning and by investigating the formula for various common ratios, the students would "notice that there are two kinds of series and an implicit conception of convergence will be born." However, the students showed no shock at being told that {{nowrap|1=1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or even that {{nowrap|1=[[1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + · · ·]] = −1}}. Sierpińska remarks that ''a priori'', the students' reaction shouldn't be too surprising given that Leibniz and Grandi thought &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be a plausible result;

:"A posteriori, however, the explanation of this lack of shock on the part of the students may be somewhat different. They accepted calmly the absurdity because, after all, 'mathematics is completely abstract and far from reality', and 'with those mathematical transformations you can prove all kinds of nonsense', as one of the boys later said."

The students were ultimately not immune to the question of convergence; Sierpińska succeeded in engaging them in the issue by linking it to decimal expansions the following day. As soon as [[0.999...]] = 1 caught the students by surprise, the rest of her material "went past their ears".&lt;ref&gt;Sierpińska pp.371-378&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preconceptions===
In another study conducted in [[Treviso]], [[Italy]] around the year 2000, third-year and fourth-year ''[[Liceo Scientifico]]'' pupils (between 16 and 18 years old) were given cards asking the following:

:"In 1703, the mathematician Guido Grandi studied the addition: 1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;... (addends, infinitely many, are always +1 and –1). What is your opinion about it?"

The students had been introduced to the idea of an infinite set, but they had no prior experience with infinite series. They were given ten minutes without books or calculators. The 88 responses were categorized as follows:

:(26) the result is 0
:(18) the result can be either 0 or 1
:(5) the result does not exist
:(4) the result is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:(3) the result is 1
:(2) the result is infinite
:(30) no answer

The researcher, Giorgio Bagni, interviewed several of the students to determine their reasoning. Some 16 of them justified an answer of 0 using logic similar to that of Grandi and Riccati. Others justified &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as being the average of 0 and 1. Bagni notes that their reasoning, while similar to Leibniz's, lacks the probabilistic basis that was so important to 18th-century mathematics. He concludes that the responses are consistent with a link between historical development and individual development, although the cultural context is different.&lt;ref&gt;Bagni pp.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prospects==
Joel Lehmann describes the process of distinguishing between different sum concepts as building a bridge over a conceptual crevasse: the confusion over divergence that dogged 18th-century mathematics.

:"Since series are generally presented without history and separate from applications, the student must wonder not only "What are these things?" but also "Why are we doing this?" The preoccupation with determining convergence but not the sum makes the whole process seem artificial and pointless to many students—and instructors as well."

As a result, many students develop an attitude similar to Euler's:
:"…problems that arise naturally (i.e., from nature) do have solutions, so the assumption that things will work out eventually is justified experimentally without the need for existence sorts of proof. Assume everything is okay, and if the arrived-at solution works, you were probably right, or at least right enough. …so why bother with the details that only show up in homework problems?"

Lehmann recommends meeting this objection with the same example that was advanced against Euler's treatment of Grandi's series by Callet.{{Clarify|date=October 2012}}

'''Hatch marks''' (also called '''hash marks''' or '''tick marks''') are a form of mathematical notation. They are used in three ways: 
* Unit and value marks — as on a ruler or number line
* Congruency notation — as on a geometric figure
* Graphed points — as on a [[Chart|graph]]

Hatch marks are frequently used as an abbreviation of some common units of measurement. In  regard to distance, a single hatch mark indicates feet, and two hatch marks indicate inches. In regard to time, a single hatch mark indicates minutes, and two hatch marks indicate seconds.
In [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]], such marks are used following an [[Degree symbol|elevated circle]] to indicate degrees, minutes, and seconds — '''(&amp;nbsp;°&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;&amp;Prime;&amp;nbsp;).'''

Hatch marks can probably be traced to [[hatching]] in art works, where the pattern of the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue. Different patterns indicate different tones.

==Unit and value marks==
Unit-and-value hatch marks are short vertical line segments which mark distances. They are seen on [[ruler]]s and [[number line]]s. The marks are parallel to each other and are evenly spaced.

The distance between adjacent marks is one unit. Longer line segments are used for [[integer]]s and [[natural number]]s. Shorter line segments are used for [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s.

Hatch marks provide a visual clue as to the value of specific points on the number line, even if some hatch marks are not labeled with a number.

Hatch marks are typically seen in [[number theory]] and [[geometry]].
 &lt;----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----|----'''|'''----&gt;
 
          -3        -2        -1         0         1         2         3

==Congruency notation==
[[Image:Hatch marks.svg|thumb|300px|Matching hatch marks are used here to indicate equal lengths. The two triangles are [[congruence relation|congruent]] and are [[ mirror image]]s of each other.]]
In [[geometry]], hatch marks are used to denote equal measures of angles, arcs, line segments, or other elements. 

Hatch marks for congruency notation are in the style of [[tally mark]]s or of [[Roman numerals]] – with some qualifications. These marks are without [[serif]]s, and some patterns are not used. For example, the numbers I, II, III, V, and X are used, but IV and VI are not used since a rotation of 180 degrees can make a 4 easily confused with a 6.

For example, if two triangles are drawn, the first pair of [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] sides can be marked with a single hatch mark on each. The second pair of congruent sides can be marked with two hatch marks each. The patterns are not alike: one pair uses one mark while the other pair uses two marks (Figure 1). This use of pattern makes it clear which sides are the same length even if the sides cannot be measured. If the sides do not appear to be congruent, as long as hatch marks are present and are the same number of hatch marks then the sides are congruent.

Note that the inverse situation should not be assumed.  That is, while sides that are hatch marked identically must be assumed to be congruent, it does not follow that sides hatch marked ''differently'' must be ''incongruent''.  The different hatch marks simply signal that the lengths may be taken to be independent of each other.  So, for example, while the triangles (Figure 1) cannot be shown to be [[Isosceles_triangle|isosceles triangles]] or [[Equilateral_triangle|equilateral triangles]], nevertheless the possibility that they ''could'' be either of those things is not precluded based on what is shown.

==Graphed points==
[[Line chart]]s may sometimes use hatch marks as graphed points. In the early days of computers, monitors and printers could only make charts using the characters available on a common typewriter. To graph a line chart of sales over time, symbols such as *, x, or | were used to mark points and various characters were used to mark the lines connecting them. While computers have advanced considerably, it is still not unusual to see x or | used as the points of interest or points of change on a graph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">In [[statistics]], the '''Hájek–Le Cam convolution theorem''' states that any [[regular estimator]] in a [[parametric model]] is asymptotically equivalent to a sum of two [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] random variables, one of which is [[normal distribution|normal]] with asymptotic variance equal to the inverse of [[Fisher information]], and the other having arbitrary distribution.

The obvious corollary from this theorem is that the “best” among regular estimators are those with the second component identically equal to zero. Such estimators are called '''efficient''' and are known to always exist for [[parametric model#Regular parametric model|regular parametric model]]s.

The theorem is named after [[Jaroslav Hájek]] and [[Lucien Le Cam]].

== Theorem statement ==
Let ℘ = {''P&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''θ''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Θ&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;} be a [[parametric model#Regular parametric model|regular parametric model]], and ''q''(''θ''): Θ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; be a parameter in this model (typically a parameter is just one of the components of vector&amp;nbsp;''θ''). Assume that function ''q'' is differentiable on Θ, with the ''m&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;k'' matrix of derivatives denoted as ''q̇&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''. Define

: &lt;math&gt; I_{q(\theta)}^{-1} = \dot{q}(\theta)I^{-1}(\theta)\dot{q}(\theta)'&lt;/math&gt;  — the ''information bound'' for ''q'',

: &lt;math&gt; \psi_{q(\theta)} = \dot{q}(\theta)I^{-1}(\theta)\dot\ell(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;  — the ''efficient influence function'' for ''q'',

where ''I''(''θ'') is the [[Fisher information]] matrix for model ℘, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\dot\ell(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[score (statistics)|score function]], and ′ denotes [[matrix transpose]].

&lt;br/&gt;
'''Theorem''' {{harv|Bickel|1998|loc=Th.2.3.1}}. Suppose ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a uniformly (locally) [[regular estimator]] of the parameter ''q''. Then
&lt;ol type=A&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There exist independent random ''m''-vectors &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_\theta\,\sim\,\mathcal{N}(0,\,I^{-1}_{q(\theta)})&lt;/math&gt; and ''Δ&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that
: &lt;math&gt;
    \sqrt{n}(T_n - q(\theta)) \ \xrightarrow{d}\ Z_\theta + \Delta_\theta,
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes [[convergence in distribution]]. More specifically,
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \sqrt{n}(T_n - q(\theta)) - \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n \psi_{q(\theta)}(x_i) \\
      \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n \psi_{q(\theta)}(x_i)
    \end{pmatrix}
    \ \xrightarrow{d}\ 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \Delta_\theta \\
      Z_\theta
    \end{pmatrix}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If the map ''θ'' → ''q̇&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is continuous, then the convergence in (A) holds uniformly on compact subsets of Θ. Moreover, in that case Δ&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all ''θ'' if and only if ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is uniformly (locally) asymptotically linear with influence function ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''q''(''θ'')&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT), some discipline within [[mathematical logic]], '''induction-induction''' is for simultaneously declaring some inductive type and some inductive predicate over this type.

An [[inductive definition]] is given by rules for generating elements of some type. One can then define some predicate on that type by providing constructors for forming the elements of the predicate , such inductively on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-induction generalizes this situation since one can ''simultaneously'' define the type and the predicate, because '''the rules for generating elements of the type''' &lt;math&gt;A : \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt; '''are allowed to refer to the predicate''' &lt;math&gt;B : A \to \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;.

Induction-induction can be used to define larger types including various universe constructions in type theory.&lt;ref name=Dybjer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A general formulation of simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions in type theory|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=65|issue=2|date=June 2000|pages=525–549|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/Inductive_Recursive.pdf|doi=10.2307/2586554|jstor=2586554|citeseerx=10.1.1.6.4575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limit constructions in category/topos theory&lt;ref name=1337777.OOO&gt;1337777.OOO : ''limit objects depend on morphisms , BUT THIS DEPENDENCE NEED-NOT BE GRAMMATICAL !'' , https://github.com/1337777/cartier/blob/master/cartierSolution3.v&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example 1 ==

Present the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as having the following constructors , note the early reference to the predicate &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; :

* &lt;math&gt;aa : A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ell\ell : \prod_{x : A} B(x) \to A ; &lt;/math&gt;

and-simultaneously present the predicate &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as having the following constructors :

* &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Tru} : B(aa)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Fal} : B(aa)&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x : A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y : B(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Zer} : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x : A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y : B(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Suc}(z) : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;.

As you can see, we gave rules for generating the elements of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which amount to saying that &lt;math&gt;B(aa)&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the booleans, and &lt;math&gt;B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the natural numbers.

== Example 2 ==

A simple common example is the Universe à la  Tarski type former.  It creates some inductive type &lt;math&gt;U : \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt; and some inductive predicate &lt;math&gt;T : U \to \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;. For every type in the type theory (except &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; itself!), there will be some element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; which may be seen as some code for this corresponding type ; The predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; inductively encodes each possible type to the corresponding element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; ; and constructing new codes in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; will require referring to the decoding-as-type of earlier codes , via the predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; .

In 1996, V. Utkin and J. Shi proposed an improved sliding control method named '''integral sliding mode control (ISMC)'''. In contrast with conventional [[sliding mode control]], the system motion under integral sliding mode has a dimension equal to that of the [[state space]]. In ISMC, the system trajectory always starts from the sliding surface.
Accordingly, the reaching phase is eliminated, and robustness in the whole state space is promised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V21-4FPX2SY-1&amp;_user=37161&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1273627224&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000004218&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=37161&amp;md5=4dd5f1f88068a6dd138950259fd1d341]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control scheme==
For a [[system]] &lt;math&gt;\overset{\cdot }{x}=f(x)+B(x)u+h(x)&lt;/math&gt;, an integral sliding surface can be designed as

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma (t)=Gx(t)-Gx(0)-\int_0^t [GBu_0(\tau )+Gf(x(\tau ))] \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Doing so, &lt;math&gt;\sigma (0)=0&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed, and the reaching mode during which the system is sensitive to noise in normal sliding mode is eliminated.

'''Guillaume-Jules Hoüel''' (7 April 1823 – 14 June 1886) was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]]. He entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1843 and received his doctoral degree in 1855 from the [[Sorbonne]]. He was sought by [[Urbain Le Verrier]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], but chose instead to return to Thaon to study there. In 1859 he began to teach at [[Bordeaux]].

In 1863 Hoüel expressed his doubts about the verifiability of the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclid]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Houel (1863) "Essai d'une expositin rationelle des principes fondamentaux de la geometrie elementaire", ''Archiv der Mathematik und Physik'' 40: 171–211&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 Hoüel produced French translations of two key publications of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]: [[Lobachevski]]'s ''Geometrical Studies on the Theory of Parallels''&lt;ref&gt;J. Hoüel (1867) "Etudes geometriques sur la theorie des parallels", ''Mémoirs de la Société des Sciences Physiques et Naturalles de Bordeaux'' 4: 83–128, reprinted by Gauthier-Villars&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bolyai]]'s ''Science of Absolute Space''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hoüel (1867) "La Science absolute de l'espace", ''Mémoirs de la Société des Sciences Physiques et Naturalles de Bordeaux'' 5: 189–248&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoüel published a four volume work titled ''Théorie Élémentaire des Quantités Complexes''. Volume four, published in 1874, began with an discussion of properties of algebraic operations (commutativity, associativity, distribution, and inverses) and used the algebra of [[quaternion]]s and [[versor]]s to describe [[spherical trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hoüel (1874) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tisLAAAAYAAJ Éléments de la Théorie des Quaternions], Gauthier-Villars publisher, link from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1890 [[P. G. Tait]] revealed his dissatisfaction with Hoüel's changes in notation with text that Tait had given for Hoüel's use. Tait wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[P. G. Tait]] (1890) [https://archive.org/details/117770257 An Elementary Treatise on Quaternions], 3rd edition, p. vi, [[Cambridge University Press]], link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:The earliest offender in this class was the late M. Hoüel who, while availing himself of my permission to reproduce, in his ''Théorie Élémentaire des Quantités Complexes'', large parts of this volume, made his pages absolutely repulsive by introducing fancied improvements in the notation.

In 1876 Hoüel reviewed a [[Russian language]] quaternion textbook written by Romer (1868)&lt;ref&gt;J. Hoüel (1876) "Principles fundamentaux de la Méthode de Quaternions", ''Bulletin ces Sciences Mathématiques et Astronomique'' 11: 113,4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">This page will attempt to list '''examples''' in mathematics.  To qualify for inclusion, an article should be about a mathematical object with a fair amount of concreteness.  Usually a definition of an abstract concept, a theorem, or a proof would not be an "example" as the term should be understood here (an elegant proof of an isolated but particularly striking fact, as opposed to a proof of a general theorem, could perhaps be considered an "example").  The discussion page for [[list of mathematical topics]] has some comments on this.  Eventually this page may have its own discussion page.  This page links to itself in order that edits to this page will be included among '''related changes''' when the user clicks on that button.

The concrete example within the article titled [[Rao-Blackwell theorem]] is perhaps one of the best ways for a [[List of mathematical probabilists|probabilist]] ignorant of statistical inference to get a quick impression of the flavor of that subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19997">In [[graph theory]] and [[theoretical computer science]], the '''longest path problem''' is the problem of finding a simple [[path (graph theory)|path]] of maximum length in a given graph. A path is called simple if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in [[weighted graph]]s) by the sum of the weights of its edges. In contrast to the [[shortest path problem]], which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative-weight cycles, the longest path problem is [[NP-hard]], meaning that it cannot be solved in [[polynomial time]] for arbitrary graphs unless&amp;nbsp;[[P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP]]. Stronger hardness results are also known showing that it is difficult to [[approximation algorithm|approximate]]. However, it has a [[linear time]] solution for [[directed acyclic graph]]s, which has important applications in finding the [[Critical path method|critical path]] in scheduling problems.

==NP-hardness==
The NP-hardness of the unweighted longest path problem can be shown using a reduction from the [[Hamiltonian path problem]]: a graph ''G'' has a Hamiltonian path if and only if its longest path has length ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, where ''n'' is the number of vertices in ''G''. Because the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete, this reduction shows that the [[decision problem|decision version]] of the longest path problem is also NP-complete. In this decision problem, the input is a graph ''G'' and a number ''k''; the desired output is "yes" if ''G'' contains a path of ''k'' or more edges, and ''no'' otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorial Optimization: Polyhedra and Efficiency, Volume 1|volume=24|series=Algorithms and Combinatorics|first=Alexander|last=Schrijver|authorlink=Alexander Schrijver|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=9783540443896|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqGeSQ6dJycC&amp;pg=PA114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the longest path problem could be solved in polynomial time, it could be used to solve this decision problem, by finding a longest path and then comparing its length to the number&amp;nbsp;''k''. Therefore, the longest path problem is NP-hard. The question "does there exist a simple path in a given graph with at least ''k'' edges" is NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction To Algorithms|first1=Thomas H.|last1=Cormen|author1-link=Thomas H. Cormen|first2=Charles E.|last2=Leiserson|author2-link=Charles E. Leiserson|first3=Ronald L.|last3=Rivest|author3-link=Ron Rivest|first4=Clifford|last4=Stein|author4-link=Clifford Stein|edition=2nd|publisher=MIT Press|year=2001|isbn=9780262032933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLngYyWFl_YC&amp;pg=PA978|page=978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In weighted [[complete graph]]s with non-negative edge weights, the weighted longest path problem is the same as the [[Travelling salesman problem|Travelling salesman path problem]], because the longest path always includes all vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorial Optimization: Networks and Matroids|first=Eugene L.|last=Lawler|authorlink=Eugene Lawler|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2001|isbn=9780486414539|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4MvtFenVjEC&amp;pg=PA64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acyclic graphs and critical paths==
A longest path between two given vertices ''s'' and ''t'' in a weighted graph ''G'' is the same thing as a shortest path in a graph −''G'' derived from ''G'' by changing every weight to its negation. Therefore, if shortest paths can be found in −''G'', then longest paths can also be found in ''G''.&lt;ref name="sedge"/&gt;

For most graphs, this transformation is not useful because it creates cycles of negative length in −''G''. But if ''G'' is a [[directed acyclic graph]], then no negative cycles can be created, and a longest path in ''G'' can be found in [[linear time]] by applying a linear time algorithm for shortest paths in −''G'', which is also a directed acyclic graph.&lt;ref name="sedge"&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithms|first1=Robert|last1=Sedgewick|author1-link=Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|first2=Kevin Daniel|last2=Wayne|edition=4th|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=2011|isbn=9780321573513|pages=661–666|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idUdqdDXqnAC&amp;pg=PA661}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, for each vertex ''v'' in a given DAG, the length of the longest path ending at ''v'' may be obtained by the following steps:
# Find a [[topological ordering]] of the given DAG.
# For each vertex ''v'' of the DAG, in the topological ordering, compute the length of the longest path ending at ''v'' by looking at its incoming neighbors and adding one to the maximum length recorded for those neighbors. If ''v'' has no incoming neighbors, set the length of the longest path ending at ''v'' to zero. In either case, record this number so that later steps of the algorithm can access it.
Once this has been done, the longest path in the whole DAG may be obtained by starting at the vertex ''v'' with the largest recorded value, then repeatedly stepping backwards to its incoming neighbor with the largest recorded value, and reversing the sequence of vertices found in this way.

The [[critical path method]] for scheduling a set of activities involves the construction of a directed acyclic graph in which the vertices represent project milestones and the edges represent activities that must be performed after one milestone and before another; each edge is weighted by an estimate of the amount of time the corresponding activity will take to complete. In such a graph, the longest path from the first milestone to the last one is the critical path, which describes the total time for completing the project.&lt;ref name="sedge"/&gt;

Longest paths of directed acyclic graphs may also be applied in [[layered graph drawing]]: assigning each vertex ''v'' of a directed acyclic graph ''G'' to the layer whose number is the length of the longest path ending at ''v'' results in a layer assignment for ''G'' with the minimum possible number of layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the problem cannot be approximated to within a factor of &lt;math&gt;n^{1-\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; unless P = NP, and with stronger complexity-theoretic assumptions it cannot be approximated to within a factor of &lt;math&gt;n/\log^{2+\epsilon} n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="bhk04"/&gt; The [[color-coding]] technique can be used to find paths of logarithmic length, if they exist, but this gives an approximation ratio of only &lt;math&gt;O(n/\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="ayz"&gt;{{citation

==Parameterized complexity==
The longest path problem is [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] when parameterized by the length of the path. For instance, it can be solved in time linear in the size of the input graph (but exponential in the length of the path), by an algorithm that performs the following steps:
# Perform a [[depth-first search]] of the graph. Let &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; be the depth of the resulting [[Trémaux tree|depth-first search tree]].
# Use the sequence of root-to-leaf paths of the depth-first search tree, in the order in which they were traversed by the search, to construct a [[path decomposition]] of the graph, with pathwidth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
# Apply [[dynamic programming]] to this path decomposition to find a longest path in time &lt;math&gt;O(d!2^dn)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of vertices in the graph.
Since the output path has length at least as large as &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the running time is also bounded by &lt;math&gt;O(\ell!2^\ell n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the longest path.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For graphs of bounded [[clique-width]], the longest path can also be solved by a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm. However, the exponent of the polynomial depends on the clique-width of the graph, so this algorithms is not fixed-parameter tractable. The longest path problem, parameterized by clique-width, is hard for the [[parameterized complexity]] class &lt;math&gt;W[1]&lt;/math&gt;, showing that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is unlikely to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Furthermore, the longest path problem is solvable in polynomial time on any class of graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded clique-width, such as the [[distance-hereditary graph]]s. Finally, it is clearly NP-hard on all graph classes on which the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-hard, such as on [[split graph]]s, [[circle graph]]s, and [[planar graph]]s.

[[File:Bachlut1.gif|thumb|250px|Hand-written musical notation by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). This is the beginning of the ''Prelude from the Suite for Lute in G minor'' BWV 995 (transcription of ''Cello Suite No. 5'', BWV 1011).]]
'''Music notation''' or '''musical notation''' is any system used to visually represent [[wikt:aurally|aurally]] perceived [[music]] played with [[instrument (music)|instruments]] or [[singing|sung]] by the [[human voice]] through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols.

Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional [[classical music]] performers, [[sheet music]] using staves and noteheads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s, the [[Nashville Number System]] is the main method.

The symbols used include ancient symbols and [[modern musical symbols|modern symbols]] made upon any media such as symbols cut into stone, made in [[clay tablet]]s, made using a pen on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] or [[manuscript paper]]; printed using a [[printing press]] (ca. 1400s), a [[computer printer]] (ca. 1980s) or other [[Music engraving|printing]] or [[Photocopier|modern copying technology]].

Although many ancient cultures used symbols to represent [[melody|melodies]] and [[rhythm]]s, none of them were particularly comprehensive, and this has limited today's understanding of their music. The seeds of what would eventually become modern western notation were sown in [[Medieval music|medieval]] Europe, starting with the [[Catholic church|Catholic Church]]'s goal for ecclesiastical uniformity.  The church began notating [[plainchant]] melodies so that the same chants could be used throughout the church. Music notation developed further in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]] eras. In the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] (1750–1820) and the [[Romantic music era]] (1820–1900), notation continued to develop as new [[music technology (mechanical)|musical instrument technologies]] were developed. In the [[contemporary classical music]] of the 20th and 21st century, music notation has continued to develop, with the introduction of [[graphical notation (music)|graphical notation]] by some modern composers and the use, since the 1980s, of computer-based [[scorewriter|score writer]] programs for notating music. Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music, including classical music, [[popular music]], and [[traditional music]

Buccellati Urkesh website (n.p.: IIMAS, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]), in about 1400 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer &amp; Civil 1986,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet from about 1250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer 1965,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994a"&gt;West 1994, 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994b"&gt;West 1994, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
{{further|Musical system of ancient Greece}}

[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

Three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. The [[Delphic Hymns]], dated to the 2nd century BC, also use this notation, but they are not completely preserved. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Western Roman Empire]].

===Byzantine Empire===
{{further|Byzantine music}}
[[File:Stavropoleos-anastasimatar-macarie-viena-1823-p11.png|thumb|right|250px|Byzantine music notation style in a Romanian ''anastasimatarion'', a "Book of Hymns at the Lord's Resurrection", 1823]]

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] music has mainly survived as music for court ceremonies, including vocal religious music. It is not known if it is based on the [[monody|monodic]] [[Musical mode#Greek scales|modal]] singing and instrumental music of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek theoretical categories played a key role to understand and transmit Byzantine music, especially the tradition of Damascus had a strong impact on the pre-Islamic [[Near East]] comparable to [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]].

Unlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps in relation to a clef or modal key ([[Enechema|modal signatures]] which had been in use since papyrus fragments dating back to the 6th century). Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the [[echos]]. Despite [[ekphonetic notation]] further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Today we can only the study the evolution of notation within Greek monastic chant books like those of the [[Sticheron|sticherarion]] and  the [[Irmologion|heirmologion]], while there is no authentic asmatikon and kontakarion of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite. The earliest books which have survived, are in Slavonic translation which already show an own notation system (see [[#Russia|Russia]]) used in [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] and [[Ohrid|Macedonia]] during the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted like in certain Syriac manuscripts). The question of rhythm was entirely based on cheironomia, well-known melodical phrases given by gestures of the [[Cantor (Christianity)|choirleaders]], which existed once as part of an oral tradition.

Today the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are ''differential'' rather than absolute, i.e. they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians know to deduce correctly, from the score and the note they are singing presently, which correct interval is meant.  These step symbols themselves, or better "phonic neumes", resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called ''gántzoi'' ("hooks") in [[Modern Greek]].

Notes as pitch classes or modal keys (usually memorised by modal signatures) are represented in written form only between these neumes (in manuscripts usually written in red ink). In modern notation they simply serve as an optional reminder and modal and tempo directions have been added, if necessary. In Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant a temporary change into another echos.

The so-called "great signs" were once related to cheironomic signs; according to modern interpretations they are understood as embellishments and microtonal attractions (pitch changes smaller than a [[semitone]]), both essential in Byzantine chant.&lt;ref&gt;See Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2000|2000]]) for a historical discussion of the great signs and their modern interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChrysanthosTable.png|thumb|400px|center|Chrysanthos' ''Kanonion'' with a comparison between Ancient Greek tetraphonia (column 1), Western [[Solfeggio]], the ''Papadic Parallage'' (ascending: column 3 and 4; descending: column 5 and 6) according to the ''trochos system'', and his heptaphonic ''parallage'' according to the New Method (syllables in the fore-last and ''martyriai'' in the last column) ([[#Chr1832|1832, p. 33]])]]

Since [[Chrysanthos of Madytos]] there are seven standard note names used for "solfège" (''parallagē'') ''pá, vú, g&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;á, d&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ē, ké, zō, nē'', while the older practice still used the four enechemata or intonation formulas of the four echoi given by the modal signatures, the authentic or "kyrioi" in ascending direction, and the plagal or "plagioi" in descending direction ([[Papadic Octoechos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832]]) made a difference between his monosyllabic and the traditional polysyllabic ''parallage.''&lt;/ref&gt; With exception of ''vú and zō'' they do roughly correspond to Western solmization syllables as ''re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do''.  Byzantine music uses the eight natural, non-tempered scales whose elements were identified by ''Ēkhoi'', "sounds", exclusively, and therefore the absolute pitch of each note may slightly vary each time, depending on the particular ''Ēkhos'' used.  Byzantine notation is still used in many Orthodox Churches.  Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western or Kievan staff notation while adding non-notatable embellishment material from memory and "sliding" into the natural scales from experience, but even concerning modern neume editions since the reform of Chrysanthos a lot of details are only known from an oral tradition related to traditional masters and their experience.

===13th-century Near East===
In 1252, [[Safi al-Din al-Urmawi]] developed a form of musical notation, where [[rhythm]]s were represented by [[Geometry|geometric]] representation. Many subsequent scholars of rhythm have sought to develop graphical geometrical notations. For example, a similar geometric system was published in 1987 by Kjell Gustafson, whose method represents a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toussaint|2004|loc=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Europe===
{{Main|Neume}}

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|Music notation from an early 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]
The scholar and music theorist [[Isidore of Seville]], while writing in the early 7th century, considered that "unless sounds are held by the memory of man, they perish, because they cannot be written down."&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville 2006, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 9th century, however, a form of neumatic notation began to develop in monasteries in Europe as a [[mnemonic]] device for [[Gregorian chant]], using symbols known as [[neume]]s; the earliest surviving musical notation of this type is in the ''Musica disciplina'' of [[Aurelian of Réôme]], from about 850. There are scattered survivals from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] before this time, of a type of notation known as [[Neume|Visigothic neumes]], but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Zapke 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--A complex issue, to be sure, but this book has 480 pages. Surely it does not take that long to demonstrate that nothing at all has been deciphered.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this notation was that it only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not be read by someone who did not know the music already.

[[File:EarlyMusicNotation.JPG|250px|thumb|Early music notation]]

Notation had developed far enough to notate melody, but there was still no system for notating rhythm. A mid-13th-century treatise, ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'', explains a set of six [[rhythmic modes]] that were in use at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen 2002, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear how they were formed. These rhythmic modes were all in triple time and rather limited rhythm in chant to six different repeating patterns. This was a flaw seen by German music theorist [[Franco of Cologne]] and summarised as part of his treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (the art of measured chant, or [[mensural notation]]). He suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented by the shape of the note. Not until the 14th century did something like the present system of fixed note lengths arise.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The use of regular measures (bars) became commonplace by the end of the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The founder of what is now considered the standard music stave was [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]],&lt;ref name="Catholic encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07065a.htm Otten 1910].&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033. He taught the use of [[solmization]] syllables based on a hymn to [[Saint John the Baptist]], which begins [[Ut Queant Laxis]] and was written by the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]]. The first stanza is:

# '''Ut''' queant laxis
# '''re'''sonare fibris,
# '''Mi'''ra gestorum
# '''fa'''muli tuorum,
# '''Sol'''ve polluti
# '''la'''bii reatum,
# '''S'''ancte '''I'''ohannes.

Guido used the first syllable of each line, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si, to read notated music in terms of [[Guidonian hand#Hexachord in Middle Ages|hexachords]]; they were not note names, and each could, depending on context, be applied to any note. In the 17th century, Ut was changed in most countries except France to the easily singable, "open" syllable Do, said to have been taken from the name of the Italian theorist [[Giovanni Battista Doni]],
but rather Do have been taken from the word "Dominus" in Latin with the meaning "the Lord". &lt;ref&gt;McNaught 1893, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, Neitz, and Battani 2003, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1994|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern staff notation==
{{Main|List of musical symbols}}

[[File:Chopin Prelude 7.svg|thumb|500px|An example of modern musical notation: Prelude, Op. 28, No. 7, by [[Frédéric Chopin]] {{audio|Chopin Prelude 7.mid|Play}}]]

Modern music notation is used by musicians of many different genres throughout the world. The staff acts as a framework upon which pitches are indicated by placing round [[Musical note|note]]s on the staff lines or between the lines. The pitch of the round musical notes can be modified by [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The duration (note length) is shown with different [[note value]]s, which can be indicated by the note being just a circle (a [[whole note]]) or using stems to indicate [[quarter note]]s and other subdivisions, and additional symbols such as [[dotted note|dots]] and [[Tie (music)|ties]] which lengthen the duration of a note. Notation is read from left to right, which makes setting music for right-to-left scripts difficult.

A staff (or stave, in British English) of written music generally begins with a [[clef]], which indicates the position of one particular note on the staff. The [[treble clef]] or G clef was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five line staff as the note G above middle C. The [[bass clef]] or F clef shows the position of the note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs, other clefs are used, such as the [[alto clef]] (used for [[viola]] and [[alto trombone]] music) and the [[tenor clef]] (used for some [[cello]] and [[double bass]] music). Notes representing a pitch outside of the scope of the five line staff can be represented using [[ledger line]]s, which provide a single note with additional lines and spaces. Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute, which use [[treble clef]] and [[double bass]] and [[tuba]], which use [[bass clef]]. Some instruments regularly use both clefs, such as [[piano]] and [[pipe organ]].

Following the clef, the [[key signature]] on a staff indicates the [[key (music)|key]] of the piece or song by specifying that certain notes are flat or sharp throughout the piece, unless otherwise indicated with [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] added before certain notes. When a sharp is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone higher. When a flat is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone lower. [[Double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s are less common, but they are used. A double sharp is placed before a note to make it two semitones higher. A double flat is placed before a note to make it two semitones lower. A [[natural sign]] placed before a note renders that note in its "natural" form, which means that any sharps or flats applying to that note from the key signature or from accidentals are cancelled. Sometimes a [[courtesy accidental]] is used in music where it is not technically required, to remind the musician of what pitch the key signature requires.

Following the key signature is the [[time signature]]. The time signature typically consists of two numbers, with one of the most common being "4/4". The top "4" indicates that there are four beats per measure (also called [[Bar (music)|bar]]). The bottom "4" indicates that each of those beats are quarter notes. Measures divide the piece into groups of [[beat (music)|beats]], and the time signatures specify those groupings. "4/4" is used so often that it is also called "[[common time]]", and it may be indicated with a "C" rather than numbers. Other common time signatures are "3/4" (three beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "2/4" (two beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "6/8" (six beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note) and "12/8" (twelve beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note; in practice, the eighth notes are typically put into four groups of three eighth notes. "12/8" is a [[compound time]] type of time signature). Many other time signatures exist, such as "3/8", "5/8", "5/4", "7/4", "9/8", and so on.

Many short [[classical music]] pieces from the [[classical period (music)|classical era]] and songs from [[traditional music]] and [[popular music]] are in one time signature for much or all of the piece. Music from the [[Romantic music]] era and later, particularly [[contemporary classical music]] and [[rock music]] genres such as [[progressive rock]] and the [[hardcore punk]] subgenre [[mathcore]], may use [[mixed meter]]; songs or pieces change from one meter to another, for example alternating between bars of "5/4" and "7/8".

Directions to the player regarding matters such as [[tempo]] (e.g., [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]], [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Largo]], [[Tempo#French tempo markings|Vif, Lent, Modérément]], [[Presto (music)|Presto]], etc.), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (pianississimo, pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo, fortississimo, etc.) appear above or below the staff. Terms indicating the [[musical expression]] or "feel" to a song or piece are indicated at the beginning of the piece and at any points where the mood changes (e.g., "Slow March", "Fast Swing", "Medium Blues", "Fougueux", "Feierlich", "Gelassen", "Piacevole", "Con slancio", "Majestic", "Hostile" etc.) For vocal music, lyrics are written near the pitches of the melody. For short pauses (breaths), [[retake]]s (retakes are indicated with a ' mark) are added.

In music for [[musical ensemble|ensembles]], a "[[sheet music|score]]" shows music for all players together, with the staves for the different instruments and/or voices stacked vertically. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score while she leads an [[orchestra]], [[concert band]], [[choir]] or other large ensemble. Individual performers in an ensemble play from  "parts" which contain only the music played by an individual musician. A score can be constructed from a complete set of parts and vice versa. The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were hand-copied from the score, but since the development of [[scorewriter]] computer software in the 1980s, a score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared by the program and quickly and inexpensively printed out using a computer printer. 

A [[Flat (music)|♭]] in music lowers a pitch down one semitone. A [[Sharp (music)|♯]] in music raises a note one semitone. For example, a sharp on B would raise it do B♯ while a flat would lower it to B♭.

===Variations on staff notation===
[[File:Lead-sheet-wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|A lead sheet]]
[[File:Chord chart.svg|thumb|250px|A chord chart. {{audio|Chord chart.mid|Play}}]]
* [[Percussion notation]] conventions are varied because of the wide range of percussion instruments. Percussion instruments are generally grouped into two categories: pitched (e.g., [[glockenspiel]] or [[tubular bells]]) and non-pitched (e.g., [[bass drum]] and [[snare drum]]). The notation of non-pitched percussion instruments is less standardized. Pitched instruments use standard Western classical notation for the pitches and rhythms. In general, notation for unpitched percussion uses the five line staff, with different lines and spaces representing different [[drum kit]] instruments. Standard Western rhythmic notation is used to indicate the rhythm.
* [[Figured bass]] notation originated in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] parts. It is also used extensively in [[accordion]] notation. The bass notes of the music are conventionally notated, along with numbers and other signs that determine which chords the harpsichordist, organist or lutenist should improvise. It does not, however, specify the exact pitches of the harmony, leaving that for the performer to improvise.
* A [[lead sheet]] specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] placed above and lyrics below. It is used to capture the essential elements of a [[popular music|popular song]] without specifying how the song should be arranged or performed.
* A [[chord chart]] or "chart" contains little or no melodic information at all but provides detailed harmonic information about the [[chord progression]]. Some chord charts also contain rhythmic information, indicated using slash notation for full beats and rhythmic notation for rhythms. This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[List of popular music genres|popular music]] and is intended primarily for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[drum]]s).
* Simpler chord charts for songs may contain only the chord changes, placed above the lyrics where they occur. Such charts depend on prior knowledge of the melody, and are used as reminders in performance or informal [[group singing]]. Some chord charts intended for [[rhythm section]] accompanists contain only the chord progression.
* The [[shape note]] system is found in some church hymnals, [[sheet music]], and song books, especially in the [[Southern United States]]. Instead of the customary elliptical note head, note heads of various shapes are used to show the position of the note on the major scale. [[Sacred Harp]] is one of the most popular tune books using shape notes.

==In various countries==

===Korea===
[[File:시용향악보 (時用鄕樂譜).jpg|200px|thumb|''Jeongganbo musical notation system'']]
''Jeongganbo'' is a unique traditional musical notation system created during the time of [[Sejong the Great]] that was the first East Asian system to represent rhythm, pitch, and time.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanadesikan 2011, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gukak|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/251893/1|website=The DONG-A ILBO|publisher=dongA.com|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among various kinds of Korean traditional music, Jeong-gan-bo targets a particular genre, Jeong-ak (정악, 正樂).

Jeong-gan-bo tells the pitch by writing the pitch's name down in a box called 'jeong-gan' (this is where the name comes from). One jeong-gan is one beat each, and it can be split into two, three or more to hold half beats and quarter beats, and more. This makes it easy for the reader to figure out the beat.

Also, there are lots of markings indicating things such as ornaments. Most of these were later created by Ki-su Kim.

===India===
{{Main|Swaralipi}}
[[File:Bhat notation1.jpg|thumb|350px|Indian music, early 20th century.]]
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes').

Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa).

Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

Other systems exist for non-twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] and non-Western music, such as the Indian ''[[Swaralipi]]''.

===Russia===
{{further|Znamenny chant}}
[[Image:Example of hooks and banners notation.PNG|thumb|200px|right|An example of Znamenny notation with so-called "red marks", Russia, 1884. "Thy [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Cross]] we honour, oh Lord, and Thy holy Resurrection we praise."]]
[[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|160px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]] 
Znamenny Chant is a singing tradition used in the [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Church]] which uses a "hook and banner" notation. Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|крюки|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|знамёна|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness.{{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}} There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.

Znamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znamëna'' (Russian for "marks", "banners") or ''Kryuki'' ("hooks"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. The stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.

The most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called "little dove" (Russian: голубчик ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]]. Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.
(See [[#Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]])

===China===
{{Main|Chinese musical notation}}

[[File:Qinnotation.png|thumb|250px|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm Bagley 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609090628/http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm |date=9 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gongche notation]] used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.

===Japan===
{{further|Shakuhachi musical notation|Kunkunshi}}
[[File:Tempyo Biwa Fu.jpg|thumb|''Tempyō Biwa Fu'' 天平琵琶譜 (circa 738 AD), musical notation for [[Biwa]]. ([[Shōsōin]], at Nara, Japan)]]
Japanese music is highly diversified, and therefore requires various systems of notation. In Japanese [[shakuhachi]] music, for example, glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches, whereas [[taiko]] notation focuses on discrete strokes.

[[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyuan]] [[sanshin]] music uses [[kunkunshi]], a notation system of [[kanji]] with each character corresponding to a finger position on a particular string.

===Indonesia===&lt;!--[[Kepatihan notation]]'s see also links here--&gt;
{{Main|Gamelan notation}}

Notation plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of [[Indonesia]]. However, in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], several systems were devised beginning at the end of the 19th century, initially for archival purposes. Today the most widespread are cipher notations ("not angka" in the broadest sense) in which the pitches are represented with some subset of the numbers 1 to 7, with 1 corresponding to either highest note of a particular octave, as in [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]] [[gamelan]], or lowest, as in the [[kepatihan notation]] of [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]].

Notes in the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one or more dots above or below the each number. For the most part, these cipher notations are mainly used to notate the skeletal melody (the [[balungan]]) and vocal parts ([[gerong]]an), although transcriptions of the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching. Drum parts are notated with a system of symbols largely based on letters representing the vocables used to learn and remember drumming patterns; these symbols are typically laid out in a grid underneath the skeletal melody for a specific or generic piece.

The symbols used for drum notation (as well as the vocables represented) are highly variable from place to place and performer to performer. In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the [[Surakarta|Solo]]nese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the [[Sindhen|pesinden]] with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in [[Yogyakarta]] a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of [[Gamelan gender wayang]] pieces, employing alphabetical notation in the old Balinese script.

Composers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] [[Musical tuning|tuning]] systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for [[microtonal music|microtones]]. The Dutch composer [[Ton de Leeuw]] also invented a three line staff for his composition ''Gending''. However, these systems do not enjoy widespread use.

In the second half of the twentieth century, Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation to other oral traditions, and a [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic scale]] cipher notation has become common for notating western-related genres (church hymns, popular songs, and so forth). Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music, which uses a "fixed Do" (that is, 1 always corresponds to the same pitch, within the natural variability of gamelan tuning), Indonesian diatonic cipher notation is "moveable-Do" notation, so scores must indicate which pitch corresponds to the number 1 (for example, "1=C").

==Other systems and practices==

===Pitch bracket notation===
In pitch bracket notation music is written with melody lines and pitch brackets. Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch by writing pitch brackets on them. Pitch brackets add or subtract scale steps to the melody line. The shape of the bracket (i.e. angle bracket), determines the number of scale steps to add. The direction of the bracket, opening or closing, determines whether to add or subtract scale steps. As a result of the mathematical nature of pitch bracket notation, arithmetic and algebra can be directly applied to the notation. Musical variations can be mathematically generated from their themes.

===Cipher notation===
{{Main|Numbered musical notation}}
Cipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals to the [[major scale]] degrees have been used at least since the Iberian organ tablatures of the 16th-century and include such exotic adaptations as ''[[Siffernotskrift]]''. The one most widely in use today is the Chinese ''Jianpu'', discussed in the [[Numbered musical notation|main article]]. Numerals can of course also be assigned to different scale systems, as in the Javanese ''[[kepatihan]]'' notation [[Musical notation#Indonesia|described above]].

===Solfège===
{{Main|Solfège}}
Solfège is a way of assigning syllables to names of the musical scale. In order, they are today: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do{{'}}'' (for the octave). The classic variation is: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do{{'}}''. The first Western system of functional names for the musical notes was introduced by [[Guido of Arezzo]] (c. 991 &amp;ndash; after 1033), using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn [[Ut queant laxis]]. The original sequence was ''Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La'', where each verse started a scale note higher. "Ut" later became "Do". The equivalent syllables used in Indian music are: ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni''. See also: [[solfège]], [[swara|sargam]], [[Kodály method#Hand signs|Kodály hand signs]].

[[Tonic sol-fa]] is a type of notation using the initial letters of solfège.

===Letter notation===
{{Main|Letter notation}}
The notes of the 12-tone scale can be written by their letter names A–G, possibly with a trailing sharp or flat symbol, such as A{{music|sharp}} or B{{Music|flat}}.

===Tablature===
{{Main|Tablature}}
Tablature was first used in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] for organ music and later in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] for [[lute]] music.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1961, xxiii and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In most lute tablatures, a staff is used, but instead of pitch values, the lines of the staff represent the strings of the instrument. The [[fret]]s to finger are written on each line, indicated by letters or numbers. Rhythm is written separately with one or another variation of standard note values indicating the duration of the fastest moving part. Few seem to have remarked on the fact that tablature combines in one notation system both the physical and technical requirements of play (the lines and symbols on them and in relation to each other representing the actual performance actions) with the unfolding of the music itself (the lines of tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding of the music). In later periods, lute and guitar music was written with standard notation. Tablature caught interest again in the late 20th century for popular [[guitar]] music and other fretted instruments, being easy to transcribe and share over the internet in [[ASCII tab|ASCII format]]. Websites like [[Tablature#OLGA.net|OLGA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olga.net/ olga.net]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070949/http://www.olga.net/ |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have archives of text-based popular music tablature.

===Klavar notation===
{{Main|Klavarskribo}}
Klavarskribo (sometimes shortened to '''klavar''') is a music notation system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means "keyboard writing" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands.

===Piano-roll-based notations===
Some chromatic systems have been created taking advantage of the layout of black and white keys of the standard piano keyboard. The "staff" is most widely referred to as "piano roll", created by extending the black and white piano keys.

===Chromatic staff notations===
Over the past three centuries, hundreds of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a "chromatic staff" in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the ''Ailler-Brennink'' notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's ''Dodeka'' music notation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodeka.info/ dodeka.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicnotation.org/systems/more-notation-systems/|title=More Notation Systems {{!}} Notation Systems {{!}} The Music Notation Project|website=musicnotation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tom Reed's ''Twinline'' notation, Russell Ambrose's ''Ambrose Piano Tabs'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ambrosepianotabs.com/ ambrosepianotabs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Morris' ''Clairnote'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://clairnote.org/ clairnote.org]&lt;/ref&gt; John Keller's ''Express Stave'', and José A. Sotorrio's ''Bilinear Music Notation''. These notation systems do not require the use of standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation. The Music Notation Project (formerly known as the Music Notation Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicnotation.org musicnotation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic notation===
{{Main|Graphic notation (music)}}
The term 'graphic notation' refers to the contemporary use of non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of a piece of music. Practitioners include [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], and [[Roger Reynolds]]. See ''Notations'', edited by John Cage and Alison Knowles, {{ISBN|0-685-14864-5}}.

===Simplified music notation===
{{Main|Simplified music notation}}
[[Simplified Music Notation]] is an alternative form of musical notation designed to make [[sight reading|sight-reading]] easier. It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but incorporates [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] into the shape of the [[note heads]]. [[Musical note|Note]]s such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]] are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] they are actually played at, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called ''history signs'' that show they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].

===Modified Stave Notation===
{{Main|Modified Stave Notation}}
[[Modified Stave Notation]] (MSN) is an alternative way of notating music for people who cannot easily read ordinary musical notation even if it is enlarged.

===Parsons code===
{{Main|Parsons code}}
Parsons code is used to encode music so that it can be easily searched.

===Braille music===
{{Main|Braille music}}
Braille music is a complete, well developed, and internationally accepted musical notation system that has symbols and notational conventions quite independent of print music notation. It is linear in nature, similar to a printed language and different from the two-dimensional nature of standard printed music notation. To a degree Braille music resembles musical markup languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicmarkup.info/scope/markuplanguages.html musicmarkup.info]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[MusicXML]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ emusician.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701200951/http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Notation Interchange File Format|NIFF]].

===Integer notation===
In [[integer notation]], or the [[integer]] model of pitch, all [[pitch class]]es and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11.

===Rap notation===
The standard form of rap notation is the "flow diagram", where rappers line up their lyrics underneath "beat numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2009, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams that rappers use: the books ''How to Rap'' and ''How to Rap 2'' extensively use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2013, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are used by musicologists Adam Krims in his book ''Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity''&lt;ref&gt;Krims 2001, 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyle Adams in his work on rap's flow.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat,&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"&gt;Edwards 2009, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; with certain syllables aligned to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have four beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"/&gt;

==Music notation on computer==
{{Main|Scorewriter}}

Many computer programs have been developed for creating music notation (called ''scorewriters'' or ''music notation software''). Music may also be stored in various digital file formats for purposes other than graphic notation output.

==Perspectives of musical notation in composition and musical performance==
According to Philip Tagg and [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musicology and to a degree European-influenced musical practice suffer from a 'notational centricity', a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg 1979, 28–32; Middleton 1990, 104–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of 20th- and 21st-century composers have dealt with this problem, either by adapting standard Western musical notation or by using graphic notation.{{Clarify|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--How does changing the style of notation encourage musicologists to ignore notation in favor of other approaches, such as recordings or spectrograms?--&gt; These include [[George Crumb]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Krzystof Penderecki]], [[Earle Brown|Earl Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce 1973, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogan 1976, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pseudo-polyomino''', also called a '''polyking''', '''polyplet''' or '''hinged polyomino''', is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge or corner to corner at 90°. It is a [[polyform]] with [[Square (geometry)|square]] cells. The [[polyomino]]es are a subset of the polykings.

The name "polyking" refers to the [[king (chess)|king]] in [[chess]]. The ''n''-kings are the ''n''-square shapes which could be occupied by a king on an infinite chessboard in the course of legal moves.

[[Solomon W. Golomb|Golomb]] uses the term ''pseudo-polyomino'' referring to kingwise-connected sets of squares.&lt;ref name="golomb1994" /&gt;

==Enumeration of polykings==
[[File:Pseudopentominoes-chain10-01.svg|thumb|right|360px|10 congruent [[Mutilated chessboard problem|mutilated chessboards]] 7x7 constructed&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;94&amp;nbsp;pseudo-pentominoes, or&amp;nbsp;pentaplets]]

=== Free, one-sided, and fixed polykings ===
There are three common ways of distinguishing polyominoes and polykings for enumeration:&lt;ref name="golomb1994" /&gt;
*''free'' polykings are distinct when none is a rigid transformation ([[translation (geometry)|translation]], [[rotation]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] or [[glide reflection]]) of another (pieces that can be picked up and flipped over).
*''one-sided'' polykings are distinct when none is a translation or rotation of another (pieces that cannot be flipped over).
*''fixed'' polykings are distinct when none is a translation of another (pieces that can be neither flipped nor rotated).

The following table shows the numbers of polykings of various types with ''n'' cells.

'''Quantum topology''' is a branch of mathematics that connects [[quantum mechanics]] with [[low-dimensional topology]].

[[Dirac notation]] provides a viewpoint of quantum mechanics which becomes amplified into a framework that can embrace the amplitudes associated with [[topological space]]s and the related embedding of one space within another such as knots and links in three-dimensional space. This [[bra–ket notation]] of kets and bras can be generalised, becoming maps of [[vector space]]s associated with [[topological space]]s that allow [[tensor product]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Quantum  Topology and Quantum Computing by Louis H. Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt;

Topological [[Tangle (mathematics)|entanglement]] involving [[Link (knot theory)|linking]] and [[Braid theory|braiding]] can be intuitively related to [[quantum entanglement]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Sheshayya A. Choudum''' (born 1947) is a professor and a former chair of the department of mathematics at [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras|IIT Madras]] specializing in [[graph theory]]. He has often worked in [[chromatic number]], [[degree sequence]], [[graph enumeration]], [[bivariegated graph]]s, and networks.

Choudum hails from [[Manvi]], [[Raichur district]], [[Karnataka]]. He completed an MSc in mathematics from [[Karnataka University]], [[Dharwar]] and a PhD in 1975 with the dissertation "Some Analysis, Synthesis and Graph Enumeration Problems in Graph Theory" from  IIT Madras. His advisor was [[K. R. Parthasarathy (Graph theorist)|K. R. Parthasarathy]]. From there, he came to the [[University of Mumbai]] to work with [[S. S. Shrikhande]], [[S. B. Rao]] and [[Vasanti N. Bhat-Nayak]]. Prior to joining the computer science department at IIT Madras, he was with the department of mathematics of [[Madurai Kamaraj University]]. While at [[Madurai]], he visited the [[University of Reading]] to work with [[Crispin Nash-Williams]]. Choudum has guided 10 PhD students in graph theory.

'''Saxon math''', developed by [[John Saxon (educator)|John Saxon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinamericaneducation.com/common-core-state-standards/recognizing-an-american-hero-john-saxon/|title=Recognizing an American Hero: John Saxon {{!}} Truth in American Education|date=2014-07-24|work=Truth in American Education|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a teaching method for incremental learning of mathematics. It involves teaching a new mathematical concept every day and constantly reviewing old concepts.  Early editions were deprecated for providing very few opportunities to practice the new material before plunging into a review of all previous material.  Newer editions typically split the day's work evenly between practicing the new material and reviewing old material.  Its primary strength is in a steady review of all previous material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/15/how-a-war-hero-launched-a-war-on-bad-math-instruction/|title=How A War Hero Launched A War On Bad Math Instruction|last=Hayes|first=Nakonia|date=15 August 2016|website=thefederalist.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is especially important to students who struggle with retaining the math they previously learned.

The Saxon Math 1 to Algebra 1/2 (the equivalent of a Pre-Algebra book) curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianbook.com/page/homeschool/math/saxon-math/saxon-algebra-12|title=Saxon Algebra 1/2 Math Curriculum - Christianbook.com|website=www.christianbook.com|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed so that students complete assorted mental math problems, learn a new mathematical concept, practice problems relating to that lesson, and solve a variety of problems. Daily practice problems include relevant questions from the current day's lesson as well as cumulative problems. This daily cycle is interrupted for tests and additional topics. From Algebra 1/2 on, the higher level books remove the mental math problems and incorporate testing more frequently.

The Saxon math program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homeschoolmath.net/curriculum_reviews/saxon.php|title=Reviews of Saxon math curriculum from HomeschoolMath.net|website=www.homeschoolmath.net|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a specific set of products to support [[homeschool]]ers, including solution keys and ready-made tests, which makes it popular among some homeschool families.  It has also been adopted as an alternative to [[reform mathematics]] programs in public and private schools.  Saxon teaches memorization of algorithms, unlike many reform texts.

== Replacing standards-based texts ==
By the mid-2000s, many school districts were considering abandoning experiments with reform approaches which had not produced acceptable test scores.  For example, school board member Debbie Winskill in [[Tacoma, Washington]] said that the non-traditional [[Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP)]] "has been a dismal failure." Speaking to the board, [[Mount Tahoma High School]] teacher Clifford Harris noted that he taught sophomores in another district Saxon Math, and their [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning]] scores have continually climbed. Unlike IMP, Saxon program gives students plenty of chances to review material, so they retain their skills, he said.&lt;ref name=Abe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6051712p-5310251c.html |title=Back to basics on kids’ math: Alarmed by low scores, Tacoma school officials OK added Saxon textbook |last=Abe |first=Debby |newspaper=The News Tribune |location=Tacoma, WA |date=August 25, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025081451/http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6051712p-5310251c.html |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2006, Tacoma Public Schools introduced the Saxon books district-wide and rejected the previous IMP textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003674945_sundaymath22.html New-age math doesn't add up]. Bruce Ramsey; ''Seattle Times'' (Seattle WA) April 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonics and spelling ==
Saxon Publishers has also published phonics and spelling curriculum. This curriculum, authored by Lorna Simmons and first published in 2005, follows the same incremental principles as the Saxon Math curriculum.&lt;ref name="Saxon Phonics K, 1, &amp; 2"&gt;[http://cathyduffyreviews.com/phonics_reading/saxon-phonics-k.htm Saxon Phonics K, 1, &amp; 2]. Cathy Duffy; "Cathy Duffy Reviews" Reviewed 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the Saxon Phonics and Spelling curriculum published provides four different levels of materials. The first three levels, starting in Kindergarten and progressing through second grade, offers daily lessons consisting of three main parts: lesson warm-up, new increment, and application and continual review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcrr.org/FCRRReports/PDF/SaxonPhonicsSpelling.pdf Florida Center for Reading Research: Saxon Phonics and Spelling K-3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005305/http://www.fcrr.org/FCRRReports/PDF/SaxonPhonicsSpelling.pdf |date=2012-04-26 }}. Mary VanSciver, M.S.; FCRR (Tallahassee, FL) April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An assessment tool is included with the teaching materials to show teachers where students may be struggling, and it also provides remediation methods to reiterate the failing concepts. The fourth level of curriculum is intended for the third grade and allows for further advancement in spelling skills.&lt;ref name="Saxon Phonics K, 1, &amp; 2"/&gt; Each level consists of various teaching materials to support the daily lesson plans and remediation factors known of Saxon curriculum. Specifically, the Saxon Phonics and Spelling curricula is "beneficial for struggling readers because of the structure and repetitive characteristics associated with Saxon Publisher's curriculum." &lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hargett; Homeschool mother for the past 24 years (Fredericksburg, VA) November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that students using the Saxon Phonics and Spelling program showed improvement over a school year in phonics, reading, and spelling.&lt;ref name="rigby.hmhco.com"&gt;[http://rigby.hmhco.com/HA/correlations/pdf/s/SaxonPhonicsEvalFinalReport11_6_07.pdf Saxon Phonics and Spelling Randomized Control Trial]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005305/http://rigby.hmhco.com/HA/correlations/pdf/s/SaxonPhonicsEvalFinalReport11_6_07.pdf |date=April 26, 2012 }} Miriam Resendez, M.A. &amp; Mariam Azin, Ph.D.; '''Planning, Research &amp; Evaluation Services Associates, Inc.''' (Jackson, WY) October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that this program works just as well with males as with females and with special education and non-special education students.&lt;ref name="rigby.hmhco.com"/&gt;

Saxon curriculum remains popular among homeschooling families but is also starting to be incorporated into public schools as well. The repetitive curriculum design provides students with constant reinforcements of previously learned concepts. This routine practice reinforces important topics into the student long-term memory. School districts find this especially beneficial when they need to raise their testing scores in math, phonics, and spelling.

== In popular culture ==

Saxon math textbooks are visible on a table in the film [[Last Action Hero]].

In [[mathematics]], '''LHS''' is informal shorthand for the '''left-hand side''' of an [[equation]].  Similarly, '''RHS''' is the '''right-hand side'''. The two sides have the same value, expressed differently, since [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] is [[equivalence relation|symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_BhgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=rhs+equation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5e0lDtBkTr&amp;sig=F_b0X-tls1pEUlFiS-LTUyUuhgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCDgKahUKEwi8nqXt7YDHAhXHxRQKHYJJBcY#v=onepage&amp;q=rhs%20equation&amp;f=false Engineering Mathematics, John Bird, p65]: definition and example of abbreviation&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, these terms may apply to an [[inequation]] or [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]; the right-hand side is everything on the right side of a [[test operator]] in an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]], with LHS defined similarly.

==Some examples==
The expression on the right side of the "=" sign is the right side of the equation and the expression on the left of the "=" is the left side of the equation.

For example, in
:''x'' + 5 = ''y ''+ 8,
"''x'' + 5" is the '''left-hand side''' (LHS) and "''y ''+ 8" is the '''right-hand side''' (RHS).

==Homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations==
In solving mathematical equations, particularly [[linear simultaneous equations]], [[differential equation]]s and [[integral equation]]s, the terminology ''homogeneous'' is often used for equations with some [[linear operator]] ''L'' on the LHS and 0 on the RHS. In contrast, an equation with a non-zero RHS is called ''inhomogeneous'' or ''non-homogeneous'', as exemplified by

:''Lf'' = ''g'',

with ''g'' a fixed function, which equation is to be solved for ''f''. Then any solution of the inhomogeneous equation may have a solution of the homogeneous equation added to it, and still remain a solution.

For example in [[mathematical physics]], the homogeneous equation may correspond to a physical theory formulated in [[Free space|empty space]], while the inhomogeneous equation asks for more 'realistic' solutions with some matter, or charged particles.

==Syntax==
More abstractly, when using [[infix notation]]

:''T'' * ''U''

the term ''T'' stands as the '''left-hand side''' and ''U'' as the '''right-hand side''' of the [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] *. This usage is less common, though.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5060">In [[combinatorics]], the '''skew sum''' and '''direct sum''' of [[permutations]] are two operations to combine shorter permutations into longer ones.  Given a permutation ''π'' of length ''m'' and the permutation ''σ'' of length ''n'', the skew sum of ''π'' and ''σ'' is the permutation of length ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' defined by

: &lt;math&gt;
(\pi\ominus\sigma)(i) = \begin{cases} \pi(i)+n &amp; \text{for }1\le i\le m, \\
\sigma(i-m) &amp; \text{for }m+1\le i\le m+n,\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the direct sum of ''π'' and ''σ'' is the permutation of length ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' defined by

: &lt;math&gt;
(\pi\oplus\sigma)(i) = \begin{cases} \pi(i) &amp; \text{for }1\le i\le m,\\
\sigma(i-m)+m &amp; \text{for }m+1\le i\le m+n.\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
The skew sum of the permutations ''π'' = 2413 and ''σ'' = 35142 is 796835142 (the last five entries are equal to ''σ'', while the first four entries come from shifting the entries of ''π'') while their direct sum is 241379586 (the first four entries are equal to ''π'', while the last five come from shifting the entries of ''σ'').

== Sums of permutations as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ==

If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''π''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[permutation matrix|permutation matrices]] corresponding to ''π'' and ''σ'', respectively, then the permutation matrix &lt;math&gt;M_{\pi \ominus \sigma}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the skew sum &lt;math&gt;\pi \ominus \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;M_{\pi \ominus \sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; M_\pi \\ M_\sigma &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,

and the permutation matrix &lt;math&gt;M_{\pi \oplus \sigma}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the direct sum &lt;math&gt;\pi \oplus \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;M_{\pi \oplus \sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} M_\pi &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; M_\sigma \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,

where here the symbol "0" is used to represent rectangular blocks of zero entries.  Following the example of the preceding section, we have (suppressing all 0 entries) that

:&lt;math&gt;M_{2413} = \begin{bmatrix} &amp;1&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;1 \\ 1&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;1&amp; \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;M_{35142} = \begin{bmatrix} &amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1 \\ 1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp; \\ &amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2413\ominus35142} = M_{796835142} = \begin{bmatrix} &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1 \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp; \\&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ 1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2413\oplus35142} = M_{241379586} = \begin{bmatrix} &amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ 1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1 \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp; \\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;&amp;\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Role in pattern avoidance ==
Skew and direct sums of permutations appear (among other places) in the study of [[pattern avoidance]] in permutations.  Breaking permutations down as skew and/or direct sums of a maximal number of parts (that is, decomposing into indecomposable parts) is one of several possible techniques used to study the structure of, and so to enumerate, pattern classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Albert and M. D. Atkinson, Pattern classes and priority queues, 	arXiv:1202.1542v1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Atkinson, [[Bruce Sagan|Bruce E. Sagan]], Vincent Vatter, Counting (3+1) - Avoiding permutations, European Journal of Combinatorics, arXiv:1102.5568v1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert, M.H. and Atkinson, M.D. Simple permutations and pattern restricted permutations. Discrete Math. 300, 1-3 (2005), 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Permutations whose decomposition by skew and direct sums into a maximal number of parts, that is, can be built up from the permutations (1), are called [[separable permutations]];&lt;ref name=Kit57&gt;Kitaev (2011) p.57&lt;/ref&gt; they arise in the study of sortability theory, and can also be characterized as permutations avoiding the [[permutation pattern]]s 2413 and 3142.

== Properties ==
The skew and direct sums are [[associative property|associative]] but not [[commutative property|commutative]], and they do not associate with each other (i.e., for permutations ''π'', ''σ'' and ''&amp;tau;'' we typically have &lt;math&gt;\pi \oplus(\sigma \ominus \tau) \neq (\pi \oplus \sigma) \ominus \tau&lt;/math&gt;).

Given permutations ''π'' and ''σ'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;(\pi \oplus \sigma)^{-1} = \pi ^{-1} \oplus \sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\pi \ominus \sigma)^{-1} = \sigma^{-1} \ominus \pi ^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a permutation ''&amp;omega;'', define its ''reverse'' rev(''&amp;omega;'') to be the permutation whose entries appear in the opposite order of those of ''&amp;omega;'' when written in [[one-line notation]]; for example, the reverse of 25143 is 34152.  (As permutation matrices, this operation is reflection across a horizontal axis.)  Then the skew and direct sums of permutations are related by

: &lt;math&gt;\pi \oplus \sigma = \operatorname{rev}(\operatorname{rev}(\sigma) \ominus \operatorname{rev}(\pi))&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a '''smooth maximum''' of an [[indexed family]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of numbers is a [[smooth approximation]] to the [[maximum]] function &lt;math&gt;\max(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt; meaning a [[parametric family]] of functions &lt;math&gt;m_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that for every {{mvar|''α''}}, the function {{tmath|m_\alpha}} is smooth, and the family converges to the maximum function {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha\to\infty}}. The concept of '''smooth minimum''' is similarly defined. In many cases, a single family approximates both: maximum as the parameter goes to positive infinity, minimum as the parameter goes to negative infinity; in symbols, {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to \infty}} and {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \min}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to -\infty}}. The term can also be used loosely for a specific smooth function that behaves similarly to a maximum, without necessarily being part of a parametrized family.

== Examples ==
For large positive values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the following formulation is one smooth, [[differential (calculus)|differentiable]] approximation of the maximum function.  For negative values of the parameter that are large in absolute value, it approximates the minimum.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\alpha x_i}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \max&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic mean]] of its inputs
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \min&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to [[softmax function|softmax]] and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{x_i}\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\alpha x_j}} [1 + \alpha(x_i - \mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n))].
&lt;/math&gt;

This makes the softmax function useful for optimization techniques that use [[gradient descent]].

=== LogSumExp ===
{{main|LogSumExp}}
Another smooth maximum is [[LogSumExp]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{LSE}(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n))
&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be normalized if the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are all non-negative, yielding a function with domain &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)^n&lt;/math&gt; and range &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
g(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n) - (n - 1) )
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; term corrects for the fact that &lt;math&gt;\exp(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; by canceling out all but one zero exponential, and &lt;math&gt;\log 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero.

The version of the formula typically used in applications is
:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! = n\ln n - n +O(\ln n)&lt;/math&gt;
(in [[big O notation]], as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;), or, by changing the base of the logarithm (for instance in the [[Comparison sort#Number of comparisons required to sort a list|worst-case lower bound for comparison sorting]]),

:&lt;math&gt;\log_2 n! = n\log_2 n - (\log_2 e)n +O(\log_2 n).&lt;/math&gt;

Specifying the constant in the {{math|''O''(ln ''n'')}} error term gives {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}ln(2π''n'')}}, yielding the more precise formula:

:&lt;math&gt;n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n,&lt;/math&gt;

where the sign ~ means that the two quantities are [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]]: their ratio tends to 1 as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity.

One may also give simple bounds valid for all positive integers {{math|''n''}}, rather than only for large {{math|''n''}}: 

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2\pi}\ n^{n+\frac12}e^{-n} \le n! \le e\ n^{n+\frac12}e^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;. These follow from the more [[Stirling%27s_approximation#Speed of convergence and error estimates|precise error bounds]] discussed below.

== Derivation ==
Roughly speaking, the simplest version of Stirling's formula can be quickly obtained by approximating the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! = \sum_{j=1}^n \ln j&lt;/math&gt;

with an [[integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n \ln j \approx \int_1^n \ln x \,{\rm d}x = n\ln n - n + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The full formula, together with precise estimates of its error, can be derived as follows. Instead of approximating {{math|''n''!}}, one considers its [[natural logarithm]] as this is a [[slowly varying function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! = \ln 1 + \ln 2 + \cdots + \ln n.&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side of this equation minus

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}(\ln 1 + \ln n) = \tfrac{1}{2}\ln n,&lt;/math&gt;

is the approximation by the [[trapezoid rule]] of the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! - \tfrac{1}{2}\ln n \approx \int_1^n \ln x\,{\rm d}x = n \ln n - n + 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and the error in this approximation is given by the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ln n! - \tfrac{1}{2}\ln n &amp; = \tfrac{1}{2}\ln 1 + \ln 2 + \ln 3 + \cdots + \ln(n-1) + \tfrac{1}{2}\ln n\\
&amp; = n \ln n - n + 1 + \sum_{k=2}^{m} \frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} \left( \frac{1}{n^{k-1}} - 1 \right) + R_{m,n},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[Bernoulli number]] and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the remainder term in the Euler–Maclaurin formula. Take limits to find that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \ln n! - n \ln n + n - \tfrac{1}{2}\ln n \right) = 1 - \sum_{k=2}^{m} \frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} + \lim_{n \to \infty} R_{m,n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Denote this limit as {{math|''y''}}.  Because the remainder {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]] satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;R_{m,n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} R_{m,n} + O \left( \frac{1}{n^m} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where we use [[big-O notation]], combining the equations above yields the approximation formula in its logarithmic form:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! = n \ln \left( \frac{n}{e} \right) + \tfrac{1}{2}\ln n + y + \sum_{k=2}^{m} \frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)n^{k-1}} + O \left( \frac{1}{n^m} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the exponential of both sides, and choosing any positive integer {{math|''m''}}, we get a formula involving an unknown quantity {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, the formula is

:&lt;math&gt;n! = e^{y} \sqrt{n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \left( 1 + O \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be found by taking the limit on both sides as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity and using [[Wallis product|Wallis' product]], which shows that {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sqrt|2π}}}}. Therefore, we get Stirling's formula:

:&lt;math&gt;n! = \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \left( 1 + O \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

== An alternative derivation ==
An alternative formula for {{math|''n''!}} using the [[gamma function]] is
:&lt;math&gt; n! = \int_0^\infty x^n e^{-x}\,{\rm d}x.&lt;/math&gt;
(as can be seen by repeated integration by parts). Rewriting and changing variables {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ny''}} one gets
:&lt;math&gt; n! = \int_0^\infty e^{n\ln x-x}\,{\rm d}x = e^{n \ln n} n \int_0^\infty e^{n(\ln y -y)}\,{\rm d}y.&lt;/math&gt;
Applying [[Laplace's method]] we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{n(\ln y -y)}\,{\rm d}y \sim  \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{n}} e^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
which recovers the Stirling's formula,
:&lt;math&gt; n! \sim   e^{n \ln n} n \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{n}} e^{-n}
= \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n.
&lt;/math&gt;
In fact further corrections can also be obtained using Laplace's method. For example, computing two-order expansion using Laplace's method yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{n(\ln y-y)}\,{\rm d}y \sim  \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{n}} e^{-n}
\left(1+\frac{1}{12 n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and gives Stirling's formula to two orders,
:&lt;math&gt; n! \sim   e^{n \ln n} n \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\left(1+\frac{1}{12 n}\right)
= \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \left(1+ \frac{1}{12 n}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

A complex-analysis version of this method&lt;ref&gt;Phillipe Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick, ''Analytic Combinatorics'', p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; is to consider &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n!}&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Taylor series|Taylor coefficient]] of the exponential function &lt;math&gt;e^z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;, computed by [[Cauchy's integral formula]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n!} \ = \ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\!\!\!\!\!|z|=r}\, \frac{e^z}{z^{n+1}} \, dz. &lt;/math&gt;

This line integral can then be approximated using the [[Method of steepest descent|saddle point method]] with an appropriate choice of countour radius &lt;math&gt;r=r_n&lt;/math&gt;. The dominant portion of the integral near the saddle point is then approximated by a real integral and Laplace's method, while the remaining portion of the integral can be bounded above to give an error term.

== Speed of convergence and error estimates ==
[[File:Stirling series relative error.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. {{math|''n''}}, for 0 to 5 terms. The kinks in the curves represent points where the truncated series coincides with {{math|&amp;Gamma;(''n'' + 1)}}.]]

Stirling's formula is in fact the first approximation to the following series (now called the '''Stirling series'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dlmf.nist.gov/5.11.i|title=NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions|authors= F. W. J. Olver, A. B. Olde Daalhuis, D. W. Lozier, B. I. Schneider, R. F. Boisvert, C. W. Clark, B. R. Miller, and B. V. Saunders, eds.}}&lt;/ref&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;
n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \left(1 +\frac{1}{12n}+\frac{1}{288n^2} - \frac{139}{51840n^3} -\frac{571}{2488320n^4}+ \cdots \right).&lt;/math&gt;

An explicit formula for the coefficients in this series was given by G. Nemes.&lt;ref name="Nemes2010-2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Nemes|first=Gergő|year=2010|title=On the Coefficients of the Asymptotic Expansion of n!|journal=Journal of Integer Sequences|volume=13|issue=6|pages=5 pp.|issn=|doi=|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Further terms are listed in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] as {{OEIS link|A001163}} and {{OEIS link|A001164}}.}} The first graph in this section shows the [[Approximation error|relative error]] vs. {{math|''n''}}, for 1 through all 5 terms listed above.

[[File:Stirling error vs number of terms.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. the number of terms used]]

As {{math|''n'' → ∞}}, the error in the truncated series is asymptotically equal to the first omitted term. This is an example of an [[asymptotic expansion]]. It is not a [[convergent series]]; for any ''particular'' value of {{math|''n''}} there are only so many terms of the series that improve accuracy, after which point accuracy actually gets worse.  This is shown in the next graph, which shows the relative error versus the number of terms in the series, for larger numbers of terms. More precisely, let {{math|''S''(''n'', ''t'')}} be the Stirling series to {{math|''t''}} terms evaluated at&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}}.  The graphs show 
:&lt;math&gt;\left | \ln \left (\frac{S(n, t)}{n!} \right) \right |, &lt;/math&gt;
which, when small, is essentially the relative error.

Writing Stirling's series in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! \sim n\ln n - n + \tfrac12\ln(2\pi n) +\frac{1}{12n} - \frac{1}{360n^3} + \frac{1}{1260n^5} - \frac{1}{1680n^7} + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

it is known that the error in truncating the series is always of the opposite sign and at most the same magnitude as the first omitted term.

More precise bounds, due to Robbins,&lt;ref name="Robbins1955"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robbins|first=Herbert|year=1955|title=A Remark on Stirling's Formula|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=62|issue=1|pages=26–29 pp.|issn=|doi=10.2307/2308012|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; valid for all positive integers {{math|''n''}} are

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2\pi}\ n^{n+\frac12}e^{-n} e^{\frac{1}{12n + 1}} &lt; n! &lt; \sqrt{2\pi}\ n^{n+\frac12}e^{-n} e^{\frac{1}{12n}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Stirling's formula for the gamma function==
For all positive integers,

:&lt;math&gt;n! = \Gamma(n+1),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Γ}} denotes the [[gamma function]].

However, the gamma function, unlike the factorial, is more broadly defined for all complex numbers other than non-positive integers; nevertheless, Stirling's formula may still be applied. If {{math|Re(''z'') &gt; 0}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\Gamma (z) = z\ln z - z + \tfrac12\ln\frac{2\pi}{z} + \int_0^\infty\frac{2\arctan\left(\frac{t}{z}\right)}{e^{2\pi t}-1}\,{\rm d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

Repeated integration by parts gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\Gamma(z) \sim z\ln z - z + \tfrac12\ln\frac{2\pi}{z} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \frac{B_{2n}}{2n(2n-1)z^{2n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the {{math|''n''}}th [[Bernoulli number]] (note that the limit of the sum as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; is not convergent, so this formula is just an [[asymptotic expansion]]). The formula is valid for {{math|''z''}} large enough in absolute value when {{math|{{abs|arg(''z'')}} &lt; π − ''ε''}}, where {{math|''ε''}} is positive, with an error term of {{math|''O''(''z''&lt;sup&gt;−2''N''+ 1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. The corresponding approximation may now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{z}}\,{\left(\frac{z}{e}\right)}^z \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A further application of this asymptotic expansion is for complex argument {{math|''z''}} with constant {{math|Re(''z'')}}. See for example the Stirling formula applied in {{math|Im(''z'') {{=}} ''t''}} of the [[Riemann-Siegel theta function]] on the straight line {{math|{{sfrac|1|4}} + ''it''}}.

== Error bounds ==
For any positive integer {{math|''N''}}, we introduce the following notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\Gamma(z) = z\ln z - z + \tfrac12\ln\frac{2\pi}{z} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N-1}{\frac{{B_{2n}}}{{2n\left({2n - 1}\right)z^{2n - 1} }}} + R_N(z)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) = \sqrt{\frac{{2\pi}}{z}} \left({\frac{z}{e}}\right)^z  \left({\sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1}{\frac{{a_n}}{{z^n}}} + \widetilde{R}_N(z)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Nemes, Error bounds and exponential improvements for the asymptotic expansions of the gamma function and its reciprocal, ''Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A'' '''145''' (2015), 571–596.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A convergent version of Stirling's formula==
[[Thomas Bayes]] showed, in a letter to [[John Canton]] published by the [[Royal Society]] in 1763, that Stirling's formula did not give a [[convergent series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/letter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128050439/http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/letter.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obtaining a convergent version of Stirling's formula entails evaluating [[Gamma function#Raabe's formula|Raabe's formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{2\arctan\left(\frac{t}{x}\right)}{e^{2\pi t}-1}\,{\rm d}t = \ln\Gamma(x) - x\ln x + x - \tfrac12\ln\frac{2\pi}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

One way to do this is by means of a convergent series of inverted [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising exponentials]]. If

:&lt;math&gt;z^{\bar n} = z(z+1) \cdots (z+n-1)&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{2\arctan\left(\frac{t}{x}\right)}{e^{2\pi t}-1}\,{\rm d}t = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{c_n}{(x+1)^{\bar n}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; c_n = \frac{1}{n} \int_0^1 x^{\bar n} \left(x - \tfrac{1}{2}\right)\,{\rm d}x = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k|s(n,k)|}{(k + 1)(k + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''s''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k'')}} denotes the [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]]. From this we obtain a version of Stirling's series

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ln\Gamma(x) &amp;= x\ln x - x + \tfrac12\ln\frac{2\pi}{x} + \frac{1}{12(x+1)} + \frac{1}{12(x+1)(x+2)} + \\
  &amp;\quad + \frac{59}{360(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} + \frac{29}{60(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which converges when {{math|Re(''x'') &gt; 0}}.

==Versions suitable for calculators==
The approximation

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{z}} \left(\frac{z}{e} \sqrt{z \sinh\frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{810z^6} } \right)^z&lt;/math&gt;

and its equivalent form

:&lt;math&gt;2\ln\Gamma(z) \approx \ln(2\pi) - \ln z + z \left(2\ln z + \ln\left(z\sinh\frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{810z^6}\right) - 2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained by rearranging Stirling's extended formula and observing a coincidence between the resultant power series and the [[Taylor series]] expansion of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function. This approximation is good to more than 8 decimal digits for {{math|''z''}} with a real part greater than 8. Robert H. Windschitl suggested it in 2002 for computing the gamma function with fair accuracy on calculators with limited program or register memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rskey.org/gamma.htm Toth, V. T. ''Programmable Calculators: Calculators and the Gamma Function'' (2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231063913/http://www.rskey.org/gamma.htm |date=2005-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gergő Nemes proposed in 2007 an approximation which gives the same number of exact digits as the Windschitl approximation but is much simpler:&lt;ref name="Nemes2010"&gt;{{Citation|last=Nemes|first=Gergő|year=2010|title=New asymptotic expansion for the Gamma function|journal=Archiv der Mathematik|volume=95|issue=2|pages=161–169|issn=0003-889X|doi=10.1007/s00013-010-0146-9|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{z} } \left(\frac{1}{e} \left(z + \frac{1}{12z - \frac{1}{10z}}\right)\right)^z,&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt; \ln\Gamma(z) \approx \tfrac{1}{2} \left(\ln(2\pi) - \ln z\right) + z\left(\ln\left(z + \frac{1}{12z - \frac{1}{10z}}\right) - 1\right). &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative approximation for the Gamma function stated by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] ([[Ramanujan's lost notebook#References|Ramanujan 1988]]{{clarify|This is obviously supposed to be a citation but its target is not clear|date=May 2018}}) is

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(1+x) \approx \sqrt{\pi} \left(\frac{x}{e}\right)^x  \left( 8x^3 + 4x^2 + x + \frac{1}{30} \right)^{\frac{1}{6}}&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''x'' ≥ 0}}. The equivalent approximation for {{math|ln ''n''!}} has an asymptotic error of {{math|{{sfrac|1|1400''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ln n! \approx n\ln n - n + \tfrac{1}{6}\ln(8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \tfrac{1}{30}) + \tfrac{1}{2}\ln\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximation may be made precise by giving paired upper and lower bounds; one such inequality is

:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\pi} \left(\frac{x}{e}\right)^x \left( 8x^3 + 4x^2 + x + \frac{1}{100} \right)^{1/6} &lt; \Gamma(1+x) &lt;  \sqrt{\pi} \left(\frac{x}{e}\right)^x \left( 8x^3 + 4x^2 + x + \frac{1}{30} \right)^{1/6}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="E.A.Karatsuba"&gt;{{Citation|last=Karatsuba|first=Ekatherina|year=2001|title=On the asymptotic representation of the Euler gamma function by Ramanujan|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|volume=135|pages=225-240|doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(00)00586-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortici2011-1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mortici|first=Cristinel|year=2011|title=Ramanujan’s estimate for the gamma function via monotonicity arguments|journal=Ramanujan J.|volume=25|pages=149-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortici2011-2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mortici|first=Cristinel|year=2011|title=Improved asymptotic formulas for the gamma function|journal=Comput.

The formula was first discovered by [[Abraham de Moivre]]&lt;ref name="LeCam1986" /&gt; in the form

:&lt;math&gt;n! \sim [{\rm constant}] \cdot n^{n+\frac12} e^{-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

De Moivre gave an approximate rational-number expression for the natural logarithm of the constant. Stirling's contribution consisted of showing that the constant is precisely &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2\pi} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pearson1924" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">In [[estimation theory]] in [[statistics]], '''stochastic equicontinuity''' is a property of [[estimator]]s (estimation procedures) that is useful in dealing with their [[Asymptotic theory (statistics)|asymptotic behaviour]] as the amount of data increases. It is a version of [[equicontinuity]] used in the context of functions of [[random variables]]: that is, [[random function]]s. The property relates to the rate of [[convergence of random variables|convergence]] of sequences of random variables and requires that this rate is essentially the same within a region of the [[parameter space]] being considered.

For instance, stochastic equicontinuity, along with other conditions, can be used to show uniform weak convergence, which can be used to prove the [[convergence of random variables|convergence]] of [[extremum estimator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Newey, Whitney K. (1991) "Uniform Convergence in Probability and Stochastic Equicontinuity", ''[[Econometrica]]'', 59 (4), 1161–1167  {{jstor|2938179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt; \{ H_n(\theta): n \geq 1 \} &lt;/math&gt; be a family of random functions defined from &lt;math&gt;\Theta \rightarrow \reals&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is any normed metric space. Here &lt;math&gt;\{ H_n(\theta) \}&lt;/math&gt; might represent a sequence of estimators applied to datasets of size ''n'', given that the data arises from a population for which the parameter indexing the statistical model for the data is ''&amp;theta;''. The randomness of the functions arises from the [[Probabilistic model|data generating process]] under which a set of observed data is considered to be a realisation of a probabilistic or statistical model. However, in &lt;math&gt;\{ H_n(\theta) \}&lt;/math&gt;, ''&amp;theta;'' relates to the model currently being postulated or fitted rather than to an underlying model which is supposed to represent the mechanism generating the data. Then &lt;math&gt;\{ H_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is stochastically equicontinuous if, for every &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \eta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt; \limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} \Pr\left( \sup_{\theta \in \Theta} \sup_{\theta' \in B(\theta, \delta)} |H_n(\theta') - H_n(\theta)| &gt; \epsilon \right) &lt; \eta .&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''B''(''&amp;theta;, &amp;delta;'') represents a ball in the parameter space, centred at ''&amp;theta;'' and whose radius depends on ''&amp;delta;''.

In [[mathematics]], a '''subsequential limit''' of a [[sequence]] is the limit of some [[subsequence]]. Every subsequential limit is a [[cluster point]], but not conversely. In [[first-countable]] spaces, the two concepts coincide.

The [[supremum]] of the set of all subsequential limits of some sequence is called the limit superior, or limsup. Similarly, the infimum of such a set is called the limit inferior, or liminf. See [[limit superior and limit inferior]].

If (X,d) is a metric space and there is a [[Cauchy sequence]] such that there is a subsequence converging to some x, then the sequence also converges to x.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">In [[geometry]], a '''supporting line''' ''L'' of a [[curve]] ''C'' in the plane is a line that contains a point of ''C'', but does not separate any two points of ''C''.&lt;ref name=Busemann&gt;"The geometry of geodesics", Herbert Busemann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t22O0XBtyJsC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22supporting+line%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ld2HTKz-Ion2tgPxo7jSCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22supporting%20line%22&amp;f=false p. 158]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words,  ''C'' lies completely in one of the two [[closed set|closed]] [[half-plane]]s defined by ''L'' and has at least one point on ''L''.

==Properties==
There can be many supporting lines for a curve at a given point. When a [[tangent]] exists at a given point, then it is the unique supporting line at this point, if it does not separate the curve.

==Generalizations==
The notion of supporting line is also discussed for planar shapes. In this case a supporting line may be defined as a line which has common points with the boundary of the shape, but not with its interior.&lt;ref name=deza&gt;"Encyclopedia of Distances", by [[Michel M. Deza]], Elena Deza, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LXEezzccwcoC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=%22Grenander+distance%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M5OO7_lKSS&amp;sig=yYmvRO5vMw4Xk4HH69_NIao3YNA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U9eHTJS1JoG4sAOR1P3dCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Grenander%20distance%22&amp;f=false p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical support lines==
If two bounded connected planar shapes have disjoint [[convex hull]]s that are separated by a positive distance, then they necessarily have exactly four common lines of support, the [[bitangent]]s of the two convex hulls. Two of these lines of support separate the two shapes, and are called '''critical support lines'''.&lt;ref name=deza/&gt; Otherwise there may be more or fewer than four lines of support, even if the shapes themselves are disjoint. For instance, if one shape is an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] that contains the other, then there are no common lines of support, while if each of two shapes consists of a pair of small disks at opposite corners of a square then there may be as many as 16 common lines of support.

'''Tomek Bartoszyński''' (born May 16, 1957 as ''Tomasz Bartoszyński'' in [[Warsaw]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]]&lt;!-- is that right? --&gt;-American mathematician who works in [[set theory]].

He is the son of statistician [[Robert Bartoszyński]].

==Biography==
Bartoszyński studied mathematics at the [[University of Warsaw]] from 1976 to 1981, and worked there from 1981 to 1987.   In 1984 he defended his Ph.D. thesis ''Combinatorial aspects of measure and category''; his advisor was Wojciech Guzicki.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=74715}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he received his [[habilitation]] from the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].

From 1986 on he worked in the United States: he taught at [[University of California]] in Berkeley and Davis.  From 1990 to 2006 he was professor (full professor from 1998 on) at [[Boise State University]].   In 1990/91 he visited the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as a [[Lady Davis Fellows|fellow of the Lady Davis foundation]], and in 1996/97 he visited the [[Free University of Berlin]] as a [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Humboldt fellow]].

Currently he is one of the program directors at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), responsible for Combinatorics, Foundations, and Probability.

His wife [[Joanna Kania-Bartoszyńska]] is the NSF program director for topology and geometric analysis.

== Scientific work==
Bartoszyński's work is mainly concerned with [[forcing (set theory)|forcing]], specifically with applications of forcing to the [[set theory of the real line]].   He has written about 50 papers in this field, as well as a monograph:

An '''untouchable number''' is a positive [[integer]] that cannot be expressed as the [[summation|sum]] of all the [[proper divisor]]s of any positive integer (including the untouchable number itself). That is, these numbers are not in the image of the [[aliquot sum]] function. Their study goes back at least to [[Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi]] (circa 1000 AD), who observed that both 2 and 5 are untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Examples==
For example, the number 4 is not untouchable as it is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of 9: 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.  The number 5 is untouchable as it is not the sum of the proper divisors of any positive integer: 5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4 is the only way to write 5 as the sum of distinct positive integers including 1, but if 4 divides a number, 2 does also, so 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4 cannot be the sum of all of any number's proper divisors (since the list of factors would have to contain both 4 and 2).

The first few untouchable numbers are:

:[[2 (number)|2]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[52 (number)|52]], [[88 (number)|88]], [[96 (number)|96]], [[120 (number)|120]], [[124 (number)|124]], [[146 (number)|146]], [[162 (number)|162]], [[188 (number)|188]], [[206 (number)|206]], [[210 (number)|210]], [[216 (number)|216]], [[238 (number)|238]], [[246 (number)|246]], [[248 (number)|248]], 262, 268, [[276 (number)|276]], 288, [[290 (number)|290]], 292, 304, 306, 322, 324, 326, 336, 342, 372, 406, 408, 426, 430, 448, 472, 474, 498, ... {{OEIS|id=A005114}}

==Properties==
The number 5 is believed to be the only odd untouchable number, but this has not been proven: it would follow from a slightly stronger version of the [[Goldbach conjecture]], since the sum of the proper divisors of ''pq'' (with ''p'', ''q'' distinct primes) is 1+''p''+''q''. Thus, if a number ''n'' can be written as a sum of two distinct primes, then ''n''+1 is not an untouchable number. It is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 7 is an untouchable number, and &lt;math&gt;1=\sigma(2)-2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3=\sigma(4)-4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;7=\sigma(8)-8&lt;/math&gt;, so only 5 can be an odd untouchable number.&lt;ref&gt;The stronger version is obtained by adding to the Goldbach conjecture the further requirement that the two primes be distinct - see {{MathWorld|urlname=UntouchableNumber|title=Untouchable Number|author=Adams-Watters, Frank and Weisstein, Eric W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it appears that besides 2 and 5, all untouchable numbers are [[composite number]]s (since except 2, all even numbers are composite). No [[perfect number]] is untouchable, since, at the very least, it can be expressed as the sum of its own proper [[divisor]]s. Similarly, none of the [[amicable number]]s or [[sociable number]]s are untouchable.

No untouchable number is one more than a [[prime number]], since if ''p'' is prime, then the sum of the proper divisors of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Also, no untouchable number is three more than a prime number, except 5, since if ''p'' is an odd prime then the sum of the proper divisors of ''2p'' is&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3.

==Infinitude==
There are infinitely many untouchable numbers, a fact that was proven by [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Erdos, Über die Zahlen der Form &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)-n&lt;/math&gt; und &lt;math&gt;n-\phi(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Elemente der Math. 28 (1973), 83-86, [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/UntouchableNumber.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chen &amp; Zhao, their [[natural density]] is at least d &gt; 0.06.&lt;ref&gt;Yong-Gao Chen and Qing-Qing Zhao, Nonaliquot numbers, Publ. Math. Debrecen 78:2 (2011), pp. 439-442.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Paley''' (July 1743 – 25 May 1805) was an English clergyman, [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]], philosopher, and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]]. He is best known for his [[natural theology]] exposition of the [[teleological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] in his work ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'', which made use of the [[watchmaker analogy]].

==Life==
Paley was born in [[Peterborough]], England, and was educated at [[Giggleswick School]], of which his father was [[head teacher|headmaster]], and at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated in 1763 as [[senior wrangler]], became fellow in 1766, and in 1768 tutor of his college.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PLY758W|name=Paley, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured on [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Joseph Butler]] and [[John Locke]] in his systematic course on [[moral philosophy]], which subsequently formed the basis of his ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy''; and on the New Testament, his own copy of which is in the [[British Library]]. The sub controversy was then agitating the university, and Paley pushed an anonymous defence of a pamphlet in which the Master of Peterhouse and Bishop of Carlisle [[Edmund Law]] had advocated the retrenchment and simplification of the [[Thirty-nine Articles]]; he did not, however, sign the petition (called the "Feathers Tavern" petition, from the place where it was agreed) for a relaxation of the terms of subscription. He was also a strong supporter of the American colonies during the revolutionary war, partly because he thought it would lead to the destruction of slavery. He studied philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crimmins | first=James E. | title=William Paley (1743–1805) | journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776 Paley was presented to the rectory of [[Musgrave, Cumbria|Musgrave]] in [[Westmorland]], which was exchanged soon after for Appleby. He was subsequently made vicar of [[Dalston, Cumbria|Dalston]] in 1780, near the bishop's palace at [[Rose Castle]]. In 1782 he became the [[Archdeacon of Carlisle]]. Paley was intimate with the Law family throughout his life, and the Bishop and his son John Law (who was later an Irish bishop) were instrumental during the decade after he left Cambridge in pressing him to publish his revised lectures and in negotiating with the publisher. In 1782 Edmund Law, otherwise the mildest of men, was most particular that Paley should add a book on political philosophy to the moral philosophy, which Paley was reluctant to write. The book was published in 1785 under the title of ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', and was made a part of the examinations at the [[University of Cambridge]] the next year. It passed through fifteen editions in the author's lifetime. Paley strenuously supported the abolition of the [[slave trade]], and his attack on slavery in the book was instrumental in drawing greater public attention to the practice. In 1789, a speech he gave on the subject in Carlisle was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Paley | first=Edmund | title=The Works of William Paley, Vol 1 | year=1825 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Principles'' was followed in 1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian apologetics, ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' which compared the Paul's Epistles with the Acts of the Apostles, making use of "undesigned coincidences" to argue that these documents mutually supported each other's authenticity. Some have said this book was the most original of Paley's works. It was followed in 1794 by the celebrated ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', which was also added to the examinations at Cambridge, remaining on the syllabus until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Paley | first=William | title=''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' | year=1790 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his services in defence of the faith, with the publication of the ''Evidences'', the [[Bishop of London]] gave him a stall in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]; the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] made him subdean of that cathedral, and the [[Bishop of Durham]] conferred upon him the rectory of [[Bishopwearmouth]].  During the remainder of Paley's life, his time was divided between Bishopwearmouth and Lincoln, during which time he wrote ''Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity'', despite his increasingly debilitating illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stephen|first=Leslie | title=Dictionary of National Biography | year=1895 | publisher=MacMillan| location=New York | page=Paley entry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 25 May 1805 and is buried in Carlisle Cathedral with his two wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19881/19881-8.txt | title=Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Carlisle | publisher=Project Gutenberg | date=2006 | accessdate=14 April 2014 | author=Eley, C. King}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second son was the architect [[Edward Graham Paley]] and his grandson was the classical scholar [[Frederick Apthorp Paley]].

==Thought==

Paley's ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'' was one of the most influential philosophical texts in late Enlightenment Britain. It was cited in several parliamentary debates over the [[corn laws]] in Britain and in debates in the US Congress. The book remained a set textbook at Cambridge well into the Victorian era. [[Charles Darwin]], as a student of theology, was required to read it when he did his undergraduate studies at Christ's College, but it was Paley's ''Natural Theology'' that most impressed Darwin even though it was not a set book for undergraduates. Portraits of Paley and Darwin face each other at Christ's College to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQO3CgAAQBAJ|title=Charles Darwin in Cambridge: The Most Joyful Years|last=Wyhe|first=John van|date=2014-05-27|publisher=World Scientific|year=|isbn=9789814583992|location=|pages=120|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Paley Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity Title Page 1802.jpg|thumb|Title Page of William Paley's ''Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity'', 1802]]
Paley is also remembered for his contributions to the [[philosophy of religion]], utilitarian ethics and Christian [[apologetics]]. In 1802, he published  ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'', his last book. As he states in the preface, he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books; in fact, he suggests that ''Natural Theology'' should be read first, so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments. The main thrust of his argument was that God's design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that was evident in the physical and social order of things. Such a book fell within the broad tradition of [[natural theology]] works written during the Enlightenment; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on [[John Ray]] (1691), [[William Derham]] (1711) and [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1750).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel and David M. Knight|title='Introduction', in William Paley, Natural Theology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. "For my part", he says, "I take my stand in human anatomy"; elsewhere he insists upon "the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Science and Rhetoric of Paley's Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=1–22|doi=10.1093/litthe/18.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the [[Watchmaker analogy]].  Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] and the Dublin Astronomer Royal [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural Theology|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=Appendix entry on Brinkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world.  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher [[Cicero]], especially in his ''De natura deorum'', ii. 87 and 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallam|first=Henry|title=Introduction to the Literature of Europe, Vol II|year=1847|publisher=Murray|location=London|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by [[Deism|deists]] and Christians alike. Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read ''Natural Theology'' when it was published in 1802.

Since Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion, the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers. Earlier in the century [[David Hume]] had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity, imperfect forms of testimony and probability (see [[watchmaker analogy#Criticism|watchmaker analogy]]). Hume's arguments, however, were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell 'stillborn' (to use Hume's own assessment) from the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Fieser, James |title=Early Responses to Hume's Life and Reputation Vols 1 and 2 |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Hume's unpopularity, Paley's published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works. Paley's works were more influential than Hume's from the 1800s to the 1840s.  Hume's arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public, and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like [[Thomas Huxley]] championed Hume's philosophy in the late 19th century.

Scientific norms have changed greatly since Paley's day, and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning. But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case. The design argument has also been applied in other fields of scientific and philosophical inquiry, notably in regards to anthropic cosmological fine-tuning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpIiIaC4kRA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj_fLi_K7jA]&lt;/ref&gt; fine-tuning for discoverability&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey8723Vc8gg]&lt;/ref&gt; and the origin of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA-FcnLsF1g]&lt;/ref&gt; His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties, which might be one reason ''Natural Theology'' continued to appeal to the reading public, making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century, even after the publication of Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.  ''[[Natural Theology]]'' and the ''[[Evidences of Christianity]]'' appealed to Victorian [[Evangelicals]], although not so much to adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]] – and both found his ''utilitarianism'' objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fyfe |first=Aileen |title=Publishing and the classics: Paley's Natural Theology and the nineteenth-century scientific canon |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |year=2002 |volume=33 |pages=729–751. |doi=10.1016/s0039-3681(02)00032-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley's views influenced (both positively and negatively) theologians, philosophers and scientists, then and since.

In addition to ''Moral and Political Philosophy'' and the ''Evidences'', [[Charles Darwin]] read ''Natural Theology'' during his student years, and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument. His views changed with time. By the 1820s and 1830s, well-known liberals like [[Thomas Wakley]] and other radical editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' were using Paley's ageing examples to attack the establishment's control over medical and scientific education in Durham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. It also inspired the [[Earl of Bridgewater]] to commission the ''Bridgewater Treatises'' and the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]] to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class.   But whereas Paley's natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors, the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World War II when, as argued by [[Matthew Daniel Eddy]], the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology |journal=Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology |year=2013 |pages=101–117 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1539597/Nineteenth-_Century_Natural_Theology_Oxford_Handbook_of_Natural_Theology_Russell_Re_Manning_ed._Oxford_Oxford_University_Press_2013_._NB_I_have_uploaded_a_text_only_version_less_memory_and_a_scan_more_memory_of_the_essay_as_it_appears_in_the_OUP_volume#1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Paley's name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design. Even [[Richard Dawkins]], an opponent of the ''design argument'', described himself as a ''neo-Paleyan'' in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. Today, as in his own time (though for different reasons), Paley is a controversial figure, a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between science and religion.  His writings reflect the thought of his time, but as Dawkins observed, his was a strong and logical approach to evidence, whether human or natural. Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist [[A.V. Dicey]] had his pupils read the ''Evidences'' to teach them about legal reasoning. It is for such reasons that Paley's writings, ''Natural Theology'' included, stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought.

In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Young's inequality for integral operators''', is a bound on the &lt;math&gt;L^p\to L^q&lt;/math&gt; [[operator norm]] of an [[integral operator]] in terms of &lt;math&gt;L^r&lt;/math&gt; norms of the kernel itself.

==Statement==

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are measurable spaces, if &lt;math&gt;K : X \times Y \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{r} -1&lt;/math&gt;, if 
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{X} |K (x, y)|^r \,\mathrm{d} x \le C^r
&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{Y} |K (x, y)|^r \,\mathrm{d} y \le C^r
&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;ref&gt;Theorem 0.3.1 in: [[Christopher D. Sogge|C. D. Sogge]], ''Fourier integral operators in classical analysis'', Cambridge University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-521-43464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{X} \left|\int_{Y} K (x, y) f(y) \,\mathrm{d} y\right|^q \, \mathrm{d} x
\le C^q \left( \int_{Y} |f(y)|^p \,\mathrm{d} y\right)^\frac{q}{p}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Particular cases==

=== Convolution kernel ===

If &lt;math&gt;X = Y = \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K (x, y) = h (x - y) &lt;/math&gt;, then the inequality becomes [[Young's convolution inequality]].
