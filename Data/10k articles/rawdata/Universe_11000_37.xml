The '''2009 Australian dust storm''', also known as the '''Eastern Australian dust storm''', was a [[dust storm]] that swept across the [[Australian states]] of [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] from 22 to 24 September. The capital, [[Canberra]], experienced the dust storm on 22 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penny McLintock |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2009/09/22/2693220.htm |title=Canberra disappears in the dust |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5bE16RG?url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2009/09/22/2693220.htm |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dust, hail and deluge"&gt;{{cite web|author=Megan Doherty |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/dust-hail-and-deluge/1630629.aspx |title=Dust, hail and deluge |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |publisher=''[[The Canberra Times]]'' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5bEP9jD?url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/dust-hail-and-deluge/1630629.aspx |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 23 September the storm reached Sydney and [[Brisbane]]. Some of the thousands of tons of dirt and soil lifted in the dust storm were dumped in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and the [[Tasman Sea]].

On 23 September, the dust plume measured more than {{convert|500|km}} in width and {{convert|1000|km}} in length and covered dozens of towns and cities in two states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/6222210/Largest-dust-storms-in-70-years-cover-Sydney.html Largest dust storms in 70 years cover Sydney] ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt; By 24 September, analysis using [[MODIS]] at [[NASA]] measured the distance from the northern edge at Cape York to the southern edge of the plume to be 3,450&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Dust over Eastern Australia"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=40302 | title = Dust over Eastern Australia | date = 25 September 2009 | accessdate=25 September 2009 | publisher = NASA – Earth Observatory| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091030024037/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=40302| archivedate= 30 October 2009| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the cloud was visible from [[Outer space|space]], on the ground the intense red-orange colour and drop in temperature drew comparisons with [[nuclear winter]], [[Armageddon]], and the planet [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|author=Toni O'Loughlin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/23/australia-dust-storm-sydney|title=Australia engulfed by dust storms|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giant Dust Storm Causes Havoc In Sydney"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Woods|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Dust-Storm-In-Sydney-Sky-turns-Orange-As-Residents-Warned/Article/200909415386715?lpos=World_News_Top_Stories_Header_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15386715_Dust_Storm_In_Sydney%3A_Sky_turns_Orange_As_Residents_Warned_|title=Giant Dust Storm Causes Havoc in Sydney|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=[[Sky News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dust storm was described by the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] as a "pretty incredible event" that was the worst in the state of [[New South Wales]] in nearly 70 years.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|author=Nichola Saminather and Ed Johnson|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=aKZwUJ3C1fYY|title=Sydney Hit by 'Nuclear Winter' as Dust Storm Envelops City|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melbourne Airport warns of delays"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney dust storm worst in 70 years, says weather bureau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26113952-5006784,00.html|title=Sydney dust storm worst in 70 years, says weather bureau|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=''[[The Australian]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927153112/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26113952-5006784,00.html|archive-date=27 September 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was reported around the world. [[The Weather Channel (Australia)|The Weather Channel]]'s [[Richard Whitaker]] said: "This is unprecedented. We are seeing earth, wind and fire together".&lt;ref name="Severe dust storm sweeps Australia"/&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:2009 Dust Storm - Australia and New Zealand Map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Australia and New Zealand showing the progress of the dust affected area and dust plume at various intervals]]
[[Particulate|Air particle]] concentration levels reached 15,400 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Normal days register up to 20 micrograms and bushfires generate 500 micrograms. This concentration of dust broke records in many towns and cities.&lt;ref name="Are the dust storms radioactive"&gt;{{cite news|title=Are the dust storms radioactive? |newspaper=news.com.au |publisher=News Limited |date=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26127235-421,00.html |accessdate=26 September 2009 |first1=Greg |last1=Roberts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928034025/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C26127235-421%2C00.html |archivedate=28 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] estimated that the storm carried some 16 million tonnes of dust from the deserts of Central Australia,&lt;ref name = "16 Megaton"&gt;{{cite news | title = 16 megaton D-bomb | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | publisher = News Limited | date = 24 September 2009 | url = http://www.goldcoast.com.au | pages = 1 to 5| accessdate= 27 September 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090913205853/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/| archivedate= 13 September 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the peak of the storm, the Australian continent was estimated to be losing 75,000 tonnes of dust per hour off the NSW coast north of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Leys, J., Heidenreich, S. and Case, M. 2009. DustWatch interim report 22–23 September. DustWatch is funded by the Lower Murray Darling, Lachlan, and Murray CMAs, the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water NSW and Griffith University.&lt;/ref&gt; The dust storm coincided with other extreme weather conditions which affected the cities of [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]].

The dust is believed to have originated from [[Far West (New South Wales)|far-western New South Wales]] and north-east South Australia. This includes an area known as the 'Corner Country',&lt;ref name="Welcome to Coughs Harbour"&gt;{{cite news|title=Welcome to Coughs Harbour |newspaper=The Coffs Coast Advocate |location=Coffs Harbour, Queensland |publisher=APN News &amp; Media Ltd |date=24 September 2009 |url=http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/story/2009/09/24/blame-it-on-the-drought/ |accessdate=25 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5tvfk7f?url=http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/story/2009/09/24/blame-it-on-the-drought/ |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a dry, remote area of far-western New South Wales. In South Australia the dust may also have come from [[Lake Eyre Basin]] or the [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] area, the latter raising concerns that it was radioactive and dangerous since the area contains the [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam uranium mine]].&lt;ref name = "Are the dust storms radioactive"/&gt;

According to the New South Wales regional director of the Bureau of Meteorology, Barry Hanstrum, the cause was an "intense north low-pressure area" which "picked up a lot of dust from the very dry interior of the continent".&lt;ref name="Australian Weather Event Brings Rain to New South Wales Crops"/&gt; Senior forecaster Ewan Mitchel said winds from a [[cold front]] picked up dust from north-east South Australia on 22 September.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; That night the winds strengthened to 100&amp;nbsp;km per hour and collected more dust from areas in New South Wales that were drought affected.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

== New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory ==
The first city to be affected was [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], which was 'blacked out' at about 3:30&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 September 2009. At least one mine was shut down.&lt;ref name="Severe dust storm sweeps Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0923/australia.html|title=Severe dust storm sweeps Australia|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also witnessed in [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]]. The storm blew across [[Canberra]] and the surrounding region by midday on 23 September 2009, before being washed away by overnight rain, the heaviest rainfall over Canberra in months.&lt;ref name="Dust, hail and deluge"/&gt;

It was reported that the dust set off [[smoke alarm]]s across the state and prompted increased demand for emergency services. [[Asthma]] sufferers were hospitalised.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt; Rain was also reported to have resulted,&lt;ref name="Australian Weather Event Brings Rain to New South Wales Crops"&gt;{{cite web|author=Madelene Pearson|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=ag7J7BMOyklk|title=Australian Weather Event Brings Rain to New South Wales Crops|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[cricket ball]]-sized hailstones falling.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

The dust storm also reached the north coast of NSW on the morning of 23 September 2009. [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]] was affected by 7 am. At Coffs Harbour Airport visibility was down to 500 metres by 9 am and the airport remained closed until 10:30am. Grafton and the [[Clarence Valley Council|Clarence Valley]] were affected by 8:30 am.&lt;ref name="Welcome to Coughs Harbour"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dust storm hits Northern NSW |publisher=ABC Online |date=23 September 2009 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/09/23/2694242.htm |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5bFLUgB?url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/09/23/2694242.htm |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It caused flight delays at Ballina airport and flight cancellations for most of the day at Lismore airport with visibility at 700 metres. A local school rugby union carnival was also called off.&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;{{cite news|title=North Coast chokes in dust |newspaper=The Northern Star |location=Lismore, Queensland |publisher=APN News &amp; Media Ltd |date=24 September 2009 |url=http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2009/09/24/north-coast-chokes-in-clouds-of-red-dust/ |accessdate=25 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5txL16o?url=http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2009/09/24/north-coast-chokes-in-clouds-of-red-dust/ |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm caused severe disruption to international flights—several early morning [[Air New Zealand]] flights from [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Wellington]] had to return to [[New Zealand]] after finding themselves unable to land at [[Sydney Airport]].&lt;ref name="Air NZ flights turn back as Sydney morphs into Mars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/air-nz-flights-turn-back-sydney-morphs-mars-111557|title=Air NZ flights turn back as Sydney morphs into Mars|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=''[[National Business Review]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926080121/http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/air-nz-flights-turn-back-sydney-morphs-mars-111557|archive-date=26 September 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These flights were listed as cancelled and many others were rescheduled to a later time.&lt;ref name="Flight delays remain as dust settles in Sydney"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Janda |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2694051.htm?section=australia |title=Flight delays remain as dust settles in Sydney |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5bDbckg?url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2694051.htm?section=australia |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 international flights were diverted to [[Melbourne Airport]] or [[Brisbane Airport]], while six others were cancelled altogether.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melbourne Airport warns of delays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2693764.htm|title=Melbourne Airport warns of delays|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were delays of six hours reported for overseas flights, whilst domestic flights experienced disruption of as much as three hours.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

[[Brisbane]] was affected by the dust storm, although low visibility was less of a problem at [[Brisbane Airport]] than it was at Sydney.&lt;ref name="Brisbane awakes from haze as dust settles"&gt;{{cite web|author=Conal Hanna|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/brisbane-awakes-from-haze-as-dust-settles-20090923-g0wm.html|title=Brisbane awakes from haze as dust settles|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009|publisher=''[[Brisbane Times]]''| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090930184642/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/brisbane-awakes-from-haze-as-dust-settles-20090923-g0wm.html| archivedate= 30 September 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] was also affected by the dust storm by 11.30&amp;nbsp;am, reducing visibility to {{convert|500|m}}. Work stopped at construction sites due to health concerns, powerlines were down in some areas, the [[Q1 (building)|Q-deck]] was closed and traffic was slow with motorists using headlights. False fire alarms resulted in the evacuation of the [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] Magistrates Court. Flights were able to depart but incoming flights were diverted.&lt;ref name="Dust descends on Gold Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/09/23/140181_gold-coast-news.html |accessdate=23 September 2009 |publisher=Gold Coast Bulletin |title=Dust descends on Gold Coast |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5bGBEs2?url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/09/23/140181_gold-coast-news.html |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dust storm reached Central and North Queensland by the evening of 23 September 2009. However the effect was less serious, with visibility between  50 and 7,000 metres. Commercial flights were not disrupted.

== New Zealand ==
Red dust from the storm reached [[New Zealand]] on the morning of 25 September 2009, behind a weather front that brought cold temperatures to the North Island. It was observed by satellite, atmospheric monitoring equipment (a beta attenuation monitor) at [[Auckland International Airport]] and by dust settling on the ground. Dust settled across [[Auckland]] as well as in the [[Northland Region|Northland]], [[Waikato]], [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] and [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] districts of the North Island and it also reached the [[South Island]]'s [[West Coast Region|West Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Storm's red dust reaches NZ |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |location=New Zealand |publisher=APN Holdings NZ Limited |date=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10599532 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5tyjCdp?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10599532 |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Desert storm hits Taranaki | newspaper = Taranaki Daily News | location = Taranaki, New Zealand | publisher = Fairfax | date = 25 September 2009 | url =http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2901968/Desert-storm-hits-Taranaki | accessdate = 25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian dust storm arrives in New Zealand |newspaper=news.com.au |location=Wellington, New Zealand |publisher=News Limited |date=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,,26125380-401,00.html |accessdate=26 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091005130610/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C%2C26125380%2D401%2C00.html |archivedate=5 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.greystar.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3719&amp;Itemid=43 | newspaper = Greymouth Star | title = Aussie Outback dust smothers the Coast | accessdate = 25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19389">'''Aeroelasticity''' is the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the interactions between the [[inertial force|inertial]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a [[fluid]] flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as [[energy harvesting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sousa|first=V. C.|title=Enhanced aeroelastic energy harvesting by exploiting combined nonlinearities: theory and experiment|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2011|volume=20|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding [[snoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first= P. D. M. |title= Laser palatoplasty for snoring due to palatal flutter: a further report|journal= Clinical Otolaryngology|year=1994|volume=19|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or [[steady state|steady]] response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body's [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (typically [[vibration]]al) response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of [[fluid mechanics]], [[solid mechanics]], [[structural dynamics]] and [[dynamical systems]].
The synthesis of aeroelasticity with [[thermodynamics]] is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with [[control theory]] is known as aeroservoelasticity.

== History ==
The 2nd failure of [[Samuel Langley]]'s prototype plane on the Potomac has been attributed to aeroelastic effects (specifically, torsional divergence).&lt;ref name="Bisplinghoff"&gt;Bisplinghoff, R.L., Ashley, H. and Halfman, H., ''Aeroelasticity''. Dover Science, 1996, {{ISBN|0-486-69189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with torsional divergence plagued aircraft in the First World War, and were solved largely by trial-and-error and ad-hoc stiffening of the wing. In 1926, [[Hans Reissner]] published a theory of wing divergence, leading to much further theoretical research on the subject.&lt;ref name="Bisplinghoff" /&gt;

In the development of [[aeronautical engineering]] at [[Caltech]], [[Theodore von Kármán]] started a course "Elasticity applied to Aeronautics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore von Kármán]] (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond'', page 155&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching the course for one term, Kármán passed it over to [[Ernest Edwin Sechler]], who developed aeroelasticity in that course, and in publication of [[textbook]]s on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Edwin Sechler]] and L.G. Dunn (1942) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.205355 Airplane Structural Analysis and Design] from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Sechler (1952) ''Elasticity in Engineering''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, [[Arthur Roderick Collar]] defined aeroelasticity as ''"the study of the mutual interaction that takes place within the triangle of the inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces acting on structural members exposed to an airstream, and the influence of this study on design."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collar|first=A. R.|title=The first fifty years of aeroelasticity|journal=Aerospace|year=1978|volume=5|series=2|pages=12–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static aeroelasticity ==
In an aeroplane, two significant static aeroelastic effects may occur. ''Divergence'' is a phenomenon in which the elastic twist of the wing suddenly becomes theoretically infinite, typically causing the wing to fail spectacularly. ''Control reversal'' is a phenomenon occurring only in wings with [[aileron]]s or other control surfaces, in which these control surfaces reverse their usual functionality (e.g., the rolling direction associated with a given aileron moment is reversed).

=== Divergence ===
Divergence occurs when a lifting surface deflects under aerodynamic load so as to increase the applied load, or move the load so that the twisting effect on the structure is increased. The increased load deflects the structure further, which eventually brings the structure to the point of divergence. Divergence can be understood as a simple property of the [[differential equation]](s) governing the wing [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]]. For example, modelling the airplane wing as an [[isotropic]] [[Euler–Bernoulli beam theory|Euler–Bernoulli beam]], the uncoupled torsional [[equation of motion]] is:

: &lt;math&gt; GJ \frac{d^2 \theta}{dy^2} = -M'&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''y'' is the spanwise dimension, ''θ'' is the elastic twist of the beam, ''GJ'' is the torsional stiffness of the beam, ''L'' is the beam length, and ''M’'' is the aerodynamic moment per unit length. Under a simple lift forcing theory the aerodynamic moment is of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;M' = C U^2 (\theta + \alpha_0) &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''C'' is a coefficient, ''U'' is the free-stream fluid velocity, and α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial angle of attack. This yields an [[ordinary differential equation]] of the form:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 \theta}{dy^2} + \lambda^2 \theta = -\lambda^2 \alpha_0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda^2 = C U^2/(GJ)&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions for a clamped-free beam (i.e., a cantilever wing) are:

: &lt;math&gt; \theta|_{y=0} = \frac{d\theta}{dy}\biggl|_{y=L} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Which yields the solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \alpha_{0} [\tan (\lambda L) \sin(\lambda y) + \cos (\lambda y) - 1]&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, for ''λL = π/2 + nπ'', with arbitrary integer number ''n'', ''tan(λL)'' is infinite. ''n = 0'' corresponds to the point of torsional divergence. For given structural parameters, this will correspond to a single value of free-stream velocity U. This is the torsional divergence speed. Note that for some special boundary conditions that may be implemented in a wind tunnel test of an airfoil (e.g., a torsional restraint positioned forward of the aerodynamic center) it is possible to eliminate the phenomenon of divergence altogether.&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;Hodges, D.H. and Pierce, A., ''Introduction to Structural Dynamics and Aeroelasticity'', Cambridge, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-80698-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control reversal ===
{{main article|Control reversal}}
Control surface reversal is the loss (or reversal) of the expected response of a control surface, due to deformation of the main lifting surface. For simple models (e.g. single aileron on an Euler-Bernoulli beam), control reversal speeds can be derived analytically as for torsional divergence. Control reversal can be used to aerodynamic advantage, and forms part of the [[Kaman servo-flap rotor]] design.&lt;ref name="Hodges" /&gt;

== Dynamic aeroelasticity ==
'''Dynamic aeroelasticity''' studies the interactions among aerodynamic, elastic, and inertial forces. Examples of dynamic aeroelastic phenomena are:

=== Flutter ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Resonance]], and [[Aeroelastic flutter]] redirects here --&gt;
'''Flutter''' is a dynamic instability of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by [[positive feedback]] between the body's deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow. In a [[linear system]], 'flutter point' is the point at which the structure is undergoing [[simple harmonic motion]]—zero net [[damping]]—and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a [[self-oscillation]] and eventual failure. 'Net damping' can be understood as the sum of the structure's natural positive damping, and the negative damping of the aerodynamic force. Flutter can be classified into two types: ''hard flutter'', in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and ''soft flutter'', in which the net damping decreases gradually.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dimitriadis, University of Liège, ''Aeroelasticity: Lectrue 6: Flight testing'', [http://www.ltas-aea.ulg.ac.be/cms/uploads/Aeroelasticity06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the p-method, the k-method and the p-k method.&lt;ref name="Hodges" /&gt; In water the mass ratio of the  pitch inertia of the foil vs that of the circumscribing cylinder of fluid is generally too low for binary flutter to occur, as shown by explicit solution of the simplest pitch and heave flutter stability determinant.&lt;ref name="windeng372013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/c553k773504m276x/?p=b99b20fe0d14408b9a01c901c4c31c05&amp;pi=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141029011643/http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/c553k773504m276x/?p=b99b20fe0d14408b9a01c901c4c31c05&amp;pi=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-29 |title=Binary Flutter as an Oscillating Windmill - Scaling &amp; Linear Analysis |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=37 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[nonlinear system]]s, flutter is usually interpreted as a [[limit cycle]] oscillation (LCO), and methods from the study of [[dynamical system]]s can be used to determine the speed at which flutter will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=D. M.|title=Effects of geometric structural nonlinearity on flutter and limit cycle oscillations of high-aspect-ratio wings|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2004|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tacoma Narrows Bridge destruction.ogv|thumb|Video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge being destroyed through aeroelastic fluttering]]
Structures exposed to aerodynamic forces—including wings and aerofoils, but also chimneys and bridges—are designed carefully within known parameters to avoid flutter.  In complex structures where both the aerodynamics and the mechanical properties of the structure are not fully understood, flutter can be discounted only through detailed testing. Even changing the mass distribution of an aircraft or the [[stiffness]] of one component can induce flutter in an apparently unrelated aerodynamic component.  At its mildest this can appear as a "buzz" in the aircraft structure, but at its most violent it can develop uncontrollably with great speed and cause serious damage to or lead to the destruction of the aircraft,&lt;ref name = "YouTube"&gt;{{citation | format = Video | title = YouTube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRit6tcNT4s | contribution = Visual demonstration of flutter which destroys an RC aircraft}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Braniff Flight 542]].  Famously the original [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] was destroyed as a result of aeroelastic fluttering.&lt;ref&gt;The adequacy of comparison between flutter in aircraft aerodynamics and Tacoma Narrows Bridge case is discussed and disputed in Yusuf K. Billah, Robert H. Scanian, [http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf  "Resonance, Tacoma Bridge failure, and undergraduate physics textbooks"]; Am. J.

Flutter as a [[controlled aerodynamic instability phenomena|controlled aerodynamic instability phenomenon]] is used intentionally and positively in windmills for generating electricity and in other works like making musical tones on ground-mounted devices, as well as on [[Kite types|musical kites]]. Flutter is not always a destructive force; recent progress has been made in windmills for underserved communities in developing countries, designed specifically to take advantage of this effect. The oscillating motion allows variable-stroke waterpumping to match the variable power in the wind. Semirotary binary flutter can also have an upper critical airspeed at which it stops, affording automatic high wind protection&lt;ref name="windeng372013"/&gt;  The resulting Wing'd Pump has been designed to mount on the well it pumps or float on the pond it draws from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIj7LCtX0U|format=video|title=WING'D MILLS 2013: FLO'Pump and FLUTTER WELL Pump}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its large scale the flutter is coupled by static gravity imbalance as well as dynamic imbalance. Further a gravity pendulum  achieves large amplitude elasticity most practically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/11008833rq050v7p/?p=818833456ce141dea72484aebc3306e6&amp;pi=8 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140608213846/http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/11008833rq050v7p/?p=818833456ce141dea72484aebc3306e6&amp;pi=8 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-06-08 |journal=Wind Engineering |title=The Flutterwing WindPumps: Design, NonLinearities, &amp; Measurements |year=2014 |volume=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same annual output can be achieved with wing length equal to a multiblade rotary windpump's diameter, in half the windspeed regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Econologica | place = Canada |url=http://www.econologica.org| title = Wing'd Pump}}.&lt;/ref&gt; P.

=== Buffeting ===
'''[[Transonic buffet|Buffeting]]''' is a high-frequency instability, caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillations from one object striking another. It is caused by a sudden impulse of load increasing. It is a random forced vibration. Generally it affects the tail unit of the aircraft structure due to air flow downstream of the wing.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The methods for buffet detection are:

# Pressure divergence at trailing edge
# Computing separation from trailing edge based on [[Mach number]]
# Normal force fluctuating divergence

=== Transonic aeroelasticity===
Flow is highly non-linear in the [[transonic]] regime, dominated by moving shock waves. It is mission-critical for aircraft that fly through transonic Mach numbers. The role of shock waves was first analyzed by [[Holt Ashley]].&lt;ref&gt;Holt Ashley. "Role of Shocks in the "Sub-Transonic" Flutter Phenomenon", Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 17, No. 3 (1980), pp. 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; A phenomenon that impacts stability of aircraft known as 'transonic dip', in which the flutter speed can get close to flight speed, was reported in May 1976 by Farmer and Hanson&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, M.G. and Hanson, P.W., "Comparison of Super-critical and Conventional Wing Flutter Characteristics," NASA TM X-72837&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Langley Research Center]].

== Prediction and cure ==
Aeroelasticity involves not just the external aerodynamic loads and the way they change but also the structural, [[damping]] and mass characteristics of the aircraft. Prediction involves making a [[mathematical model]] of the aircraft as a series of masses connected by springs and dampers which are tuned to represent the [[dynamic characteristics]] of the aircraft structure. The model also includes details of applied aerodynamic forces and how they vary.

The model can be used to predict the flutter margin and, if necessary, test fixes to potential problems. Small carefully chosen changes to mass distribution and local structural stiffness can be very effective in solving aeroelastic problems.

== Media ==
These videos detail the [[X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing|Active Aeroelastic Wing]] two-phase [[NASA]]-[[United States Air Force|Air Force]] flight research program to investigate the potential of aerodynamically twisting flexible wings to improve maneuverability of high-performance aircraft at transonic and [[supersonic]] speeds, with traditional control surfaces such as [[aileron]]s and leading-edge flaps used to induce the twist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13727">'''Anaerobic respiration''' is [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] using [[electron acceptors]] other than [[Allotropes of oxygen|molecular oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Although oxygen is not the final electron acceptor, the process still uses a respiratory electron transport chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slonczewski|first1=Joan L.|last2=Foster|first2=John W.|title=Microbiology : An Evolving Science|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393934472|page=166|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aerobic organisms]] undergoing respiration, electrons are shuttled to an [[electron transport chain]], and the final electron acceptor is oxygen. [[Molecular oxygen]] is a highly [[oxidizing agent]] and, therefore, is an excellent electron acceptor. In [[anaerobes]], other less-oxidizing substances such as [[sulfate]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[sulphur]] (S), or [[fumarate]] are used. These terminal electron acceptors have smaller [[reduction potential]]s than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning that less energy is released per oxidized molecule. Therefore, generally speaking, anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic.

== As compared with fermentation ==
There are two important microbial methane formation pathways, through carbonate reduction (respiration), and acetate fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.biogeosciences.net/14/2283/2017|doi=10.5194/bg-14-2283-2017|year=2017|author=Sapart et al.|journal=Biogeosciences|volume=14|issue=9|pages=2283–2292|title=The origin of methane in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf unraveled with triple isotope analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellular respiration (both [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] and anaerobic) utilizes highly reduced chemical compounds such as [[NADH]] and [[FADH2]] (for example produced during [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]]) to establish an [[electrochemical gradient]] (often a proton gradient) across a membrane, resulting in an [[electrical potential]] or ion [[concentration]] difference across the membrane. The reduced chemical compounds are oxidized by a series of respiratory [[integral membrane proteins]] with sequentially increasing reduction potentials with the final electron acceptor being [[oxygen]] (in [[aerobic respiration]]) or another chemical substance (in anaerobic respiration). A [[proton motive force]] drives [[protons]] down the gradient (across the membrane) through the proton channel of [[ATP synthase]]. The resulting current drives ATP synthesis from [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and inorganic phosphate.

[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]], in contrast, does not utilize an electrochemical gradient. Fermentation instead only uses [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] to produce ATP. The electron acceptor [[NAD+]] is regenerated from [[NADH]] formed in oxidative steps of the fermentation pathway by the reduction of oxidized compounds. These oxidized compounds are often formed during the fermentation pathway itself, but may also be external. For example, in homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, NADH formed during the oxidation of [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] is oxidized back to NAD+ by the reduction of [[pyruvate]] to [[lactic acid]] at a later stage in the pathway. In [[yeast]], [[acetaldehyde]] is reduced to [[ethanol]] to regenerate NAD+.  The two processes thus generate ATP in very different ways, and the terms should not be treated as synonyms.

==Ecological importance==

Anaerobic respiration is a critical component of the global [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[iron]], [[sulfur cycle|sulfur]], and [[carbon cycle|carbon]] cycles through the reduction of the oxyanions of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon to more-reduced compounds.  The [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]] of these compounds, which depends upon anaerobic respiration, significantly impacts the [[carbon cycle]] and [[global warming]]. Anaerobic respiration occurs in many environments, including freshwater and marine sediments, soil, subsurface aquifers, deep subsurface environments, and biofilms. Even environments, such as soil, that contain oxygen also have micro-environments that lack oxygen due to the slow diffusion characteristics of [[oxygen]] gas.

An example of the ecological importance of anaerobic respiration is the use of nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, or dissimilatory [[denitrification]], which is the main route by which fixed [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]] is returned to the atmosphere as molecular nitrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Jörg|last2=Klotz|first2=Martin G.|date=2013-02-01|title=Diversity and evolution of bioenergetic systems involved in microbial nitrogen compound transformations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000527281200984X|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|series=The evolutionary aspects of bioenergetic systems|volume=1827|issue=2|pages=114–135|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2012.07.005|pmid=22842521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[methanogenesis]], a form of carbonate respiration, that is used to produce [[methane]] gas by [[anaerobic digestion]]. Biogenic methane is used as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. On the negative side, uncontrolled methanogenesis in landfill sites releases large volumes of methane into the atmosphere, where it acts as a powerful [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogner|first=Jean|last2=Pipatti|first2=Riitta|last3=Hashimoto|first3=Seiji|last4=Diaz|first4=Cristobal|last5=Mareckova|first5=Katarina|last6=Diaz|first6=Luis|last7=Kjeldsen|first7=Peter|last8=Monni|first8=Suvi|last9=Faaij|first9=Andre|date=2008-02-01|title=Mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions from waste: conclusions and strategies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report.

==Economic relevance==

Dissimilatory [[denitrification]] is widely used in the removal of [[nitrate]] and [[nitrite]] from municipal wastewater. An excess of nitrate can lead to [[eutrophication]] of waterways into which treated water is released. Elevated nitrite levels in drinking water can lead to problems due to its toxicity. Denitrification converts both compounds into harmless nitrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nancharaiah|first=Y. V.|last2=Venkata Mohan|first2=S.|last3=Lens|first3=P. N. L.|date=2016-09-01|title=Recent advances in nutrient removal and recovery in biological and bioelectrochemical systems|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=215|pages=173–185|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.129|issn=1873-2976|pmid=27053446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anaerobic Denitrification (ETC System).svg|thumb|Anaerobic Denitrification (ETC System)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;English: The model above shows the process of anaerobic respiration through denitrification which takes place in some bacteria. The process shown takes place in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes. NO3 goes through respiratory dehydrogenase and reduces through each step from the Ubiquinose through the bc1 complex through the ATP Synthase protein as well. Each reductase loses oxygen through each step so that the final product of anaerobic respiration is N2.

&lt;br&gt;2. Periplasm]]


Specific types of anaerobic respiration are also critical in [[bioremediation]], which uses microorganisms to convert toxic chemicals into less-harmful molecules to clean up contaminated beaches, aquifers, lakes, and oceans. For example, toxic [[arsenate]] or [[selenate]] can be reduced to less toxic compounds by various anaerobic bacteria via anaerobic respiration. The reduction of [[Organochloride|chlorinated chemical pollutants]], such as [[vinyl chloride]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]], also occurs through anaerobic respiration.

Anaerobic respiration is useful in generating electricity in [[microbial fuel cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which employ bacteria that respire solid electron acceptors (such as oxidized iron) to transfer electrons from reduced compounds to an electrode. This process can simultaneously degrade organic carbon waste and generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Bojun|last2=Ge|first2=Zheng|last3=He|first3=Zhen|date=2015-05-15|title=Sediment microbial fuel cells for wastewater treatment: challenges and opportunities|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5EW00020C|journal=Environ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">The '''Anderson impurity model''' is a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] that is used to describe [[magnetic impurity|magnetic impurities]] embedded in [[metal]]lic hosts. It is often applied to the description of [[Jun Kondo|Kondo]]-type problems, such as [[heavy fermion]] systems and [[Kondo insulator]]s. In its simplest form, the model contains a term describing the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons, a two-level term with an on-site Coulomb repulsion that models the impurity energy levels, and a hybridization term that couples conduction and impurity orbitals. For a single impurity, the Hamiltonian takes the form

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{\sigma}\epsilon_f f^{\dagger}_{\sigma}f_{\sigma} + \sum_{\langle j, j^\prime\rangle\sigma}t_{jj'} c^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}c_{j'\sigma} + \sum_{j,\sigma}(V_j f^{\dagger}_{\sigma}c_{j\sigma} + V_j^* c^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}f_{\sigma}) + Uf^{\dagger}_{\uparrow}f_{\uparrow}f^{\dagger}_{\downarrow}f_{\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; operator corresponds to the annihilation operator of an impurity, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a conduction electron annihilation operator, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; labels the spin. The onsite Coulomb repulsion is &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, which is usually the dominant energy scale, and &lt;math&gt;t_{jj'}&lt;/math&gt; is the hopping strength from site &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to site &lt;math&gt;j'&lt;/math&gt;. A significant feature of this model is the hybridization term &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, which allows the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; electrons in heavy fermion systems to become mobile, although they are separated by a distance greater than the [[Hill limit (solid-state)|Hill limit]].

For heavy-fermion systems, a lattice of impurities is described by the periodic Anderson model:

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{j\sigma}\epsilon_f f^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}f_{j\sigma} + \sum_{\langle j, j^\prime \rangle\sigma}t_{jj'}c^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}c_{j'\sigma} + \sum_{j,\sigma}(V_j f^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}c_{j\sigma} + V_j^* c^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}f_{j\sigma}) + U\sum_{j}f^{\dagger}_{j\uparrow}f_{j\uparrow}f^{\dagger}_{j\downarrow}f_{j\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;

There are other variants of the Anderson model, for instance the SU(4) Anderson model, which is used to describe impurities which have an orbital, as well as a spin, degree of freedom. This is relevant in [[carbon nanotube quantum dot]] systems. The SU(4) Anderson model Hamiltonian is

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{i\sigma}\epsilon_f f^{\dagger}_{i\sigma}f_{i\sigma} + \sum_{&lt;j, j'&gt;\sigma}t_{ijj'} c^{\dagger}_{ij\sigma}c_{ij'\sigma} + \sum_{ij,\sigma}(V_j f^{\dagger}_{i\sigma}c_{ij\sigma} + V_j^* c^{\dagger}_{ij\sigma}f_{i\sigma}) + \sum_{i\sigma,i'\sigma '} \frac{U}{2}n_{i\sigma}n_{i'\sigma '}&lt;/math&gt;

where i and i' label the orbital degree of freedom (which can take one of two values), and n represents a [[number operator]].

The '''California Volcano Observatory''' (CalVO) is the [[volcano observatory]] that monitors the volcanic and geologic activity of California and Nevada. It is a part of the [[Volcano Hazards Program]] of the [[United States Geological Survey]], a scientific agency of the [[United States government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wovo.org/1201.html WOVO.org: World Organization of Volcano Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the volcano observatory was known as the Long Valley Observatory which monitored volcanic activity east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[Mono County, California]] which included [[Long Valley Caldera]], [[Mammoth Mountain]], and the [[Mono–Inyo Craters]]. 

In 2012, the Long Valley Observatory was integrated into the new California Volcano Observatory based in [[Menlo Park, California]] which covers the entire states of California and Nevada, this includes the southern Cascade Range volcanoes in the state of California which were previously under the jurisdiction of the [[Cascades Volcano Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klemetti|first=Erik|title=Meet the USGS’s Newest Volcano Observatory: CalVO|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/02/meet-the-usgss-newest-volcano-observatory-calvo/|work=Eruptions|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=11 February 2012|date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4127">The '''Canadian Nuclear Society''' (CNS) is a not-for-profit organization representing individuals contributing to, or otherwise supporting, [[nuclear science]] and [[nuclear engineering|engineering]] in [[Canada]].

The CNS is a member of the [[International Nuclear Societies Council]] (INSC).

==History and Mandate==

The Canadian Nuclear Society was established in 1979 as "the technical society of the [[Canadian Nuclear Association]] (CNA)". Although legally a division of the CNA, the CNS operated independently from the start, with its own volunteer Council ([[Board of Directors]]), its own mandate, its own activities, and its own budget. In 1998 the CNS incorporated independently as a federal, not-for-profit corporation, following an overwhelming vote from members. Since then the legal name of the CNS is "Canadian Nuclear Society/Société Nucléaire Canadienne, Inc.".

The CNS is dedicated to the exchange of information, both within the nuclear professional and academic community, and with the public, in the field of applied nuclear science and technology. This encompasses all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[uranium]], [[nuclear fission|fission]] and other nuclear technologies such as occupational and environmental protection, [[nuclear medicine|medical diagnosis and treatment]], the use of [[radioisotopes]], and [[food irradiation|food preservation]]. 

==Governance==
The CNS is governed by a council, acting as its board of directors, consisting of an executive committee and nine - sixteen members-at-large.  The 2017–2018 executive committee consists of: Daniel Gammage (president), Peter Ozemoyah (past president), John Luxat (1st vice-president and president-elect), Keith Stratton (2nd vice-president), Mohamed Younis (treasurer), Colin Hunt (secretary), Ken Smith (financial administrator), Ben Rouben (executive director), Peter Easton (communications director), and John Roberts (chair of the Education and Communications Committee).

==Membership==

The CNS membership includes about 1200 individuals, mostly from within Canada.

The primary category of CNS membership is that of an individual directly involved in the use or development of a nuclear technology in any of the above areas or an individual who is simply interested in nuclear technology. 

Another category of CNS membership is that of an educational institution, such as school or university, or public library, that has an interest in providing timely information on nuclear science and technology to a student body or to the public at large. This type of membership has all the privileges of an individual membership with the exception of voting rights. 

==Operational Structure and Activities==

The CNS is structured along five main technical Divisions (Design &amp; Materials, Fuel Technologies, Nuclear Operations &amp; Maintenance, Nuclear Science &amp; Engineering, and Environment &amp; Waste Management), whose main activities are to organize and conduct workshops, courses, symposia, or conferences within their respective technical areas.  

General administration and outreach (public, other societies, etc.) are typically carried out by a number of Committees within the CNS.

The CNS holds an annual conference each June, which includes technical sessions covering all fields, as well as plenary sessions that address topics of broad interest.

At the local level across the country, the CNS includes fourteen branches (nine in [[Ontario]], one in each of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Quebec]], and [[New Brunswick]])

==Affiliations==
The CNS is affiliated with several "sister" nuclear societies around the world, and is also an organizational member of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]] (EIC).   The president of the CNS is an ''ex officio'' voting member of the board of directors of the [[Canadian Nuclear Association]].

'''Radionuclides which emit [[gamma radiation]]''' are valuable in a range of different industrial, scientific and medical technologies. This article lists some common gamma-emitting radionuclides of technological importance, and their properties.

== Fission products ==

Many artificial [[radionuclide]]s of technological importance are produced as fission products within [[nuclear reactor]]s. A [[fission product]] is a nucleus with approximately half the mass of a uranium or plutonium nucleus which is left over after such a nucleus has been "split" in a [[nuclear fission]] reaction.

[[Caesium-137]] is one such radionuclide. It has a [[half-life]] of 30 years, and decays by pure [[beta decay]] to a [[metastable]] state of [[barium]]-137 ({{SimpleNuclide2|barium|137|m|link=yes}}).  Barium-137m has a half-life of minutes and is responsible for all of the [[gamma ray]] emission. The ground state of [[barium-137]] is stable.

The gamma ray ([[photon]]) energy of Ba-137m is about 662&amp;nbsp;keV. These gamma rays can be used, for example, in radiotherapy such as for the treatment of cancer, in [[Food irradiation|food irradation]], or in industrial gauges or sensors. Cs-137 is not widely used for industrial [[radiography]] as other nuclides, such as [[cobalt-60]] or [[iridium-192]] for example, offer higher radiation output for a given volume.

[[Iodine-131]] is another important gamma-emitting radionuclide produced as a fission product. With a short half-life of 8 days, this radioisotope is not of practical use in radioactive sources in industrial radiography or sensing. However, since iodine is a component of biological molecules such as thyroid hormones, iodine-131 is of great importance in [[nuclear medicine]], and in medical and biological research as a [[radioactive tracer]].

[[Lanthanum-140]] is a [[decay product]] of [[barium-140]], a common fission product. It is a potent gamma emitter. It was used in high quantities during the [[Manhattan Project]] for the [[RaLa Experiment]]s.

== Activation products ==

Some radionuclides, for example [[cobalt-60]] and [[iridium-192]], are made by the [[neutron irradiation]] of normal non-radioactive [[cobalt]] and [[iridium]] metal in a [[nuclear reactor]], creating radioactive nuclides of these elements which contain extra neutrons, compared to the original stable nuclides.

In addition to their uses in radiography, both [[cobalt]]-60 ([[Co-60]]) and [[iridium]]-192 ([[Ir-192]]) are used in the [[radiotherapy]] of cancer. [[Cobalt]]-60 tends to be used in [[teletherapy]] units as a higher photon energy alternative to Cs-137, while iridium-192 tends to be used in a different mode of therapy, internal radiotherapy or [[brachytherapy]].  The iridium wires for brachytherapy are a [[palladium]]-coated iridium/palladium [[alloy]] wire made radioactive by [[neutron activation]]. This wire is then inserted into a tumor such as a [[breast]] tumor, and the tumor is irradiated by gamma ray [[photons]] from the wire. At the end of the treatment the wire is removed.

A rare but notable gamma source is [[sodium]]-24, this has a very short half-life but it emits photons with very high energies (&gt;2 MeV). It could be used for radiography of thick steel objects if the radiography occurred close to the point of production. In common with Co-60 and Ir-192 it is formed by the [[neutron activation]] of the commonly found stable isotope.

== Minor actinides ==

[[Americium]]-241 has been used as a source of low energy gamma photons, it has been used in some applications such as portable X-ray [[fluorescence]] equipment ([[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]]) and common household ionizing smoke detectors.

== Natural radioisotopes ==

Many years ago [[radium]]-226 and [[radon]]-222 sources were used as [[gamma-ray]] sources for industrial [[radiography]]: for instance a [[radon]]-222 source was used to examine the mechanisms inside an unexploded [[V-1 flying bomb]], while some of the early [[Bathysphere]]s could be examined using radium-226 to check for cracks. Because both radium and radon are very radiotoxic and very expensive due to their natural rarity, these natural radioisotopes have fallen out of use over the last half-century, replaced by artificially created radioisotopes.

The '''Danish Ministry of Transport''' ({{lang-da|Transportministeriet}}) is the [[Government of Denmark|Danish]] ministry in charge of coordinating and realizing the transport politics of [[Denmark]].

The Ministry is headed by a Permanent Secretary. The Ministry of Transport employs approximately 140 staff. The daily administration and handling of tasks and assignments on transport are carried out by a number of institutions, executive agencies, corporations, councils and boards. Counting every institution and every corporation the Ministry employs around 40.000 people

== History ==

The Ministry of Transport was founded in 1892 under the name Ministry for Public Works ("''Ministeriet for offentlige Arbejder''"). In 1987 it changed name to Ministry of Traffic ("''Trafikministeriet''"), though briefly known as Ministry of Traffic and Communication ("''Trafik- og Kommunikationsministeriet''") during 1988 to 1989. In 2005 the energy sector was detached from [[Danish Ministry of the Environment|Ministry of the Environment]] and attached to the Ministry of Traffic. In turn, the name was changed to Ministry of Transport and Energy; the energy department was transferred to what is now known as the [[Danish Ministry of Climate and Energy]] in 2007.

'''Edward Lewis Morse''' (born January 5, 1942 in [[New York City]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[petroleum|energy]] [[economics|economist]].  He is currently the Global Head of Commodities Research at Citigroup in New York. From 1969 to 1975, he taught at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson School]] at [[Princeton University]]. From 1979 to 1981, Morse served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Energy Policy. From 2006 to 2008, he was chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers, where he argued the [[2000s energy crisis|oil price rises of 2007 and 2008]] were an unsustainable bubble. He is the author of numerous books and scholarly articles on international relations and energy topics. He was a co-founder of [[PFC Energy]], a Washington-based energy consultancy group.

==Early life==
Morse was born in [[New York City]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1963; [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], 1966). He then received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1969.

==Career==
He taught international relations at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] from 1969 to 1975. From 1975 to 1978, Morse was a senior research fellow at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].

In 1978, Morse joined the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], where he was initially executive assistant to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs. In 1979, Morse became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Energy Policy, and was the U.S. representative at the [[International Energy Agency]], under the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administrations.

From 1981 to 1984, he worked at [[ConocoPhillips|Phillips Petroleum Co.]], where he was Director for International Affairs. He was a co-founder and Managing Director at [[PFC Energy]] from 1984 to 1996. He was president of the ''[[Energy Intelligence Group|Petroleum Intelligence Weekly]]'', a premier journal for energy intelligence, from 1988 to 1999. In 1999, Morse joined Hess Energy Trading Co. as a senior executive.

In 2001, Morse chaired a task force on energy security, sponsored jointly by the Council on Foreign Relations and the James A. Baker III Institute at [[Rice University]].

In 2006, Morse joined [[Lehman Brothers]] as a managing director and chief energy economist, where he built a world-class team as part of the #1-ranked fixed-income research group. Upon its [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|bankruptcy]] in 2008, Morse moved to Louis Capital Markets. In January 2010, Edward Morse joined [[Credit Suisse]] as Head of Commodities Research. In 2011, Morse was hired by Citigroup to be their Global Head of Commodities Research.

He is chairman of the New York Energy Forum, and serves on the academic advisory boards at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. He is a member of Oxford Energy Policy Club, the Council on Foreign Relations, and an editor of The Geopolitics of Energy. For his pioneering contributions to energy research, he was honored by the International Association for Energy Economics.

==Personal==
Morse has a keen interest in ballet, and is a member of the Chairman's Council of the American Ballet Theatre.

He married Linda Kasle Jones on August 15, 1965. He has two children, Michael Ari and Molly Rachel, and five grandchildren.

==Oil price spike of 2007-08==
In 2008, as oil prices approached its [[2000s energy crisis|peak]] near $150/bbl, Morse and his research team at Lehman Brothers argued this was an [[Economic bubble|unsustainable overshooting]] fueled by behavioral herding, and that there would be sufficient [[demand destruction]] in advanced economies and new supply from non-OPEC countries to cause prices to collapse [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_30/b4093000546844.htm?chan=magazine+channel_what%27s+next]. As oil prices subsequently plunged, Morse's foresight proved correct [http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/russia_oil_politics/archives/2008/09/irony_at_lehman.html].

== 1MDB controversy ==
In 2009 Morse provided a valuation for the Malaysian state fund 1MDB for petroleum exploration and production assets associated with PetroSaudi International Ltd. The valuation he provided was $2.9 billion, which supported 1MDB's decision to enter a joint venture with PetroSaudi. The same assets were valued earlier that year by PetroSaudi at $0.5 billion. Leaked emails and 1MDB board minutes suggest that Morse's valuation was influenced by PetroSaudi director Patrick Mahony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sarawakreport.org/2016/01/tarek-rated-petrosaudi-project-as-being-worth-zero/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1044629783|title=Billion dollar whale : the man who fooled Wall Street, Hollywood, and the world|last=reporter),|first=Wright, Tom (Wall Street Journal|others=Hope, Bradley,|isbn=9780316436502|edition= First|location=New York, NY|oclc=1044629783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16548">'''Elevational diversity gradient''' (EDG) is an ecological pattern where trends in [[biodiversity]] occur at different [[elevation]]s. The EDG states that [[species richness]] tends to increase as elevation increases, up to a certain point, creating a "diversity bulge" at middle elevations. There have been multiple hypotheses proposed for explaining the EDG, none of which accurately describe the phenomenon in full.

[[File:MontanaMountains.jpeg|thumb|View of Mont LeConte in Great Smokey Mountains National Park, Tennessee]]

A similar pattern, known as the [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal diversity gradient]], describes an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the [[equator]]. While the EDG generally follows the LDG (i.e., high elevations in tropical regions have greater biodiversity than high elevations in temperate regions), the LDG does not account for elevational changes.

==Origin==
The first recorded observation of the elevational diversity gradient was by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his treatise ''On the growth of the habitable earth''. In this document, Linnaeus based his predictions on [[flood geology]], assuming most of the world was at one point inundated, leaving only the highest elevations available for terrestrial life. Since, by Linnaeus’ hypothesis, all life was concentrated at high elevations, a higher species diversity would be observed there even as life re-populated lower elevations.

In 1799, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aimé Bonpland]] described elevational changes along the [[Andes|Andean]] slopes, noting how climatic changes impacted plant and animal communities. These observations contributed to [[Leslie Holdridge|Leslie R. Holdridge’s]] "life zone concept" (1947). Climatic variables shaping life zones include mean potential temperature, total annual precipitation, and the ratio of mean annual [[evapotranspiration]] to mean annual precipitation. These variables, most notably precipitation and temperature, vary along an elevational gradient, resulting in the distribution of different ecosystems.&lt;ref name=kricher2011&gt;Kricher, J. C. (2011) What and where are the tropics? Tropical Ecology, pp. 7-25. Princeton UP, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the current literature correlates elevational diversity to gradients in single climatic or biotic variables including "rainfall, temperature, productivity, competition, resource abundance, habitat complexity, or habitat diversity".&lt;ref name=mccain2005&gt;McCain &amp; Christy M. (2005) Elevational gradients in diversity of small mammals. Ecology, 86.2, 366-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Mid-domain effect===
A pattern in species richness is also observed as one moves along an elevational gradient; generally, species richness is thought to decline with increasing elevation. Whether this decline is monotonic or if it assumes different shapes based on the [[taxa]] or region being studied is still a topic of debate. In a review of previous studies looking at elevational diversity gradients, Rahbek noted the importance of other factors contributing to the shape of a gradient, distinguishing elevational patterns from those described by the latitudinal diversity gradient.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995&gt;Rahbek, C. (1995) The elevational gradient of species richness – a uniform pattern. Ecography, 18, 200–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

For certain taxa and regions, there is a mid elevational peak in species richness. This pattern has received empirical support for small mammals,&lt;ref name=mccain2004&gt;McCain, C. M. (2004) The mid-domain effect applied to elevational gradients: species richness of small mammals in Costa Rica. Journal of Biogeography, 31, 19-31.&lt;/ref&gt; spiders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaladze | first1 = G. | last2 = Otto | first2 = S. | last3 = Tramp | first3 = S. | title = A spider diversity model for the Caucasus Ecoregion | doi = 10.1007/s10841-014-9649-1 | journal = Journal of Insect Conservation | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–416 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ants &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaladze | first1 = G. | title = Climate-based model of spatial pattern of the species richness of ants in Georgia | doi = 10.1007/s10841-012-9464-5 | journal = Journal of Insect Conservation | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 791–800 | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sanders2002&gt;Sanders, N.J.

(2008) Microbes on mountainsides: contrasting elevational patterns of bacterial and plant diversity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105, 11505–11511.&lt;/ref&gt; but also increasing, hump-shaped, and U-shaped elevational patterns in diversity.&lt;ref name="WangMeier2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Jianjun|last2=Meier|first2=Sandra|last3=Soininen|first3=Janne|last4=Casamayor|first4=Emilio O.|last5=Pan|first5=Feiyan|last6=Tang|first6=Xiangming|last7=Yang|first7=Xiangdong|last8=Zhang|first8=Yunlin|last9=Wu|first9=Qinglong|last10=Zhou|first10=Jizhong|last11=Shen|first11=Ji|title=Regional and global elevational patterns of microbial species richness and evenness|journal=Ecography|volume=40|issue=3|year=2016|pages=393-402|issn=09067590|doi=10.1111/ecog.02216|hdl=10261/131604}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One explanation for a mid elevational peak includes mid elevational [[condensation]] zones.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995 /&gt; Under the assumption that natural boundaries can limit species distributions in varying degrees (for example, a mountain can present absolute elevational limits), Collwell and Lees explained the mid domain effect with geometric theory.&lt;ref name=colwell2000&gt;Colwell, R.K. &amp; Lees, D.C. (2000) The mid-domain effect: geometric constraints on the geography of species richness. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 15, 70–76.
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a mountain, geometric boundary constraints will naturally result in the increasing overlap of species ranges nearing the midpoint of the mountain. Using [[vascular plant|vascular]] [[epiphyte]]s in [[Costa Rica]], Cardelus et al. (2008) noted that the elevational species richness pattern observed was substantially due to the mid domain effect; there was a bulge in epiphyte species richness at 1000m (The [[cloud forest]]).
&lt;!--
[[File:Tropical Ecology Epiphytes.jpg|thumb|Virola with epiphytes (left) and a Virola branch with large bromeliads, ''Werhauia kupperiana'', and fern, ''Phlebodium auretum'']]
--&gt;

This elevational pattern, however, was less consistent for species with small ranges, suggesting that environmental factors may be more clearly accounted for when constraints on domain boundary are loosened. In cases where geometric models fail to explain the location of the midpoint or the trend in species richness, other explanations need to be explored. An example of this can be seen with microbes, which have been shown to exhibit monotonically decreasing diversity when moving from low to high elevations.&lt;ref name=bryant2008 /&gt;

===Mountain-mass effect===
The mountain-mass effect (also known as the [[Massenerhebung effect]] or mass-elevation effect) was proposed in 1904 by [[A. de Quarvain]]. This phenomenon recognizes the correlation between mountain mass and the occurrence of physiognomically similar vegetation types; similarity in vegetation type is observed at higher elevations on large mountain masses.&lt;ref name=flenley1994&gt;Flenley, J. R. (1994) Tropical mon-tane cloud forests. Cloud forest, the Massenerhebung effect, and ultraviolet insolation  (eds L. S. Hamil-ton, J. O. Juvik &amp; E N. Scatena), pp. 150-155. Spring-er-Verlag, New York, New York, USA. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, under a climatically driven mountain–mass effect, there is a “positive linear trend observed in the elevation of highest diversity with mountain height”.&lt;ref name=mccain2005 /&gt; This trend is most evident on isolated mountain peaks.

==Hypotheses==

===Area Hypothesis===
Another hypothesis that is cited to explain the upper limit of the elevational diversity gradient is the area hypothesis, which states that larger areas are able to support more species. As elevation increases, total area decreases; thus, there are more species present at middle elevations than high elevations.

However, this hypothesis does not account for differences between [[lowland]] areas and middle elevations, as lowlands tend to have more area than middle elevations and thus would be expected by this hypothesis to have higher species diversity, an assertion that runs counter to the EDG. Additionally, the area hypothesis does not take climatic conditions or resource availability into account.

===Rainfall hypothesis===
This hypothesis states that diversity increases with increasing [[rainfall]],&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; however the correlation between rainfall and plant diversity varies from region to region.  The consistency of rainfall seems to correlate more with species richness than total annual rainfall. Species diversity appears to level off when annual rainfall reaches about 4,000mm, however this could be due to sampling limitations. Rainfall and soil richness affect productivity trends which are also believed to affect diversity.&lt;ref name=gentry1988&gt;Gentry, A.H. (1988) Changes in plant community diversity and floristic composition on environmental and geographical gradients. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 75.1, 1-34. 
&lt;/ref&gt; A mid elevation peak is usually seen in mean annual rainfall.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992&gt;Rosenzweig, M.L. (1992) Species diversity gradients: we know more and less than we thought. Journal of Mammalogy, 73.4, 715-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource diversity hypothesis===
The resource diversity hypothesis states an increase in diversity can be seen when an increase in the diversity of available resources such as soil and food is present.&lt;ref name=gentry1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanchez2001&gt;SÁnchez-Cordero, V. (2001) Elevation gradients of diversity for rodents and bats in Oaxaca, Mexico. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In this hypothesis diversity increases in an area of higher resource diversity even when resource abundance is constant. However resource diversity, especially pertaining to food, could be a result of other influences, such as rainfall and [[productivity]]; as such, it may be inappropriate to consider the resource diversity hypothesis as a mechanism acting independently of other factors influencing diversity gradients.&lt;ref name=heaney2001&gt;Heaney, L. R. (2001) Small mammal diversity along elevational gradients in the Philippines: an assessment of patterns and hypotheses. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 15–39.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity hypothesis===
The productivity hypothesis states that diversity increases with increased productivity.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; There is some contradiction to this as other research suggests that after a certain point increasing productivity actually correlates with a decrease in diversity.&lt;ref name=sanders2007&gt;Sanders, N.J., Lessard, J.P., Fitzpatrick, M.C. &amp; Dunn, R.R. (2007) Temperature, but not productivity or geometry, predicts elevational diversity gradients in ants across spatial grains. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 16, 640–649.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally thought that productivity decreases with an increase in elevation, however there is some research that shows a peak in productivity at mid elevation which may be related to a peak in rainfall within the same area.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt;

===Temperature hypothesis===
The temperature hypothesis correlates increasing temperature with an increase in species diversity, mainly because of temperature's effect on productivity.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995 /&gt; However increasing temperatures due to [[climate change]] have begun to be linked to the spread of [[chytrid]] among frogs in the Tropics. Another concern is that higher-elevation species will become extinct as their ranges become more and more restricted with an increase in temperature.&lt;ref name=pounds2006&gt;Pounds, J. A., Martín R. Bustamante, Luis A. Coloma, Jamie A. Consuegra, Michael P. L. Fogden, Pru N. Foster, Enrique La Marca, Karen L. Masters, Andrés Merino-Viteri, Robert Puschendorf, Santiago R. Ron, G. Arturo Sánchez-Azofeifa, Christopher J. Still, and Bruce E. Young. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Disease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.7073 (2006): 161-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis is an important factor in considering the [[effects of global warming]].

===Competition===
There are conflicting views on the effect of [[competition (biology)|competition]] on species diversity. Some hold the view that an increase in interspecies competition leads to local [[extinction]]s and a decrease in diversity.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; Others view competition as a means of species specialization and niche partitioning, resulting in increase diversity.&lt;ref name=menge1976&gt;Menge, B. A. &amp; Sutherland, J.P. (1976) Species diversity gradients: synthesis of the roles of predation, competition, and temporal heterogeneity. The American Naturalist, 351-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other studies the competition between plant species at high elevations has been shown to facilitate the movement of plant species into high stress environments. The competition between plant species leads to hardier species spreading into the high stress environment. These founder species then provide shelter and facilitate the movement of less hardy species into the area.&lt;ref name=bryant2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=choler2001&gt;Choler, P., Michalet R. &amp; Callaway, R.M. (2001) Facilitation and competition on gradients in alpine plant communities. Ecology, 82, 3295-3308.&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in the movement of plant species up a mountainside.

==State of research==
Current research illuminates a variety of mechanisms than can be used to explain elevational diversity gradients. No one factor can be used to explain the present of diversity gradients within and among taxa; in many cases, we must consider more than one hypothesis or mechanism to fully understand a pattern in elevational diversity. The emerging macroecological experiments along environmental gradients (for example, mountain elevation gradients) are an important tool in ecological research because they allow for the disentangling the effects of individual environmental drivers on biodiversity, the independent effects of which are not be easily separated due to their covariance in nature.&lt;ref name=Wang2016&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Jianjun | last2 = Pan | first2 = Feiyan | last3 = Soininen | first3 = Janne | last4 = Heino | first4 = Jani | last5 = Shen | first5 = Ji | title = Nutrient enrichment modifies temperature-biodiversity relationships in large-scale field experiments | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13960 | pmid = 28000677 | pmc = 5187590 | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13960 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, microcosm experimental setups in subtropical and subarctic regions (China and Norway, respectively) showed clear segregation of bacterial species along temperature gradients, and interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on biodiversity along mountain elevation gradients.&lt;ref name=Wang2016/&gt; A more expansive research program for mountain [[biogeography]] may be extremely beneficial for conservation biologists seeking to understand factors driving biodiversity in known hot spots.&lt;ref name=lomolino2001&gt;Lomolino, M. V. (2001) Elevation gradients of species-den-sity: historical and prospective views. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research and reviews are also needed to address contradictions in the scientific literature, and to identify the extent of interactions between current explanations and hypotheses.

The United States '''Energy Research and Development Administration''' ('''ERDA''') was a [[United States government]] organization formed from the split of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) in 1975. It assumed the functions of the AEC not assumed by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].

The agency was created as part of the [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]], which was passed on October 11, 1974 in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]].  The act split the Atomic Energy Commission into two new agencies: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would [[government regulation|regulate]] the commercial [[nuclear power]] industry, while the ERDA would manage the energy [[research and development]], [[nuclear weapon]]s, and [[naval reactors]] programs.

The Energy Research and Development Administration was activated on January 19, 1975.  The first Administrator was [[Robert Seamans]], followed by [[Robert Fri|Robert W. Fri]].

In 1977, ERDA was combined with the [[Federal Energy Administration]] to form the [[United States Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.gov/articles/farewell-erda-hello-energy-department&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fender Bassman''' is a [[Bass guitar|bass]] [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier]] introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] during 1952.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Initially intended to amplify [[bass guitar]]s, the '''5B6 Bassman''' was used by musicians for other instrument amplification, including the  [[electric guitar]], [[harmonica]], and [[pedal steel guitar]]s. Besides being a popular and important amplifier in its own right, the Bassman also became the foundation on which [[Marshall amplification|Marshall]] and other companies built their high-gain tube amplifiers.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==History==

===The 5B6 Bassman ===
During 1952, the Fender 5B6 Bassman amplifier was introduced as a combo amplifier cabinet that included the amplifier chassis combined with one 15" speaker. The 1952–1954&lt;ref name="wide-panel-tweed"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ampwares |url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-wide-panel-tweed-bassman/ |title=Fender Wide Panel Tweed Bassman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5B6 Bassman amplifiers had two 6SC7 or 6SL7GT pre-amp tubes, two 5881 power tubes and a single 5U4G rectifier tube. It was designed to generate 26 watts at an 8 ohm impedance load, and offered a cathode-based bias.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

From 1952 through the spring of 1954, Fender produced approximately 660 model 5B6 Bassman amplifiers (serial numbers #0001–0660).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The earlier cabinets have been called "TV Front" designs,&lt;ref name="wide-panel-tweed" /&gt; with a front panel that had a rectangular grill cloth with rounded corners and looked much like a television of that era. In 1953 the cabinet designs were changed to the so-called "Wide Panel" design, with a 5 inch wide tweed covered panel above and below a wider swath of grill cloth. Fender ceased production of 5B6 Bassman amplifiers during the spring of 1954.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===The 5D6 Bassman with dual rectifiers===
During November 1954, Fender introduced the newly designed 5D6 Bassman amplifier offering four ten inch speakers and was designed utilizing two rectifier tubes. The 5D6 was a major departure from the earlier 5B6 Fender Bassman model. Designed by [[Freddie Tavares]], longtime R&amp;D man at Fender,{{sfn|Wheeler|2007|p=164}} the new circuit included two rectifier tubes and became known as the Dual Rectifier Bassman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gbase.com/gear/fender-bassman-1956-tweed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audioasylum.com/cgi/t.mpl?f=tubediy&amp;m=203358&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the single 15" speaker, four 10" Jensen Alnico P10R speakers were used. The circuit had two innovations: a fixed bias for the power tubes, which increased power in comparison to the earlier cathode bias design, and a cathodyne phase inverter, using half of the [[12AX7]] tube and allowing a third gain stage on the other half.&lt;ref name="narrow-panel-tweed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ware|first=Mark|title=Fender Amp Field Guide|url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-narrow-panel-tweed-bassman/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 4x10 Bassman amplifiers started with a batch of prototypes in November and December 1954, model 5D6. No schematic for the 5D6 circuit has ever been found, but Ken Fox and Frank Roy have created a few from originals, and copies are freely available online. Only 11 of these early 5D6 Bassman examples are known to have survived. The lowest serial number known to still exist is 0013 (Frank Roy), 0035 (Albert Talley), 0075 (Jim Cornett), 0077 (Perry Tate), 0089 (Mark Grandfield), 0701, 0745 (Walter Horton), 0769 (Hayes Kolb), 0780 (sold on eBay Nov 2006), 0783, and 0785 (Hayes Kolb) are among those still known to exist.

===Narrow panel models, 1954 to 1960===
Fender began making other models with tweed covering, a similar open backed cabinet with a rectangular grill cloth and a narrow (just over an inch wide) tweed covered panel at the top and bottom. Produced from 1954 until 1960, these models are called the "narrow panel" tweed amps .&lt;ref name="narrow-panel-tweed"/&gt;

Fender introduced the model 5D6 "DK" in November 1954 followed by the 5E6 Bassman Amp during early 1955. The 5E6-A Bassman model was introduced later that year and included some evolutionary improvements.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Demand for the tweed Bassman amp grew, so Fender increased production.&lt;!-- {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} --&gt; By the middle of 1957 more than 1,500 examples of the 5E6 series had been sold.&lt;ref name="gagliano"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Greg|title=Dating Fender Amps by Serial Number, Part VI|journal=Vintage Guitar Magazine|date=April 2010|pages=38–39, 100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1957, Fender introduced the model 5F6 Bassman. This model also had four Jensen P10R speakers, but the power supply was redesigned around a single 83 mercury vapor rectifier tube, and a new preamp circuit was introduced that included a three knob [[tone stack]], with separate controls for Treble, Mid and Bass. The power amp included a "long tailed pair" phase inverter, an innovation that noticeably increased the "headroom" or clean power output capability of the amplifier.&lt;!-- {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} --&gt; Similar preamp changes were also incorporated in the 5F8 Twin Amp at about the same time, but not on other large size Fender amps.&lt;!-- {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} --&gt;

During 1958, Fender introduced the model 5F6-A Bassman model. This final 1950s Tweed Bassman model product line included a change from the 5Y3 to the GZ34 rectifier tube, as well as a modification within the Presence control circuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-narrow-panel-tweed-bassman/&lt;/ref&gt; During early 1960, Fender began producing the 5F6-A Bassman with Jensen P10Q speakers. The P10Q Jensen speakers are more able to manage stronger electrical input power and generate better "clean" output sounds than previous installed P10R Jensen speakers. The P10R Jensen speakers were shipped within all Fender Bassmen from late 1954 until early 1960. Many professional music industry analysts have heralded the 1950s Fender 4×10 Bassman amps as the greatest guitar amp ever.&lt;!-- {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} --&gt; The first 1954 Fender Tweed 5D6 4×10 circuit generated further Tweed Bassman amplifier development through 1960. Several Bassman models were progressively influenced by the 5D6 through the last Fender Tweed 5F6-A Bassman's circuit design. The 5F6-A Bassman's design was directly copied by Marshall Amplifiers within their JTM-45 amplifier during the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="kuehnel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuehnel|first=Richard|title=Circuit Analysis of a Legendary Tube Amplifier The Fender Bassman 5F6-A|year=2009|publisher=Pentode Press|isbn=0976982250|pages=12–15|url=http://www.ampbooks.com/home/books/bassman/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Fender began reissuing the 5F6-A Bassman. The first series of the reissue were made at the [[Corona, California]] facility, and came equipped with four Eminence-made 10" blue frame AlNiCo speakers, and a solid state rectifier unit. Later on, production was moved to [[Ensenada, Baja California]], and the model name was altered to "59 Bassman LTD". The LTD came equipped with the original 5AR4 rectifier tube, and four Jensen P10R reissue alnico speakers, which was period correct for the original amp.

===Piggyback model===
In late 1960, Fender introduced a completely redesigned model 6G6 Bassman Amp, using the "piggy-back" design, in which the amplifier chassis is housed in a small cabinet, attached by metal clips to a larger separate speaker enclosure.

The early models were called "Brownface" because of the dark brown color used on the control panel. The 6G6 model was covered in rough Blonde colored Tolex material with Oxblood colored grill cloth. It had a single GZ34 rectifier, two 5881/6L6GC power tubes and four 12AX7 preamp tubes. The output was 50 watts at 8 ohm into a single 12 inch speaker, with a "Tone Ring" baffle in the speaker cabinet. In early 1961, model 6G6-A was introduced with a solid state rectifier replacing the GZ34, and two 12 inch speakers with a conventional baffle in a slightly larger cabinet (wired in parallel) with a 4 ohm output. In 1962, model 6G6-B was introduced, which incorporated circuit changes but used the same speaker configuration. In 1963 smooth Blonde Tolex covering was used instead of the early rough texture cover, and a light tan grill cloth.  In late, 1963, Fender changed the cosmetics to what is commonly known as the "blackface" scheme.  This amp still had the presence knob and same circuit (designated 6G6-B) as the smooth Blonde Tolex Bassman, but the faceplace was now black, the Tolex was black, and the grillcloth had moved to a silver cloth with black thread.  The logo had also transitioned from the flat cast tin Fender with the brown paint in the tail, to a plastic logo with faux chrome and more 3-D shape.

In 1964 Fender introduced the AA864 circuit, and changed the appearance to the "Blackface" design, with black tolex covering and a black painted control panel. Fender was sold to CBS in 1965, and the AA165 circuit was briefly introduced, before being replaced by the AB165 circuit. The "Blackface" design continued until the "Silverface" model was introduced in 1968. Early "Drip-Edge" Silverface Bassmen used the same AB165 circuitry as the previous Blackface versions. The Brownface, Blackface, and Silverface "piggyback head" (except the Bassman 10 and 20, which were also combo amplifiers) versions of the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s generally followed a trend toward cleaner sound and more headroom.

'''Fermium''' is a [[synthetic element]] with symbol '''Fm''' and [[atomic number]] 100. It is an [[actinide]] and the heaviest element that can be formed by [[neutron]] bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared.&lt;ref name="Silva"/&gt; A total of 19 isotopes are known, with &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.

It was discovered in the debris of the [[Ivy Mike|first]] [[hydrogen bomb]] explosion in 1952, and named after [[Enrico Fermi]], one of the pioneers of [[nuclear physics]]. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 [[oxidation state]] but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.

==Discovery==
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|left|Fermium was first observed in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
[[File:Enrico Fermi 1943-49.jpg|thumb|left|The element was named after [[Enrico Fermi]].]]
[[File:Albert Ghiorso ca 1970.jpg|thumb|right|The element was discovered by a team headed by [[Albert Ghiorso]].]]
Fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the '[[Ivy Mike]]' nuclear test (1&amp;nbsp;November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.&lt;ref name="lanl"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/99.html|title=Einsteinium|accessdate=2007-12-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026052909/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/99.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/elements/el/fm.html Fermium – National Research Council Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225025414/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/elements/el/fm.html |date=2010-12-25 }}. Retrieved 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt; Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of [[plutonium]], [[plutonium-244|{{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}]]: this could only have formed by the absorption of six [[neutron]]s by a [[uranium-238]] nucleus followed by two [[Beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;decays]]. At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}} raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"&gt;{{cite journal|first = Albert|last = Ghiorso|authorlink = Albert Ghiorso|date = 2003 |title = Einsteinium and Fermium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/einsteiniumfermium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36|doi = 10.1021/cen-v081n036.p174|pages = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Element&amp;nbsp;99 ([[einsteinium]]) was quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through the cloud from the explosion (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}).&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt; It was then identified in December 1952 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] and co-workers at the [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="lanl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt; They discovered the isotope &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es ([[half-life]] 20.5 days) that was made by the [[neutron capture|capture]] of 15 [[neutron]]s by [[uranium-238]] nuclei – which then underwent seven successive [[beta decay]]s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[+ 15 \ce{n}][7 \beta^-] ^{253}_{99}Es&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U atoms, however, could capture another amount of neutrons (most likely, 16 or 17).

The discovery of fermium ({{math|1=''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 100}}) required more material, as the yield was expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of element&amp;nbsp;99, and so contaminated coral from the [[Enewetak atoll]] (where the test had taken place) was shipped to the [[University of California Radiation Laboratory]] in [[Berkeley, California]], for processing and analysis. About two months after the test, a new component was isolated emitting high-energy [[α-particle]]s (7.1&amp;nbsp;MeV) with a [[half-life]] of about a day. With such a short half-life, it could only arise from the β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;decay of an isotope of einsteinium, and so had to be an isotope of the new element&amp;nbsp;100: it was quickly identified as &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Fm ({{nowrap|1=''t''&amp;nbsp;= 20.07(7)&amp;nbsp;hours}}).&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt;

The discovery of the new elements, and the new data on neutron capture, was initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military until 1955 due to [[Cold War]] tensions.&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "PhysRev.99.1048" &gt;{{cite journal

Fermium is produced by the bombardment of lighter [[actinide]]s with [[neutron]]s in a nuclear reactor. Fermium-257 is the heaviest isotope that is obtained via neutron capture, and can only be produced in picogram quantities.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;All isotopes of elements Z &amp;gt; 100 can only be produced by accelerator-based nuclear reactions with charged particles and can be obtained only in tracer quantities (e.g., 1 million atoms for Md (Z = 101) per hour of irradiation (see reference 1 below)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Luig |first1=Heribert |last2=Keller |first2=Cornelius |last3=Wolf |first3=Walter |last4=Shani |first4=Jashovam |last5=Miska |first5=Horst |last6=Zyball |first6=Alfred |last7=Gervé |first7=Andreas |last8=Balaban |first8=Alexandru T. |last9=Kellerer |first9=Albrecht M. |last10=Griebel |first10=Jürgen |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a22_499 |chapter=Radionuclides |isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major source is the 85&amp;nbsp;MW [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR) at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]], USA, which is dedicated to the production of transcurium (''Z''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 96) elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = High Flux Isotope Reactor|url = http://neutrons.ornl.gov/facilities/HFIR/|publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate = 2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower mass fermium isotopes are available in greater quantities, however, these isotopes (254 and 255) are very short lived.

After production, the fermium must be separated from other actinides and from [[lanthanide]] fission products.

Although the most stable isotope of fermium is &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm, with a [[half-life]] of 100.5&amp;nbsp;days, most studies are conducted on &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Fm (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 20.07(7)&amp;nbsp;hours), since this isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 39.8(12)&amp;nbsp;days).&lt;ref name="Silva"/&gt;

==Synthesis in nuclear explosions==
The analysis of the debris at the 10-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test was a part of long-term project, one of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within a microsecond, i.e. about 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5{{e|15}} neutrons/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at [[Enewetak Atoll]] for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.&lt;ref name=s39&gt;Seaborg, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ActinideExplosionSynthesis.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Estimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.&lt;ref name=s40/&gt;]]
The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge. They were less successful in terms of yield that was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Isolation of the products was found to be rather problematic, as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of 300–600 meters, and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.&lt;ref name=s39/&gt;&lt;ref name=s40&gt;Seaborg, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the nine underground tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], 1962), Kennebec (&lt;5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38 kilotons, 1964), Barbel (&lt;20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (&lt;20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615000000/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }}, DOE/NV--209-REV 15, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the last one was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates.&lt;ref name=s40/&gt; The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4{{e|-14}} of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&amp;nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.&lt;ref name=s43&gt;Seaborg, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.&lt;ref name=s44&gt;Seaborg, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories. So 6{{e|9}} atoms of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. They were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm and in discovery of a new fermium isotope &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Fm. Also, the rare &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities, which is very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm – the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very "long" on the explosion timescale.&lt;ref name=s47&gt;Seaborg, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of fermium, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], and is present only within a few months from the time of the synthesis. The [[transuranic element]]s from [[americium]] to fermium did occur naturally in the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] at [[Oklo]], but no longer do so.&lt;ref name="emsley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Although few people come in contact with fermium, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] has set annual exposure limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[becquerel]]s (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Bq; for fermium-257, at 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Bq and 4000 Bq respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Lothar|title=Transuranium Elements, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a27_167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Finsterwalde Solar Park''' was, in November 2010, the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world’s largest]] [[Photovoltaic power station|photovoltaic plant]] with 80.7 [[Watt-peak|MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php Large-scale photovoltaic power plants ranking 1 - 50]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is located in [[Finsterwalde]], [[Germany]] and  is equipped with [[Q-Cells]] modules and LDK solar [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exenewable.com/projectProfile.asp?id=14657 eXenewable Project Profile Page - Finsterwalde, PV, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of the project was commissioned in 2009, the second and third in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-energy.de/download/2010_06_18_realisierung_solarpark_finsterwalde_2_und_3_eng.pdf Implementation of the 39 MWp – „Solar Park Finsterwalde II and Finsterwalde III“]&lt;/ref&gt;  All phases were developed by Unlimited Energy GmbH. Phase I was sold to LQ Energy GmbH, a joint venture of Q-Cells International and LDK Solar. In 2011, Finsterwalde I was sold to LHI Leasing, a joint venture of [[Landesbank Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Nord/LB]].&lt;ref name=finance210311&gt;

'''Galeru Nagari Sujala Sravanthi Project''' or '''GNSS project''' is an irrigation project in [[Kadapa district|Kadapa]] and [[Chitoor District|Chitoor districts]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/20/stories/2009042053550700.htm|title=YSR warns people against voting back TDP to power|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is envisaged to irrigate {{convert|265,000|acre|km2}} in two phases besides providing drinking water facilities to villages and towns en route the canal alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Gnss_(Galeru_Nagari_Sujala_Sravanthi)_JI00006 |title=Galeru Nagari Sujala Sravanthi, JI00006 |accessdate=17 August 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main canal, Gandikota, Vamikonda and Sarvarajasagar reservoirs are under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/01/27/stories/2009012755710300.htm|title=Patriotic fervour marks Republic Day|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/20/stories/2007042009130500.htm|title=CPI wants Galeru Nagari works expedited|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme envisages drawl of 40 TMC surplus flood waters of river Krishna from the foreshore of [[Srisailam Dam|Srisailam Reservoir]] through Srisailam Right Bank Canal (SRBC) system up to Gorakallu Reservoir and thereafter through an independent flood flow canal to feed nine storage reservoirs en route and utilize the stored water for irrigation during the Rabi season.

The project construction started in 2005, but the work is still in progress. This project doesn't have any assured water allocation and the [[Rayalaseema]] region people are strongly demanding the government to allocate assured water to the project.

A '''gas thermometer''' measures [[temperature]] by the variation in volume or pressure of a gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gas_thermometer|title=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Volume Thermometer==
This thermometer functions by [[Charles's Law]]. [[Charles's Law]] states that when the temperature of a gas increases, so does the volume. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| publisher = Heinemann
| isbn = 0-435-57078-1
| pages = 141–42
| last = Fullick
| first = P.
| title = Physics
| location = 
| year = 1994
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Charles's Law]], the temperature can be measured by knowing  the volume of gas at a certain temperature by using the formula, written below. Translating it to the correct levels of the device that is holding the gas. This works on the same principle as mercury thermometers. 

:&lt;math&gt;V \propto T\,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{T}=k&lt;/math&gt;

T is the temperature.

V is the volume.

k is the constant for the system. k is not a fixed constant across all systems and therefore needs to be found experimentally for a given system through testing with known temperature values. 


==Pressure Thermometer and Absolute Zero==
[[File:Gas thermometer and absolute zero.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Plots of pressure vs temperature for three different gas samples extrapolate to absolute zero.]]
The constant volume gas thermometer plays a crucial role in understanding how [[absolute zero]] could be discovered long before the advent of [[cryogenics]].  Consider a graph of pressure versus temperature made not far from standard conditions (well above absolute zero) for three different samples of any ideal gas ''(a, b, c)''. To the extent that the gas is ideal, the pressure depends linearly on temperature, and the extrapolation to zero pressure occurs at absolute zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tipler|first=Paul|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers|year=2008|publisher=Freeman|isbn=9781429201322|edition=6th|author2=Mosca, G.|chapter=17.2: Gas thermometers and the absolute temperature scale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that data could have been collected with three different amounts of the same gas, which would have rendered this experiment easy to do in the eighteenth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3507">'''HSPF''' ('''Heating Seasonal Performance Factor''') is a term used in the heating and cooling industry. HSPF is specifically used to measure the efficiency of [[air source heat pump]]s.

The efficiency of [[Air conditioning|air conditioners]] is often rated by the HSPF as defined by the [[Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute|Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute]] in its standard ''210/240 Performance Rating of Unitary Air-Conditioning and Air-Source Heat Pump Equipment''.&lt;ref name="ahri210/240"&gt;{{cite web|title=ANSI/AHRI 210/240-2008: 2008 Standard for Performance Rating of Unitary Air-Conditioning &amp; Air-Source Heat Pump Equipment|url=http://www.ahrinet.org/App_Content/ahri/files/standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20standards%20pdfs/ANSI.AHRI%20Standard%20210.240%20with%20Addenda%201%20and%202.pdf|publisher=[[Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute]]|year=2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher the HSPF rating of a unit, the more energy efficient it is. HSPF is a ratio of [[British thermal unit|BTU]] heat output over the heating season to [[watt-hour]]s of electricity used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Springfield, Illinois City, Water, Light &amp; Power - Appliance Efficiency Ratings|url=http://www.cwlp.com/energy_services/efficiency_ratings/appliance_efficiency_ratings.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181247/http://www.cwlp.com/energy_services/efficiency_ratings/appliance_efficiency_ratings.htm|archivedate=2011-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has units of BTU/watt-hr.

Depending on the system, an HSPF ≥ 8 can be considered high efficiency and worthy of a US [[Energy Tax]] Credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Federal Tax Credits for Energy Efficiency|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_tax_credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSPF is related to the non-dimensional [[Coefficient of Performance]] (COP) for a heat pump, which measures the ratio of heat energy delivered to electrical energy supplied, independently of the units used to measure energy. The HSPF can be converted to a seasonally-averaged COP by converting both the BTU heat output and the electrical input to a common energy unit (e.g. [[joule]]s). Since 1 BTU = 1055.056 J, and 1 watt-hour = 3600 J, the seasonally-averaged COP is given by:

Avg COP = Heat transferred / electrical energy supplied = (HSPF * 1055.056 J/BTU) / (3600 J/watt-hour) = 0.29307111 HSPF.

Thus, a system which delivers an HSPF of 7.7 will transfer 2.25 times as much heat as electricity consumed over a season. In Europe the term Seasonal Performance Factor ("SPF") is used to mean the same as the average COP over the heating season. Thus a system which transfers 2.25 times as much heat as the electricity consumed is said to have an SPF of 2.25. A well designed ground source heat pump installation should achieve an SPF of 3.5, or over 5 if linked to a solar-assisted thermal bank.&lt;ref&gt;Thermalbanks and Thermal Energy Storage, http://www.icax.co.uk/Seasonal_Performance_Factor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: For a heat pump delivering 120,000,000 BTU during the season, when consuming 15,000 kWh, the HSPF can be calculated as :

: HSPF = 120000000 (BTU) / (1000) / 15000 (kWh)) =
: HSPF = 8

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12529">[[File:Sstanom 199711 krig.jpg|thumb|right|Water temperatures around the Mentawai Islands dropped about 4° Celsius during the height of a positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole in November 1997. During these events unusually strong winds from the east push warm surface water towards Africa, allowing cold water to upwell along the Sumatran coast. In this image blue areas are colder than normal, while red areas are warmer than normal.]]
The '''Indian Ocean Dipole''' ('''IOD'''), also known as the Indian Niño, is an irregular oscillation of sea-surface temperatures in which the western [[Indian Ocean]] becomes alternately warmer and then colder than the eastern part of the ocean.

Monsoon in India is generally affected by the temperature between bay of Bengal in the east and The Arabian sea in the west.

==Phenomenon==
The IOD involves an aperiodic oscillation of sea-surface temperatures (SST), between "positive", "neutral" and "negative" phases. A positive phase sees greater-than-average sea-surface temperatures and greater precipitation in the western Indian Ocean region&lt;!--  is it really like that? Look at discussion --&gt;, with a corresponding cooling of waters in the eastern Indian Ocean—which tends to cause droughts in adjacent land areas of [[Indonesia]] and [[Australia]]. The negative phase of the IOD brings about the opposite conditions, with warmer water and greater precipitation in the eastern Indian Ocean, and cooler and drier conditions in the west.

The IOD also affects the strength of monsoons over the Indian subcontinent. A significant positive IOD occurred in 1997–98, with another in 2006. The IOD is one aspect of the general cycle of global climate, interacting with similar phenomena like the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The IOD phenomenon was first identified by climate researchers in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saji|Goswami|Vinayachandran|Yamagata|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Webster, P.J.; Moore, A.M:Loschnigg, J.P., Leben, R.P.|title=Coupled ocean–atmosphere dynamics in the Indian Ocean during 1997–98 |journal=Letters to Nature | doi=10.1038/43848 |volume=401 |pages=356–360|bibcode=1999Natur.401..356W}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An average of four each positive-negative IOD events occur during each 30-year period with each event lasting around six months. However, there have been 12 positive IODs since 1980 and no negative events from 1992 until a strong negative event in late 2010. The occurrence of consecutive positive IOD events is extremely rare with only two such events recorded, 1913–1914 and the three consecutive events from 2006 to 2008 which preceded the [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Modelling suggests that consecutive positive events could be expected to occur twice over a 1,000-year period. The positive IOD in 2007 evolved together with [[La Niña]], which is a very rare phenomenon that has happened only once in the available historical records (in 1967).&lt;ref name="Argo"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cai W, Pan A, Roemmich D, Cowan T, Guo X |title=Argo profiles a rare occurrence of three consecutive positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, 2006–2008 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=36 |pages=L037038 |year=2009  |doi=10.1029/2008GL037038 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008GL037038.shtml |bibcode = 2009GeoRL..36.8701C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cooper | first = Dani | date = March 25, 2009 | title = Bushfire origins lie in Indian Ocean | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2009/03/25/2525580.htm | accessdate = December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite web | last = Perry | first = Michael | date = February 5, 2009 | title = Indian Ocean linked to Australian droughts | work = [[Reuters]]| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5133FL20090205 | accessdate = December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosebro"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rosebro | first = Jack | date = February 12, 2009 | title = Australi Reels  From Split Weather System | work = Green Car Congress | url = http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/australia-reels/comments/page/2/ | accessdate = December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong negative IOD developed in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seasonal Prediction: ENSO forecast, Indian Ocean forecast, Regional forecast |work=Low-latitude Climate Prediction Research |publisher=JAMSTEC |url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/frcgc/research/d1/iod/sintex_f1_announcements_s.html.en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, coupled with a strong and concurrent La Niña, caused the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods]] and the [[2011 Victorian floods]].

In 2008, [[Nerilie Abram]] used coral records from the eastern and western Indian Ocean to construct a coral Dipole Mode Index extending back to 1846&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coral Dipole Mode Index, World Data Center for Paleoclimatology|url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/coral/indian_ocean/mentawai2008.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extended perspective on IOD behaviour suggested that positive IOD events increased in strength and frequency during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abram|first1=Nerilie J.|last2=Gagan|first2=Michael K.|last3=Cole|first3=Julia E.|last4=Hantoro|first4=Wahyoe S.|last5=Mudelsee|first5=Manfred|title=Recent intensification of tropical climate variability in the Indian Ocean|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=16 November 2008|volume=1|issue=12|pages=849–853|doi=10.1038/ngeo357|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..849A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on Australian droughts==
A 2009 study by Ummenhofer ''et al.'' at the [[University of New South Wales]] (UNSW) [[Climate Change Research Centre]] has demonstrated a significant correlation between the IOD and drought in the southern half of Australia, in particular the south-east. Every major southern drought since 1889 has coincided with positive-neutral IOD fluctuations including the [[Federation Drought|1895–1902]], 1937–1945 and the [[2000s Australian drought|1995–2009]] droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ummenhofer |first=Caroline C. |date=February 2009 |title=What causes southeast Australia's worst droughts? |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=36 |pages=L04706 |doi=10.1029/2008GL036801 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008GL036801.shtml |bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.4706U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research shows that when the IOD is in its negative phase, with cool Indian Ocean water west of Australia and warm [[Timor Sea]] water to the north, winds are generated that pick up moisture from the ocean and then sweep down towards southern Australia to deliver higher rainfall. In the IOD-positive phase, the pattern of ocean temperatures is reversed, weakening the winds and reducing the amount of moisture picked up and transported across Australia.  The consequence is that rainfall in the south-east is well below average during periods of a positive IOD.

The study also shows that the IOD has a much more significant effect on the rainfall patterns in south-east Australia than the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean as already shown in several recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Behera, Swadhin K. |author2=Yamagata, Toshio |title=Influence of the Indian Ocean Dipole on the Southern Oscillation |journal=Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=169–177 |year=2003 |doi=10.2151/jmsj.81.169 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/81/1/81_1_169/_article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Annamalai, H. |author2=Xie, S.-P. |author3=McCreary, J.-P. |author4=Murtugudde, R. |title=Impact of Indian Ocean sea surface temperature on developing El Niño |journal=Journal of Climatology |volume=18 |pages=302–319 |year=2005 |doi=10.1175/JCLI-3268.1 |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-3268.1|bibcode = 2005JCli...18..302A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Izumo, T. |author2=Vialard, J. |author3=Lengaigne, M. |author4=de Boyer Montegut, C. |author5=Behera, S.K. |author6=Luo, J.-J. |author7=Cravatte, S. |author8=Masson, S. |author9=Yamagata, T. |title=Influence of the state of the Indian Ocean Dipole on the following year’s El Niño |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=3 |pages=168–172 |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/NGEO760 |bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..168I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indium(III) selenide''' is a compound of [[indium]] and [[selenium]]. It has potential for use in photovoltaic devices and it has been the subject of extensive research. The two most common phases, α and β, have a layered structure, while γ is a "defect [[Wurtzite (crystal structure)|wurtzite structure]]." In all, there are five known forms (α, β, γ, δ, κ).&lt;ref&gt;''Crystal structure of κ-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.''

[[File:Unstable3.svg|thumb|A ball on the top of a hill is an unstable situation.]]
In numerous fields of study, the component of '''instability''' within a [[system]] is generally characterized by some of the outputs or internal [[state (controls)|states]] growing without [[bound state|bounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instability|title=Definition of INSTABILITY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all systems that are not [[Stability theory|stable]] are unstable; systems can also be [[marginal stability|marginally stable]] or exhibit [[limit cycle]] behavior.

In [[structural engineering]], a structure can become unstable when excessive load is applied. Beyond a certain threshold, structural [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]s magnify [[stress (physics)|stresses]], which in turn increases deflections. This can take the form of [[buckling]] or crippling. The general field of study is called [[structural stability]].

[[Atmospheric instability]] is a major component of all [[weather system]]s on Earth.

==Instability in control systems==
{{See also|Stabilizability}}

In the theory of [[dynamical systems]], a [[state variable]] in a system is said to be unstable if it evolves without bounds. A system itself is said to be unstable if at least one of its state variables is unstable.

In [[continuous time]] [[control theory]], a system is unstable if any of the [[Root of a function|roots]] of its [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] has [[real part]] greater than zero (or if zero is a repeated root).  This is equivalent to any of the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[State space (controls)|state matrix]] having either real part greater than zero, or, for the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, the algebraic multiplicity being larger than the geometric multiplicity.{{clarification needed|reason=what is the difference between these two types of multiplicity?|date=September 2015}} The equivalent condition in [[discrete time]] is that at least one of the eigenvalues is greater than 1 in absolute value, or that two or more eigenvalues are equal and of unit absolute value.

==Plasma instabilities==
{{Main|Plasma stability#Plasma instabilities}}
[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] instabilities can be divided into two general groups (1) hydrodynamic instabilities (2) kinetic instabilities. Plasma instabilities are also categorised into different modes&amp;nbsp;– see [[Plasma stability#Plasma instabilities|this paragraph in plasma stability]].

==Instabilities of stellar systems==

[[Galaxies]] and [[star cluster]]s can be unstable, if small perturbations in the [[gravitational potential]] cause changes in the density that reinforce the original perturbation.  Such instabilities usually require that the motions of stars be highly correlated, so that the perturbation is not "smeared out" by random motions. After the instability has run its course, the system is typically "hotter" (the motions are more random) or rounder than before. Instabilities in stellar systems include:

* [[Bar instability]] of rapidly rotating disks
* [[Jeans instability]]
* [[Firehose instability]]&lt;ref name="MS94"&gt;{{citation

==Joint instabilities==
The most common residual disability after any sprain in the body is instability.  Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed the physiological limits.  Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the injured joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guskiewicz |first=K. M. |first2=David H. |last2=Perrin |title=Effect of Orthotics on Postural Sway Following Inversion Ankle Sprain |journal=Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=326–331  |date=1996 |doi=10.2519/jospt.1996.23.5.326 |pmid=8728531 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Injuries cause [[proprioceptive]] deficits and impaired postural control in the joint.  Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to injury than those with better postural control.  Instability leads to an increase in postural sway, the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal [[Center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)|center of pressure]].  The measurement of a subject’s postural sway can be calculated through testing center of pressure (CoP), which is defined as the vertical projection of center of mass on the ground.  Investigators have theorized that if injuries to joints cause [[deafferentation]], the interruption of sensory nerve fibers, and functional instability, then a subject’s postural sway should be altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Pintsaar |last2=Brynhildsen |first2=J. |first3=H. |last3=Tropp |title=Postural Corrections after Standardised Perturbations of Single Limb Stance: Effect of Training and Orthotic Devices in Patients with Ankle Instability |journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=151–155 |date=1996 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.30.2.151 |pmid=8799602 |pmc=1332381 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Joint stability can be enhanced by the use of an external support system, like a brace, to alter body mechanics.  The mechanical support provided by a brace provides cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control and increasing stability.

[[Image:San Domenico56.jpg|thumb|Geometric figure (1537), intarsia by fra [[Damiano da Bergamo]]; Museum of the Basilica of Saint Dominic, Bologna, Italy]]

'''Intarsia''' is a form of wood [[inlay]]ing that is similar to [[marquetry]]. The start of the practice dates before the seventh century.

== History ==

The technique of intarsia inlays sections of wood (at times with contrasting ivory or bone, or mother-of-pearl) within the solid stone matrix of floors and walls or of table tops and other furniture; by contrast marquetry assembles a pattern out of [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s glued upon the carcass. It is thought that the word 'intarsia' is derived from the Latin word 'interserere' which means "to insert".

When Egypt came under Arab rule in the seventh century, indigenous arts of intarsia and wood inlay, which lent themselves to non-representational decors and [[Tessellation|tiling]] patterns, spread throughout the [[maghreb]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Dimand, "An Egypto-Arabic Panel with Mosaic Decoration" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', '''33'''.3 (March 1938:78-79)&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of intarsia was already perfected in Islamic North Africa before it was introduced into Christian Europe through [[Sicily]] and [[Andalusia]]. The art was further developed in [[Siena]] and by Sienese masters at the [[cathedral of Orvieto]], where figurative intarsia made their first appearance, c. 1330 and continuing into the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Wilmering, "Domenico di Niccolò, Mattia di Nanni and the Development of Sienese Intarsia Techniques Domenico di Niccolò, Mattia di Nanni and the Development of Sienese Intarsia Techniques", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''139''' No. 1131 (June 1997:376-97).&lt;/ref&gt; and in northern Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, spreading to German centers and introduced into [[London]] by Flemish craftsmen in the later sixteenth century. The most elaborate examples of intarsia can be found in cabinets of this period, which were items of great luxury and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Ángeles Jordano, "The Plus Oultra Writing Cabinet of Charles V: Expression of the Sacred Imperialism of the Austrias", ''Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies'' '''9''' (2011:14-26), {{doi|10.5334/jcms.91105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After about 1620, marquetry tended to supplant intarsia in urbane cabinet work.

In the 1980s, intarsia began to gain popularity in the United States as a technique for creating wooden art using a band saw or scroll saw. 
Early practitioners made money both by selling their art, and also selling patterns used to create intarsia. In France [[:fr:Georges_Vriz|Georges Vriz]] proposed a new method which revolutionise the marquetry. Contrary to all the other techniques, based on the generally accepted idea of a decoration "flat" made of wood or other matters, George VRIZ brings an important innovation: Thanks to '''the superposition of the layers of wood''', and with the possibility offered by '''plating to create "transparencies"''', these means make it possible to bring thus sometimes the light, the color, a veil, a depth. These made impossible to create with a traditional method are made using '''judicious but controlled sandpaperings'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52602867|title=Vriz : la marqueterie, un art revisité|last=Bruno.|first=Bontempelli,|date=2002|publisher=Atlantica|others=Vriz, Georges.|isbn=9782843945557|location=Anglet|oclc=52602867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43366042|title=Masterpieces of marquetry|last=Pierre.|first=Ramond,|date=2000|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9780892365951|location=Los Angeles|oclc=43366042}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Process ==

Intarsia is a woodworking technique that uses varied shapes, sizes, and species of wood fitted together to create a mosaic-like picture with an illusion of depth. Intarsia is created through the selection of different types of wood, using their natural grain pattern and color (but can involve the use of stains and dyes but is (not really considered intarsia)) to create variations in the pattern. After selecting the specific woods to be used within the pattern, each piece is then individually cut, shaped, and finished.  Sometimes areas of the pattern are raised to create more depth. Once the individual pieces are complete, they are fitted together like a jig-saw puzzle and glued to a wooden backer-board, cut to the outline of the pattern, often with the intention of creating a three-dimensional effect as seen in the [[studiolo]] of the [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino]].

[[Marble]] intarsia (''opere di commessi''), called ''[[pietre dura]]'' in English for the semi-precious [[Hardstone carving|hardstones]] combined with colored marbles that are employed, is an intarsia of coloured stones inlaid in white or black marble. Early examples in [[Florence]] date from the mid fifteenth century and reached a peak of refinement and complexity in revetments of the [[Medici Chapel]], produced under [[Medici]] patronage in the ''Opificio delle Pietre Dure'', which was established by [[Ferdinando I de’ Medici]]. Later complex designs and refinement of the art developed in Naples circa the beginning of the 17th century.  The floor of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is a particularly notable example of marble intarsia.  Later this form of decoration became a feature of [[baroque]] interior design, particularly so in the [[Sicilian Baroque]] designs following the [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquake of 1693]].

Today intarsia can be made from purchased patterns. To make intarsia from a pattern, first wood is chosen based on color and grain pattern. Next the pattern is transferred onto the wood and individual pieces are precisely cut out on the band saw or scroll saw. The pieces are then sanded individually or in groups to add depth to the piece. Once the sanding is completed, the wood pieces are fitted together to form the final result. A finish (for example a clear gel stain) can be applied to the individual pieces before gluing, or to the glued final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodcarvers.org/intarsia.htm|accessdate=23 April 2015|title=Intarsia, How to Do it}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Intarsia is also used to refer to a similar technique used with small, highly polished stones set in a marble matrix also called [[pietre dure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7197">'''Interactive evolutionary computation''' (IEC) or '''aesthetic selection''' is a general term for methods of [[evolutionary computation]] that use human evaluation. Usually human evaluation is necessary when the form of [[fitness function]] is not known (for example, visual appeal or attractiveness; as in Dawkins, 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawkins, R.|title=[[The Blind Watchmaker]]|publisher=Longman|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or the result of optimization should fit a particular user preference (for example, taste of coffee or color set of the user interface).

==IEC design issues==

The number of evaluations that IEC can receive from one human user is limited by user fatigue which was reported by many researchers as a major problem. In addition, human evaluations are slow and expensive as compared to fitness function computation. Hence, one-user IEC methods should be designed to converge using a small number of evaluations, which necessarily implies very small populations. Several methods were proposed by researchers to speed up convergence, like interactive constrain evolutionary search (user intervention) or fitting user preferences using a [[convex function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Takagi, H.|year=2001|title=Interactive Evolutionary Computation: Fusion of the Capacities of EC Optimization and Human Evaluation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=89|issue=9|pages=1275–1296|url=http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~takagi/TAKAGI/IECpaper/ProcIEEE_3.pdf|doi=10.1109/5.949485}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEC [[human-computer interface]]s should be carefully designed in order to reduce user fatigue. There is also evidence that the addition of computational agents can successfully counteract user fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kruse, J.  |author2=Connor, A.M.|year=2015|title=Multi-agent evolutionary systems for the generation of complex virtual worlds|journal=EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies |volume=15|issue=5|url=http://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.20-10-2015.150099|doi=10.4108/eai.20-10-2015.150099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However IEC implementations that can concurrently accept evaluations from many users overcome the limitations described above. An example of this approach is an interactive media installation by [[Karl Sims]] that allows one to accept preferences from many visitors by using floor sensors to evolve attractive 3D animated forms. Some of these multi-user IEC implementations serve as collaboration tools, for example [[HBGA]].

===IGA===

An interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) is defined as a [[genetic algorithm]] that uses human evaluation. These algorithms belong to a more general category of Interactive evolutionary computation. The main application of these techniques include domains where it is hard or impossible to design a computational fitness function, for example, evolving images, music, various artistic designs and forms to fit a user's aesthetic preferences. Interactive computation methods can use different representations, both linear (as in traditional [[genetic algorithms]]) and tree-like ones (as in [[genetic programming]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1104">The '''Japan Customs-cleared Crude''' (JCC) is the average price of [[customs]]-cleared [[crude oil]] imports into [[Japan]] (formerly the average of the top twenty crude oils by volume) as reported in customs statistics; nicknamed the "'''Japanese Crude Cocktail'''". 

It is a commonly used index in long term [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] contracts in Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], and replaced the [[Government Selling Price]] of crude oil as the standard index.  

The data to calculate JCC is published by the Japanese government every month.  This is the raw and crude oil import prices in yen per kilolitre, the dollar yen exchange rate and the total Japanese imports of all commodities for the month. 

JCC prices are available from the [[Petroleum Association of Japan]].

'''Jojoba''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-US-Jojoba.ogg|h|ə|ˈ|h|oʊ|b|ə}}, with the [[botanical name]] '''''Simmondsia chinensis''''', and also known as '''goat nut,''' '''deer nut,''' '''pignut,''' '''wild hazel,''' '''quinine nut,''' '''coffeeberry,''' and '''gray box bush''',&lt;ref name="desertmuseum"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = Steven J. | editor1-last = Phillips | editor2-first = Patricia Wentworth | editor2-last = Comus | title = A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000 | pages = 256–257 | isbn = 0-520-21980-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is native to Southwestern North America. ''Simmondsia chinensis'' is the sole species of the family [[Simmondsiaceae]], placed in the order [[Caryophyllales]].

Jojoba is grown commercially to produce [[jojoba oil]], a liquid [[wax|wax ester]] extracted from its seed.

==Distribution==
The plant is a native [[shrub]] of the [[Sonoran Desert]],&lt;ref name="Gentry 1958 261–295"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentry|first=Howard Scott|authorlink = Howard Scott Gentry|title=The natural history of Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) and its cultural aspects|journal=Economic Botany|date=July 1958|volume=12|issue=3|pages=261–295|doi=10.1007/BF02859772}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colorado Desert]], [[Baja California Desert]], and [[California chaparral and woodlands]] habitats in the [[Peninsular Ranges]] and [[San Jacinto Mountains]]. It is found in southern [[California]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]] (U.S.), and [[Baja California]] state (Mexico).

Jojoba is [[endemic]] to North America, and occupies an area of approximately {{convert|260000|km2|sp=us}} between latitudes 25° and 31° North and between longitudes 109° and 117° West.&lt;ref name="Gentry 1958 261–295"/&gt;

==Description==
''Simmondsia chinensis'', or jojoba, typically grows to {{convert|1|–|2|m|ft||sp=us}} tall, with a broad, dense crown, but there have been reports of plants as tall as {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Gentry 1958 261–295" /&gt;

The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, oval in shape, {{convert|2|–|4|cm|in|sp=us}} long and {{convert|1.5|–|3|cm|in|sp=us}} broad, thick, waxy, and glaucous gray-green in color.

The [[flower]]s are small and greenish-yellow, with 5–6 sepals and no petals. The plant typically blooms from March to May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=44601 |title=Simmondsia chinensis |website=Jepson eFlora (TJM2) |publisher=The Jepson Herbarium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Each plant is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with [[hermaphrodites]] being extremely rare. The [[fruit]] is an acorn-shaped ovoid, three-angled [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] {{convert|1|–|2|cm|in|sp=us}} long, partly enclosed at the base by the sepals. The mature seed is a hard oval that is dark brown and contains an oil (liquid wax) content of approximately 54%. An average-sized bush produces {{convert|1|kg|lb|sp=us}} of [[pollen]], to which few humans are allergic.&lt;ref name="desertmuseum"/&gt;

The female plants produce seed from flowers pollinated by the male plants. Jojoba leaves have an aerodynamic shape, creating a spiral effect, which brings wind-born pollen from the male flower to the female flower. In the Northern Hemisphere, pollination occurs during February and March. In the Southern Hemisphere, pollination occurs during August and September.

Somatic cells of jojoba are [[tetraploid]]; the number of chromosomes is 2''n'' = 4''x'' = 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tobe|first=Hiroshi|last2=Yasuda|first2=Sachiko |last3=Oginuma|first3=Kazuo |title=Seed coat anatomy, karyomorphology, and relationships of ''Simmondsia'' (Simmondsiaceae)|journal=The Botanical Magazine Tokyo|date=December 1992|volume=105|issue=4|pages=529–538|doi=10.1007/BF02489427}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomy===
Despite its scientific name ''Simmondsia chinensis'', the plant is not native to [[China]]. The botanist [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|Johann Link]] originally named the species ''Buxus chinensis'', after misreading a collection label "Calif", referring to California, as "China."  Jojoba was collected again in 1836 by [[Thomas Nuttall]] who described it as a new genus and species in 1844, naming it ''Simmondsia californica'', but priority rules require that the original specific epithet be used.

The common name "jojoba" originated from [[O'odham]] name ''Hohowi''.&lt;ref name="desertmuseum"/&gt; The common name should not be confused with the similarly written [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus zizyphus''), an unrelated plant species, which is commonly grown in China.

==Uses==
[[Image:JojobaOil.png|thumb|[[Jojoba oil]] in a clear glass vial]]
Jojoba foliage provides year-round food for many animals, including [[deer]], [[Collared Peccary|javelina]], [[bighorn sheep]], and livestock. Its nuts are eaten by squirrels, rabbits, other rodents, and larger birds.

Only [[Bailey's pocket mouse]], however, is known to be able to digest the wax found inside the jojoba nut. In large quantities, jojoba seed meal is toxic to many mammals, later this effect was found to be due to [[simmondsin]], which inhibits hunger.  The indigestible wax acts as a [[laxative]] in humans.

===Native American uses===
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] first made use of jojoba. During the early 18th century  [[Jesuit]] missionaries on the [[Baja California Peninsula]] observed indigenous peoples heating jojoba seeds to soften them. They then used a [[mortar and pestle]] to create a salve or buttery substance. The latter was applied to the skin and hair to heal and condition. The [[O'odham]] people of the [[Sonoran Desert]] treated burns with an [[antioxidant]] salve made from a paste of the jojoba nut.&lt;ref name="desertmuseum"/&gt;

Native Americans also used the salve to soften and preserve [[leather|animal hides]]. Pregnant women ate jojoba seeds, believing they assisted during childbirth. Hunters and raiders ate jojoba on the trail to keep hunger at bay.

The [[Seri people|Seri]], who utilize nearly every edible plant in their domain, do not regard the beans as real food and in the past ate it only in emergencies.&lt;ref name="desertmuseum"/&gt;

===Contemporary uses===
Jojoba is grown for the liquid wax, commonly called [[jojoba oil]], in its seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ienica.net/crops/Jojoba.pdf |title=Jojoba |publisher=IENICA |access-date=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oil is rare in that it is an extremely long (C36–C46) straight-chain [[wax ester]] and not a [[triglyceride]], making jojoba and its derivative [[jojoba ester]]s more similar to [[whale oil]] than to traditional vegetable oils. It has been discussed as a possible [[biodiesel]] fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Elsa | last1 = Franke | first2 = Reinhard | last2 = Lieberei | first3 = Christoph | last3 = Reisdorff | date = 24 October 2012 | title = Nutzpflanzen: Nutzbare Gewächse der gemäßigten Breiten, Subtropen und Tropen | location = Stuttgard | publisher = Georg Thieme Verlag| page= 399|url = {{google books | id = SvKBgdI7-foC | page = 399 | plainurl = yes}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Hamamre 2013 217–226"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Hamamre|first=Z.|title=Jojoba is a Possible Alternative Green Fuel for Jordan|journal=Energy Sources, Part B: Economics, Planning, and Policy|date=July 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=217–226|doi=10.1080/15567240903330442}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Widyan|first=Mohamad I.|last2=Al-Muhtaseb|first2= Mu’taz A.|title=Experimental investigation of jojoba as a renewable energy source|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|date=August 2010|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1702–1707|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2009.11.043}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jojoba cannot be cultivated on a scale to compete with traditional fossil fuels, and its use is regulated to personal care products.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Uwe Wolfmeier, Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer, Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber|title=Waxes|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|year=2002|doi=10.1002/14356007.a28_103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:San Carlos Apache Reservation Jojoba Seed Purchase(2008).JPG|thumb|Right|Wild jojoba seed market on the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] in [[Arizona]]]]

===Cultivation===
[[Plantation]]s of jojoba have been established in a number of desert and semi-desert areas, predominantly in Argentina, Australia, Israel, Mexico, Peru and the United States. It is currently the [[Sonoran Desert]]'s second most economically valuable native plant (overshadowed only by ''[[Washingtonia filifera]]''—California fan palms, used as [[ornamental trees]]).

Jojoba prefers light, coarsly textured soils. Good drainage and water penetration is necessary. It tolerates [[salinity]] and nutrient-poor soils. Soil pH should be between 5 and 8.&lt;ref name=CaliforniaAgriculture&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yermanos | first = D. M. | date = 1979 | title = Jojoba – a crop whose time has come | journal = California Agriculture }}&lt;/ref&gt; High temperatures are tolerated by jojoba, but frost can damage or kill plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Borlaug | first = N. | date = 1985 | title = Jojoba. New Crop for Arid Lands, New Raw Material for Industry | publisher = National Academy Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Requirements are poor because jojoba plants do not need an intensive cultivation. Weed problems only occur during the first two years after planting and there is little damage by insects. Supplemental [[irrigation]] could maximize production if rainfall as less than 400&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=CaliforniaAgriculture/&gt; There is no need for high [[fertilisation]], but, especially in the first year, nitrogen increases growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nelson | first = M. | date = 2001 | title = Nitrogen fertilization effects on jojoba seed production | journal = Industrial Crops and Products | volume = 13 | pages= 145–154 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6690(00)00061-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jojoba is normally harvested by hand because seeds do not all mature in the same time. Yield is around 3.5 t/ha depending on the age of the plantation.&lt;ref name=CaliforniaAgriculture/&gt;

Selective breeding is developing plants that produce more beans with higher wax content, as well as other characteristics that will facilitate harvesting.&lt;ref name="desertmuseum"/&gt;

Its ability to withstand high salinity (up to 12 d[[Siemens (unit)|S]] m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at pH 9) and the high value of jojoba products make jojoba an interesting plant for the use of desertification control. It has been used to [[Desertification#Countering desertification|combat and prevent desertification]] in the [[Thar Desert]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Abdulrahman S. |last1=Alsharhan |first2=Abdulrahman |last2=Fowler |first3=Andrew S. |last3=Goudie |first4=Eissa M.|last4= Abdellatif |first5=Warren W. |last5=Wood |title=Desertification in the third millennium|year=2003|publisher=Balkema|location=Lisse|isbn=978-0-415-88943-8|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mercury Sable''' is a range of automobiles that were manufactured and marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] brand of [[Ford Motor Company]].  Introduced in 1986 as the replacement for the [[Mercury Marquis]], the Sable marked the transition of the mid-size Mercury product range to front-wheel drive.  From 1986 to 2005, the Sable was produced as a mid-size four-door sedan and station wagon, serving as the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Taurus (no Sable version of the [[Ford Taurus SHO|Taurus SHO]] was produced).  For 2006, the Sable was withdrawn, replaced by the smaller [[Mercury Milan]] and larger [[Mercury Montego]].  For 2008, alongside the return of the Ford Taurus, the Sable nameplate was revived; as a mid-cycle revision of the Montego, the Sable became a full-size sedan slotted below the Grand Marquis.  

Due to low sales, Mercury discontinued the Sable after 2009, with the final vehicle produced on May 21, 2009.&lt;ref name="endagain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090517/AUTO01/905170326/1148/rss25|title=Sable reaches end of the line|author=Hoffman, Bryce G|date=May 17, 2009|work=The Detroit News|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, 2,112,374 Sables were produced during its 1986-2005 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specs/Production.php|title=Production Figures|work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia|publisher=Taurus Car Club of America|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the 2018 model year, the Ford Taurus/SHO remains in production in North America, though the 2010 closure of Mercury left the Sable without a direct successor.    

The Mercury Sable derives its name from the [[sable]], a weasel-like mammal from Russia that is valued for its smooth, dark fur.

[[File:1st Mercury Sable wagon rear.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Mercury Sable wagon]]
 
The Sable was a very important sedan for both Mercury and the American auto industry.  Ford had lagged in introducing mid-size front wheel drive cars to compete against [[General Motors]]' [[Chevrolet Citation]] and its best-selling [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]/[[Pontiac 6000]]/[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]/[[Buick Century]] quartet as well as [[Chrysler]]'s well-received [[Chrysler K cars|K cars]] and Japanese offerings from [[Honda]], [[Datsun]]/[[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]].&lt;ref name="Taub"&gt;{{cite book|title=Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford|last=Taub|first=Eric|date=November 1991|publisher=[[E. P. Dutton]]|isbn=0-525-93372-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mercury brand suffered even more from this delay. In 1983, Ford launched the redesigned [[Mercury Cougar]] to start a reinvigoration of the Mercury brand with new aerodynamic designs, and started development of the Sable.&lt;ref name="Coolcat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coolcats.net/fox/1983.html |title=Cool Cats: The 1983 Mercury Cougar |work=coolcats.new |date=16 February 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427131704/http://www.coolcats.net/fox/1983.html |archivedate=27 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this design, the Sable was a resounding success and launched Mercury into a new design era, as well as influencing the other American automakers to follow suit and create more [[aerodynamic]] cars, thus ending the "boxy" cars of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt;

The Taurus and Sable siblings used flush aerodynamic composite [[headlights]]. Ford was the first to produce and sell vehicles with such headlights in the U.S., when it introduced the [[Lincoln Mark VII]] in 1984. To do so, Ford (among other automakers) had to lobby the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) to have them approved.&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt; The Taurus and Sable were the first domestically-produced, mainstream sedans to use the new lights. They also went beyond the [[Audi 5000]], with which they were often compared, to adopt a grille-less "bottom breather" nose, first pioneered by the [[Citroën DS]] in the 1950s, and also used briefly on the Mustang.&lt;ref name = "Taub" /&gt;

The Sable was unveiled along with the Taurus in a resounding fashion. For its aerodynamic shape, the launch was held in [[MGM Studios]] Soundstage 85, where ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was filmed. Ford workers came into the room, which was decorated in space-age decor, holding cups shaped like flying saucers and the Taurus and Sable were sitting behind a curtain, their outlines silhouetting. Then, with the flashing of strobe lights and a drum-roll, the curtain was pulled back and the two cars were revealed to the public.&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt;

The bodyshell was smooth and aerodynamic. The Mercury Sable was given its own front fascia; in place of a grille, the Sable was styled with a low-wattage "lightbar" between the headlights and fitted with clear turn signals, effectively wrapping around most of the distance from wheel to wheel.  The design was also adopted in the Mercury Topaz and Tracer, with other automakers adopting variations of the styling into the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1996-pontiac-grand-prix-5.htm Pontiac Grand Prix at Consumer Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015065945/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1996-pontiac-grand-prix-5.htm |date=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1994-mitsubishi-eclipse-5.htm Mitsubishi Eclipse at Consumer Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309140754/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1994-mitsubishi-eclipse-5.htm |date=2007-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1992-to-1997-subaru-svx-5.htm Subaru SVX at Consumer Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015065952/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1992-to-1997-subaru-svx-5.htm |date=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft-style doors were used to reduce wind noise, and the handles were recessed. The Sable also had large glass areas with slim pillars, and were flush with the body. The rear glass wrapped fully around, and the B-pillars were painted black to give the illusion that the front and rear glass were connected. The interior was available with bucket seats — very rare for most U.S. midsize sedans — and the dashboard wrapped around the driver and fed into the door panels to create more of a "cockpit" feel.&lt;ref name="bestselling"&gt;{{cite web|last=DiPetro|first=John|date=2003-04-18|publisher=Edmunds|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46007|title=Inside Line: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable|accessdate=2006-05-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66YJVO7hm?url=http://www.insideline.com/|archivedate=2012-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sable was first introduced as a 1986 model in December 1985, to strong sales and fanfare. It came in two models, base GS and high-end LS. Initial Sable sales were strong, and the Sable sold around 300,000 units its first year.&lt;ref name = "Taub" /&gt;

For the first year on the market, Sable buyers had the choice of a 90&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford HSC engine#2.5|HSC]] [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] mated to a three-speed automatic [[transaxle]] or a 140&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] [[V6]] with a four-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], with the latter having much higher sales. 4-cylinder Sable sales were so poor that the engine was dropped in 1987 (it remained an option for the Taurus until 1991). Ford's 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]]'' [[V6]] was added to the line-up in 1988. Although the power output was rated at the same 140&amp;nbsp;hp (104&amp;nbsp;kW) as the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L engine, this large V6 produced 215&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf (291&amp;nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]], a welcome addition, especially in the heavier [[station wagon]]s. However, the 3.8 suffered from premature head gasket failure, which was primarily a fault with Ford's supplier of gaskets, not with the engine itself. Some also attribute this to reduced under-hood cooling.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; Unlike the Taurus, no manual transmission was offered in the Sable.

The Sable had just received small changes over the years, mostly in terms of equipment and cosmetics. In 1991, sales dipped to just over 100,000 units, so a new generation of Sable was launched.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt;

===Sable in Mexico===
This generation of the Sable wasn't sold in [[Mexico]].  It was sold with Mercury badges as the [[Ford Taurus]] up until 1995, especially with the second generation.

===Awards===
The Sable was on [[Car and Driver]] magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] on its release in 1986 and again in 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt;

The Sable received its first significant cosmetic update in 1992, which modernized the interior and the front and rear fascias.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; The operation cost Ford $650 million at the time. With the older model facing slumping sales, this new model brought sales back up again, with 410,000 examples sold during 1992, a number unheard of even today.&lt;ref name="det"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm|last=Mayne|first=Eric|date=2005-04-19|work=[[Detroit News]]|title=End of Ford Taurus closes era|accessdate=2006-05-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730140903/http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm|archivedate=2012-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the design was basically the same, every body panel on the sedan except for the doors was changed.;&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G2/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable spotters guide (Generation 2) |work=taurusclub.com/encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the station wagon all the sheet metal to the rear of the cowl was the same as that of the 1986-1995 Ford Taurus wagon. The interior was also redesigned, and included an optional passenger-side airbag, a first in its class.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; The Taurus, sister car of the Sable, was the best-selling car in the United States for every year of this cosmetic update.&lt;ref name= "bestselling"/&gt;

The base "GS" and luxury "LS" trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. A front cloth bench seat was standard on GS sedans and wagons, although cloth bucket seats were available on GS sedans only. Higher-end cloth bucket seats were standard on LS sedans, but a bench seat was a no cost option. A front bench was standard on LS wagons, with bucket seats optional. Leather seating surfaces were available on all LS Sables.

In 1993, unpopular optional features such as the "[[Quickclear|InstaClear]]" heated windshield were eliminated.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; For 3.0 L V6 engines, the drive belt system became a single-belt setup for 1993 (previously, the 3.0 L [[alternator (auto)|alternator]] had used a separate belt).&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; A passenger-side airbag became standard for 1993, and a redesigned drivers side airbag and steering wheel came in 1994. Also in 1994, some 3.0&amp;nbsp;L models began receiving the new [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4N|AX4N]] transmission.

The wagon version was available with mostly the same options as the sedan versions.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; Wagons had a maximum of 81.1 cubic feet of cargo area with the 60/40 split rear seat folded down.&lt;ref name="Consumerguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-ford-taurus.htm |title=1990-1995 Ford Taurus Review |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328192510/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-ford-taurus.htm |archivedate=2007-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They featured a 2-way liftgate (raise the entire liftgate or just the window), a roof rack with crossbar and tie-downs, an optional rear-facing third seat, a lockable under-floor compartment, and an optional fold-out picnic table. With both rear split seats in the upright position, standard cargo capacity was 45.7 cubic feet.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; Wagons that were equipped with the front bench seat and rear folding seat could seat eight people.

The last year of this updated Sable generation was 1995. For the 1995 model year, the rare LTS trim level was added. It featured leather bucket seats, Taurus LX-style alloy wheels, special cladding, and many leather wrapped interior trim parts.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; The LTS trim had either the standard 3.0 L Vulcan V6 or the optional 3.8 L Essex V6.

The 1996 model year saw the first complete redesign for the Sable. Ford hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had had with the 1986 Sable. The controversial oval theme was not well received by the press and the public, and is ultimately blamed as the reason for a substantial dip in sales.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Car: A Drama of The American Workplace|first=Mary|last=Walton| date=May 1997 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|isbn=0-393-04080-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this generation, the Sable tried to move slightly upmarket, and as a result, prices rose considerably, also driving away potential buyers.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; The 1996 Sable was the first model to share sheetmetal with the Taurus. Differences from the Taurus included different front and rear fascias, and the elimination of the rear quarter window.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG3" /&gt; Although the Sable used a less oval based styling, sales still fell.&lt;ref name = "mw" /&gt;

The 1996 model could be equipped with the brand new 200&amp;nbsp;hp (149&amp;nbsp;kW) 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[double overhead cam|DOHC]] ''[[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec 30]]'' [[V6]] as an option.&lt;ref name="CG96"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-mercury-sable.htm |title=1996-1999 Mercury Sable at Consumer Guide |work=consumerguide.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823102851/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-mercury-sable.htm |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trim lines stayed the same, with GS as the entry level model and LS as the most luxurious model. The LTS was eliminated.&lt;ref name = "CG96" /&gt; Although all 1998 models had the option of the DOHC Duratec engine, it was only available on the LS for 1999. That same year front bucket seats became optional on the GS.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG3" /&gt; Mercury claimed that the 1999 Duratec had less power than the 2000 Duratec in hopes to increase sales of the 2000 Sable.&lt;ref name = "Myths"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Other/Myths.html |title=TCCA encyclopedia: Myths |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2007-01-13 |accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:96-99 Mercury Sable wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1998-1999 Mercury Sable LS wagon]] 
In an effort to reverse the declining sales of the Sable, Mercury did major cost cutting for the 1997 model.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G3/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable spotters guide (Generation 3 1996-1999) |work=taurusclub.com/encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried this further for 1998, by giving it a front end facelift, and cutting the price up to $2,000 in 1999.&lt;ref name = "CG96" /&gt; Mercury also continued to cut costs, eliminating some options for 1999.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG3" /&gt;

The Sable received another redesign in 2000, which minimized some of the oval design elements from the 1996 model, replacing them with more conventional styling.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; The redesign also featured a taller roof over the rear-passenger space, to increase passenger headroom that had been sacrificed by the tapered 1996 design.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; The taller and roomier trunk also served to make the vehicle more functional.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; The interior was completely changed for a much more conservative design.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; Certain elements of the interior were retained from the 1996 model, such as the integrated control console, which combined the sound system and climate controls into one panel; but the shape of that panel was changed from the controversial oval to a more conventional and conservative trapezoid. The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was also softened to appeal to a broader, non-sporting audience.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; To reduce the price and increase profitability, many features such as four-wheel [[disc brake]]s were eliminated &lt;ref name="Consumerguide00"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2005-mercury-sable.htm |title=2000-2005 Mercury Sable |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210080341/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2005-mercury-sable.htm |archivedate=2007-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the sedan; station wagons retained four-wheel disc brakes.

The 2002 Sable included extra equipment on every trim level, including a CD player and power driver's seat on the GS, and a power [[moonroof]] or leather interior on the LS.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; Side airbags and [[traction control system|traction control]] were added as options on all models.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; For 2004, the Sable received minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear fascias, most noticeably the grille was made fully chrome. Inside were a new instrument cluster and steering wheel.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt;

Due to the Mercury brand's discontinuation in Canada, the fourth generation Sable was never available in the Canadian market.  Thus it was unique to the [[United States|US]] and [[Mexico]].

The 2005 [[Mercury Montego]] and 2006 [[Mercury Milan|Milan]] were launched as replacements for the Sable.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; Shortly after the Montego's introduction the Sable was discontinued, along with the Taurus wagon; the Taurus sedan continued to be produced, but primarily for the fleet market. The last Sable left the Atlanta plant on April 29, 2005.&lt;ref name = "det" /&gt;

{{wikinewsart|Ford Taurus to be revived}}

At the [[Chicago Auto Show]] on February 7, 2007, [[Ford]] [[CEO]] [[Alan Mulally]] unveiled a refreshed version of the [[Mercury Montego]] sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/products/press_article_display.cfm?article_id=25374&amp;vehicle_id=1539|title=Mercury Sable Returns to Showrooms With More Power, Style and Sophistication|work=Media. Ford.com|accessdate=2007-02-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001212/http://media.ford.com/products/press_article_display.cfm?article_id=25374&amp;vehicle_id=1539|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to dealer demand and in a move towards better nameplate recognition, the Montego name was dropped in favor of a revived Sable.

Entering sale on July 2007 as a 2008 model, the revived Sable was joined by a revived Ford Taurus (replacing the [[Ford Five Hundred]]) and [[Ford Taurus X]] (replacing the Ford Freestyle, effectively replacing the Taurus/Sable station wagons).  Although externally smaller than the Grand Marquis, the fifth-generation Sable was the first version produced as a full-size sedan.

In the transition to the Montego to the Sable, a number of changes were made to the body and chassis.  Alongside the addition of the 263&amp;nbsp;hp 3.5L V6 and 6-speed 6F automatic, the exterior underwent several revisions, including a new front bumper and grille, redesigned headlamps; the LED taillamps were retained, but given white lenses.

==Special editions==
A few rare special editions of the Sable were made, all consisting of first generation models.

In 1987, Mercury created a special edition of the Sable called the "LS Monochrome Edition", which as an option would color the bumpers, side trim, and wheels white.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G1/index.html |title=Generation 1 Spotter's Guide |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher= Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only offered in 1987; the production quantity is not known and it is also unknown how many still exist.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG1" /&gt;

In 1989, Mercury created a "50th Anniversary" edition of the Sable, to celebrate Mercury's 50th Anniversary. Keeping with the name, only 50 were sold, combined between GS and LS models. This Sable was actually a test bed for creating a Luxury sports version of the Sable called the LTS, similar to that of the Ford Taurus SHO. It was meant to use the SHO's chassis, interior, and suspension, but not the engine.&lt;ref name = "Rarez" /&gt; After the launch of the SHO, and all the publicity and praise it got, Ford shelved the Sable LTS to focus on the SHO, and because they were afraid it would take sales away from the SHO. The Sable LTS remained in a "[[development hell]]" until mid-1994 when it was introduced as a high end version of the Sable, but by then, it was just a highly optioned LS. An unknown number of these Sables still exist, but a pristine condition GS in this trim was sold on [[eBay]] in 2007.&lt;ref name = "Rarez"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/50th-sable.html |title=1989 50th Anniversary Mercury Sable|work=encyclopedia.taurusclub.com |date= |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special one-of-a-kind Sable convertible was created in 1988 for the [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit SAE auto show]]. It was built from a sedan chassis and featured a completely custom two-door body with a custom folding top. However, it was shelved; the only one sat in a warehouse for years until it was given a [[VIN]], titled, and driven. It was sold on eBay in 2006.&lt;ref name = "Convert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Concepts/88convert.html |title=1988 Sable Convertible concept |work=www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in Automotive News (circa 1990) an all aluminum "body in white" was made for a Sable. In an accompanying photo it is shown being held up by two middle aged women, leading to the belief it would weigh less than 600&amp;nbsp;lbs. At the time Audi had just released the A8, so it might have been an engineering exercise for constructing all aluminum frames, as Jaguar has now. Whatever became of the "Aluminum Sable Unibody", or if there was more than one, is unknown.

==Popular culture==
In the movie ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', the main character, Beldar, drives a 1992 Sable GS. The car is equipped with a removable sunroof to accommodate his "cone." At the end of the movie, the car is taken to planet Remulak, and the owner's guide given as a gift to the Conehead Highmaster. The car is described as "a personal conveyance named after its inventor, an assassinated ruler, a character from Greco-Roman myth and a small furry mammal." ([[Henry Ford]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and [[Sable]], respectively).

The '''November 2009 nor'easter''' (also referred to as '''"Nor'Ida"''') was a powerful autumn [[nor'easter]] that caused widespread damage throughout the east coast of the United States.  This [[extratropical cyclone]] formed in relation to  [[Hurricane Ida (2009)|Hurricane Ida's]] mid-level circulation across southeastern Georgia and moved east-northeast offshore North Carolina before slowly dropping south and southeast over the succeeding several days.

==Synoptic history==
[[File:Ida 2009 track.png|thumb|left|Track map of Hurricane Ida]]
The origins of the nor'easter originated from with the remnants of Hurricane Ida, a storm that formed on November&amp;nbsp;4 over the southern Caribbean Sea.&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt; After tracking through Nicaragua as a [[SSHS#Category 1|Category&amp;nbsp;1 hurricane]], the system attained [[SSHS#Category 2|Category&amp;nbsp;2]] status over the [[Yucatán Channel]]. Once in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the combination of increasing [[wind shear]] and cooler waters caused Ida to weaken. The system eventually moved over the southeastern United States on November&amp;nbsp;10 before transitioning into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. Ida eventually dissipated over the [[Florida Panhandle]].&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt; However, Ida's mid-level circulation led to the formation of a new low over southeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which eventually moved off the coast of [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="NOAArpt"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kathleen Egan |author2=Laurita Brown |author3=Karen Earwaker |author4=Colleen Fanelli |author5=Adam Grodsky |author6=Aijun Zhang |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=May 2010|accessdate=December 22, 2010|title=Effects of the November 2009 Nor'easter on Water Levels|url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/tech_rpt_56.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new low quickly intensified and became a powerful [[nor'easter]] that caused substantial damage throughout the [[Mid-Atlantic States]].&lt;ref name="TCR"/&gt; Due to the rapid succession of these systems, United States media referred to the nor'easter as "Nor'Ida".&lt;ref name="USGS1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=St. Petersburg Coastal  |author2=Marine Science Center |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=December 23, 2010|title=Nor'Ida|url=http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/norida/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November&amp;nbsp;12, the system attained a minimum pressure of 992&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.29&amp;nbsp;inHg) along with winds of 65&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="NASAIda"/&gt; In combination with a large [[High pressure area|area of high pressure]], a long stretch of easterly, onshore winds impacted areas from [[Virginia]] to southern [[New England]].&lt;ref name="PA34"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul J. Kocin|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|date=November 12, 2009|accessdate=December 22, 2010|title=Public Advisory 34 for Remnants of Ida|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/2009/IDA/IDA_34.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking parallel to the North Carolina coastline, the system eventually moved onshore near [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina|Cape Hatteras]] by November&amp;nbsp;13. Due to the high pressure system situated over [[Vermont]], the low turned southeastward, bringing its center back over water. Gradual weakening took place during this period, though heavy rains continued to fall across much of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area. On November&amp;nbsp;14, a brief secondary low developed off the coast of Delaware.&lt;ref name="NOAArpt"/&gt; Continuing to weaken, the cyclone resumed a northward track after the high weakened and persisted through November&amp;nbsp;17, by which time it had moved over [[Atlantic Canada]].&lt;ref name="HPCIda"/&gt;

==Preparations==
[[File:Ida 2009 rainfall.png|thumb|right|300px|Rainfall from Hurricane Ida and the subsequent nor'easter in the United States]]
As the remnants of Ida began to weaken within the developing nor'easter on November&amp;nbsp;11, [[flood warning]]s were already in force from [[Alabama]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[flood watch|watches]] extended northward into the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. Coastal flood watches and high wind warnings were also in effect from North Carolina to [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="PA32"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael T.

==Impact==

===Storm surge===
Due to the location of the storm, south east of the Chesapeake Bay, persistent onshore flows brought elevated water levels to some areas for up to four days. This also brought a [[storm surge]] to much of the region and in some cases, these surges reached record levels set by [[Hurricane Isabel]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="NOAArpt"/&gt; In [[Norfolk, Virginia]], a maximum storm surge of {{convert|7.74|ft|m|abbr=on}} was measured on November&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;ref name="NWSrpt1"/&gt; Five coastal measuring stations recorded record-high water levels during the event and three were within {{convert|0.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Despite the nor'easter not being nearly as intense as Hurricane Isabel, water levels rivaled that of the hurricane because of persistent onshore flows, elevating water levels for several days.&lt;ref name="NOAArpt"/&gt;

===Southeastern states===
[[File:Nor'Ida Virginia damage.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Before and after images of a beach in Virginia depicting the severity of beach erosion]]
Along the east coast of the United States, a [[nor'easter]] spawned by the remnants of Ida resulted in widespread damage along coastal areas.&lt;ref name="TCR"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lixion A.

'''Philip H. Diehl''' (January 29, 1847 &amp;ndash; April 7, 1913) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] mechanical [[engineer]] and [[inventor]] who held several U.S. [[patent]]s, including [[light bulb|electric incandescent lamp]]s, [[electric motor]]s for [[sewing machine]]s and other uses, and [[ceiling fan]]s. Diehl was a contemporary of [[Thomas Edison]] and his inventions caused Edison to reduce the price of his incandescent bulb.

He occasionally spelled his first name 'Phillip'.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl spelled and signed his first name 'Phillip' in his US patent 208838, awarded 8 October 1878&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Philip H. Diehl was born in [[Flörsheim-Dalsheim|Dalsheim]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"&gt;"Diehl's Lamp Hit Edison Monopoly," Elizabeth Daily Journal, Friday Evening, October 25, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 1868, he immigrated to [[New York City]] where he worked in several machine shops before finding work as an apprentice with the [[Singer Manufacturing Company]]. In 1870 or 1871 he was transferred to [[Chicago, Illinois]] and worked at [[Remington Products|Remington Machine Company]] until 1875. He lost all of his possessions in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. In 1873, Diehl married Emilie Loos in Chicago.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;

In 1875, Diehl moved to [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] and took charge of experimental work improving sewing machines at the Singer plant. His daughter, Clara Elvira, was born April 2, 1876.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;

==Inventions==
While working at Singer in Elizabeth, Diehl experimented at work and at his home. This resulted in several inventions.

===Electric light===
Working in the basement of his home on Orchard Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Diehl invented a lamp that was different from [[Thomas Edison]]'s incandescent electric lamp, which was patented in 1879. Diehl's lamp had no lead-in wires. In 1882 Diehl obtained the first patent on this induction incandescent lamp. The base of the lamp contained a wire coil that coupled with a primary coil in the lamp socket, causing current to flow through the lamp without the need for lead-in wires. Two additional patents were granted in 1883, followed by patents for electrical lighting systems in 1885 and 1886.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EDISONIAN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edisonian.com/p004b006.htm |title=Diehl lamp |accessdate=2007-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19991004060012/http://www.edisonian.com/p004b006.htm |archivedate=1999-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following is a partial list of lamp or lighting related patents issued to Philip Diehl:&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;
*U.S. No. 255,497, Incandescent Electric Lamp, March 28, 1882
*U.S. No. 272,125, Electric Incandescent Lamp, February 13, 1883
*U.S. No. 276,571, Incandescent Electric Lamp, May 1, 1883
*U.S. No. 314,567, Electric Arc Lamp, March 31, 1885
*U.S. No. 350,482, Electric Lighting System, October 12, 1886 

Diehl erected the city's first arc light in front of the Corey Building in Elizabeth, which still stands at 109 Broad Street.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;

Diehl's invention of the induction lamp was used by [[George Westinghouse]] to force royalty concessions from Thomas Edison. The Westinghouse Company bought Diehl's patent rights for $25,000. Although Diehl's lamp could not be made and sold at a price to compete with the Edison lamp, the Westinghouse Company used the Diehl bulb to force the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;

===Sewing machine===
Together with Lebbeus B. Miller, Diehl invented and patented the "oscillating shuttle" [[bobbin drivers|bobbin driver]] designed and a sewing machine build around it.
{{main|Bobbin drivers}}

===Electric engines===
Diehl's work at Singer to improve the sewing machine led to developments in electric motors, first to power sewing machines and later for other uses as well. In 1884 at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] he demonstrated a [[dynamo]], modeled after his smaller motor, which generated a current for arc lamps, sewing machine motors and incandescent lamps, all covered by his patents. The judicial committee at the exhibition judged it to be one of the best dynamos exhibited.&lt;ref name="UNION"&gt;"Philip Diehl", History of Union County, New Jersey, Vol 2, A. Van Doren Honeyman, 1923, pp 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceiling fan===
The fan was invented in 1882 by [[Schuyler Wheeler|Schuyler Skaats Wheeler]]. A few years later, Philip Diehl mounted a fan [[blade]] on a [[sewing machine]] [[Electric motor|motor]] and attached it to the ceiling, inventing the [[ceiling fan]], which he patented in 1887. Later, he added a [[light fixture]] to the ceiling fan. Later in 1904,Diehl and Co. added a split-ball joint, allowing it to be redirected; three years later, this developed into the first [[oscillating]] [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]].&lt;ref name="NEWSFINDER"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/ceiling_fans/ 
|title=NEWSFINDER Ceiling Fans 
|accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Philip Diehl died on April 7, 1913 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary Notes, Philip H. Diehl, The New York Times, Tuesday, April 8, 1913, page 13, column 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 1889 the American Institute of New York awarded Philip Diehl a bronze medal, which bears the inscription ''The Medal of Merit, awarded to Philip Diehl for Electric Fans and Dynamos, 1889.''&lt;ref name="UNION"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5113">A '''Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO)''' is an ESCO [[Energy service company]] which provides energy to the consumers from renewable energy sources, usually [[Photovoltaics|solar photovoltaics]], [[wind power]] or [[micro hydro]].

RESCOs include [[Investor-owned utility|investor owned]], [[Public ownership|publicly owned]], [[cooperatives]], and [[community organisation]]s.

== Main characteristics ==
The main characteristics of a RESCO are:
*  The household serviced does not own the generation equipment, which is owned by an external organisation such as a Government agency or the RESCO;
*  The user does not carry out maintenance, all maintenance and repair service is provided by the RESCO;
*  The user pays a service charge that covers the capital repayment requirement and the cost of providing for maintenance and repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fdoe.gov.fj/ReportsRenewableEnergy/Charter%20for%20Renewable%20Energy%20Based%20Rural%20Electrification%20Nov%202002.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110201137/http://www.fdoe.gov.fj/ReportsRenewableEnergy/Charter%20for%20Renewable%20Energy%20Based%20Rural%20Electrification%20Nov%202002.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is much like that of a conventional [[electric utility]] in that the generation equipment is not owned by the user and the electricity that is generated is made available to the customer for a fee. The fee charged to the user includes any required capital replacement cost and all operating, maintenance and repair costs plus a profit for the operating organisation.

There are two significant differences between the conventional utility approach and that of the RESCO. For a RESCO:
* Generation may be distributed among many households instead of being centralised at a [[power station]];
* Many organisations regulated by the government may provide services independently of each other.

== RESCOs &amp; rural electrification ==
RESCOs have been very successful in the expansion of [[rural electrification]] projects worldwide because:
*  Low income rural households receive electricity without having to invest in renewable energy equipment, something that they would not normally be able to afford due to the high initial cost.
*  Equipment is properly maintained and components replaced by the RESCO, making sure that the service is not interrupted,
*  Equipment is owned by an organization that directly or indirectly represents the users (beneficiaries of the funding).

As a result of all this, donors are prepared to contribute with funding to the RESCO concept because it makes their aid (1) effective, (2) sustainable and (3) accountable.&lt;ref&gt;Akura, Terubentau &amp; Torra Griso, Marc "Solar Home Systems Technical &amp; Management Model in Kiribati". SOPAC Regional Energy Meeting , Tonga, 20 – 24 April 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;

== RESCOs in the Pacific ==
Pacific Governments have provided rural electrification to remote locations by means of four main institutional set-ups, which are:
*  Engaging the power utility in carrying out the rural electrification. This is the approach followed in [[Marshall Islands]] by the Marshall Electric Company (MEC) or in the Federated States of Micronesia by the Yap State Public Service Corporation (YSPSC) and the Chuuk Power Utility Corporation (CPUC).
*  Setting up a different entity for the rural electrification (RESCO), but still centralising much of the decision making process in Government officials through the nomination of a board of directors. This is the strategy applied in [[Kiribati]], with the Kiribati Solar Energy Company Ltd (KSEC).
*  Decentralising operation and maintenance by engaging the private sector, while keeping the ownership of the equipment in the hands of a government department. This is the solution followed in [[Fiji]] with the RESCO charter and in [[Pohnpei]] State ([[Federated States of Micronesia]]).
*  Decentralising operation and maintenance by engaging the users, and transferring ownership of the equipment to the organisation that represents them.  This was the solution followed in [[Tonga]] though the Ha'apai District Solar Electricity Committee before deciding to engage the power utility in providing the service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35501">Under its commitment to the [[EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC|EU renewable energy directive]] of 2009, France has a target of producing 23% of its total energy needs from renewable energy by 2020. This figure breaks down to renewable energy providing 33% of energy used in the heating and cooling sector, 27% of the electricity sector and 10.5% in the transport sector. By the end of 2014, 14.3% of France's total energy requirements came from renewable energy, a rise from 9.6% in 2005.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/national-action-plans|title = National action plan for the promotion of renewable energies 2009-2020 In accordance with Article 4 of European Union Directive 2009/28/EC|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outlook for renewable electricity in France received a boost following the publication in October 2016 of the "Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie",  showing a commitment to re-balancing the electricity mix towards renewables. According to the report, renewable electricity capacity is planned to grow from 41&amp;nbsp;GW in 2014 to between 71 and 78&amp;nbsp;GW by 2023.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Programmation-pluriannuelle-de-l,48569.html|title=Ministre de l'Environnement, de l'Énergie et de la Mer, Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie, 27 October 2016.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the electricity sector in France has been dominated by the country's longstanding commitment to [[nuclear power]].  However, the report emphasizes that by 2025 more than half of [[Nuclear power in France|France's nuclear power capacity]] will come from stations that will be 40 years or older, and subject to closure or refurbishment to extend their operation. Thus, there is a need to look to other sources, including renewables, to meet the expected generating-capacity shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Programmation-pluriannuelle-de-l,48569.html|title = Ministre de l'Environnement, de l'Énergie et de la Mer, Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie, 27 October 2016, pg 110.|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A key component of France's renewable target is the commitment to greatly increase energy efficiency, particularly for buildings and thermal insulation. Heat wastage is targeted to be reduced by 38% by 2020. The renewable targets are also intended to stimulate new trades and changes to existing trades to enable green growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
The PPE plan targets the reduction of the consumption of primary fossil energy by 22% in 2023 from 2012 levels (reference scenario) or a fallback scenario of an 11% reduction under less-favorable conditions (variant scenario).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Programmation-pluriannuelle-de-l,48569.html|title = Ministre de l'Environnement, de l'Énergie et de la Mer, Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie, 27 October 2016, p15.|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In terms of the reduction in primary consumption, petroleum products are targeted to fall by 23% between 2012 and 2023 (reference scenario) or 9.5% (variant scenario), gas by 16% (9% variant scenario) and coal by 37% (30% variant scenario).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the transport sector, France has a range of initiatives designed to promote renewable energy use and increase efficiency. 
These include changing transport behavior, such as a target of 10% of [[Telecommuting|tele-worked]] days by 2030 to reduce consumption.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Programmation-pluriannuelle-de-l,48569.html|title = Ministre de l'Environnement, de l'Énergie et de la Mer, Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie, 27 October 2016, p33.|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 2023, the country aims to have a fleet of 2.4&amp;nbsp;million rechargeable electric and [[hybrid vehicle]]s and for 3% of heavy-duty applications to use [[natural gas vehicle]]s (NGVs). 
[[Biofuel]]s blended with petrol are set for 1.8% in 2018 and 3.4% in 2023, and for diesel 1% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2023.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
By 2030, non-road freight transport is targeted to reach 20% of all goods. 
Initiatives to increase walking and cycling are also being undertaken. [[Carpool|Car pooling]] and digital services will be promoted to increase occupancy rates to between 1.8 and 2 people by 2030. The country is also pursuing research and development of [[Vehicular automation|autonomous vehicles]], particularly in public transport.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

During 2016 renewable electricity accounted for 19.6% of France's total domestic power consumption, of which 12.2% was provided by hydroelectricity, 4.3% by wind power, 1.7% by solar power and 1.4% by bio energy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte-france.com/sites/default/files/panorama_enr20161231.pdf|title=Panorama de l'électricité renouvelable en 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the report "Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; renewable electricity capacity is targeted to grow from 41&amp;nbsp;GW capacity in 2014 to 52&amp;nbsp;GW by 2018 and between 71 and 78&amp;nbsp;GW by 2023. The target for 2023 includes a high and low scenario to take into account external factors such as cost and consultations that may affect future deployment. The sources that are planned to grow fastest are wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) power; 500&amp;nbsp;MW of offshore wind power is expected to be grid-connected by 2018. Onshore wind power is set to grow from around 9&amp;nbsp;GW in 2014 to between approximately 22 and 26&amp;nbsp;GW by 2023. Offshore wind power is targeted to grow from zero capacity in 2014 to between 3.5&amp;nbsp;GW and 9&amp;nbsp;GW by 2023, and up to an additional 2&amp;nbsp;GW of marine energy. Solar PV power is projected to grow from around 5.3&amp;nbsp;GW in 2014 to between 18.2&amp;nbsp;GW and 20.2&amp;nbsp;GW by 2023. Hydroelectric power is already well developed in France but is targeted to grow 500–750&amp;nbsp;MW by 2023.

Solid biomass accounted for the largest share of renewable energy consumption in the heating and cooling sector at 8,661 ktoe (thousand [[Tonne of oil equivalent|tonnes of oil equivalent]]) in 2014. The next-largest source was provided by [[heat pump]]s at 1,794 ktoe. Heat accounts for about 95% of the energy produced by solid biomass, while the remaining 5% is used to produce electricity.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurobserv-er.org/solid-biomass-barometer-2016/|title=Solid Biomass Barometer 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy from wood and wood products accounts for almost all of this production, of which 73% is used to heat family dwellings.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; During 2015, heat consumption in France (excluding dependencies) from solid biomass amounted to 8,836 ktoe, of which 8,115 ktoe were accounted for by direct use of end user, and 721 ktoe from [[district heating]] sources.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; District heating networks were supplied during 2015 by both heat-only plants (326 ktoe), and [[Combined Heat And Power|combined heat and power]] plants (395 ktoe).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Thassalia marine geothermal plant ===
The Thassalia marine geothermal plant is located in the [[Marseille-Fos Port|Grand Port Maritime de Marseille]] and uses marine thermal energy to provide heating and cooling to buildings connected to its network. The first phase of the network was inaugurated in October 2016 and covered {{convert|150,000|m2}}.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/11/thassalia-france-s-first-marine-geothermal-energy-power-plant-inaugurated.html|title=Renewable Energy World|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212092244/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/11/thassalia%2Dfrance%2Ds%2Dfirst%2Dmarine%2Dgeothermal%2Denergy%2Dpower%2Dplant%2Dinaugurated.html|archive-date=2017-02-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network is planned to be expanded to cover around {{convert|500,000|m2}} of Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engie.com/en/journalists/press-releases/thassalia-marine-geothermal/|title=ENGIE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant pumps seawater from the port of Marseille and extracts the natural heat from the water using large-scale heat pumps to provide heating for the town. The process can be reversed to provide cooling during the hot Mediterranean summer. The project is regarded as a flagship example and it is hoped more will follow, including a much-larger geothermal marine project on the island of [[Réunion|La Réunion]] to supply air conditioning utilizing seawater piped from {{convert|1,100|m}}.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Solar photovoltaic (PV) power grew from 104&amp;nbsp;MW capacity in 2008 to 6,549&amp;nbsp;MW by year end 2015 at which time France had the seventh-largest solar PV installed capacity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-__A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2015_-_Final.pdf|title=Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets, IEA PVPS p14.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; France and is set to undergo significant expansion of its solar power with a target of around 18–20&amp;nbsp;GW installed capacity by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Programmation-pluriannuelle-de-l,48569.html|title=Ministre de l'Environnement, de l'Énergie et de la Mer, Programmation pluriannuelle de l'énergie, 27 October 2016.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, President [[François Hollande]] and the Prime Minister of India, [[Narendra Modi]], laid the foundation stone for the headquarters of the [[Sunshine countries|International Solar Alliance]] (ISA) in Gwalpahari, Gurgaon, India. The ISA will focus on promoting and developing solar energy and solar products for countries lying wholly or partially between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]].

In 2018 EDF had plans to invest up to {{euro}}25&amp;nbsp;billion in PV power generation, and introduce green electricity tariffs.&lt;ref name=ft-20180216&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9f3ef348-12d0-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb |title=EDF revenues slip as nuclear pressures bite |author=Cat Rutter Pooley |newspaper=Financial Times |date=16 February 2018 |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tidal power ===
France opened [[Rance Tidal Power Station]], the world's first tidal power station, in 1966. It remained the world's largest tidal station until 2011. Its 24 turbines reach a peak output of 240&amp;nbsp;MW with an annual output of around 500&amp;nbsp;GWh. The dam traverses the estuary of the Rance River in [[Brittany]], connecting the tourist towns of Dinard and Saint Malo, providing both a roadbridge and footbridge. In addition the barrage is a popular destination in its own right amongst both tourists and anglers providing a pleasant walkway across the entire estuary.

&lt;small&gt;Note: Percentage values are shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in the total domestic market for heating and cooling (H&amp;C), electricity (E), and transport (T) sectors.&lt;/small&gt;

France has an overall target of producing 23% of its total energy needs from renewable energy by 2020, encompassing 33% in the heating and cooling sector, 27% in the electricity sector and 10.5% in the transport sector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By 2014 France had achieved a 14.3% renewable energy share of its total energy use, a figure a little below its target figure of 16% by that year.  Figures for the transport and electricity sectors were at or near their targets whilst the shortfall in the heating and cooling sector was around 4.1%. This may partially be explained by the ambitious rates targeted for this sector, where other countries typically have higher percentage targets in the electricity sector, a sector that has proven easier to raise the share of renewable energy.

His most important paper, "On the Moving Force of Heat",&lt;ref name="Theory of Heat"/&gt; published in 1850, first stated the basic ideas of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In 1865 he introduced the concept of [[entropy]]. In 1870 he introduced the [[virial theorem]] which applied to [[heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = RJE | year = 1870 | title = On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat | journal = Philosophical Magazine |series=4th Series | volume = 40 | pages = 122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Clausius was born in [[Koszalin|Köslin]] (now [[Koszalin]] in Poland) in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]] in [[Prussia]]. His father was a [[Protestant]] pastor and school inspector,&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Segrè (2012). ''From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries''. Courier Dover Publications. p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and Rudolf studied in the school of his father. After a few years, he went to the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Stettin]] (now [[Szczecin]]). Clausius graduated from the [[University of Berlin]] in 1844 where he studied mathematics and physics with, among others, [[Heinrich Gustav Magnus|Gustav Magnus]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Jakob Steiner]]. He also studied history with [[Leopold von Ranke]]. During 1847, he got his doctorate from the [[University of Halle]] on optical effects in Earth's atmosphere. He then became professor of physics at the Royal Artillery and Engineering School in Berlin and Privatdozent at the Berlin University. In 1855 he became professor at the [[ETH Zürich]], the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in [[Zürich]], where he stayed until 1867. During that year, he moved to [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and two years later, in 1869 to [[University of Bonn|Bonn]].

In 1870 Clausius organized an ambulance corps in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He was wounded in battle, leaving him with a lasting disability. He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for his services.

His wife, Adelheid Rimpham, died in childbirth in 1875, leaving him to raise their six children. He continued to teach, but had less time for research thereafter.

In 1886, he married Sophie Sack, and then had another child.

Two years later, on 24 August 1888, he died in [[Bonn]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Cropper2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=William H.|last=Cropper|title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=25 March 2014|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517324-6|pages=93–105|chapter=The Road to Entropy Rudolf Clausius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Clausius's PhD thesis concerning the refraction of light proposed that we see a blue sky during the day, and various shades of red at sunrise and sunset (among other phenomena) due to reflection and refraction of light. Later, [[Lord Rayleigh]] would show that it was in fact due to the scattering of light, but regardless, Clausius used a far more mathematical approach than some have used.

His most famous paper, ''Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die bewegende Kraft der Wärme'' ("On the Moving Force of Heat and the Laws of Heat which may be Deduced Therefrom")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last=Clausius |first=R.  | title =Ueber die bewegende Kraft der Wärme und die Gesetze, welche sich daraus für die Wärmelehre selbst ableiten lassen |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15164w/f518.table  | journal =Annalen der Physik  | volume =79 | pages=368–397, 500–524| year =1850 | doi=10.1002/andp.18501550403|bibcode = 1850AnP...155..500C }}.

was published in 1850, and dealt with the mechanical theory of heat. In this paper, he showed that there was a contradiction between [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]'s principle and the concept of [[conservation of energy]]. Clausius restated the two [[laws of thermodynamics]] to overcome this contradiction (the [[third law of thermodynamics|third law]] was developed by [[Walther Nernst]], during the years 1906&amp;ndash;1912). This paper made him famous among scientists.

Clausius' most famous statement of thermodynamics second law was published in German in 1854,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clausius|first=R.|title=Ueber eine veränderte Form des zweiten Hauptsatzes der mechanischen Wärmetheoriein|journal=[[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]]|year=1854|volume=93|issue=12|pages=481–506|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15178k/f499.image|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clausius|first=R.|title=On a Modified Form of the Second Fundamental Theorem in the Mechanical Theory of Heat|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine|Phil.

During 1857, Clausius contributed to the field of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] after refining [[August Krönig]]'s very simple gas-kinetic model to include translational, rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of '[[Mean free path]]' of a particle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Clausius, R.  | title =Über die Art der Bewegung, die wir Wärme nennen   | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15185v/f371.table  | journal =Annalen der Physik  | volume =100 | pages =353–379 | year =1857|doi=10.1002/andp.18571760302 |bibcode = 1857AnP...176..353C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Clausius, R.  | title =Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Wärmeleitung gasförmiger Körper   | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15200x/f13.table  | journal =Annalen der Physik  | volume =115 | pages =1–57 | year =1862 |doi=10.1002/andp.18621910102 |bibcode = 1862AnP...191....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clausius, R.

Clausius deduced the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]] from thermodynamics. This relation, which is a way of characterizing the [[phase transition]] between two states of matter such as [[solid]] and [[liquid]], had originally been developed in 1834 by [[Émile Clapeyron]].

===Entropy===
{{Main|History of entropy}}
In 1865, Clausius gave the first mathematical version of the concept of [[entropy]], and also gave it its name.&lt;ref name="Cropper2004"/&gt;  Clausius chose the word because the meaning (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐν ''en'' "in" and τροπή ''tropē'' "transformation") is "''content transformative''" or "''transformation content''" ("''Verwandlungsinhalt''").&lt;ref name="Theory of Heat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clausius|first=R.|title=The Mechanical Theory of Heat – with its Applications to the Steam Engine and to Physical Properties of Bodies|year=1867|publisher=John van Voorst|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:PwR_Sbkwa8IC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h6DgT5WnF46e8gSVvbynDQ&amp;ved=0CDYQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2012}} Contains English translations of many of his other works.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Clausius, R.  | title =Ueber verschiedene für die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen Wärmetheorie | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152107/f369.table  | journal =Annalen der Physik  | volume =125 | pages =353–400 | year =1865 |doi=10.1002/andp.18652010702|bibcode = 1865AnP...201..353C }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the now abandoned unit 'Clausius' (symbol: '''Cl''') for entropy.
:1 Clausius (Cl) = 1 [[calorie]]/[[degree Celsius]] (cal/°C) = 4.1868 [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J/K)

The landmark 1865 paper in which he introduced the concept of entropy ends with the following summary of the first and second laws of thermodynamics:&lt;ref name="Theory of Heat"/&gt;
{{quotation | ''The [[energy]] of the [[universe]] is constant.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The [[entropy]] of the universe tends to a maximum.}}''

For transmission lines, the space between overhead line and ground forms a capacitor parallel to transmission line, which causes an increase in voltage as the distance increases. When a network becomes larger, sometimes the short-circuit current on transmission line exceeds the short-circuit rating of the equipment. To offset the capacitive effect of the transmission line and to regulate the voltage and reactive power of the power system, reactors are connected either at line terminals or at the middle, thereby improving the voltage profile of transmission line.

A shunt reactor is connected in parallel with a transmission line or other load. A series reactor is connected between a load and source.

== Bus reactors ==
A bus reactor is a type of air core inductor, or in some cases, oil filled, connected between two buses or two sections of the same bus in order to limit the voltage transients on either bus. It is installed in a bus to maintain system voltage when the load of the bus changes. It adds inductance to the system to offset the capacitance of the line which varies due to load, humidity, weather, generator excitation and temperature.

== Line reactors ==
A line reactor is placed in line at the point of use or just after a transformer to maintain a stable amperage to the user. When a line is disconnected from the system, the line reactor is also disconnected from the system. Line reactors are often used to compensate line capacitance, mitigate voltage transients due to switching, and to limit fault currents, especially in case of underground transmission lines.

A bus reactor and a line reactor are interchangeable as long as they are rated for the same voltage which is dependent upon substation's physical layout, and bus configuration.

== Shunt reactors ==
Shunt reactors are used in power systems to counteract the effect of the line parasitic capacitance, thereby stabilizing the system voltage within acceptable limits. For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of capacitive current from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the sending end, thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving end voltage being higher than sending end voltage. In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system. Since inductors absorbs VARs, a reactor is connected in parallel with shunt capacitance of the line known as Shunt Reactor,

==Controlled Shunt Reactors==
{{see also|Variable shunt reactor|Flexible AC transmission system}}
A [[Controlled shunt reactor]] (CSR) is a variable inductance, smoothly regulated by magnetic biasing of ferromagnetic elements of magnetic circuit. The magnetic system of a CSR single phase consists of two cores. Each core is equipped with control and power windings. In case of regulated DC voltage source connection to the control windings, biasing flow is increasing and directed to different sides in the adjacent cores. This resulted in saturation of CSR cores at relevant half-period of the current. Core saturation is resulted in initiation and increase of the current in the power winding due to non-linear characteristics of the magnetic core. Change in biasing current value leads to the power winding current change, due to which a stepless variation of voltage levels in CSR connection point as well as the value of reactive power consumed by the reactor is ensured.

== Series reactors ==
Series reactors are used as [[current limiting reactor]]s to increase the impedance of a system. They are also used for neutral earthing. Such reactors are also used to limit the starting currents of synchronous electric motors and to compensate Reactive Power in order to improve the transmission capacity of power lines.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20667">'''Telechrome''' was the first all-electronic single-tube [[color television]] system. It was invented by well-known Scottish television engineer, [[John Logie Baird]], who had previously made the first public television broadcast, as well as the first color broadcast using a pre-Telechrome system.

Telechrome used two [[electron gun]]s aimed at either side of a thin, semi-transparent [[mica]] sheet. One of the sides was covered in [[cyan]] phosphor and the other red-orange, producing a limited [[color gamut]], but well suited to displaying skin tones. With minor modifications, the system could also be used to produce 3D images. Telechrome was selected as the basis for a UK-wide television standard by a committee in 1944, but the difficult task of converting the two-color system to three-color [[RGB]] was still underway when Baird  died in 1946.

The introduction of the [[shadow mask]] design by [[RCA]] produced a workable solution for color television, albeit one with considerably less image brightness. Interest in alternative systems like the Telechrome or [[Geer tube]] faded by the late 1950s. The only alternatives to see widespread use were [[General Electric]]'s slot-mask, and [[Sony]]'s [[Trinitron]], both were modifications of the RCA concept. All CRT-based methods have since been almost completely replaced by [[LCD television]], starting in the 1990s.

==Background==

===Mechanical and hybrid color===
Baird performed one of the earliest public demonstrations of color television system on 3 July 1928 using an all-mechanical system with three [[Nipkow disk]] scanners synchronized with a single disk on the receiving end and three colored lights that were turned on and off in synchronicity with the broadcaster. The same basic system was used on 4 February 1938 to create the first color broadcast transmissions from [[The Crystal Palace]] to the [[Dominion Theatre]] in [[London]]. Baird was not the only one to experiment with mechanical color television, and a number of similar devices were demonstrated throughout this period, but Baird is recorded as the first to show a real over-the-air transmission in a public demonstration.{{sfn|Colour|1941}}

In 1940 he introduced a much better solution using a system known today as hybrid color. This used a traditional black and white CRT with a rotating colored filter in front. Three frames, sent one after the other in a system known as ''sequential scan'', were displayed on the CRT while the colored wheel was spun in synchronicity. This design was physically very long, leading to deep receiver chassis, but later versions folded the optical path using mirrors to produce a somewhat more practical system. Again, Baird was not the only one to produce such a system, with [[CBS]] displaying a very similar system at almost the same time. However, Baird was not happy with the design later stated that a fully electronic device would be better.{{sfn|Colour|1941}}

===Fully electronic systems===
[[File:Baird first color photo.jpg|thumb|right|This live image of Paddy Naismith was used to demonstrate Baird's first all-electronic color television system, which used two projection CRTs. The two-color image would be similar to the basic telechrome system. Note that the green in Paddy's blouse reproduces very poorly as a dark, grayish cyan. Baird's two-color method can't reproduce true greens or blues.]]

The basic problem facing designers of color televisions was this: Sending each frame of the moving image meant sending three signals, red, green and blue. The sequential systems, like Baird's earlier efforts, sent the three images one after another. In order for motion to appear smooth, images must change at least 16 times a second. To reduce flicker, over 40 frames per second (fps) is mandatory. In sequential systems, each color requires a separate field. For this reason, very high refresh (field) rates were necessary. CBS' system refreshed at 144&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Electronic Motion Pictures, 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; (Peter Goldmark's CBS team tried several field rates. Within the 6&amp;nbsp;MHz allowable channel bandwidth, the most acceptable rate was 144 fps. This rate made pictures incompatible with existing systems working at 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/color.html |title= Early Color Television |website= Early Television Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system sending all three signals at the same time at a conventional refresh rate would be greatly preferable. Transmitting such a signal could be accomplished by using three camera tubes, each with a color filter in front of them, using mirrors or prisms to aim at the same scene through a single lens. Each signal would then be separately broadcast using three conventional TV channels, and using the [[luminance]] concept, one of those could be received on a conventional black and white set. This would use a considerable amount of [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], but this was a small cost in the era of only a few television channels.&lt;ref name=early/&gt;

The problem, however, was how to combine the three separate signals back into a single display. The system used in the cameras, with three separate tubes combined together optically, was not practical due to the cost of a receiver set with three CRTs as well as the unwieldily chassis needed to contain them. One such example was the [[RCA]] [[Triniscope]], which produced useful images but was extremely complex, required constant adjustment, and was the size of a contemporary refrigerator to produce a {{convert|10|inch}} display. A number of experiments were carried out using more conventional tubes and then filtering them, but the low output of the CRTs produced very dim images that were dismissed as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Reitan |url=http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html |title=CBS Field Sequential Color System |date=24 August 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105183213/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html |archivedate=5 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baird had previously worked on a high-intensity CRT system known as the "teapot tube" that saw some use in the UK and US as a projection system in theatres. These were normally built with two such CRTs side-by-side, with one acting as a hot backup in case the primary tube failed. In 1941 Baird converted such a projector to produce a two-color image simply by placing filters in front of the two tubes and projecting them onto a smaller screen to improve the effective intensity. He first showed this in 1941, and in 1942 the [[BBC]] described the resulting color image as "entirely natural". The image, of [[Paddy Naismith]], is the first known image of color television to be published.{{sfn|Colour|1941}}

A projection system with two CRTs was better than three, but still not practical for a home receiver. Baird continued to consider other solutions. One used a single conventional CRT with the two images displayed in a single frame, with the top half of the image containing the image for one color and the bottom the other. Lens systems focused on the display were positioned to see only the top or bottom image, passed them through filters, and then recombined them on a screen. There were drawings showing a similar system with three frames.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=376}} Like many similar efforts from other experimenters, Baird abandoned this approach.{{sfn|Stereoscopic|1944}}

==Two-gun Telechrome==
Still searching for a single-tube solution that was bright enough for direct viewing, in 1942 Baird hit upon the Telechrome concept. His solution was essentially to combine two tubes into one large spherical enclosure. In the center of the enclosure was a translucent [[mica]] sheet forming the display, covered on one side with [[cyan]] [[phosphor]], the other with an orange-red color, producing a limited but useful [[color gamut]]. Two [[electron gun]]s arranged on either side of the screen fired at it, producing the two colors. The image was viewed from one side, seeing one of the colors directly and the other being transmitted through the screen from the other side.{{sfn|TwoSided|1945}} This was the first single-tube color television system.{{sfn|Media}}

The earliest test models used screens only a few inches across and had the guns arranged almost at right angles to it, making for a very large tube.{{sfn|Media}} Later models were built inside very large [[Hackbridge-Hewittic]] (H-H) vacuum tubes, which the company originally designed for use as high-power [[rectifier]]s in [[power supply|power supplies]].{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=378}} Arthur Johnson, a glass blower who had previously worked for both Baird and H-H, produced the new models. These had screens ten inches across,{{sfn|Herbert|1996|p=26}} comparable to monochrome screens of the era. The guns fired upward at about a 45 degree angle. As in the teapot tube, the necks were very long.{{sfn|TwoSided|1945}}{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=378}}

Baird also demonstrated the use of the two-gun tube as the basis for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3D television.{{sfn|TwoSided|1945}} In this use, the two color-filtered television cameras were separated to produce a measurable angle, and then broadcast normally. Viewers wore colored glasses to re-separate the images into the left and right eye, in a fashion identical to [[Anaglyph 3D]] movies.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=380}}

==Three-gun Telechrome==
The colour gamut of the two-gun system was limited, unable to produce strong greens or blues. To produce a wider gamut, a system using the three primary colours would be needed. For two colours one can aim at either side of the screen, but for three there is no "third side" that can be used. Baird's solution used a variation on his two-colour system, using one side of the screen as-is, and patterning the other side with a series of horizontal triangular ridges. One gun, normally shown as red in most diagrams, fired onto the flat side of the screen, as in the two-colour model. The other two guns were arranged above and below the ridged side of the screen, so they fired onto one side or the other of the ridges. These were coloured green and blue. When all three guns fired, the image would be combined into a single display.{{sfn|TwoSided|1945}}{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=378}}

The problem with this approach was that it was very difficult to focus the electron guns on the ridges without the signal bleeding over to the ridges on either side. This problem was compounded by the changing angle between the gun and the ridges as the signal progressed down the screen. Similar designs were attempted by a number of researchers, the best known was the [[Geer tube]] that used pyramid-shaped patterns with three guns arranged around the back. None of these systems could ever be made to work reliably, with focusing and alignment being continual problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858780,00.html |title=Teacher's Tube |journal=Time |date=20 March 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no documentary evidence that a successful version of the three-gun Telechrome tube was ever built, although images of Baird holding what is claimed to be a prototype are widely duplicated. The image shows a three-neck tube, but the third neck is the original Hewittic port, now used to hold the internal screen. Burns published a typical photo of the two-gun, three-neck tube.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=379}}

Baird also described a system using the ridged tube that eliminated the need for glasses. In this case, the tube was rotated so the peaks ran vertically instead of horizontally and the red gun was removed. The guns formerly used for green and blue were now used for left and right images.{{sfn|Stereoscopic|1944}} The basic concept is identical to the [[lenticular printing]] system used in magazines and other printed materials to produce 3D images.{{sfn|TwoSided|1945}} However, there is no evidence such a system was ever trialled.

==Public demonstrations==
Baird gave a number of demonstrations of the two-color system throughout the war, and held a full press demonstration on 12 August 1944. These were generally reported in glowing terms, notably an October 1944 report in ''Electronics'' that described the images as bright and the 3D effect "excellent".{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=380}}

Not all reports were so positive. One concluded that Baird had "done a real service in demonstrating the value of colour television", but suggested that the two-color system would ultimately have to be replaced with a three-color system.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=380}} They went on to note:

{{cquote|Apart from the coated mica screen, we do not think any new invention has been demonstrated, and we consider that development on a scale far beyond the capabilities of Mr. Baird's present organisation is necessary for successful results.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=380}}}}

They also dismissed the 3D work, which Baird had apparently ended by this point, as a "stunt".{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=380}}

==Telechrome and the Hankey Committee==
In 1943, with the war clearly turning in the Allies favor, [[Winston Churchill]] formed a series of committees to consider post-war redevelopment. Among these were plans to re-open the [[Alexandra Palace]] broadcaster, and more widely, nationwide television. To consider this, in September 1943 Churchill formed the Television Committee, better known to history as the Hankey Committee.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=381}}

The Committee met numerous times during the next year, and asked Baird to prepare a number of papers on the topic of post-war broadcasting. Among his suggestions, he stated that the [[BBC]]'s monopoly should be ended and independent broadcasters should be licensed, which was delivered along with a request to start such a service. The Committee agreed with this position. He also described the Telechrome system, and this appears to have had a great impact on the Committee.

In his comments to the Hankey Television Committee, Baird suggested two-color, 1,000-line pictures. Such pictures would have required considerable radio bandwidth. The pictures would be incompatible with the pre-war, EMI / BBC, 405-line system. Before the Hankey Committee, Baird also considered the possibility of compatible color systems. {{sfn|Burns|2000|p=406-7}} We can imagine two ways to adapt Telechrome as an EMI / BBC compatible color system. Method 1 would use one field of the EMI / BBC interlaced  image for red. The other field would convey cyan picture information. Yet this method would reduce the effective resolution from 405 to 202.5 lines. The video field rate would drop from 50 to 25&amp;nbsp;Hz (40 mS). In areas of solid color, flicker would increase. Method 2 would broadcast full, 405-line images. But in this method, frame rate would fall to a mere 12.5 fps (80 mS). Flicker would then be considerable.

In December 1944, the committee delivered its preliminary report. The report called for a system that had "on the order of 1,000 lines" of resolution. The system would optionally be capable of color and 3D displays. The system also be able to run beside the pre-war 405-line system by Marconi and EMI.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=381}}

Baird was called to a 29 February 1944 meeting of [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]] (C&amp;W) to discuss the formation of a color television studio. After some discussion, C&amp;W chairman [[Edward Wilshaw]] noted that there was an agreement in place that precluded [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] from entering the market until 1949, which would place them at a significant disadvantage compared to other companies. He suggested that the matter be deferred, as any immediate changes would produce friction between C&amp;W, the [[General Post Office]] and the BBC. The matter was dropped, and it would not be until the [[Television Act 1954]] that the possibility was again considered.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=383}}

== Telechrome ends ==

From 1944 Baird was suffering from increasingly poor health, and late that year he suffered an attack of fever that left him almost invalid. Nevertheless, he formed a new company, John Logie Baird Ltd., with offices and labs in a downtown London house. Baird visited the lab less and less frequently over time, and his wife noticed why in a November 1945 visit when he was seen to have to stop and pant after climbing every stair of the building's four stories.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=386}} He caught a cold over Christmas 1945, and suffered a stroke in February 1946. He was ordered bedridden but refused to stay there, and continued to deteriorate until his death on 14 June.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=388}}

Telechrome died with Baird, but the company by this time had introduced its first truly successful product. This combined a {{convert|27|inch}} black and white television, a radio receiver and a record-changing [[record player]] in a single large cabinet. The company was purchased in 1948 and switched hands several times, eventually being used as a brand name by [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] for a time.{{sfn|Burns|2000|p=388}}

==Telechrome and Trinitron==
Many years later, former Baird employee Edward Anderson was quoted as saying that they "had the equivalent of the Sony Trinitron tube on the drawing board".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Waddell |title=Seeing by wireless |journal=New Scientist |page=344 |date=11 November 1976 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=AKxYsBuC3jsC&amp;pg=PA344}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used by a number of non-technical authors to suggest that the [[Trinitron]] is in some way technically related to the Telechrome in spite of the two systems having nothing in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=G6vZAAAAMAAJ |journal=Journal of Economic and Social Intelligence |title=Baird |date=1992 |quote=All modern T.V. receivers can be traced directly back to the TELECHROME of August 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hawes |first=James |title=Did J.L.

A '''timber slide''' is a device for moving [[timber]] past [[rapids]] and [[waterfall]]s.  Their use in [[Canada]] was widespread in the 18th and 19th century [[timber trade]].  At this time, cut timber would be floated down [[river]]s in large [[timber raft]]s from logging camps to ports such as [[Montreal]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].  Rapids and waterfalls would, however, damage the wood and could potentially cause log jams.  Thus at these locations timber slides were constructed.  These were thin water filled [[chute (gravity)|chutes]] that would run [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the river.  They would usually only be wide enough for a single log and one at a time the logs would be directed down it.  The idea is attributed to [[Ruggles Wright]] who introduced the first one in 1829 not far from what is today down-town [[Hull, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timberplus.co.uk/timber-slides/ History of Timber Slides]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the slides could often be up to a kilometre in length. They were most commonly found on the [[Ottawa River]] system.

In some areas the timber slide became a tourist attraction, the most notable being the 1.2&amp;nbsp;km chute bypassing the [[Chaudière Falls]] on the Ottawa River in [[Ottawa]]. Its most notable visitors are the [[Duke of York]], who later became King [[George V]], and his wife, the [[Duchess of York]] [[Mary of Teck]].&lt;ref&gt;http://niche-canada.org/2016/08/15/sliding-down-the-timber-chute-the-1901-royal-tour-of-canada/&lt;/ref&gt;

Timber slides disappeared after the construction of canal networks and the decline of the timber trade. They were almost all out of service by the [[World War I|First World War]].

[[Image:Treen snuff.jpg|thumbnail|Nineteenth century carved walnut treen snuff box]]

'''Treen, '''literally "of a tree" is a generic name for small handmade functional household objects made of [[wood]]. Treen is distinct from [[furniture]], such as [[chair]]s, and [[cabinetry]], as well as [[clock]]s and [[cupboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/690380/treen Treen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/treen treen definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the late 17th-century, when silver, pewter, and ceramics were introduced for tableware, most small household items, boxes and tableware were carved from wood. Today, treen is highly collectable for its beautiful patina and tactile appeal.

Anything from wooden plates and bowls, [[snuff box]]es and needle cases, spoons and stay busks to shoehorns and chopping boards can be classed as treen. Domestic and agricultural wooden [[tool]]s are also usually classed with treen.

Before the advent of cheap metal wares in industrialized societies, and later [[plastic]], wood played a much greater part as the raw material for common objects. [[Wood turning|Turning]] and [[wood carving|carving]] were the key manufacturing techniques. The selection of wood species was important, and close-grained native hardwoods such as [[Buxus|box]], [[beech]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]] were particularly favoured, with occasional use of exotics, such as [[lignum vitae]] for mallet heads.

Wooden objects have survived relatively less well than those of metal or stone, and their study by archaeologists and historians has been somewhat neglected until recently. Their strongly functional and undecorated forms have, however, been highly regarded by designers and collectors.

The scholarly study of treen was greatly advanced by Edward Pinto (1901–1972), who started collecting in his childhood and wrote a definitive book on the subject. In 1965, when [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] purchased his collection, it contained over 7,000 items.

== Burl treen ==
In North America, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] carved [[Burl|tree burls]] into durable wooden objects with uniquely marbled grain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=LeFever|first=Gregory|date=February 2010|title=Early Burl Treen|url=http://www.gregorylefever.com/pdfs/Burl Treen 2.pdf|magazine=Early American Life|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burls were rare in Europe because the [[old-growth forest]]s where they are commonly found had largely been logged out of existence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rXt1R5EoFh4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=%22burl+treen%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mfKUjwj2G6&amp;sig=J2A_Jqgqa-dcEHw8DoMhkzTsgEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif7oDwmJnZAhVMeKwKHa1jA84Q6AEIXTAL#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=North American Burl Treen: Colonial &amp; Native American|last=Powers|first=Steven S.|date=|publisher=Steve Powers|year=2005|isbn=9780976063506|location=|pages=9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burl treen was found in Europe occasionally, particularly in objects intended for celebration or the upper class, but was not in wide-scale use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In contrast, burls were widely available in the virgin forests of North America. Native Americans worked these burls into domestic objects like bowls and ladles with tools such as stone blades, hot coals, and beaver teeth.{{Sfn|LeFever|2010|p=12}} Native Americans traded these wooden items with European colonists, who later learned to harvest burl and carve them into treen in the style of their home countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Burl treen is considered an indigenous North American craft, and examples are found in museums and private collections of [[Americana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The snarled and interlaced grain of a burl makes the resulting objects stronger and less likely to split.{{Sfn|LeFever|2010|p=11}} They were strong enough to be passed down over generations.{{Sfn|LeFever|2010|p=13}}  A variety of trees produce burls, but almost all North American burl treen (upwards of ninety percent) is made from [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]]. Another five percent is made from [[maple]], with other woods such as [[Cherry|cherry wood]], [[white cedar]], [[oak]], and [[birch]] making up the remainder.{{Sfn|LeFever|2010|p=11}} Woodworker Michael Combs has speculated that black ash burl was favored because it is easy to work on a lathe.{{Sfn|LeFever|2010|p=12}}

The '''Ulu Jelai Power Station''' is a hydroelectric power station under construction in the district of Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia. It is one of the entry point projects under the Economic Transformation Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://etp.pemandu.gov.my/30_November_2010-@-Tenaga_Nasional_Infrastructure_Investment.aspx|title=Tenaga Nasional Infrastructure Investment|last=Pemandu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The project is located approximately 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Kuala Lumpur. The nearest town is Ringlet, 40&amp;nbsp;km away. The under-construction station is accessible from route {{JKR|102}} connecting the towns of Ringlet and Sungai Koyan. It is located within Ulu Jelai and Bukit Jerut forest reserves, near Cameron Highlands-Lipis district border.

== About the Power Station ==
The power station has a maximum generating capacity of 372&amp;nbsp;MW. Water from 3 rivers - Sungai Bertam, Sungai Telom and Sungai Lemoi is used for electricity generation. A dam is built to impound Sungai Bertam. Weirs and diversion tunnels are built on Sungai Telom and Sungai Lemoi to divert water into the main reservoir at Sungai Bertam. From the reservoir, water is channeled into a series of tunnels 15&amp;nbsp;km-long to generate electricity before being released back into Sungai Telom.

The underground power cavern houses 2 units of Francis turbines each with a generating capacity of 186&amp;nbsp;MW.

==Construction==
TM-Salini Consortium has been appointed as the main contractor. Construction commenced in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.utusan.com.my/utusan/special.asp?pr=theMessenger&amp;y=2011&amp;dt=0302&amp;pub=theMessenger&amp;sec=Home_News&amp;pg=hn_01.htm|title=Utusan Online - English Version|website=ww2.utusan.com.my|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 88m-high roller compacted concrete (RCC) dam on Sungai Bertam was built after Sungai Bertam has been successfully diverted. The RCC mix is of low cementitious content and aggregates were sourced from a nearby quarry.

All tunnels and underground caverns were excavated using drill and blast method except for the diversion tunnels which utilised a 3m-diameter tunnel boring machine. Lining of tunnels depended upon the rock conditions and water pressure - concrete and steel are used as lining materials. The surge shaft was excavated using the raised boring technique. Unit 1 is expected to be commissioned in December 2015 while Unit 2 in March 2016.

The construction of this project resulted in the relocation of 3 orang Asli villages - Kampung Susu, Kampung Tiat and Kampung Pinang.

The reservoir impounding started on 18 January 2016 and reach the full supply level on 16 May 2016.

Unit 2 was the first unit being commissioned due to some issues with the commissioning of Unit 1. Commercial operation of Unit 2 was at 0000 hours on 15 August 2016.

==Issues==
Sedimentation is a major issue for Sungai Bertam and Sungai Telom due to uncontrolled clearing of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/05/19/Hills-raped-at-an-alarming-rate-Cameron-Highlands-pristine-virgin-jungle-being-cleared-with-impunity/|title=Hills 'raped' at an alarming rate|last=Isabell Lai|date=2013-05-19|publisher=Star Publications (M) Bhd|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A check dam has been constructed upstream of the main reservoir on Sungai Bertam. The check dam is able to reduce the amount of sediment entering the reservoir and prolonging the reservoir life. A desanding system has been constructed at the intake of Sungai Telom for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swisssedtech.com/referenzen/malaysia.htm|title=Malaysia|last=Ag|first=Paul Büetiger|website=www.swisssedtech.com|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''velomobile''', '''velomobiel''', '''velo''', or '''bicycle car''', is a [[human-powered vehicle]] (HPV) enclosed for aerodynamic advantage and protection from weather and collisions.&lt;ref&gt;Frederik Van De Walle. ''[http://users.pandora.be/fietser/fotos/VM4SD-FVDWsm.pdf The Velomobile as a Vehicle for more Sustainable Transportation]'' {{ISSN|1651-0194}}, Retrieved on 23 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to [[recumbent bicycle]]s and [[tricycle]]s, but with a full [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]] (aerodynamic shell).  A fairing may be added to a non-faired cycle, or the fairing may be an integral part of the structure, monocoque like that of an airplane. 

Not to be confused with purpose built for racing or speed records fully fared vehicles with two wheels, generally called [[streamliner]]s. Streamliners have set many speed and distance [http://ihpva.org/hpvarech.htm records]  Though fast in their own right, Velomobiles are consider much more streetable machines.  Using three or more wheels can have advantages for everyday use, including the ability to stop and start unaided, better stability, cross-wind handling, etc.  Though there are arguments made that the multiple track machines (3+ wheels) have aerodynamic disadvantages due to the drag of the extra wheels and the surface contact points.   [https://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard/aero/aerodynamics.htm A good discussion on bicycle wheel aerodynamics is here] In practice though [https://lonniemorse.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/streamliners-and-velomobiles/ Velomobiles continue to be close to their 2 wheel cousins in performance] 

There are few velomobile manufacturers; some are home-built. Some models have the operator's head exposed; this has the advantage of giving the operator unobstructed vision, hearing, and some cooling, with the disadvantage of being potentially more exposed to weather and less aerodynamic.   Fully enclosed machines can suffer from heat or humidity issues as well as potential noise issues. 

The [http://mccraw.co.uk/milan-velomobile-drivetrain-details/ typical drive train] of a velomobile is not unlike a bicycle or recumbent. It will consist of a front [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_bracket|bottom bracket]] with 1 or more [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankset#Chainring| chainrings]], a rear [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailleur_gears| derailleur]]  Depending on the configuration of the Velomobile there may be any number of idler pulleys, and [http://www.ihpva.org/Projects/tstrike/building/plasticguide.htm chaintubes] along the drive train to manage and protect the chain.   One of the defining characteristics of most velomobiles is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_drivetrain_systems| chain and drivetrain components]] are protected from weather and the road.

Before World War I, Charles Mochet built a small four-wheeled 'bike'-car for his son. Mochet built many models of small vehicles called "[[Velocar]]". Some models had two seats, most were pedal powered, but as the years went by, many were fitted with small engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclegenius.com/history.php The Real History of the Recumbent Bicycle] Retrieved on 26 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mochet Velocars use a thin wood/plywood body on a steel frame.

Some other early velomobiles use a fabric body or "skin" sewn to fit loosely on closely spaced wires or tubes, then painted or "doped" with a liquid that dries and shrinks the fabric to a tight fit on the wire/tube supports.  The approach was used widely on early [[airplanes]], and has the advantage of light weight with relatively low-technology materials.  It is sometimes called "bird cage" construction because the support looks similar to closely spaced wires used in construction of [[bird cage]]s, and because the wire/tube support outline shows through once the fabric is tight.  Some disadvantages of this approach are the cost of construction, due to the many interconnected supports; and that the shape is that of many flat panels, which limits smoothness of the skin and thus limits the aerodynamics.

In the 1970s, the [[People Powered Vehicle]] was produced. It was a two-seat, "sociable" tandem with a steel sub frame and molded plastic body. It was well designed and weighed something over {{convert|50|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}; a recently restored version weighs {{convert|59|kg|lbs|abbr=on|disp=or}}.  However, it had flaws in the execution that doomed it as a practical, everyday vehicle. Positive features, such as easily adjustable and comfortable seats, independent pedalling for both passenger and driver, adequate cargo space and relatively good weather protection, could not overcome the negative features, such as a complex, heavy and badly spaced three-speed gear box, ineffective brakes, and pedals that slid on sleeve bearings on steel shafts, which made it difficult to use as an everyday vehicle.

In [[Sweden]], a two-seat design called [[Fantom]] was sold as blueprints and became very popular; over 100,000 copies of the blueprints were sold, but few were actually completed.  The downfall of these early 'bicycle' cars came when the economy improved and people chose motorised transport.

==Modern/contemporary velomobiles==
Builders continued to make "one-off" velomobiles, but for a time none were available commercially.  In the 1970s, [[Carl-Georg Rasmussen]]
rediscovered ''Fantomen''; he redesigned it and in 1983 started selling a production version called [[Leitra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fyens.dk/indland/Ufo-med-pedalmotor/artikel/1323680|title=Ufo med pedalmotor|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leitra velomobiles have been in continuous production since then (as of 2017), with current models evolved/improved from the originals.

There are many ways to build a velomobile.  One modern design is "body-on-frame", in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body.  A standard cycle may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with special fittings to mount the body; the use of special fittings tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight.  Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it does not need to be self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames.  Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used.  However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.

Another modern design is the [[:de:Alleweder|Alleweder]], using aluminum sheet formed and riveted to make the fairing and the structure in one piece.  This approach is sometimes called [[monocoque]] or "unit" construction; it was used in airplanes before 1920 and has been used commonly in automobiles since the 1970s.  Labor costs to build an Alleweder are significant due to the many rivets and rivet holes.  Also, the choices of aerodynamic shapes are limited by the formability of the aluminum sheet.  That said, aluminum is relatively inexpensive, and as of 2017 Alleweders can be often be bought for less than other designs; they can also be bought as kits, to reduce out-of-pocket cost.  Aluminum can also be repaired relatively easily, and aluminum, which is homogeneous, can be recycled more easily than many composite materials.

Another common modern design is a monocoque shell, often made of [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] or "FRP", plus sub-frames of welded aluminum tubes.  FRP can be used to produce a wide range of shapes, and thus can improve aerodynamics over approaches such as "birdcage" and aluminum-sheet monocoque.  FRP can also use fibers with high strength-to-weight ratio that in velomobiles can save several kilograms compared to other designs.  A wide range of fibers may be used, but those which reduce weight while retaining strength and toughness often increase the price significantly—e.g., a premium of 1000 Euros to save 3&amp;nbsp;kg.  In addition, it is often hard to segregate and recycle the FRP materials.  But despite the cost and other issues, the aerodynamic and weight advantages mean that (as of 2017) monocoque FRP is a common way to build velomobiles.

As of 2017, most velomobiles are tricycles with two front wheels.  A tricycle has the advantage over a bicycle that it does not fall over when stopped.  In addition, when a cross-wind hits a fairing, it makes a big force; faired tricycles are less likely to get blown over than faired bicycles.  Although three wheels have practical advantages, they also have more aerodynamic drag than two wheels, so land speed record cycles are often bicycles.  Although four wheels were used as far back as the Velocar, they are not today common.  As of 2017, there is at least one 4-wheel production model, the [[QuattroVelo]].  Four wheels tends to further hurt aerodynamics and weight compared to three; but for a given width, four wheels is much more laterally stable than three wheels.  Also, four wheels can be placed in a way that increases luggage capacity a lot compared to three-wheel designs.

Most velomobiles drive the rear wheel(s).  This approach is simple and can often use many standard bicycle parts.  Velomobiles with two rear wheels may drive just one wheel, or may drive both.  Driving a single wheel is the simplest and lightest approach.  Driving both wheels can improve traction but also increases complexity, cost, and weight.  A solid axle may be used, but increases friction/drag in corners and thus can slow down the vehicle.  One alternative is a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], which is the approach used in most cars.  A second alternative is to use a pair of ratchets, where the slower wheel is driven and the faster wheel coasts.  Rear drive often uses "idler" pulleys to route the chain; front-wheel drive can eliminate idlers, so offers less friction and also less weight.  It can also increase luggage capacity.  However, front drive with two front wheels uses some non-standard components, and as of 2017 is used only rarely.

As with other cycles, a velomobile may use suspension.  Suspension tends to improve rider comfort, and can also improve speed—it takes energy to "bounce" the velomobile and rider, so a suspension can reduce the energy lost to bouncing.  However, suspension adds cost, weight, and maintenance.  Common velomobile designs include no suspension, front-only suspension, and front+rear suspension.

As of 2017, there are several commercial makers of velomobiles.  At the same time, there are still many "one-off" makers.  Individual designs (both one-off and production) emphasize specific features.  For example, some  emphasize aerodynamics and light weight to improve average speed, even if cost, ease of entry/exit, comfort, and other "practical vehicle" attributes are reduced.  By analogy, many automobile makers make performance cars with limited seating and cargo and worse emissions and fuel economy.  In contrast, other velomobile designs sacrifice performance features in order to improve cost, entry/exit, comfort, carrying capacity, and so on.  By analogy, many automobile makers offer cargo vans.  As of 2017, individual makers sometimes offer models spanning a range of features—for example, there are Milan models used in racing but also a Milan "cargo" model with enough luggage volume to carry a (not-pedaling) human passenger and other bulky items.

All current (2017) velomobiles are produced in low volume, with "big" makers producing one or a few velomobiles per week.  Velomobiles use some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles, and thus made in low volume.  The use of "more parts" (e.g., 3 wheels instead of 2) and "more low-volume" parts makes velomobiles more expensive.  The only attempt at a mass-produced velomobile, which was in the mid-1980s, flopped.  This was the [[Sinclair C5]].  The C5 was a delta trike (one front, two rear wheels) with electric assist designed to be mass-produced and sold for a low price.  The C5 was poorly designed; it was heavy, had only one gear and had no adjustment for the distance between the pedals and the seat, which is important to get a comfortable pedalling position.

A concept and a potential assessment concerning low-cost velomobiles for daily short trips as well as strategies for reaching a critical lot size for mass production was the subject of a research project called RegInnoMobil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buschbacher.at/reginnomobilen.html Research project "RegInnoMobil" about low-cost velomobiles for short daily trips] Retrieved on 19 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Velomobiles have also been used in [[Australian HPV Super Series]] since 1985, and more recently, other events in Australia like the [[RACV Energy Breakthrough]], the [[Technology Challenge Maryborough|Fraser Coast Technology Challenge]], and the [[Victorian HPV Series]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Comparison to other cycle types ==
The velomobile fairing adds weight compared to standard upright cycles or unfaired recumbent cycles.  For a given terrain, the added weight demands lower gearing and makes the velomobile slower climbing hills than its unfaired counterpart.

Some velomobile fairings are mainly for weather protection.  However, if the velomobile fairing is substantially streamlined, then improved aerodynamics means the speeds on flats and down hills may be substantially higher than its unfaired counterpart, and often enough faster to make up for the slower climbing due to weight.

An aerodynamic fairing must be well-shaped, but minimizing the [[frontal area]] of the velomobile is also important to reduced drag: a fairing with half the frontal area may approach half the air drag.  In turn, aerodynamic velomobiles use a laid-back or [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbent]] riding position, with the rider's head much lower than on regular bicycles.  In turn, velomobile is much easier to accidentally "hide" behind a car or road-side shrubbery, fences, etc.

Velomobile bodies are typically light enough that the center of mass is similar to the center of mass on an unfaired recumbent cycle.  This makes cornering stability similar to similar unfaired cycles.  However, minimizing velomobile width also contributes to reduced frontal area and thus drag; so there is an additional incentive to make the velomobile narrow.  The narrowest velomobiles are only slightly wider than the rider's shoulders, and so the width approaches that of an upright bicycle.  However, an upright bicycle still has a significantly narrower "useful" width, as the road contact is in the center and so the rider's hands/elbows/etc. might overhang the edge of the roadway or path without causing problems.  In contrast, the wheel track of a velomobile is very nearly as wide as the vehicle itself, and so cannot overhang the edge.

As of 2017, most velomobiles use a delta tricycle configuration—mainly to reduce component weight and improve wheel aerodynamics.  However, some use a four-wheel or [[quadracycle]] configuration.  The extra wheel significantly improves cornering stability and can also improve luggage capacity.  As of 2017 there are not many four-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings, but there are a few, and some riders report speeds are close to three-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings.

Two-wheel "streamliner" configurations can have much less aerodynamic drag: wheels are hard to make aerodynamic; each wheel entry/exit to the fairing adds drag; and velomobiles with two front wheels are necessarily wider or longer than the rider, while two-wheel streamliners can be barely wider than the rider.  A common way to describe aerodynamic drag is "[[Frontal area|CdA]]"; in one comparison of racing cycles, there were several two-wheel streamliners with less than half the CdA drag of the best three-wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPVlog/VehicleDrags.html|title=Vehicle Drags|author=Greg Kolodziejzyk|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Air drag is most significant for high-speed events; as of 2016, the world record for a 200-metre sprint on near-level ground is about 145&amp;nbsp;km/h for a two-wheel streamliner and about 120&amp;nbsp;km/h for any vehicle with more than two wheels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihpva.org/hpvarecl.htm|title=IHPVA Official Speed Records|publisher=International Human Powered Vehicle Association|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the two-wheel vehicle was about 20% faster.  Aerodynamic power is roughly cubic in speed, so at lower speeds the difference is much less pronounced.  At the same time, two-wheel streamliners require a way to stay upright when stopped and at very low speed, and are more sensitive to blowing over in cross-winds.  These factors limit the use of streamliners, despite their aerodynamic advantage.

The fairing on a velomobile sometimes makes it more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle.  The effect of cross-winds is complicated because the force of the wind can act as a steering force, as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle.  "Wind steer" can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line.  Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall.  For example, it is common for [[Time trial bicycle|time-trial bicycle]]s to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind.  Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design.  For example, a longer "tail" on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on the steered wheels and so an improve stability in side winds.  A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more [[Skin friction drag|skin drag]]), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.

Velomobiles with fairings that are mainly for weather protection can use a more upright seating position.  This tends to improve both the ability to see and be seen.  However, to retain stability against tipping (both cornering and cross-winds), the wheel track needs to be wider than a comparable velomobile with a low seating position.  In turn, this may make the velomobile quite a bit wider than a conventional cycle.

"Weather" protection includes cold and wet, but also shading from sun.  Since the rider is doing work, it is typically desirable to have at least some cooling.  Many velomobiles have vents and ducts which allow cooling while keeping out water; and the ducts/vents may be closed or covered in cold weather so the rider can stay comfortable even without a secondary heat source.  In warm and hot weather, the fairing provides sun protection, but blocks the rider from cooling air, and so may be much warmer for a given level of effort.  In some situations, a rider's power output (for any type of cycle) is limited by body temperature, and the worse cooling of a velomobile can limit the rider's power output more than on an unfaired cycle.  With an aerodynamic fairing, the velomobile rider at reduced power output may still be faster than an unfaired cycle, due to the lower aerodynamic drag.

Velomobiles for cargo use often have heavy frames to carry load, plus the weight of the cargo itself.  In turn, the weight of the fairing may be relatively less important.  Also, bulky loads often have poor aerodynamics, and so the quality of aerodynamics of the fairing is less important.  This may enable use of a fairing which in hot weather can be converted to a canopy.  A canopy provides no aerodynamic benefits, but improves cooling compared to a faired configuration, while also reducing sun exposure compared to riding without a canopy.  Thus, a "high speed" velomobile may benefit most from better aerodynamics, even when aerodynamics hurts rider cooling; while at the same time a "high load" velomobile may benefit most from improved cooling (to maximize power output) even if that hurts aerodynamics.

The steered wheels on a velomobile will hit the fairing if steered sharply enough.  Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for aerodynamics and width.  Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse [[turning circle]] than an equivalent unfaired cycle.  In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle.  Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, but it is hard to build a stable vehicle using only [[Steering#Rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]].  The [[Velayo]] uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it was produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles [[Four-wheel steering|steered all wheels]]; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels.  However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.

A velomobile's fairing shields the drivetrain from weather, as well as the rider.  Drivetrain maintenance is often reduced compared to other cycles, especially unfaired bicycles, where the front wheel kicks up grit-containing dust, mud, and dirty water that lands directly on the chain and increases the rate of abrasive wear on the drivetrain—including chain and sprockets, but sometimes also derailleurs.  The fairing of a velomobile tends to limit both the amount and the kinds of grit landing on the drivetrain.  Some cycles use tooth-belt drive, which is less affected by grit, is quieter than a chain, and may be lighter.  However, belts are only available in pre-selected sizes.  Many recumbent cycles, including most velomobiles, have a long drivetrain for which no suitable tooth belts are available.

Velomobiles are significantly bulkier than conventional cycles.  Further, the bodywork typically cannot be disassembled much, whereas conventional cycles often can be disassembled to fit in a box or bag of dimensions similar to the frame.  In turn, this makes velomobiles more difficult to transport.

Velomobiles are often built using some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles or even specific to a particular make or model.  In addition, the bodywork is large and may be around half the weight of a velomobile.  Thus, to reduce weight, the body is often made of lighter but more expensive materials.  Also, production volumes are low, so for both parts and labor there are not benefits of mass production—as of 2017, many velomobile makers have yearly production on the order of tens or maybe a few hundred velomobiles.  Taken together, these factors mean velomobiles are often much more expensive than other cycle types.

As an example of prices and price/weight tradeoffs, as of April 2017 the maker Trisled offers their "Rotovelo" model either with a [[Rotational molding|rotational molded]] plastic fairing or with a carbon fiber fairing (as well as some other weight-saving changes).  The body shapes and underlying framework are similar; the rotational-molded version weighs 33 kilograms and has a list price of Au$6500,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trisled Rotovelo|url=http://trisled.com.au/hpv/rotovelo-2|publisher=Trisled|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the carbon fiber version weighs 20 kilograms and has a list price of Au$10900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trisled Rotovelo Carbon|url=http://trisled.com.au/hpv/rotovelo-carbon|publisher=Trisled|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the cycle-related infrastructure design is based on the typical configuration of an upright bicycle.  For example, multi-modal transportation such as bike/train/bike routes often use bicycle racks in the train, and the dimensions of racks and also the train ingress/egress assume a conventional cycle.  Similarly, cycle paths often have bollards or S-bend paths to prevent motor vehicle entry, and the entry is often spaced for upright bicycles, but may be too narrow or require too sharp of a turn to allow through some velomobiles.

== Electric assisted velomobiles ==
{{Anchor|Hybrid velomobile}}
Some velomobiles have been converted to provide electric assist. Electric assist means that a small battery-operated electric-propulsion system is provided to assist the driver's leg muscle effort. Most electric-assist propulsion motors are of the in-wheel design in the rear wheel, such as geared hub motors (like eZee, Heinzmann, Bafang, BMC, etc.) and direct-drive hub motors (like Crystalyte, BionX, 9Continent, etc.) but mid-drive units (like Sunstar, Cyclone, Ecospeed, etc.) are used as well due to design constraints in velomobile models with one-sided rear wheel mounting like the Quest, Strada and Mango or front wheel drive in the Velayo, or better efficiency by using the multiple speeds of the chain drive or internal geared hubs (e.g. Rohloff 14 speed hub).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

While an electric-assist unit does add extra weight to the velomobile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velorizontal.bbfr.net/t17956-leiba-x-stream-electric-iut-aisne|title=velomobile electric leiba X stream  (IUT Aisne)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is somewhat offset by the flexibility it also provides, especially during hill climbs and stop-and-go traffic. Due to vastly better aerodynamics of velomobiles the range of a similar electric assist unit and similar battery in a velomobile can be about 50% to 100% higher compared to upright bicycles or unfaired recumbents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In events like the [[RACV Energy Breakthrough]] and the [[Technology Challenge Maryborough|Fraser Coast Technology Challenge]], there are entire categories dedicated to electric and other hybrid powered velomobiles.

The legal definition of "bicycle" often includes velomobiles, but [[Electric bicycle laws|laws covering cycles with electric assist]] vary widely across countries and often within a country and even between cities in a region.  For example, a specific vehicle may be a "bicycle" in one area, a "low-speed pedal-assisted cycle" in another area, and a "moped" in yet a third.  Similarly, going from 3 wheels to 4 wheels can change the category of an otherwise identical vehicle.  One reason for the varying treatment is that many laws are older than widespread use of power-assisted velomobiles and so the laws were not written to consider such vehicles.  In some areas, laws are being rewritten to include power-assist velomobiles and to harmonize treatment with nearby laws.

==DIY (do it yourself) velomobiles==
With a growing [[DIY]]-community{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly "[[green energy]]", some [[hobby]]ists have endeavored to build their own velomobiles from kits, sourced components, or from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelwolf.com/essn/ESSN-Mar2005.pdf |title=ESSN-Mar2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to similar sized commercial velomobiles, the DIY velomobiles tend to be less expensive.

Probably the most built velomobile kits are the various models of the [[:de:Alleweder|Alleweder]] made from prefabricated aluminium sheet metal due to its affordable price. Some velomobile manufacturers offer their models as kits for self-assembly (Räderwerk Milan Mk2 + Milan SL, Beyss Go-One Evo K + Go-One Evo Ks, [http://www.alligt.nl/bodies/alleweder-a9.html Alleweder A9/Sunrider Mk2] for instance) at reduced price.

==Velomobile and recumbent Internet communities==
Many amateur velomobile builders are also recumbent bike riders.  In more recent years many online velomobile groups, some of them focusing on specific regions, have appeared, on Facebook and on other platforms.  Engaging actively in those communities is probably the best way to get informed and eventually own a velomobile.

The '''Zerotracer''' is a purpose built [[Electric vehicle]] for the [[Zero Emissions Race]] which went around the world in 2010/11. The vehicle seats two in a closed cabin, while its driving characteristics are more similar to a motorbike. The race started under [[UNEP]] patronage on 16 August 2010 in front of the [[Palace of Nations]] at [[Geneva]] where it ended on 24 February 2011 completing 80 days of travel - inspired obviously by Jules Verne's [[Around the World in Eighty Days|novel]]. 
Of the only three vehicles completing the race, Zerotracer accumulated the highest score of points to win.&lt;ref name="www.dailygreen.de_Zerotracer"&gt;Oliver Karthaus: [http://www.dailygreen.de/2011/02/25/in-80-tagen-um-die-welt-schweizer-gewinnen-zero-emission-race-14609.html ''In 80 Tagen um die Welt: Schweizer gewinnen Zero Emission Race''] DailyGreen-Internetportal, 25. Februar 2011 (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zero Emission Race Route==
Geneva - Bruxelles - Berlin - Kiev - Moscow - Chelyabinsk - Almaty - Ürümqi - Shanghai - Vancouver - US West Coast - Cancún [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] - Casablanca - Geneva.

== Performance and development ==
Zerotracer covered the through route from Geneva to Shanghai without a break caused by a technical problem.  
This is due to its fully developed concept deriving from the ''Monotracer'', a very similar concept using a petrol engine. Manufacturer Designwerk&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.design-werk.ch/design-werk/about.html Homepage of developer Designwerk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023221730/http://www.design-werk.ch/design-werk/about.html |date=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluates the production of the vehicle.
