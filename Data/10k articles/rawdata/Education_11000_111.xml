'''Alfred Irving''' "'''Pete'''" '''Hallowell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|l|ə|w|ɛ|l}}; 1892&amp;ndash;1974) was an American [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and businessman.  He was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and attended the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] receiving his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in 1914, his [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] in 1920, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in anthropology in 1924.  He was a student of the anthropologist [[Frank Speck]].  From 1927 through 1963 he was a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania excepting 1944 through 1947 when he taught the subject at [[Northwestern University]].  Hallowell's main field of study was [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  He also held the presidency of the [[American Anthropological Association]] for a period.

His students included the anthropologists [[Melford Spiro]], [[Anthony F. C. Wallace]], [[Raymond D. Fogelson]], [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], [[Regna Darnell]], [[James W. VanStone]] and [[Marie-Françoise Guédon]].

After his retirement, his position was filled by the linguistic anthropologist [[Dell Hymes]].

'''Bonnie Gold''' (born 1948){{r|born}} is an American mathematician, [[mathematical logic|mathematical logician]], [[philosophy of mathematics|philosopher of mathematics]], and [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]]. She is a professor emerita of mathematics at [[Monmouth University]].{{r|monmouth}}

Gold completed her Ph.D. in 1976 at [[Cornell University]], under the supervision of [[Michael D. Morley]]. The research from her dissertation, ''Compact and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-compact formulas in &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_{1},\omega}&lt;/math&gt;'',{{r|mgp}}
was later published in the journal ''Archiv für Mathematische Logik und Grundlagenforschung'', and concerned [[infinitary logic]].{{r|nebres}}
She was the chair of the mathematics department at [[Wabash College]] before moving to Monmouth, where she also became department chair.{{r|prestigious}}

In 2012, Gold became the winner of the 22nd [[Louise Hay Award]] of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] for her contributions to mathematics education. The award citation noted her work in [[educational assessment]] for undergraduate study in mathematics, which culminated in the publication of an edited volume, ''Assessment Practices in Undergraduate Mathematics''.{{r|hay}} This book, co-edited with Sandra Z. Keith and William A. Marion, was published by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA) in 1999.{{r|lesser}}

With Roger A. Simons, Gold is also the editor of another book, ''Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy'' (MAA, 2008).{{r|pod}} Her essay "How your philosophy of mathematics impacts your teaching" was selected for inclusion in ''The Best Writing on Mathematics 2012''. In it, she argues that the philosophy of mathematics affects the teaching of mathematics even when the teacher's philosophical principles are implicit and unexamined.{{r|best}}

'''Briarcliff Farms''' was a farm established in 1890 by [[Walter William Law]] in [[Briarcliff Manor]], a village in [[Westchester County, New York]]. One of several enterprises established by Law at the turn of the 20th century, the farm was known for its milk, butter, and cream and also produced other dairy products, [[American Beauty rose]]s, bottled water, and print media. At its height, the farm was one of the largest dairy operations in the [[Northeastern United States]], operating about {{convert|8000|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1}} with over 1,000 [[Jersey cattle]]. In 1907, the farm moved to [[Pine Plains (town), New York|Pine Plains]] in New York's [[Dutchess County]], and it was purchased by New York banker [[Oakleigh Thorne]] in 1918, who developed it into an [[Angus cattle]] farm. After Thorne's death in 1948, the farm changed hands several times; in 1968 it became Stockbriar Farm, a beef feeding operation. Stockbriar sold the farmland to its current owners in 1979.

The farm combined a practical American business model with the concept of a European country seat or [[manor]], with cows being milked constantly, and with milk promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes, and shipped to stores in New York City each night. The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of [[tenant farming]], established working blacksmith, [[wheelwright]], and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's [[manor house]], and constructed numerous buildings in the [[Tudor Revival]] architectural style.

Briarcliff Farms was the original location for the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, established by the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture in conjunction with Walter Law. The school's purpose was to teach students in farming, gardening, poultry-keeping, and other agriculture-related skills. The school moved to a farm near [[Poughkeepsie]] in 1903, and the school building was run as a hotel for two years until it became Miss Knox's School. After the building burned down in 1912, Miss Knox's School was relocated several times; since 1954, the Knox School has been located in [[St. James, New York]].

==History==
[[File:Stillman Farm in Briarcliff Manor.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of a farm and farmhouse buildings|Illustration of James Stillman's Briarcliff Farm around 1886]]
James Stillman owned a small farm on Pleasantville Road since at least 1886.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|pages=9, 12}} It was known as Briarcliff Farm after John David Ogilby's estate, Brier Cliff (itself named after Ogilby's family home in Ireland).&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|pages=21, 31}}&lt;ref name="ButterTests"/&gt; In 1887 Stillman had a display at the Great Dairy and Cattle Show in New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]], where he demonstrated setting milk, churning cream and making butter.&lt;ref name="StillmanMSG"/&gt; In 1890, Walter Law began purchasing property in the present-day village of Briarcliff Manor as part of his desire for rest and recreation.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; That year, Law paid James Stillman $35,000 (${{inflation|US|35000|1890|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) for his {{convert|236|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm and renamed it Briarcliff Farms.&lt;ref name="1939history"/&gt; In 1893, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the [[Cristobal Colón y de La Cerda, 14th Duke of Veragua|14th Duke of Veragua]] (a [[livestock]] farmer) and a large party visited the farm on the afternoon of June 16; at that time, the farm had about 330 cattle and 100 sheep. The party went from New York to [[Scarborough, New York|Scarborough]], proceeding by carriage to Briarcliff, and visited the farm's poultry yard, hennery and stables. After observing the farm's heifers and stallions, they went to the creamery to taste Briarcliff butter. The guests went to Law's Yonkers home, Hillcrest, for dinner before returning to New York. After the visit, the duke had said "Well, this is a perfect place. I am delighted with what I have seen."&lt;ref name="Duke"/&gt;
[[File:WalterWLaw1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=An old man with white hair and sideburns wearing a suit|[[Walter W. Law|Walter Law]], founder of Briarcliff Farms and Manor]]
In 1898 Law retired from the vice-presidency of [[W. &amp; J. Sloane]], moved with his family to the area and began devoting his time to agriculture.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=35}} He rapidly added to his holdings, buying about forty parcels in less than ten years; by 1900, Law owned more than {{convert|5000|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1}} of Westchester County&lt;ref name="glassglory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="society"/&gt; and was its largest individual landholder.&lt;ref name="Holdings"/&gt; Some previous owners became [[tenant farmer]]s; Law received half of the hay and straw from a {{convert|160|acre|ha|sigfig=1|adj=on}} farm formerly owned by Jesse Bishop, and one-third of everything else.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=35}} Law and Briarcliff Farms initially deepened the [[Pocantico River]] for {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}}, taking out [[Ford (crossing)|rifts]] so the stream would flow and adjacent swamps would drain. Workers also cut rock and took out trees lining the swamps to reclaim land for farming.&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt;

Law found the soil poor, since it had been farmed for a half-century. The fields were bare, and cows gave poor-quality milk: "I had to begin at the bottom and repair the waste of fifty years." He improved the soil's fertility by arranging for manure from New York City streets and stables to be regularly brought to his farm; for four years, twenty carloads of manure a week were spread on the land. As a result, the farm's hay yield increased from two to five tons. Law also decided to improve the area's roads, giving them a base layer of large, closely packed stones and layers of top gravel. He developed his herd; at first the farm had weak cattle (many afflicted with [[tuberculosis]]) and "ordinary milk", but after Law's development the farm had strong cattle, healthy calves and an abundance of rich milk. Law hired Leonard Pearson (a professor of [[veterinary medicine]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]])&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; to check each cow every six months for tuberculosis&lt;ref name="Nurses"/&gt;{{rp|page=102}} and other diseases, exceeding [[New York City Board of Health]] standards.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt;

Although Law had little knowledge or experience of farming at first, he had enough money to reach his goal of maximizing his dairy farm's quality and output.&lt;ref name="RiverJournal"/&gt; Law's farm had 500 workers tending cattle, pigs, chickens, [[Thoroughbred]] horses, pheasants, peacocks and sheep at its peak.&lt;ref name="OssHist"/&gt; In 1900, when the US government asked Briarcliff Farms to exhibit its milk, butter and cream at Paris' [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]],&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=23}}&lt;ref name="Co-operative"/&gt; the farm submitted [[raw milk|raw]], pasteurized, and sterilized milk; however, according to the French, "There is no use sending these, for your fresh milk keeps fresh".&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt; The farm contributed to the [[USDA]] [[Bureau of Animal Industry]] and the New York State Commission to the Paris Exhibition's joint exhibit,&lt;ref name="ParisExpo1"/&gt; winning gold medals for its milk, cream, and butter&lt;ref name="ParisExpo2"/&gt; and a silver medal for social benefit or economy.&lt;ref name="Social4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silver"/&gt; Concerned that the farm's milk had preservatives, French authorities requested an [[affidavit]] that no chemicals were added.&lt;ref name="Co-operative"/&gt; Photographs by the US government of Briarcliff Farms' barns, farmland, Law's mottoes and employees were displayed&lt;ref name="Conservative"/&gt; in the exposition's Palace of Social Economy and Congress.&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt;

On September 2, 1901, the farm's dairy buildings were destroyed by fire. The cause of the fire (which was discovered in the dairy building's tower) was unknown, and the damage was covered by insurance. Law quickly arranged for a temporary dairy in a room of the electric plant which had a boiler for sterilization; by the afternoon, milk was processed as usual. A larger dairy building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping.&lt;ref name="Social3"/&gt;

When Briarcliff Manor was incorporated on November 21, 1902, Law owned all but two small parcels of the square-mile village and employed nearly all of its residents (around 100).&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=19}} He developed the village, establishing schools, churches, parks and the Briarcliff Lodge. The population grew, encouraging Law to incorporate the area as a village. A proposition was presented to the supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8, 1902 that a {{convert|640|acre|ha|adj=on}} area with a population of 331 be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor,&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=14}} and it was incorporated on November 21.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=43}}&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; That year Law's son, [[Walter W. Law, Jr.|Walter Jr.]], joined his father and brother Henry in managing the farm and realty company; he was the second village president,&lt;ref name="Walter Jr"/&gt; in office from 1905 to 1918.&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=15}}{{refn|group=nb|The title changed to President-Mayor during Henry Law's office (1918-36) and subsequently to Mayor around 1936.&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=15}}}}

In April 1906, [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Albert Grey]] and US Representative and farm architect [[Edward Burnett]] drove up from New York City and toured the farm as guests of Walter Law. According to ''Briarcliff Outlook'', they "expressed hearty approval of Briarcliff ways".&lt;ref name="OutlookAp1906"/&gt;{{rp|page=358}} &lt;!--In November 1906, one of Briarcliff Farms' stores in New York City filled a large order of milk and cream for the battleship [[USS Louisiana (BB-19)|USS ''Louisiana'']] for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s trip to the Panama Canal site.&lt;ref&gt;Briarcliff Once-A-Week, October 14, 1906, p34 https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066586292&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Relocation to Pine Plains===
[[File:Briarcliff Farms, Pine Plains.jpg|thumb|alt=A large barn and silos|Barn A in Pine Plains around 1910]]
Law developed his Briarcliff Manor property primarily as a corporation until 1907 when, due to rising property values and falling agricultural development in Westchester County, he purchased twelve farms—totaling {{convert|3249|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1}}—for Briarcliff Farms on both sides of the Pine Plains-Stanford Road (present-day [[New York State Route 82]]) in [[Pine Plains (town), New York|Pine Plains]]&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt; and began developing his Briarcliff Manor properties for houses, churches and schools. Law's general manager, George W. Tuttle (who had worked at Briarcliff Farms since 1901),&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt; arranged the Pine Plains purchases and the construction of new barns, a creamery, a [[power station]] and other buildings.&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt; The barns used [[Franklin Hiram King]]'s King ventilation system, and the concrete dairy building cost about $25,000 (${{Inflation|US|25000|1909|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). The farm's well, {{convert|700|ft}} from the barn, was {{convert|26|ft}} deep and {{convert|15|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt;

In 1907 and 1908, the farm and many of its workers moved to Pine Plains. Although preliminary steps in the relocation were primarily small, the final October 1908 transfer used two trains to move 300 cattle. The rest of the cattle were transferred a day later, to the farm's main station (between Pine Plains and [[Attlebury]] on the Central New England Railway)&lt;ref name="CNEstop"/&gt; at Barn A.&lt;ref name="OutlookOc1908"/&gt;{{rp|page=22}} During Briarcliff Manor's [[Briarcliff Manor, New York#Sports|first automobile race]] in 1908, the barns were used for mechanic crews and each driver had his own crew weeks before the race.&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=12}} In 1909 Law formed the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Manor property. He sold the Pine Plains property in 1918&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt; and died in 1924.&lt;ref name="LawDeath"/&gt;

&lt;!--On April 27, 1913, at the former farm location in Briarcliff Manor, the old Barn A was destroyed in a large fire.{{refn|The barn was at the north end of Dalmeny Road, where St. Theresa's school is today, behind the farms office.}} The barn was next-door to Briarcliff's fire company headquarters, which was previously a blacksmith shop. The fire company's steam-operated pumper could not create enough pressure quickly enough to stop the fire, although the barn took enough time to burn to allow people to carry out much of its contents, including its thirty horses and most of its carriages.Pages 5 and Unknown, BMFD 2001 book--&gt;
On October 9, 1918,&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; New York banker [[Oakleigh Thorne]]&lt;ref name="S&amp;S"/&gt; and several partners purchased the {{convert|4200|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1|adj=on}} Briarcliff Farms property, cattle and dairy buildings&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=37}} for $500,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|500000|1918}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name="ThorneNYT"/&gt; Thorne began breeding [[Aberdeen Angus]] cattle under the Briarcliff Farms name, and the farm remained well known for its beef.&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taconic"/&gt; Thorne and W. Alan McGregor began the herd by importing cattle from Scotland in 1925, and enlarged it through breeding. The Aberdeen Angus industry became prominent in the United States due to Briarcliff Farms;&lt;ref name="1982NewsP3"/&gt; in 1955, about 95 percent of US Angus cattle were from Briarcliff stock.&lt;ref name="95Angus"/&gt;

Thorne hired William Harper Pew for Pew's knowledge of livestock bloodlines. At the time, the farm had over {{convert|5000|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1}} and 1,000 purebred Aberdeen Angus cattle (the largest Aberdeen Angus herd in the country). Pew began eighteen Angus herds in [[Dutchess County]], and was a director of the [[American Angus Association]].&lt;ref name="Pew"/&gt; At the International Livestock Show in 1927, the farm had the International Grand Champion Female, and in 1930 it had the 1930 International Grand Champion Bull. Because of the 1931 and 1933 expositions, Thorne became first to win a grand champion twice, with two of his livestock awarded International Grand Champion [[Cattle#Terminology|Steers]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;amp;S"/&gt; At the 1934 [[Dutchess County Fair]]'s beef-cattle show, 100 cattle and steers were exhibited. Briarcliff Aristocrat, a summer yearling weighing {{convert|1000|lb}}, was named the grand champion steer. The grand champion bull was the farm's Briarcliff Barbarian 8th, the first-prize senior yearling of the 1933 International Livestock Show. The grand champion female was Briarcliff Mighonne 10th, the first-prize senior yearling heifer of the 1933 international show.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DutchessFair"/&gt;

The farm affected a number of herds, and the Briarcliff prefix is still seen in many pedigrees.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; In 1935 the {{convert|2000|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1|adj=on}} portion of the farm east of the road was sold to Henry Jackson, who named it Bethel Farms. After Thorne's death in 1948, Briarcliff Farms changed hands a number of times. In 1968 it became Stockbriar Farm, a beef-feeding operation.&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt; Stockbriar tried to sell the farm several times, and it nearly became a county zoo.&lt;ref name="1982NewsP3"/&gt; In 1979, Stockbriar sold the farmland to the Conservation and Preservation Association (CAPA) for $2.1 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2100000|1979}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name="1982News"/&gt;

In 1982 CAPA hired a [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] realtor, who advertised the farm for $2.75&amp;nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2750000|1982}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in ''The New York Times'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and newspapers published by Taconic Press.&lt;ref name="1982News"/&gt; Around that time Stockbriar Farms filed four lawsuits against CAPA and its lessee (Mashomack Fish and Game Preserve) over the Pine Plains farm, claiming that the preserve operated a private club without a liquor permit and CAPA missed a March 23, 1982 payment which was the bulk of its total payment for the farm.&lt;ref name="1983News"/&gt; Stockbriar Farms requested that Mashomack be evicted, and its property returned.&lt;ref name="1982News"/&gt; One lawsuit was filed in county court, and the other three were filed in [[New York Supreme Court]]. Although Mashomack and CAPA won the first two,&lt;ref name="1982NewsP3"/&gt; in 1984 a state supreme court justice ordered Mashomack and CAPA to vacate the property and Stockbriar Farms remained for sale.&lt;ref name="1984News"/&gt;

The farm, overlooking the [[Hudson River]], was established between the Hudson and [[Pocantico River]]s in the hamlet of Whitson's Corners (present-day Briarcliff Manor), {{convert|27|mi|km|sigfig=1}} from [[Manhattan]]. Its location was described in 1901 as "the most healthy, hilly portion of Westchester&amp;nbsp;...where there are neither swamps nor contaminated streams of water".&lt;ref name="Nurses"/&gt;{{rp|page=101}} The original land plot, {{convert|4|mi|m|spell=in}} long and {{convert|3|mi|m|spell=in}} wide, was developed within twelve years.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; In 1901, Briarcliff Farms (including its school farm) encompassed {{convert|6000|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1}} between Pleasantville and Old Briarcliff Roads north of Scarborough Road.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=31}} At its peak, its original location covered {{convert|7800|acre|sqmi|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name="Mashomack"/&gt; In Briarcliff Manor, the farm had six main barns: Barn A, near its office building on Pleasantville Road, housed the horses for the farm and the [[Briarcliff Lodge]].&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=23}} The farm's blacksmith, wheelwright, harness shops and other buildings were located around that barn, and a [[smokehouse]] and butcher's shop were on-site.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}} Barns B (housing 78 cattle) and C (housing 118 cattle) were at the south end of Dalmeny Road;&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=23}} Barn D (housing 116 cattle), between Beech Hill Road and [[New York State Route 117]], was later used as a boarding stable for horses. Barn E (housing 118 cattle) was on Pleasantville Road just east of the present [[Taconic State Parkway]], and Barn F (housing 118 cattle&lt;ref name="1977history"/&gt;{{rp|page=24}}) was in [[Millwood, New York|Millwood]] near the intersection of the Taconic and [[New York State Route 100]]. The farm also had a large barn near [[New York State Route 9A]] for supplies, including feed for the farm. Each barn had an ice shed to cool milk; ice was harvested primarily from Echo Lake (source of the Pocantico River), with Kinderogen Lake (now part of the [[Edith Macy Conference Center]]) as a supplemental source.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=35}} The farm had a large supply store, with feed and other items, southeast of the service station at North State and Pleasantville Roads.&lt;ref name="1977history"/&gt;{{rp|page=27}}

The Briarcliff Farms office, Walter Law's personal office, was also the first dairy building;&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt; it burned down in 1901, and was rebuilt the following year. From Briarcliff Manor's 1902 incorporation to the construction of its first municipal building in 1913, the office housed the village government.&lt;ref name="BMSHSNews2014"/&gt; During the 1960s the building was redesigned, rebuilt and became a local union headquarters for the [[International Union of Operating Engineers]].&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|pages=16, 126}} The farm was enclosed, and its pastures were divided&lt;ref name="IllAm"/&gt; by stone walls from within the farm;&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; the stones were also used for roadbeds, and for walls of the farm buildings, office, and Law's house.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}}&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=307}}
[[File:BriarcliffFarmsHouses.jpg|thumb|alt=Three similar houses, with porches and garages|Cottages on Dalmeny Road]]
Walter Law encouraged his Briarcliff Farms employees to move into the village, selling {{convert|2,500|sqft|adj=on}} or {{convert|11,250|sqft|adj=on}} plots of land to workers for a nominal price. He asked workers to choose the type of house they wanted; he would have it built and hold the mortgage,&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; or allow them to rent a cottage.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=335}} Law built several wood-framed cottages near the farms,&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=23}} with steep [[Gablefront house|front-gable]] roofs and open porches using some of the first-floor space.&lt;ref name="IfYou'reNYT"/&gt; Of the cottages still standing, six are on Dalmeny Road and three are on Old Briarcliff Road.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=125}} The farm also owned and operated a farm in [[Peekskill]] previously owned by [[John Paulding]], a militiaman who helped capture British major [[John André]],&lt;ref name="OutlookJu1905"/&gt;{{rp|pages=29–30}} running the Peekskill farm as a nursery for maples, oaks, lindens, hemlocks, spruces and other trees.&lt;ref name="OutlookAp1907"/&gt;{{rp|page=587}} During the early 1900s Law purchased farms in [[Lewisboro]] and [[Pound Ridge]], using those farms to replenish the main farm's cattle herd. He also purchased a house in Pound Ridge, which his Briarcliff Realty Company sold to Westchester County after his death; it became the headquarters of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, the county's largest park.&lt;ref name="PoundRidge"/&gt;

Walter Law provided Dalmeny, a [[boarding house]] on Dalmeny Road,&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=36}} for the farm's single men.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; The building, modeled after the [[Mills House No. 1|Mills Houses]] in New York City,&lt;ref name="Social4"/&gt; was {{convert|100|ft}} long and four stories tall. Its first floor had a social hall for meetings and entertainment, a parlor and reading room equipped with books, newspapers, magazines, and games, a large dining room, a private dining room, a kitchen and a bathroom with marble basins and clean towels. The upper floors had seventy individual bedrooms for the men, with bathrooms with showers and tubs on every floor.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Social2"/&gt; Dalmeny also had a resident barber. Farm workers were not required to live in the boarding house, although the number of people wanting to live there exceeded the space available. Rent was $15–18 per month, including room, [[Room and board|board]] and laundry. Law frequently joined the men at meals,&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; lecturers visited the boarding house&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=313}} and the farm workers had a performing orchestra, brass band and [[glee club]].&lt;ref name="Social4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=335}}

Dalmeny opened on Christmas 1899&lt;ref name="Social2"/&gt; and closed in July 1908, in conjunction with the farm's relocation to [[Upstate New York]].&lt;ref name="OutlookOc1908"/&gt;{{rp|page=142}} Over a period of several months in 1909 the building was moved to the Briarcliff Lodge property, where it was adjacent to the Lodge's laundry building.{{refn|group=nb|The Briarcliff Lodge's laundry building was built in 1909, was [[The King's College (New York)|The King's College]]'s music building, and was demolished in summer 2002.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|pages=90, 115}}}} When the Lodge was the campus of [[The King's College (New York)|King's College]] from 1955 to 1994, the school called the former boarding house Harmony Hall and used it for classrooms and staff housing.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|pages=36, 90}} In autumn 1979, King's College demolished the building shortly after dedicating a new classroom building.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=90}}

The farm utilized the concept of a European country seat,&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt; through [[tenant farming]],&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=35}} established blacksmith, [[wheelwright]], and harness shops on-site, in addition to a butcher shop and smokehouse.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}} Buildings were centrally located around Walter Law's [[manor house]], many of which were constructed in the [[Tudor Revival]] style. The farm's office building,&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=16}} Dysart House,&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=15}} the Briarcliff Lodge,&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|pages=15, 19}} and the railroad station&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=35}} shared that architectural style.

The farm, one of the first producers of certified milk in the US, operated under the supervision of the Milk Commission of the Medical Society of the County of New York.&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; With the farm producing about {{convert|4500|USqt|l|abbr=off}} of milk daily&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; (an average of {{convert|8|USqt|l|abbr=off}} per cow per day),&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; Briarcliff Farms was one of the largest dairy operations in the northeast.&lt;ref name="Mashomack"/&gt; According to Nebraska's department of agriculture in 1903, the three largest owners of dairy cows in the eastern US were Fairfield Farm Dairy in New Jersey, Briarcliff Farms and the Walker-Gordon Laboratory Company (which had "branches in all of the principal cities").&lt;ref name="Largest"/&gt; In 1897 the farm had Jersey, [[Normande]] and [[Simmental cattle|Simmental]] cattle,&lt;ref name="IllAm"/&gt; selling the breeds' milk for 10, 12 and 15 cents per quart respectively. Briarcliff Farms also sold cream (with 50 percent [[butterfat]])&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; for 60 cents per quart, Jersey butter for 50 cents per pound and Normande or Simmental butter for 60 cents per pound.&lt;ref name="MilkVarieties"/&gt; In 1909, half the farm's herd consisted of [[Breed registry|registered]] Jerseys and the other half high-grade Jerseys.&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; In Pine Plains, many of Barn B's milkers were from the [[Netherlands]] because of that country's reputation for good milkers.&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt;

In 1905, Briarcliff Farms was milking nearly 500 cows at any given time. The farm raised its own stock, feeding the cattle eight pounds of dry feed twice a day&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; with pasture and green corn in summer. The feed mixture was 50 percent bran, 25 percent crushed oats and 25 percent cornmeal, all of which were claimed to be the best available. The farm required that each cow produce 6,000 pounds of milk with 5 percent butterfat or 5,000 pounds of milk with 6 percent butterfat, or she would be butchered or sold. Each cow ate an average of seven pounds of grain per day (varying from two pounds on pasture to 12 in winter), 1.5 to 2 pounds of oil meal each day and free-choice timothy and clover hay—{{convert|17|-|20|lb}} daily, depending on size. Each worker milked, cleaned and groomed 16 to 18 cattle daily. The New York Milk Commission analyzed the farm's milk weekly; although the board of health regulations in New York allowed three&amp;nbsp;million bacteria per [[cubic centimeter]] in milk, the milk commission limited bacteria to 30,000. The farm chilled its milk within two minutes of milking to {{convert|45|°F|°C}}, often limiting its bacteria counts to 200–400 per cc.&lt;ref name="OutlookSe1905"/&gt;{{rp|pages=289–91}} A chemical analysis of the milk was performed every month;&lt;ref name="MunJournal"/&gt; although regulations required a minimum of three percent butterfat, Briarcliff required its milk to have over five percent butterfat to be sold.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; A March 1905 New York Milk Commission analysis indicated that the farm's milk had 8.2 percent butterfat, the "richest Briarcliff product ever reported on".&lt;ref name="OutlookJu1904"/&gt;{{rp|page=210}}

In 1901 the farm had 1,045 Jersey cattle, 4,000 chickens and ducks, 1,500 pigs, and 400 sheep.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;{{rp|page=2666}} It grew, with 500 workers tending those animals in addition to [[Thoroughbred]] horses, pheasants and peacocks.&lt;ref name="OssHist"/&gt; The pigs (which included [[Chester White]]s and [[Berkshire pig|Berkshires]]) lived outdoors, because the farm superintendent believed they should be penned only for breeding; in summer, they were allowed to run in the orchards or the woods.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; About 2,000 were butchered each year.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}} The farm's 31 poultry houses had a head poulterer and 40 assistants; each building was {{convert|18|by|100|ft}}, and they were spread around the property. The farm, which used 300-egg insulators,&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}} fed the hens a mix of grains (including oats, wheat and corn) five times a day.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; The farm butchered 7,000 [[broiler]]s each season.&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; Eggs sold for 35 to 50 cents per dozen, with demand exceeding supply.

The lambs, which were dressed (their internal organs removed) on the farm, sold for $12 (${{Inflation|US|12|1900|r=0|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) or more apiece; demand also exceeded supply.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}}

The farm gardens grew a variety of crops, adapting to the market;&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; in 1900 this included oats, rye, corn, wheat, buckwheat, carrots, [[Mangelwurzel|mangolds]], turnips, rutabagas, radishes, sugar beets, potatoes, apples, cabbages, rye, oat, and wheat straw, hay, corn stalks and [[silage]].&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt; The farm rotated its grain production to grow better vegetables.

Briarcliff Farms operated a printing press and office north of the farm office on Pleasantville Road. The print shop produced ''Briarcliff Farms'', the ''Briarcliff Bulletin'' in 1900, the monthly ''Briarcliff Outlook'' in 1903 and ''The Briarcliff Once-a-Week'' in 1908 (all edited by Arthur W. Emerson)&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=27}} and bottle caps for Briarcliff dairy products. The Briarcliff Table Water Company sold its products in New York City, [[Lakewood, New Jersey]] and the Westchester municipalities of [[Yonkers]], [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], and [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]]. The company owned {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} wells.&lt;ref name="1977history"/&gt;{{rp|page=27}} Around 1901, the Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1 (later the [[Briarcliff Manor Fire Department]]) housed its equipment and horses at Briarcliff Farms' Barn A.&lt;ref name="BMFDhistory"/&gt;{{rp|page=5}} The American Plasmon Syndicate, a producer of the dried milk product plasmon, had its factory in Briarcliff for milk from Briarcliff Farms;&lt;ref name="CountryLifeJun1902"/&gt; the farm built the factory and its power plant.&lt;ref name="Co-operative"/&gt;

In a 1900 publication the farm's motto was reported to be "The production of pure food of the highest standard of excellence",&lt;ref name="AmGardening"/&gt; although a 1902 publication reported that its motto was "Do unto a cow as you would that a cow would do unto you" (also saying that the motto appeared in large letters in every barn on the farm).&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=309}} Notices printed by the farm began with the verse, "If a Cobbler by trade, I'll make it my pride, the best of all Cobblers to be; and if only a Tinker, no Tinker on earth shall mend an old Kettle like me";&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; this verse and several other mottoes decorated [[frieze]]s on the interior walls of the Dalmeny boarding house.&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=67}}

===Processing and delivery===
[[File:Briarcliff Farms bottling.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=Two men in white, one arranging milk bottles|Bottling at Briarcliff Farms, 1906]]
At its peak, the farm delivered milk to areas from [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to New York City.&lt;ref name="Mashomack"/&gt; After it was cooled, the milk was brought daily to the dairy-processing building,&lt;ref name="OutlookAu1904"/&gt; where it was poured into a large, sterilized tank and forced—with compressed air at {{convert|160|USqt}} per minute&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=312}}—through sterilized pipes to the building's second floor. There the milk was cooled, strained five times and bottled.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; The bottles were sealed with [[Parchment paper|parchment]] circles with the supervising commission's certification and the date,&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; and then put in boxes with ice.&lt;ref name="MunJournal"/&gt; The entire process, from entering the building to bottling, took five minutes. Every utensil contacting the milk (or workers) would be regularly sterilized with [[live steam]]. The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it; its rooms had white-tiled walls and floors, with coving (concave tiling) between the walls and floors for better cleaning.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating wire brushes and two hours of heat sterilization.&lt;ref name="MunJournal"/&gt;

===Ethos and advances===
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|fontsize=76%|quote=That a man&amp;nbsp;...who has acquired wealth by trade or manufacture should leave the city to develop an ideal farm is something new and notable. This is what Mr. Walter W. Law has done at Briarcliff Manor. He determined to have a farm run absolutely on the highest principles—a farm where science should speak the first word and the last word, and all the time. Science is nothing but accumulated experience; what we have found out to be best and truest; and so Briarcliff Manor farms were simply to do the best, instead of second best, or third best, or tenth best. The houses were to be models, the stables were to be ideal, the orchards planted and worked ideally, the gardens must show what possibly could be done in vegetables, and the corn crop and the oats and the wheat must not be left to any guesses of man or nature. Feeding must be done on scientific principles; barns must be as sanitary as houses; stables must be sunny and thoroughly ventilated. Water must be absolutely pure for the cattle, and their sanitary conditions as perfect as those for human beings.|source=''The Independent'' &lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;{{rp|page=2666}}}}

In 1906, [[Andrew Carnegie]] wrote about Briarcliff Farms: "Every known appliance or mode of treatment is at hand, and the herd is pronounced free from all and every ailment. In cases of doubt animals are sacrificed".&lt;ref name="RiverJournal"/&gt; The farm used the best obtainable stock, with extensive experimenting, for its products. The operation immediately removed every cow that appeared ill, and many cattle were butchered during the farm's first few years to improve the herd's overall health. According to Walter Law, "It is not the cows that have been put in, but those which have been taken out, that have made the Briarcliff herd what it is". The farm's large, light barns had concrete floors, which were cleaned daily,&lt;ref name="MunJournal"/&gt; and up-to-date appliances for separating, churning, handling and packing its products.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt;

Law made annual five-dollar cash awards (${{Inflation|US|5|1900|r=0|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to workers in September (giving them out at Dalmeny on December 24),&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt; which included "most gentle with cows", "most careful teamster in feeding his horses and keeping his stables clean", "cleanest delivery wagon", "neatest house yard", "best garden truck" and "best-kept room in Dalmeny";&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; the farm emphasized the commercial value of such virtues. On Christmas Eve, after the Briarcliff Orchestra played [[George Frideric Handel]]'s "[[Ombra mai fu|Largo]]", Law spoke about the farm's improvements that year and awarded the prizes.&lt;ref name="Social1"/&gt; The orchestra was made up of the farm's workers, and among its members was Law's son [[Walter W. Law, Jr.|Walter Jr.]]&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|fontsize=76%|quote=The arrangement for human beings must be on the highest level. Men and boys who were employed must be looked after to produce a splendid human result. That is, they must not be left to act as so many mechanical appliances or brute force masters of the lower animals&amp;nbsp;... It seems not yet quite familiar to us that a store should have the [[Golden Rule]] for a business maxim; but what are we to make of a farm where the superintendent says, "Not until we apply the Golden Rule to cows will we ever get the best from them?" The walls of the stables are hung with such mottoes as "Speak gently; it is better far to rule by love than by fear." The application of this rule to cows ought to create a moral evolution in the stablemen, so that by and by it could be applied to human folk as well, and thoroughly believed in as a workable law of life.|source=''The Independent'' &lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;{{rp|page=2666}}}}
Briarcliff Farms intended to prove that optimal farming practices could be profitable.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;{{rp|page=2666}} Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse:&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=26}} "Cruelty to a cow is the same as cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm."&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; He knew everyone who lived at the farms,&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=316}} and the farm workers knew the name of each cow&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=310}} (which was on a brass plate at the front of the cow's stall).&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}} The cows were sponged several times a day, and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, rinsed and dried.&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a "perceptible effect upon their milk".&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}}&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=312}} The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows.&lt;ref name="NYSDA"/&gt; The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, ''The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review'' said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this.&lt;ref name="Nurses"/&gt;{{rp|page=102}}

The farm had a veterinary chemist and a laboratory for regular milk analysis.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; Its dairy plant had a visitor-observation area,&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=336}} permitting the viewing of each step of the farm's dairy processing. In one room (separated from the viewing area by glass doors), cream was skimmed; in a second milk was bottled, and in a third butter was churned. The building's sterilizing, pasteurizing, and shipping departments were in the basement. Briarcliff Farms shipped {{convert|2000|USqt|l}} of milk, {{convert|300|USqt|l}} of cream and {{convert|500|lb|kg}} of butter each day.&lt;ref name="Conservative"/&gt; Students from the [[Ethical Culture School]] and nurses from New York City hospitals visited the farm to learn about its practices in relation to their work,&lt;ref name="Nurses"/&gt;{{rp|pages=102–3}} and Briarcliff Farms was reportedly chosen as the most typical New York industry available for inspection.&lt;ref name="Excursion"/&gt;

Although Briarcliff Farms' primary operation was dairy, a secondary agricultural product was its American Beauty rose. The farm had two groups of greenhouses; one, behind Walter Law's house and west of the Briarcliff Lodge, produced decorations for Briarcliff Farms, the Briarcliff Lodge and Law's and his workers' houses. The other group, the Pierson commercial greenhouses, grew the American Beauty rose and rare [[carnation]]s; it produced 22 varieties and about 2,500 blooms a day.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=26}}&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; The greenhouses, advanced for their time, had light steel frames and glass panes unique in their "almost unshadowed exposure to the light". The newer greenhouses, {{convert|50|by|300|ft}},&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; held up to 40,000 plants apiece.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; The Pierson roses, which earned up to $100,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) a year, were sold in winter for eight to 12 cents each&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; with most shipped to New York City.&lt;ref name="glassglory"/&gt; The Briarcliff Lodge sponsored an annual American Beauty carnival with a golf tournament, water sports, moonlight bathing and night diving, a dinner dance, a cinema program and a concert.&lt;ref name="Carnival"/&gt;

Greenhouse foreman George Romaine propagated an American Beauty rose with longer, more-pointed buds and a brighter color, and Paul M. Pierson registered it with the American Rose Society as the Briarcliff Rose.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=37}} It is Briarcliff Manor's village symbol,&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; and since 2006 has been used on village street signs.&lt;ref name="RoseStreetSigns"/&gt; Although the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club also uses the Briarcliff Rose as its symbol,&lt;ref name="GardenClub"/&gt; the variety is now lost.&lt;ref name="BMSHSNews2014"/&gt;

==School of Practical Agriculture==
[[File:Pocantico Lodge.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=A three-story rectangular building on a hill|The school's first building]]
During the winter of 1895-96, the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor&lt;ref name="LivingIssues"/&gt; researched the causes of youth moving from the country to cities to develop the most efficient method of attracting them back to the country.{{refn|group=nb|The inquiry was specifically made by George T. Powell and a Pennsylvania farmer named Kelgaard in New York City. The two asked state residents, primarily farmers, about urban migration, tenant farming, and principals of agriculture. The direct result of the research was the founding of the School of Practical Agriculture.&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt;}} That, and an examination of agricultural needs for a year,&lt;ref name="PracticalSchool"/&gt; resulted in meetings at the homes of Abram S. Hewitt and R. Fulton Cutting and the formation of the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; The committee, chaired by Hewitt, included Cutting, Jacob H. Schiff, John G. Carlisle, Mrs. Seth Low, Josephine Shaw Lowell, Walter Law and William E. Dodge. Its board of trustees had five officers (with Theodore L. Van Norden president) and seventeen other trustees, including Law, [[V. Everit Macy]] and [[James Speyer]].&lt;ref name="NYTPoughkeepsie"/&gt; George T. Powell,{{refn|group=nb|Powell was a practical educator and lecturer with Cornell University and the USDA.&lt;ref name="Puritan"/&gt;{{rp|page=338}}}} a "recognized authority on scientific agriculture" according to ''The New York Times'', was consulted; he later organized the school and became its director.&lt;ref name="NYTPoughkeepsie"/&gt; When Walter Law was included the school took shape,&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; since he provided its land and building.&lt;ref name="SFCall"/&gt; In September 1900,&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; Law and the committee established the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture as part of Briarcliff Farms, on an elevated {{convert|66|acre|ha|adj=on}} site about midway between the [[Briarcliff Manor Public Library|Briarcliff Manor]] and [[Pleasantville (Metro-North station)|Pleasantville]] train stations&lt;ref name="Yonkers"/&gt; on Pleasantville Road.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=10}} Law leased the 66 acres (which were worth $1,000 (${{Inflation|US|1000|1901|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) an acre) for 20 years at the rate of a dollar per year, gave the trustees $30,000 (${{Inflation|US|30000|1901|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to build a dormitory and promised them $3,000 (${{Inflation|US|3000|1901|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) a year for expenses until the school earned a profit. With that and $30,000 from the trustees, the school opened;&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; the committee focused the curriculum on [[horticulture]], [[floriculture]], gardening and [[aviculture]].&lt;ref name="PracticalSchool"/&gt; The school's progress was followed by members of the public interested in agricultural education.&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt;
[[File:SchoolofPracticalAgriculture.jpg|thumb|alt=Flower gardens surrounded by paths|The school's landscape gardens]]
When it was founded, the school was considered an experiment.&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt; Its goal was "to open an independent means of livelihood for young men and women, especially of our cities; to demonstrate that higher values may be obtained from land under intelligent management, and to develop a taste for rural life."&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;{{rp|page=2666}} Most students were trained in garden and farm operations in a two-year course, with short summer courses in nature study also offered. The academic year had three terms, with twelve weeks of vacation. Although the school allowed new students to begin at any term, a September start was considered the most desirable.&lt;ref name="AmGardening"/&gt; Instruction was offered in [[agriculture]], horticulture, cold storage, [[botany]], chemistry, geology, physics, agricultural zoology, [[entomology]], [[beekeeping]],&lt;ref name="AmGardening"/&gt; [[meteorology]], land surveying and leveling, soils, drainage, irrigation, [[tillage]], fertilizers, plant diseases, stock, fruit growing, landscape gardening and bookkeeping. It was a practical school, with no attempt to provide a general education. Work included caring for orchard trees and bush fruit, greenhouse culture of fruits and vegetables, jelly- and jam-making, market gardening, tillage, fertilizer use, hybridizing and propagating flowers, harvesting and marketing crops. The school used Briarcliff Farms, where students worked the land, tested milk and cared for a variety of animals.&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; Students also raised flowers, vegetables and fruit, and accompanied their products to cities for marketing.&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;{{rp|page=314}} The [[New York Botanical Garden]] arranged with the school for student access to its lectures, museums and conservatories.&lt;ref name="WorldsWork"/&gt; Tuition was $100 a year (${{Inflation|US|100|1901|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}), and [[Room and board|board]] $280 a year (${{Inflation|US|280|1901|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). Instruction was primarily weekday-morning lectures with laboratory work; during the afternoon, students worked on the school farm (which had a foreman, gardener and several workmen to ensure continuous operation)&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt; under instructor supervision.&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; In 1901 35 students attended, followed by 34 in 1902&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; (almost all from cities), ranging in age from 16 to 35. Most had a high-school education before enrolling, and some had been to college. The school had a capacity of 35 students, and planned to expand.&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt;

For one year it met in the basement of Pleasantville's public school (until the Briarcliff Farms building was completed), and did not provide housing.&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; The farm building was completed in spring 1901&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|page=18}} and dedicated on May 15.&lt;ref name="Yonkers"/&gt; The large [[Colonial Revival]] building, with a plain exterior and wide halls,&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; had lecture halls, a library, a laboratory,&lt;ref name="CountryLifeMay1902"/&gt; an office, a dining hall&lt;ref name="Yonkers"/&gt; and dormitory space for 40 staff members and students. Its grounds had an orchard, a working garden, experimental greenhouses, poultry houses, a farmhouse&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt; and barns.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;{{rp|page=2666}} The school's faculty included a director, a horticulturalist, an agriculturalist and instructors in nature study and cold storage. It was [[coeducational]], with identical courses for men and women.&lt;ref name="SPA-NYT"/&gt; Students were required to be proficient in English, provide good references, be at least 16 years of age, and be in good health.&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt; On January 1, 1902 [[Henry Francis du Pont]], then in his third year at [[Harvard University]], wrote to Powell requesting admission to the school; Powell replied that DuPont was listed first in the school's 1903 class. However, DuPont was unable to attend and left Harvard (perhaps due to his mother's sudden death in autumn 1902).&lt;ref name="HFDuPont"/&gt;

===Relocation and closure===
The school outgrew its Briarcliff location,&lt;ref name="ExpStation3"/&gt; and in autumn 1902 R. Fulton Cutting purchased a {{convert|415|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm near Poughkeepsie as a permanent upstate location.&lt;ref name="NYTPoughkeepsie"/&gt; Prior to the move, the school was popularly known as the Briarcliff School, and after moving it became formally known as the School of Practical Agriculture at Poughkeepsie. When the school was established there, Theodore Van Norden said that it needed funds for equipment and an endowment.&lt;ref name="SFCall"/&gt; The land had no buildings, and thus the school rented two houses in Poughkeepsie until funds were obtained to build.&lt;ref name="ExpStation2"/&gt; It initially hoped to raise one million dollars;&lt;ref name="ExpStation3"/&gt; in 1903, after raising $50,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1903}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) of a hoped-for $150,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|150000|1903}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to operate the school, director George Powell announced that it would close and the property would be sold. Cutting presented a plan to the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] to carry out the plan devised for the school in Poughkeepsie.&lt;ref name="Closed"/&gt; In 1908, school funds were donated to [[Cornell University]] as the Agricultural Student Loan Fund for students in Cornell's [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]].&lt;ref name="CornellFund"/&gt;

From 1903 to 1905 the original school building was known as Pocantico Lodge, a small year-round hotel. In 1905 Alice Knox, an employee at [[Mrs. Dow's School]], opened Miss Knox's School in the building.&lt;!--Fire at 6:10 at night, students evacuated, unknown cause. 3-story frame structure with two wings running back of the main building. A bus carried the students to Mrs. Dow's and the [[Holbrook School]] and Dr. Wilder's residence. The Ossining Democratic Register reported that the fire was one of the largest that had been known to have occurred in the area. BMFD 2001 book--&gt; Destroyed by fire in 1912, the school moved to nearby Tarrytown and then to [[Cooperstown]].&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=38}} The Knox School moved to [[St. James, New York|St. James]], on [[Long Island]], in 1954.&lt;ref name="KnoxSchool"/&gt; The only remaining feature of the Pocantico Lodge building is a stone retaining wall in front of the current building on the site, built in 1925 by Oscar Vatet for Rufus P. Johnston (pastor of [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s Fifth Avenue Baptist Church)&lt;!--or [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], according to WestPictHistp183--&gt;. The building, later occupied by Arthur O'Connor, Cognitronics, and Frank B. Hall, is currently an unused part of Briarcliff Corporate Campus.&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=71, 73}}

Most of the Pine Plains farmland is occupied by Berkshire Stud, a Thoroughbred breeding farm which purchased {{convert|550|acre|ha}} beginning in 1983,&lt;ref name="BerkHistory"/&gt; and the Mashomack Polo Club (which owns the farmhouse on Halcyon Lake).&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BerkRealEstate"/&gt; The farm's creamery&lt;ref name="LittleNine"/&gt; and several barns (some built during the 19th century) still stand at the polo club, and have been used since the 1980s for stables, farm-equipment storage and the raising of sporting birds. The barns also housed the Triangle Arts Association (part of the [[Triangle Arts Trust]]) from 1982 to 1993.&lt;ref name="Mashomack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt;

In Briarcliff Manor, part of the original Stillman farmhouse survives as the [[rectory]] of St. Theresa's Catholic Church&lt;ref name="Changing Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=79}} and several employee wood-framed cottages still stand on Dalmeny and Old Briarcliff Roads.&lt;ref name="BMSHSNews2014"/&gt; Similar houses are on South State, Pleasantville, and Poplar Roads. The farm's dairy building is owned by [[Consolidated Edison]]; the company also owns a nearby building which formerly housed the Briarcliff Manor Light and Power Company. The Plasmon Company of America's Woodside Avenue factory is now an [[automotive restoration]] facility.&lt;ref name="LodgeBook"/&gt;{{rp|pages=18, 125}}

'''Brookhouse School''' (also known as '''Brookhouse International School''') is an independent British curriculum co-educational day and boarding school offering Early Years, preparatory and secondary schooling. It is located in [[Langata]], a suburb of [[Nairobi]], about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} from the Nairobi's CBD. The school was opened in 1981 and caters for pupils from pre-school to [[A-level]], with an overall enrolment of 750 students. The campus occupies a {{convert|14|acre|adj=on|sigfig=2}} site, adjacent to the [[Nairobi National Park]].[[File:SixthForm.JPG|440px|right]]

==Academics==
Brookhouse follows the British National Curriculum and students take [[IGCSE]] and [[A-Level]] at 16+ and 18+, respectively. Students take examinations through both the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE)&lt;ref name=CIE&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cie.org.uk/events/detail?event_id=34710&amp;nes=0| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101229034719/http://www.cie.org.uk/events/detail?event_id=34710&amp;nes=0| archivedate=29 December 2010|title= Events: Stage 2 Professional Development Courses, Kenya| publisher= Cambridge International Examinations|accessdate=March 20, 2016| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edexcel]] Boards.

Most students elect to continue their education at UK universities, with an increasing number of students going to the USA, Canada, Australia and South Africa for post-secondary education. The school offers [[English as a Second Language]] (ESL) and Special Needs support.

==Admission==
The academic year begins in late August for Term 1. Entry to the school is preferable at that time but students may be accepted at any time in the year. Acceptance follows an evaluation of the child's previous academic record. Entry assessment tests are used to assist in the placement process.

All admissions to Brookhouse School are made through a senior member of staff. When seeking admission, prospective students are requested to provide copies of previous school reports, academic transcripts, and where applicable, a Leaving Certificate. Where practicable, prospective students will also be interviewed and may be asked to sit an entrance placement examination. A student will only be admitted to Brookhouse if it is considered that they will benefit from the curriculum offered and if they are prepared to contribute positively to the life of the school.
Students come from 40 different countries.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;&lt;ref name=Admission&gt;{{cite web|title=Application and Admission|url=http://www.brookhouse.ac.ke/application.html|work=brookhouse.ac.ke|publisher=Brookhouse International School|accessdate=2 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116064458/http://www.brookhouse.ac.ke/application.html|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EAPSG&gt;{{cite web|title=Brookhouse International School|url=http://eaprivateschools.com/schools/?school_id=11&amp;search=1|publisher=The East African Private Schools Guide|accessdate=2 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201150857/http://eaprivateschools.com/schools/?school_id=11&amp;search=1|archivedate=1 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dozen or more staff are also accommodated on site, to provide a high level of supervision and support for the boarding students. The Boarding House has its own student common rooms and other recreational facilities. Younger children are accommodated in a separate area of the Boarding complex.They have their own full-time boarding staff to provide a homely atmosphere for the children.
*'''Sports''' – Brookhouse has a gym that all students can use under the supervision of the gym coach. In 2010, the Tergat Sports Centre was officially opened. Named after one of Kenya's long distance athletic greats, [[Paul Tergat]], the indoor sports centre hosts major indoor sports and activities.
*'''Auditorium''' – The on-campus Burudani Theatre is a world-class performing arts venue for music concerts, drama performances and other activities. In 2013 it was the venue for the historic inaugural presidential debates in the run up to the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2013]] March.

'''Canal Educativo''' is a [[Television in Cuba|Cuban television]] channel devoted to educational programming. Operated by the [[Cuban Institute of Radio and Television|ICRT]], it began operations on 9 May 2002.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of Canal Educativo, there was no designated home for educational programming among Cuba's national television portfolio. The establishment of this network enabled the delivery of telecourses and the use of school hours to broadcast content. Canal Educativo covers 87.9% of the Cuban population.

In 2004, a second network, '''Canal Educativo 2''' (currently abbreviated '''ce2''' on air), was launched.

==Programming==
Canal Educativo's programming includes telecourses, documentaries, historical programs, and arts programming including opera, ballet and musical performances. It also reportedly airs cartoons such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

'''Centre for Research and Action for Peace (CERAP)''' (''Centre de Recherche et d'Action pour la Paix''), Ivory Coast, began as the African Institute for Economic and Social Development (INADES), with its early focus on agricultural training. In 2003, INADES expanded and changed its name to CERAP. 

==History==
The CERAP was established in 1962 at the request of the Catholic bishops of West Africa to develop a center of Christian reflection on socio-economic development, with the cooperation of a similar center in France (CERAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjweb.info/sjs/pjnew/PJShow.cfm?pubTextID=9048|title=Social Justice Secretariat|website=www.sjweb.info|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the encouragement of political leaders in the Ivory Coast including President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Programs==
On 9 May 2003, INADES changed its name to CERAP, Centre for Research and Action for Peace, and reorganized into four branches:
* CEDOC, created in 1964 under the name of IDOC, is the Documentation Centre for the social sciences.
* Social Action in Urban Areas (ASMU), created in 1985, offers apprenticeships for disadvantaged youth. 
* EDICERAP, formerly INADES-Editions (1976-1992), encourages publication of newspapers and books by Ivorian authors. It also publishes the monthly ''Courrier Débats – West Africa''.
* The Institute of Dignity and Human Rights (DIHR), created in 2003, grants diplomas and the master's degree in human rights, peace studies, economic ethics, and sustainable development, recognized by the Ivorian Ministry of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;Decree No. 489 / MES / DESUP of 5 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Wolfgang Alexander''' (born 4 October 1936 in [[Vienna]], Austria)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patternlanguage.com/ca/ca.html|title=PatternLanguage.com|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/caframe.htm?/../ca/whoswho.htm|title=CA FRAME|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a widely influential [[architect]] and design theorist, and currently [[Professors in the United States#Professor emeritus and emerita|emeritus professor]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His theories about the nature of human-centered [[design]] have affected fields beyond architecture, including [[urban design]], [[software]], [[sociology]] and others.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander has designed and personally built over 100 buildings, both as an architect and a general contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/calexander/|title=Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=www.pps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html|title=2009 Scully Prize|author=|date=|website=nbm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In software, Alexander is regarded as the father of the [[pattern language]] movement. The first [[wiki]]—the technology behind [[Wikipedia]]—led directly from Alexander's work, according to its creator, [[Ward Cunningham]].&lt;ref name="C2 Wiki Front Page"&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki C2 Wiki Front Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c2.com"&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns C2 Wiki: People, Projects and Patterns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's work has also influenced the development of [[agile software development]].&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt;

In architecture, Alexander's work is used by a number of different contemporary architectural communities of practice, including the [[New Urbanist]] movement, to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2009/12/do_you_see_a_pattern.html|title=Do You See a Pattern?|first=Witold|last=Rybczynski|date=2 December 2009|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects and critics, in part because his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.&lt;ref name="nikos"&gt;Nikos Salingaros, "[[A Theory of Architecture]]", Umbau-Verlag, Solingen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander is known for many books on the design and building process, including ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]], [[A City is Not a Tree]]'' (first published as a paper and recently re-published in book form), ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]], A New Theory of Urban Design,'' and ''[[The Oregon Experiment]].'' More recently he published the four-volume ''[[The Nature of Order]]: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe,'' about his newer theories of "morphogenetic" processes, and ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth'', about the implementation of his theories in a large building project in Japan. All his works are developed or accumulated from his previous works, so his works should be read as a whole rather than fragmented pieces. His life's work or the best of his works is The Nature of Order on which he spent about 30 years, and the very first version of The Nature of Order was done in 1981, one year before this famous debate with Peter Eisenman in Harvard.

Alexander is perhaps best known for his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]],'' a perennial seller some four decades after publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459281087&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+pattern+language|title=A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction|first1=search|last1=results|first2=search|last2=results|first3=search|last3=results|first4=search|last4=results|first5=Ingrid|last5=Fiksdahl-King|first6=Shlomo|last6=Angel|date=7 June 1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2NSI4vSu_IC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0htfQ-O3KAhVE32MKHYy5BfkQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&amp;f=false|title=The Oregon Experiment|first1=Christopher|last1=Alexander|first2=Professor in the Department of Architecture Christopher|last2=Alexander|first3=Murray|last3=Silverstein|first4=Shlomo|last4=Angel|first5=Sara|last5=Ishikawa|first6=Danny|last6=Abrams|date=7 June 1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUGiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj97JbG9-3KAhUS5GMKHWBkDIUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&amp;f=false|title=How to Study Public Life|first1=Jan|last1=Gehl|first2=Birgitte|last2=Svarre|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Island Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1991-1/the-oregon-experiment-revisited|title=The Oregon Experiment after Twenty Years - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; he produced and validated (in collaboration with his students Sara Ishikawa, [[Murray Silverstein]], Max Jacobson, Ingrid King, and Shlomo Angel) a "[[pattern language]]" to empower anyone to design and build at any scale.

==Personal life==
As a young child Alexander emigrated in fall 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2008|title=ARCH+ Zeitschrift für Architektur und Städtebau|url=|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his parents from Austria to England, when his parents were forced to flee the Nazi regime. He spent much of his childhood in [[Chichester]] and [[Oxford]], England, where he began his education in the sciences. He moved from England to the United States in 1958 to study at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He moved to [[Berkeley, California]] in 1963 to accept an appointment as Professor of Architecture, a position he would hold for almost 40 years. In 2002, after his retirement, Alexander moved to [[Arundel]], England, where he continues to write, teach and build. Alexander is married to Margaret Moore Alexander, and he has two daughters, Sophie and Lily, by his former wife Pamela.

==Education==
Alexander attended [[Oundle School]], England. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Architecture and a [[Master's degree]] in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Architecture ever awarded at [[Harvard University]]), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked at MIT in transportation theory and computer science, and worked at Harvard in cognition and cognitive studies.

==Honors==
Alexander was elected to the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows]], Harvard University 1961-64; awarded the First Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/reflections-on-puarl-01062014/christopher-alexander-aia-medal|title=AIA First Medal for Research|author=AIA Journal|date=August 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;; elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy, 1980; winner of the Best Building in Japan award, 1985; winner of the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) Distinguished Professor Award, 1986 and 1987;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://acsa-arch.org/programs-events/awards/archives/DP ACSA Archives, Distinguished Professor Award winners.]&lt;/ref&gt; invited to present the Louis Kahn Memorial Lecture, 1992; awarded the Seaside Prize, 1994; elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1996;&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt; one of the two inaugural recipients of the Athena Award, given by the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU), 2006;. awarded (''in absentia'') the [[Vincent Scully Prize]] by the [[National Building Museum]], 2009; awarded the lifetime achievement award by the [[Urban Design Group]], 2011; winner of the [[Global Award for Sustainable Architecture]], 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patternlanguage.com/bios/vitae.htm|title=Curriculum Vitae|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Author===

''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:

{{quote|There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.}}

''[[A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]'' (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a [[generative grammar]].

The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.

The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.

The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete. It uses [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] construction to build as high as three stories, permitting very high densities.

This book's method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'' (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.

''A New Theory of Urban Design'' (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in [[urbanism]] among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students on a site in [[San Francisco]], it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only ''local'' rules, in relation to neighbours. A vastly undervalued part of the Alexander canon, ''A New Theory'' is important in understanding the generative processes which give rise to the [[shanty town]]s latterly championed by [[Stewart Brand]],&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 2 of his ''Whole Earth Discipline'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Neuwirth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Shadow Cities: a billion squatters, a new urban world'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name="Hanson-Younés"&gt;See Brian Hanson &amp; Samir Younés, "Reuniting Urban Form and Urban Process: The Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force", ''Journal of Urban Design'', v.6, no.2 (June 2001), pp.185-209; Charles, Prince of Wales, speech at the "Traditional Urbanism in Contemporary Practice" conference at The Prince's Foundation, London, 20 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been critical reconstructions of Alexander's design studio based on the theories put forward in ''A New Theory of Urban Design''.&lt;ref name="Warped"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7550339/Warped_educational_strategies_in_simulation_of_practice|title=Gareth Griffiths, "Warped educational strategies in simulation of practice", in ''Nordic Journal of Architectural Research'', 1/2013.|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]]'' (2003–04), which includes The ''Phenomenon of Life'', ''The Process of Creating Life'', ''A Vision of a Living World'' and ''The Luminous Ground'', is Alexander's most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in which we view the world in general. The mostly static patterns from ''A Pattern Language'' have been amended by more dynamic sequences, which describe how to work towards patterns (which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences). Sequences, like [[pattern language|patterns]], promise to be tools of wider scope than building (just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture).

The online publication ''Katarxis 3'' (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary debate between Alexander and [[Peter Eisenman]] from 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm |title=Contrasting Concepts of Harmony in Architecture: The 1982 Debate Between Christopher Alexander and Peter Eisenman |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's latest book, ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems'' (2012), is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled, the construction of a new High School/College campus in Japan. He also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series. He contrasts his approach, (System A) with the construction processes endemic in the US and Japanese economies (System B). As Alexander describes it, System A is focused on enhancing the life/spirit of spaces within given constraints (land, budget, client needs, etc.) (drawings are sketches - decisions on placing buildings, materials used, finish and such are made in the field as construction proceeds, with adjustments as needed to meet overall budget); System B ignores, and tends to diminish or destroy that quality (architect responsible for drawings which the builder uses to build structures at the lowest possible cost). In the last few chapters he describes "centers" as a way of thinking about the connections among spaces, and about what brings more wholeness and life to a space.

===Works of architecture===
Among Alexander's most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near [[Tokyo]] (the building process of which is outlined in his 2012 book ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth''); the West Dean Visitors Centre &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.livingneighborhoods.org/ht-0/westdean.htm England, The West Dean Visitors Centre]'' - Project History&lt;/ref&gt; in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in [[San Jose, California]] (both described in ''Nature of Order''); the [[Sala House]] and the Martinez House (experimental houses in Albany and Martinez, California made of lightweight concrete); the low-cost housing in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]] (described in ''The Production of Houses''); and several private houses (described and illustrated in ''The Nature of Order''). Alexander's built work is characterized by a special quality (which he used to call "the quality without a name", but named "wholeness" in ''Nature of Order'') that relates to human beings and induces feelings of belonging to the place and structure. This quality is found in the most loved traditional and historic buildings and urban spaces, and is precisely what Alexander has tried to capture with his sophisticated mathematical design theories. Paradoxically, achieving this connective human quality has also moved his buildings away from the abstract imageability valued in contemporary architecture, and this is one reason why his buildings are under-appreciated at present.&lt;ref name="nikos" /&gt;

His former student and colleague [[Michael Mehaffy]] wrote an introductory essay on Alexander's built work in the online publication ''Katarxis 3'', which includes a gallery of Alexander's major built projects through September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Gallery.htm |title=Gallery |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
In addition to his lengthy teaching career as a Professor at [[UC Berkeley]] (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key faculty member at both The Prince of Wales's Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990–1994) and [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.architectural-review.com/rethink/viewpoints/lessons-from-prince-charles/8636206.article Architectural Review, September 2012]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also initiated the process which led to the international [[Building Beauty]] post-graduate school for architecture, which launched in Sorrento, Italy for the 2017-18 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buildingbeauty.org/|title=Building Beauty – First Level Master in Architecture|author=|date=|website=buildingbeauty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buildinggreen.com/newsbrief/architecture-hands-search-beauty|title=Architecture as a Hands-on Search for Beauty|author=|date=27 December 2017|website=buildinggreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Architecture===

Alexander's work has widely influenced architects; among those who acknowledge his influence are [[Sarah Susanka]],&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Susanka: ''Not So Big House'', Taunton Press, 2001, {{ISBN|1561583766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andres Duany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Duany.htm|title=Andres Duany, Architect and Urban Theorist|author=|date=|website=www.katarxis3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Witold Rybczynski]].&lt;ref name="nbm.org"&gt;http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Campbell (journalist)|Robert Campbell]], the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the ''Boston Globe'', stated that Alexander "has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work, and I think that's true of a whole generation of people."&lt;ref name="nbm.org"/&gt;

Architecture critic [[Peter Buchanan (architect)|Peter Buchanan]], in an essay for ''[[The Architectural Review]]''{{'}}s 2012 campaign ''The Big Rethink'', argues that Alexander's work as reflected in ''A Pattern Language'' is "thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive, as so many misunderstand it to be." He continues:
{{quote|Even architects not immune to the charms of the places depicted, are loath to pursue the folksy aesthetic they see as implied and do not want to engage with such primitive construction—although the systemic collapse now unfolding may force that upon them. The daunting challenge for architects then, if such a thing is even possible to realise, would be to recreate in a more contemporary idiom both the richness and quality of experience suggested by the pattern language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectural-review.com/the-big-rethink/the-big-rethink-transcend-and-include-the-past/8629373.article?blocktitle=Towards-a-Complete-Architecture&amp;contentID=4950 The Big Rethink: Transcend And include The Past], 24 April 2012 (accessed 5 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many urban development projects continue to incorporate Alexander's ideas. For example, in the UK the developers [[Living Villages]] have been highly influenced by Alexander's work and used ''A Pattern Language'' as the basis for the design of The Wintles in Bishops Castle, Shropshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/24/a-wander-round-the-wintles/|title=A Wander Round the Wintles » Transition Culture|first=Rob|last=Hopkins|date=|website=transitionculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Susanka]]'s "Not So Big House" movement adapts and popularizes Alexander's patterns and outlook.

===Computer science===

Alexander's ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'' was said to be required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s. It had an influence&lt;ref name="naur"&gt;{{cite conference | first = H. | last = Kilov | title = Using RM-ODP to bridge communication gaps between stakeholders | booktitle = Communications H Kilov | conference = Workshop on ODP for Enterprise Computing 2004 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.161.553 | quote = Peter Naur proposed in 1968 to use Christopher Alexander's work… }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and 1970s on [[programming language design]], modular programming, [[object-oriented programming]], [[software engineering]] and other design methodologies. Alexander's mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s influential ''A Discipline of Programming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Dijkstra

| title = A Discipline of Programming
| date = 1976-10-28

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest influence of ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' in computer science is the [[design patterns]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Chris.text.html#COMPUTER |title= Christopher's Alexander's influence on Computer Science |author=Nikos A. Salingaros |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design also influenced the [[extreme programming]] movement.&lt;ref name="accu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accu.org/index.php/journals/509|title=ACCU  :: eXtreme Programming An interview with Kent Beck|first=ACCU|last=Members|date=|website=accu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wiki]] was invented&lt;ref name="C2 Wiki Front Page"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c2.com"/&gt; to allow the Hillside Group to work on programming [[design patterns]]. More recently the "deep geometrical structures" as discussed in ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' have been cited as having importance for [[object-oriented programming]], particularly in C++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/budha/coplien.htm|title=Space:  The Final Frontier|author=|date=|website=www.cs.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] wrote that Alexander's work was influential in the origin of the ''[[SimCity]]'' computer games, and in his later game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconeye.com/architecture/features/item/3261-will-wright-interview|title=Will Wright interview|author=|date=|website=iconeye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander has often led his own software research, such as the 1996 Gatemaker project with [[Greg Bryant (computer scientist)|Greg Bryant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatemaker.org|title=Aspen -- early 1997|author=|date=|website=gatemaker.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/gatemaker|title=Gatemaker: Christopher Alexander's dialogue with the computer industry - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander discovered and conceived a recursive structure, so called wholeness, which is defined mathematically, exists in space and matter physically, and reflects in our minds and cognition psychologically. He had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of ''The Nature of Order''. In fact, his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in spirit to Google's PageRank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1502.03554 | title=Wholeness as a Hierarchical Graph to Capture the Nature of Space | journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science | volume=29 | issue=9 | pages=1632 | first=Bin | last=Jiang | date=27 March 2015| doi=10.1080/13658816.2015.1038542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The fourth volume of ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter, [[human perception]] of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts. He suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and [[belief]]s, and recent scientific advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureoforder.com/summarybk4.htm|title=SUMMARY OF BOOK FOUR OF THE NATURE OF ORDER|author=|date=|website=www.natureoforder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his leanings toward [[Deism]], and his naturalistic and anthropological approach to religion, Alexander maintains that he is a practicing member of the [[Catholic Church]], believing it to embody a great deal of accumulated human truth within its rituals&lt;!-- There is no mention of 'accumulated human truth' or 'rituals' in the linked article. --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/02/making-the-garden|title=Making the Garden - Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=firstthings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design science===
The life's work of Alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior, so called design science. In his very first book ''Notes on the Synthesis of Forms'', he has set what he wanted to do. He was inspired by traditional buildings, and tried to derive some 253 patterns for architectural design. Later on, he further distills 15 geometric properties to characterize living structure in ''[[The Nature of Order]]''. The design principles are differentiation and adaptation.

===Complex networks===
In his classic ‘A City is Not a Tree’, he already had some primary ideas of complex networks, although he used semilattice rather than complex networks. In his first book ‘Notes on the synthesis of forms’ on page 65, he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks, a recent topic emerged around 2004: [[Community structure]].

Unlike the [[college admissions|regular admissions]] process, early action usually requires [[student]]s to submit an application by October 15 or November 1 of their [[High school senior|senior year of high school]] instead of January 1. Students are notified of the school's decision by mid-December instead of April 1.

In this way, it is similar to many [[college]]s' [[early decision]] programs.  Early decision, however, is a binding commitment to enroll; that is, if accepted under an early decision program, the applicant must withdraw all other applications and enroll at that institution.  Thus, early decision does not allow applicants to apply to more than one early decision school simultaneously.  Early action, on the other hand, allows candidates to decline the offer if accepted, and depending on the program, it may be possible for a candidate to apply to more than one early action school and an early decision school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/us-applications/1451/deadlines-early-decision |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926143135/http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/us-applications/1451/deadlines-early-decision |archivedate=2013-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of early action programs: restrictive early action and non-restrictive early action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jennifer Gross and Nicole Verardi |url=http://www.nacacnet.org/MemberPortal/News/StepsNewsletter/early_decision.htm |publisher=The National Association for College Admission Counseling |accessdate=2008-02-22 |title=NACAC Early Decision and Early Action: Does the Early Bird Get the Worm? |date=May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219032604/http://www.nacacnet.org/MemberPortal/News/StepsNewsletter/early_decision.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Restrictive EA allows candidates to apply to only one early action institution and to no institutions for early decision, while, as the name implies, there are no such restrictions on non-restrictive early action.  Regardless, the applicant is still permitted to reject any offer of admission in both types of early action.

[[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Virginia]] dropped all early admissions processes (which were binding early admission programs) in 2007. All three reversed course in February 2011, restoring an early-admission program, though less restrictive than previous offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale University]] and [[Stanford University]] recently{{when|date=April 2013}} switched from early decision to restrictive early action. Other schools that offer non-restrictive early action include the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], [[UNC-Chapel Hill]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Villanova University]], and the [[University of Notre Dame]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to ''[[Uni in the USA]]'', "The advantage [of early action applications] is you will know much earlier and can plan accordingly. The disadvantage is that candidates who apply this way tend to be much stronger and rejection is more likely than in the regular admission pool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/us-applications/1451/deadlines-early-decision |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926143135/http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/us-applications/1451/deadlines-early-decision |archivedate=2013-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund C. Arnold''' (June 25, 1913 – February 2, 2007) was a newspaper designer, considered by many to be the father of modern newspaper design. As a newspaper consultant, he designed more than a thousand newspapers including ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]'', ''Today'', ''[[Toronto Star]]'', ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', and many small weeklies. He also worked as the editor of ''The Linotype News'', and as a columnist for ''Publisher's Auxiliary''.

Arnold was born on June 25, 1913, in Bay City, Michigan, the son of Ferdinand M. and Anna I. (Begick) Arnold. As a small boy the family moved to Saginaw, Michigan. Edmund's only brother, Robert, drowned in the Saginaw Bay in a boating accident in 1938 at the age of 19.

In addition to his newspaper work, Arnold was an educator. He was the chairman of the Graphic Arts and Publishing Departments at the School of Journalism at [[Syracuse University]] and taught as a professor at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. He was a charter member of the [[Society for News Design]]. He wrote over 25 books, including the ''Ink on Paper'' (1963), ''Ink on Paper 2'' (1972), and ''Modern Newspaper Design'' (1969).

Arnold was honored with SND's lifetime achievement award in 2000. When describing the state of [[news design]] in an interview at the time he was honored, Arnold said:

{{quote|I want to put on record that I'm not an old reprobate longing for a return of the good old days. I'm more of an old father who is disappointed that his kids are only reaching 98 percent of their potential and wants them to reach 101 percent. My message to young designers is this: Look kids, you can do better, but the only way to achieve your potential is to go back to - and understand - the basics. That sounds boring, but it's reality.}}The seminal work on the Gutenberg diagram (or Z pattern layout) is attributed to the typographer Edmund Arnold, who is said to have developed the concept in the 1950s.

An '''electronic portfolio''' (also known as an '''eportfolio''', '''e-portfolio''', '''digital portfolio''', or '''online portfolio''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/jobs/an-online-portfolio-can-showcase-your-work-career-couch.html |title= Career couch: Showcasing Your Work, in an Online Portfolio |work=[[The New York Times]] |last= Zimmerman |first= Eilene |date=30 June 2012 |accessdate= 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of electronic [[evidence]] assembled and managed by a user, usually on [[World Wide Web|the Web]]. Such electronic evidence may include input text, electronic files, images, [[multimedia]], [[blog]] entries, and [[hyperlink]]s. E-portfolios are both demonstrations of the user's abilities and platforms for self-expression. If they are online, users can maintain them dynamically over time.

One can regard an e-portfolio as a type of learning record that provides actual evidence of achievement. Learning records are closely related to the [[learning plan]], an emerging tool which individuals, teams, [[community of interest|communities of interest]], and organizations use to manage learning.{{cn|date=April 2016}} To the extent that a [[personal learning environment]] captures and displays a learning record, it may also operate as an electronic portfolio.

E-portfolios, like traditional [[career portfolio|portfolios]], can facilitate students' reflection on their own learning, leading to more awareness of learning strategies and needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Moon |first= Jenny| publisher= The Higher Education Academy | title= Guide for Busy Academics No. 4: Learning through reflection|url= http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/resource_database/id69_guide_for_busy_academics_no4_moon|accessdate= 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative research by [[Maarten van Wesel|M. van Wesel]] and A. Prop between paper-based portfolios and electronic portfolios in the same setting tentatively suggests that use of an electronic portfolio may lead to better [[learning outcomes]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|author=M. van Wesel &amp; A. Prop |year=2008 |title=The influence of Portfolio media on student perceptions and learning outcomes |publisher=Maastricht University |url=http://www.fdewb.unimaas.nl/EDUC/MASTER/Documents/Proceedings_S_ICT2008_Final.pdf#page=73 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229121030/http://www.fdewb.unimaas.nl/EDUC/MASTER/Documents/Proceedings_S_ICT2008_Final.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are three main types of e-portfolios, although they may be referred to using different terms:
*developmental (e.g., working)
*assessment
*showcase

A developmental e-portfolio can show the advancement of skill over a period of time [[rubric (academic)|rubric]]s. The main purpose is to provide an avenue for communication between student and instructor. An assessment portfolio will demonstrate skill and competence in a particular domain or area. A  showcase portfolio highlights stellar work in a specific area, it is typically shown to potential employers to gain employment. When it is used for job application it is sometimes called [[career portfolio]]. Most e-portfolios are a mix of the three main types to create a hybrid portfolio.

==Usage==
Today, electronic portfolios are gaining popularity in:
* [[School]]s (''see also'' [[Technology integration]])
* [[Higher education]]
* [[Continuing professional development]]
* Job applications/professional advertisements
* [[group therapy|Therapy group]]s
* Assessment
* Accreditation 
* [[Recognition of prior learning]] (RPL)

===In education===
In education, the electronic portfolio is a collection of a students' work that can advance learning by providing a way for them to organize, archive, and display work. The electronic format allows an instructor to evaluate student portfolios via the Internet, CD-ROM, DVD, or zip disk. Electronic portfolios have become a popular alternative to paper-based portfolios because they provide the opportunity to review, communicate and give feedback in an asynchronous manner. In addition, students are able to reflect on their work, which makes the experience of creating the e-portfolio meaningful. A student e-portfolio may be shared with a prospective employer or used to record the achievement of program or course specific learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=LorenzoIttelson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eli3001.pdf |title=An Overview of E-Portfolios |publisher=Educause |last=Lorenzo |first=George |last2=Ittelson |first2=John |date=2005 |accessdate=7 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102080117/https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI3001.pdf |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uses of e-portfolios are most common in the courses with departments of education.  Most preservice teachers are asked to compile an e-portfolio to demonstrate competencies needed to gain teaching certification or licensure. Student e-portfolios are increasingly being used in other disciplines such as communications, math, business, nursing, engineering and architecture. In education e-portfolios have six major functions:
* Document skills and learning;
* Record and track development within a program;
* Plan educational programs;
* Evaluate and monitor performance;
* Evaluate a course; 
* Find a job

In general e-portfolios promote critical thinking and support the development of technology literacy skills. Faculty now use e-portfolios to record course or discipline designs that may be shared with colleagues to promote teaching and learning. A teaching e-portfolio is used to showcase career accomplishments.&lt;ref name=LorenzoIttelson /&gt;.
Different sorts of files can be added here which the marking and other work is easier for the student as well as tutor.

E-portfolios also help to foster an independent and autonomous way of thinking, according to Strivens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/survey-e-pdp-and-e-portfolio-practice-uk-higher-education |last=Strivens |first=Janet |publisher=Higher Education Academy |title=A survey of e-pdp and e-portfolio practice in UK Higher Education |date=February 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in large part because people must focus on their collective work, think about how it will be portrayed, and what the work says about them as an individual.  The individual is then in charge of their learning and the choice of where to demonstrate their proficiency. People are also forced to reflect on what they have learned and how they plan to build and improve in the future.  This helps people to become better critical thinkers and helps them to develop their writing and multimedia skills.  Today, many students are using multimedia such as Facebook, Twitter, and texting—all informal settings.  The electronic portfolio, on the other hand, is a more formal setting where students must apply both their knowledge of how the web works and the message they want to convey. In this sense, students' use and comfort with the web at times can be a hindrance if they are not taught to use electronic portfolios in the correct fashion, suggests Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=C.|title=The Power of ‘e’:  Using e- Portfolios to Build Online Presentation Skills|journal=Innovate|date=2007|volume=3|issue=3|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities and schools are currently working to make sure that students are gaining practice and experience with electronic portfolios so that they are able to use them to the best of their ability. For example, in places like Michigan students can earn the MCOATT (Michigan Certificate of Outstanding Achievement in Teaching Technology) for submitting an electronic portfolio which demonstrates evidence of technology being used in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching with Technology|title=COATT: Preparing Teachers for the Evolving Classroom|url=http://www.coatt.net/|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consortium is an organization aimed to make Michigan one of the leaders in integrating technology into the training of young professionals.

===Other uses===
Some e-portfolio applications permit varying degrees of audience access, so the same portfolio might be used for multiple purposes. According to Anderson, e-portfolios can then go viral and be passed on to be easily viewed by many on the web.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. (2010) TED: Ideas Worth Spreading.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=July 2014}}

'''Ethnocinema''', from [[Jean Rouch]]’s ''cine-ethnography'' and ''ethno-fictions'',&lt;ref&gt;Rouch, Jean. 2003. ''Cine-Ethnography''. Translated and edited by Steven Feld. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging practice of [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] filmmaking being defined and extended by [[Melbourne, Australia]]-based writer and arts educator, [[Anne Harris (educator)|Anne Harris]], and others. Originally derived from the discipline of [[anthropology]], ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality, collaboration and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Race and Refugeity: Ethnocinema as Radical Pedagogy" in ''Qualitative Inquiry'' (ERA=B) Nov 1, 2010:16, pp. 768-777. http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/9/768.short&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's ethos claims that the role of anthropologists, and other cultural, media and educational researchers, must adapt to changing communities, transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century.

Ethno-cinematographers have also been associated with American historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] who has asserted that “all ethnographic representations are partial truths”.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus, (eds). 1986. ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley, CA: Univ of California Press., pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative ethnographic film and video projects are created with the intention of going beyond "preserving", "empowering" or "giving voice" to [[Marginalization|marginalised]] cultures, [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]], communities or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "‘You Could Do With A Little More Gucci’: Ethnographic Documentary Talks Back" in ''Creative Approaches to Research'', Vol 2:1, July 2009. Melbourne: RMIT Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; According to theorists, such voices already have [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and share community or agendas with ethnocinematic filmmakers. Ethnocinematic films primarily document "relationships"&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne and Nyuon, Nyadol: "Working It Both Ways: Intercultural Collaboration and the Performativity of Identity" ''The Australasian Review of African Studies'', Vol 31:1, June 2010. Pp 62-81. {{cite web |url=http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216144841/http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; between filmmakers from different cultures, or subcultures, who now share common space of a [[Politics|political]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Geography|geographical]] or [[Virtual world|virtual]] nature.
 
Ethno-cinematographers include [[Jean Rouch]], [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004.

== History ==

Tobing Rony identifies three modalities in early ethnographic representation&lt;ref&gt;Tobing Rony, Fatimah. 1996. ''The Third Eye: Race, Cinema and Ethnographic Spectacle''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, pg 195.&lt;/ref&gt; including “ethnographic inscription” (Regnault), “taxidermic mode” (Flaherty’s ''Nanook''), and “self-reflexive” (Rouch’s films of the 1950s){{Clarify|date=July 2012}}. Of these, Rouch’s films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema. Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century, among them American [[Bill Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Bill. 1994. ''Blurred Boundaries: questions of meaning in contemporary culture''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema is typical{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} of a shift toward destabilizing traditional notions of representation, both in the West/North and in cultures and communities which had historically been the subjects of such films, and in which indigenous and diasporic peoples are taking control of their own representations, or working (as in ethnocinema) in intercultural collaboration. In addition to Rouch, this includes the work of such ethnographers and intercultural filmmakers as [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and others.  More recently, indigenous filmmakers such as [[Essie Coffey]] (Australia) are collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works. Working against the [[observational cinema]] tradition, these filmmakers are all acknowledging and deconstructing Minh-ha’s observation that “Everywhere we go, we become someone’s private zoo”,&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, T. (1996) "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist literary theory: a reader''. (ed.) Eagleton, Mary. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pg 394.&lt;/ref&gt; and theorists like Harris continue to draw on her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Anne | year = | title = Someone's Private Zoo: Ethnocinema and the Other | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of early attempts to define ethnocinema include the 1972 "ethnocinematic experiment" of Sol Worth and John Adair documented in "American Indians and the ethnocinematic complex: From native participation to production control",&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L. 1989. "American Indians and the Ethnocinematic Complex: From Native Participation to Production Control". in ''Eyes Across the Water'', edited by R. M. Boonzajer Flaes. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis. Pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which seven co-participants of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage were given video cameras and asked to make films which were ‘Indian’; these films, however, were framed by essentialising notions of Other and did not seek to go beyond the researcher/researched [[dichotomy]]. Tobing Rony (1996) and Sam Pack (2000) consider developments in Indigenous media in relation to the anthropological notion of “native authenticity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = Sam | year = 2000 | title = Indigenous media then and now: Situating the Navajo film project | doi = 10.1080/10509200009361497 | journal = Quarterly Review of Film and Video | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 273–286 [274] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why such essentialising notions are increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century’s ethnocinematic context. Yet the ability to truly collaborate in ethnographic research remains a contentious notion in anthropological and other circles, as ethnographic documentary scholar [[Jay Ruby]] asserts; what he calls ''Ethnographic Cinema'' must, he claims “be the work of academically educated and academically employed socio-cultural anthropologists”.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, J. ''Ethnographic Cinema (EC) - A Manifesto / A Provocation''  (n.d.)   {{cite web |url=http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195720/http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}. (Retrieved on: 17 May 2009), para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By Ruby’s reckoning, what is emerging as ethnocinema has almost nothing to do with ethnographic films. By this definition, even Jean Rouch doesn’t qualify.

Conversely, Rouch encouraged the potential of ethnographic film as a “celebration of a relationship” between filmmaker and imaged, in which the “rapport and participation”&lt;ref&gt;Rouch 2003, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; between both parties enhances any end-product that is collectively achieved. Loizos’s{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} claim (like Ruby’s) that contemporary filmmakers blur the lines between "authentic" ethnography and general [[documentary]] seems increasingly out of place. Traditional ethnographic filmmaking as a tool of anthropological researchers seeking to bring the stories of “distant peoples to audiences in North America and Europe”&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Karl G. 2006. ''Ethnographic Film''. Austin: University of Texas Press, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly outmoded in a culture of [[YouTube]] and [[social networking]] sites screaming for video content.{{Why|date=July 2012}}

=== Toward a contemporary ethnocinema: some contradictions ===
The confusion continues. By 2006, there are still scant references to ethnocinema and they frequently conflict. One online [[blog]] characterises a Burmese festival as “a surrealist anti-documentary, with no voice-over, odd visual juxtapositions, and none of the quasi-academic tone that afflicts so much ''official ethno cinema''”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. 2006. "Burmese Daze". Originally published in ''The Strange Attractor Journal'', No. 4. http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2007-04-01-1746-0.txt. (Retrieved on: 19 September 2009), para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  An abstract for an academic paper on the ritual branding of [[Andean cattle]] in [[Peru]] refers to the paper as an “ethnocinematographical study in which we reinterpret, with and in the film” the acts which they have recorded filmically, using the video cameras as “observation instruments”,&lt;ref&gt;Reyna, Carlos. 2005. ''Cinema e Antropologia: Novos diálogos metodológicos na interpretação de um ritual andino''. Biblioteca online de ciências da comunicação. http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/reyna-carlos-cinema-antropologia.pdf. (Retrieved on: 10 September 2009), pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt; none of which characterizes contemporary ethnocinematic work.

Several recent European [[film festival]]s list among their offerings the category of ethnocinema, without giving examples or defining the term. Still other contemporary film festivals appear to use the terms ''ethnographic'' and ''ethnocinematic'' interchangeably, which only adds to the confusion. In 2001, ''Notes From the Underground'', [[Goran Gocić]]’s insider look at the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], appeared in which he discusses what he alternatively calls ''ethno-cinema'' and then just "''ethno''". A ''[[Modern Language Association Review]]'' article opined, "The appeal of Kusturica's films … is that of "ethno" cinema, a cinema rooted in local traditions but expressed in "Western" form. This liberal political engagement with exotic subject matter is nonetheless, argues Gocić, an empowerment of the marginal."&lt;ref&gt;Haymes, Peter. 2004. "Review of ''Notes from the Underground: The Cinema of Emir Kusturica''". ''The Modern Language Review'', January. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7026/is_1_99/ai_n28245389/. (Retrieved on: 9 September 2009), pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

and from a far less favourable online book review:
he invests considerably more time to embracing instead his own recurring but vague references to 'ethno-cinema' as a base context from which Kusturica is operating (and by which Gocic seems to mean to have it both ways: indulging in [[exoticism]] and critiquing others' supposed essentializing). The only specific examples he offers to define this category are a handful of big budget Hollywood films involving Native Americans.''&lt;ref&gt;Karl, Brian Bernard. 2004. "Capturing Kusturica: On Gocić’s ''The Cinema of Kusturica''", ''Film Philosophy'', vol. 8, no. 12, 2004, para 24. http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol8-2004/n12karl. (Retrieved on: 20 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gocić himself says that, “inside film history itself, ethno cinema is the most exciting cinematic concept that the world has had to offer in the past two decades: aesthetically, it is difficult to argue against”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, Goran. 2001. ''The Cinema of Emir Kusturica: Notes from the Underground''. London: Wallflower Press, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, throughout the text his attempts to define ethnocinema contradict and obscure any practical working definition.  Gocić identifies "ethno" as having been around since the 1950s and as being typified by a sense of the “local”, including local motifs, but frequently made for a Western audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, only nine pages later he locates the birth of "ethno cinema" “in the late 1970s and early 1980s solely judging by the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] winners, which were Italian at the end of the 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gocić does attempt to characterise and define his version of ''ethno cinema'' with the following: “nostalgia,” (as a search for the “‘lost ‘authenticity’ of primitivism”), “intertextuality, openness and subjectivity (as postmodern characteristics), incredulity (or denial of ideology), and ‘double coding' or unexpected, surrealist, incongruous elements”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema, then, suggests that the voices/images of "women/natives/others"&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, Trinh T. 1996. "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist Literary Theory: A Reader'', edited by M. Eagleton. Cambridge MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; have something in common, and have agency in contributing to ethnographic film, whether independently or collaboratively, interculturally or intra-culturally. Current attempts to offer a working definition of ethnocinema may share more with the more recent movement of intercultural cinema which emerged around 1990. [[Laura Marks]] identifies this emergence as connected to three main factors: “the rise of multiculturalism … availability of funding … and an intellectual climate characterised by the disintegration of master narratives and a growing conceptualisation of knowledge as partial and contested”.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Laura U. 2000. ''The skin of the film: intercultural cinema, embodiment, and the senses''. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its filmic and academic antecedents, ethnocinema is emerging, and – as Rouch has repeatedly shown us – "the other cannot be denied" as his/her image and means of production transforms.

In ethnocinema there is the belief that in the relationship which emerges through the shared project, both self and Other are understood and represented in newly constructed ways.  One way of disrupting traditional ethnographic documentary [[voyeurism]] is in making transparent the intercultural relationship normally shrouded behind the scenes. [[Gwendolyn A. Foster|Foster’s]] contention that controlling the means of production is "foregrounding subjectivity",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Gwendolyn A. 1997. ''Women Filmmakers of the African and Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is limited.  It presumes a one-way relationship between the content and construction of all ethnographic films (including ethnocinematic ones), and assumes that by creating the films the subject is empowered and the gaze is recast.  It ignores the complex relationship between reception and production, and classifies films created by marginalised filmmakers as more authentic, or even automatically transgressive in a dominant culture.   This cannot be assumed, either in content or reception.  We have moved well beyond [[orientalism]] and the temporary inability of the Other to represent her or himself, so that "they must therefore be represented by others",&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. 2000. ''Reflections on exile and other essays''. Boston: Harvard University Press, pg 206.&lt;/ref&gt; but similarly it cannot be assumed that self-representation is automatically "authentic" or an end in itself. In ethnocinema, relationship and process always take precedence over formal considerations.  Obviously, to achieve a wide viewing audience, formal concerns cannot be completely ignored, but these aesthetic concerns are addressed ''together'' in the co-creation of the films. In ethnocinema, there is no perception of a conflict between its ethnographic and [[popular culture]] characteristics. It remains ethnographic because it is grounded in cultural specificity, which is not essentialist and can be always-changing.  It does not seek to "document" a culture, as in ethnocinema culture is understood to be varied, diverse and always emerging.

=== Ethnocinema: new directions ===

In ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology'', Ruby calls for places where “critical standards are debated and canons develop”,&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2000. ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pg 23. Original edition, 1975 article.&lt;/ref&gt; and the need for ethnographic filmmakers to generate a set of critical standards analogous to those for written ethnographies. Harris agrees, and says that standards are needed, but diverges from Ruby’s definition in two important ways: firstly as a call to ethnocinematic filmmakers (whether academic or non-academic) that films included in this category must prioritise a post-colonial collaborative relationship between makers and imaged; and secondly, that Ruby’s so-called “marketplace considerations”&lt;ref&gt;Ruby 2000, pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt; need not pollute the product which is made. Ruby proposed in 2008 that “anthropologists should simply relinquish the term ethnographic to professional documentary filmmakers and seek another term to characterize their efforts”;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2008. "Towards an Anthropological Cinema": a talk given at the 2008 Nordic Anthropological Film Association Meetings in Ísafjörur, Iceland, June 6, 2008 (pg 3). www.media-anthropology.net/ruby_anthrocinema.pdf. (Retrieved on 10 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; while Harris proposes that ethnographic is being superseded by ''ethnocinematic'' filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Too Tall, Too Dark, Too Something: New Racism in Australian Schools" in ''Trauma, Media, Art: New Perspectives'' (Eds) Broderick, M &amp; Traverso, A.  Cambridge Scholars Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4438-2283-3}}, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etta Zuber Falconer''' (21 November 1933 – 19 September 2002) was an educator and mathematician the bulk of whose career was spent at [[Spelman College]], where she eventually served as department head and associate [[Provost (education)|provost]].  She  was one of the earlier [[African-American]] women to receive a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics.&lt;ref name= "BWM"&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/falconner_ettaz.html Black men In Mathematics: Etta Zuber Falconer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Etta Zuber was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to Walter A. Zuber, a [[physician]], and Zadie  L. Montgomery Zuber, a [[musician]].&lt;ref name= "MAA"&gt;[http://www.maa.org/summa/archive/falconer.htm Biography at The Mathematical Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt; The Zubers had two daughters, with Etta being the younger and Alice the older.  While teaching at Okolona Junior College in [[Okolona, Mississippi]], Etta met and married Dolan Falconer, a basketball coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackengineer.com/Editorial/EttaFalconer.shtml Spelman's Legendary Math and Science Professor Passes On]&lt;/ref&gt;  They had three children – Dolan Falconer Jr., who became a [[nuclear engineer]]; Alice Falconer Wilson, a [[pediatrician]]; and Walter Zuber Falconer, a [[urologist]].&lt;ref name= "MAA2" /&gt;  The couple's marriage lasted over 35 years, ended by Dolan's death.

==Education==
Etta Falconer attended the Tupelo public school system, graduating from [[Carver High School (Tupelo, Missisippi)|Carver High School]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="High School"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrow |first1=Charlene |last2=Perl |first2=Teri |title=Notable Women in Mathematics: A Biographical Dictionary |date=1998 |isbn=9780313291319 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MAA" /&gt;
At the age of 15 she entered [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she [[academic major|majored]] in mathematics and [[academic minor|minored]] in chemistry, graduating ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' in 1953.&lt;ref name= "MAA" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "MAA2"&gt;[http://www.maa.org/pubs/sept03pdf.pdf Etta Zuber Falconer (1933-2002) (PDF, 29 pages)]&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Fisk, Falconer was inducted into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society.&lt;ref name= "BWM" /&gt;

She went on to study at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], where she earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in mathematics in 1954.  Lonely in Wisconsin, she decided not to pursue her doctorate there and returned to Mississippi to teach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/fyi/teachers.tools/03/20/efalconer/Etta Zuber Falconer – Mathematician, Educator]&lt;/ref&gt; After a 1965 family move to Atlanta, she entered [[graduate school]] at [[Emory University]].  At Emory she earned a [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics in 1969, with a [[dissertation]] on [[abstract algebra]].

To assist in setting up a [[computer science]] department while mathematics department head at [[Spelman College]], she returned to graduate school at [[Atlanta University]], earning a Master of Science degree in computer science in 1982.&lt;ref name= "IPC"&gt;[http://www.ipcmath.org/documents/IPC05Proceedings.pdf "Promoting Diversity in the Mathematical Sciences", Infinite Possibilities Conference (PDF, 77 pages)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching career==
Falconer began her teaching career in 1954 at Okolona Junior College, where she met and married Dolan Falconer.  She remained at Okolona until 1963, when she accepted a position at Howard High School in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where she taught the academic year 1963-64.  When her husband was offered a coaching position at [[Morris Brown College]] in 1965, the family moved to Atlanta, also the site of [[Spelman College]], an [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] women's college.

Falconer's mother had studied at Spelman, and Falconer approached the head of the mathematics department, telling him that she wanted to teach there.&lt;ref name= "BWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "StA"/&gt;  She was appointed an instructor in 1965.  Falconer advanced to [[Professor|associate professor]], leaving Spelman in 1971 to join the mathematics department at [[Norfolk State University]], where she taught for the academic year 1971-1972.  Falconer returned to Spelman as professor of mathematics and head of the mathematics department.&lt;ref name= "StA"&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Falconer.html Biography at University of St Andrews School of Mathematics and Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Falconer devoted 37 years of her life to teaching mathematics and improving science education at Spelman College.  In 1995, she stated: "My entire career has been devoted to increasing the number of African American women in mathematics and mathematics-related careers."&lt;ref name= "BWM" /&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 1995, Falconer was honored by the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]], who awarded her the [[Louise Hay Award]] for outstanding achievements in mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm-math.org/hayaward/1995.html 5th Louise Hay Award, Citation for Etta Z. Falconer]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, she received the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/mentor/mentor_winners.shtml AAAS Mentor Award Recipients]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6974">The '''European Training Programs''' '''Certification''' &amp; '''Examination''' ('''Uniform ETP Exam''') is the examination administered to most people who wish to become ''' Certified Public Training Accountants for Banking, Management of Human Resource, Or Information &amp; STATICO''' in the '''European Union'''. The Uniform '''ETP''' Exam is developed and maintained by the '''International European Institute of Management &amp; Commerce''' ('''IEMC'''), and is administered by the '''National Association of Management''' ('''ISG'''). The '''ETP exam''' is used by the regulatory bodies of all [[European Union]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ghana]], Congo, [[Lebanon]], and [[Jordan]].

==History==
Until the 1990s, the Uniform '''ETP''' Exam was a 19 and a half hour test given over a three-day period, consisting of four subject areas (sections), which were tested in five sittings:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-presentation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; '''Auditing''' (3.5 hours); '''Business Law''' (3.5 hours); '''Human Resource Theory''' (3.5 hours); and''' STATICO''' Practice (Part I &amp; Part II; 4.5 hours each). Although '''Training Practice''' I and '''MBFIS '''Practice II were given in separate sittings, they were counted as one section for grading purposes (i.e., five exam parts, resulting in four separate scores). In '''1994''', the exam was restructured into a four-section, two-day exam. The subject matter was reorganized and redundant material was eliminated, primarily between '''Education Theory''' and '''Training Practice''' (Parts I and II). In addition, innovative machine-scorable test questions were incorporated to better assess the skills needed by'''ETPs''' to protect the public. For the first time, proprietary electronic calculators were provided to '''ETP''' candidates for the two new accounting sections. The four new sections were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilc-et.com/european-training-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Human Resource''' and Professional Responsibilities
* '''Management Information Systems'''
* '''Accounting and Reporting Banking''' – Taxation, Financial Managerial, and Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-deroulement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Financial Accounting and Reporting''' – Business Enterprises
Until '''1996''', completely new versions of the '''ETP Exam''' were prepared every Three months, and after each administration all questions and the keyed responses (correct answers) were published and available for purchase. Beginning with the May 1996 administration, almost all exam material was kept secure so that many high-quality questions could be reused. Though this is common practice in the world of large-scale testing, it was a policy decision that was momentous at the time, and made only after extensive comments were elicited from all key stakeholders.

==Sections and topics covered==
The sections have been reorganized as follows:
* '''Management Of Banking &amp; Finance International Systems''' (4.5 hours): (MBFIS) – This section covers knowledge of planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications.
* '''Management of Human Resource''' (4.0 hours):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/european-training-programs.html [ Brochure for ISG.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; (MHR) – This section covers knowledge of concepts and standards for Management Human Resource statements, typical items in MHR statements, specific types of transactions and events, letters and reporting for governmental agencies, and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations.
*''' STATICO''' (4.0 hours): (REG) – This section covers knowledge of statics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation – individuals, and Federal taxation – entities.
* '''[[Management Information Systems]]''' (4.5 hours): (MIS) – This section covers knowledge of business structures, MIS concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement.
The Uniform '''ETP Exam''' tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature—such as '''Management''', '''auditing''' and '''accounting standards''', the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code—that are universally adopted by all European Union jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialnewsline.com/finance/changes-to-the-cpa-exam-in-january-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Every effort is made to avoid asking about subject matter that may have different correct answers in different jurisdictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10810">'''Global Management Challenge''' ('''GMC''') is a strategic management competition for managers and university students. Participants form teams of 3-5 members, and each team is placed in a group of 5-8 teams, depending the competition. The teams are then given a virtual company, initially identical to every other company in the competition. Each team then develops their company by making a series of decisions relating to every aspect of the business, such as how many machines to buy, or how much to spend on advertising. In each round, five sets of decisions are taken, corresponding to five quarters. A quarter is a period said to span three months.

These decisions - made on the Decision Sheet - are run through sophisticated business simulation software, which generates in-depth Management Reports, showing the consequences of the decisions. The aim is to finish the game with the highest share-price on the virtual stock exchange.

The competition is divided into rounds with usually 3 or 4 rounds on national level and 2 rounds on international level. The number of national rounds can vary in each country and depends on number of participants. Some countries use slightly different approach and combine Global Management Challenge with other competitions. In India teams compete in another competition which is more sector related (e.g. they run a car manufacturing company) and the last 8 teams join GMC national final. Also in Germany the participants play GMC only in their final round. As it might seem interesting it brings disadvantage to those teams because they are not so familiar with the simulation compared to other teams on the international level.

== History ==

The concept of the competition emerged in 1980 in Portugal by SDG – Simuladores e Modelos de Gestão – in partnership with [[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]], a weekly newspaper.  The GMC computer model was designed by [http://www.edit515.co.uk Edit 515 Limited], registered in [[Scotland]], U.K.  It is updated frequently to reflect real world trading conditions and business risks, the aim being to present competitors with very realistic and complex business scenarios, with varied challenges and problems.

The Global Management Challenge is now the world's biggest strategic management competition - 20000 participants annually. More than 400,000 university students and company managers around the world participated since 1980.

Thirty-three countries currently participate in the contest: [[Angola]], [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Greece]], [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR (China)]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Macau|Macau SAR (China)]], [[Mexico]], [[Morocco]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Venezuela]].

For the 2010-2011 session, two new African countries are entering the contest: [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], in partnership with Educarriere.net, a leading website in Ivory Coast which have been famous because it used to publish the result of many exams.

Each country organizes its own National competition, the model producing all material in the language of that country. The winners of the National competition meet to contest the International Semi-Finals and, if successful, go on to compete in the International Final (with results still in each of the countries' native language).

== World Champions ==
In 1980—the first year of the competition—only Portuguese teams competed. For the next two years, the GMC winner was decided by a Luso-Brazilian final, between Portugal and Brazil. Brazil won in 1981 and Portugal won in 1982. Since 1983, the winner has been decided at an International Final, hosted by one of the competing countries. The winners of each year's competition are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldgmc.com/index.php?cid=*F3350FAB648C17BC17B2A62C690F1370BCD6171C&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7912">The '''Hamlyn Lectures''' are a series of [[public lectures]] in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland given annually on a legal topic. The lectures have been given every year since 1949.

== History ==
The '''Hamlyn Trust''' was established in 1948 by the will of Miss Emma Hamlyn in memory of her father, a solicitor and JP in Torquay. The trust was to further&lt;blockquote&gt;among the Common People of this Country of the knowledge of the Comparative Jurisprudence and the Ethnology of the Chief European countries including our own and the circumstances of the growth of such Jurisprudence to the intent that the Common People of our Country may realise the privileges which in law and custom they enjoy in comparison with other European Peoples and realising and appreciating such privileges may recognize the responsibilities and obligations attaching to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/TheHamlynLegacy.pdf|title=The Hamlyn Legacy|last=Stebbings|first=Chantal|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Initially there was doubt as to whether the trust was valid, but the High Court approved a scheme for the administration of the trust in 1948, which followed closely the wording of the will.

'''Henry Cook''' (23 October 1893 – 9 January 1917), sometimes known as '''Harry Cook''', was an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[wing half]] in the [[The Football League|Football League]] for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;{{cite book |title = Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939|last = Joyce|first = Michael|publisher = Tony Brown|year = 2012|isbn = 190589161X|location = Nottingham|page = 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played for [[South Bank F.C.|South Bank]] and appeared as a guest for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 Years Of Brentford|last=|first=|publisher=Brentford FC|year=1989|isbn=0951526200|editor-last=White|editor-first=Eric|location=|page=363|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8327">[[File:Houanden in Makabe.jpg|thumb|250px|Hō-an-den in a school in [[Sakuragawa, Ibaraki|Sakuragawa]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]; Greek temple type]]
In [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], between the 1910s and 1945, a {{Nihongo|'''Hō-an-den'''|奉安殿}} was a small [[Shinto shrine|shrine]]- or [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temple]]-like building that housed a photograph of the incumbent Emperor and Empress ([[Emperor Meiji]], [[Emperor Taishō]], [[Emperor Shōwa]], [[Empress Shōken]], [[Empress Teimei]] and [[Empress Kōjun]]) together with a copy of the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]].  A Hō-an-den was typically installed at [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary schools]], though also at a number of other institutions. This served as a place for the [[Arahitogami|veneration]] of the [[Emperor of Japan]].

==History==
Dissemination of photographs of the Emperor and Empress of Japan started after the publication of the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] on 30 October 1890. This 315 character document was read aloud at all important school events, and pupils were required to study and memorize the text. On ceremonial days, such as [[National Foundation Day]], the [[The Emperor's Birthday|Emperor's Birthday]] and [[Japanese New Year|New Year's Day]], it was customary to make a deep, respectful bow to the photograph of the Emperor and Empress.  In the [[Taishō era]] and [[Shōwa era]] before the end of [[World War II]], the birthday of [[Emperor Meiji]], November 3, was an additional day of celebration. On these occasions, the school principal read the Imperial Rescript on Education. All, when passing in front of the Hō-an-den, were required to take a deep bow, correcting their uniforms.
[[File:原新化尋常小學校御真影奉安殿.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Hō-an-den, previously at Harashinka Elementary school, [[Tainan]], [[Formosa]]]]

==Types==
Earlier, a ''Hō-an-sho'' was established in elementary schools, inside the auditorium or in the teachers' office; inside were placed pictures of the Emperor and Empress together with the Imperial Rescript on Education. However, there were cases of fires which endangered the photographs. In the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], some photographs burned and principals committed suicide in atonement. As a separate structure, there were various types of Hō-an-den, including a [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek temple]]-style and [[Shinto shrine]] type. In 1933, there was a Hō-an-den competition. In elementary schools, independent small buildings or Hō-an-den were preferred, while in higher schools such as [[Secondary education in Japan|middle schools]], a ''hō-an-ko'' or [[safe]] might be preferred, installed within the existing school buildings.

==Standards==
The standard Hō-an-den should be built near the principal's office, staff room or duty room, outside the building; the minimum interior space should be 85&amp;nbsp;cm from the front to the back, 1.5 meter high and 1.2 meter in width; construction should be in [[reinforced concrete]], with walls more than 25&amp;nbsp;cm thick.  The Ho-an-den should be equipped with a safe-type door, and the interior should be resistant to fire and earthquake, with [[asbestos]], and covered inside with wood such as ''[[Chamaecyparis obtusa]]'' or ''[[Paulownia tomentosa]]''. The height of the container for the photograph was to be 50&amp;nbsp;cm.

==Maintenance==
The maintenance of the photographs of the Emperor and Empress was the utmost duty of the principal of the schools. There were cases of principals committing suicide when the photograph of the Emperor and Empress was burned.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}  Because of marked humidity within the Ho-an-den, some photographs became stained, and in that case, a written explanation was necessary.

==Other Hō-an-den==
In the early part of the 1940s, a Ho-an-den was erected inside [[Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium]], a [[leprosarium]].&lt;ref&gt;National Hansen's disease Museum[2010:45]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
Immediately after the end of [[World War II]], educational reforms were issued by the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]], namely the prohibition of the support of National shintoism on November 15 and the return of the photographs of the Emperor and Empress on December 28, and the order of the destruction of the Hō-an-den (on February 18, 1946 in Kumamoto City).&lt;ref&gt;Kumamoto City[1997:Tsūshihen, 8, Gendai, 488-491]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hō-an-den were destroyed or buried, while a small number of them were left as they were, and some of them were designated as local war memorials. Because Hō-an-den were so strongly built, Kumamoto city ordered that the roof parts should be completely destroyed and the feeling of sacred places should not be left, and it might be left if it was used for the purpose of warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;Kumamoto City[2003:Tsūshihen, 8, Gendai, 489-490]&lt;/ref&gt; There were ceremonies when the photographs of the Emperor and the Empress were burned. The copies of the Imperial Rescript on Education, distributed in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] were brought back to the building of the Ministry of Education in September 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Kumamoto City[1997:Tsushihen, 8, Gendai, 490]&lt;/ref&gt; while the photographs of the Emperor and the Empress were collected and burned in a ceremony on February 2, 1946 at Sekidai Elementary School.&lt;ref&gt;Kumamoto City[2003:7-3-pp.1019]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], teachers held a burning ceremony of photographs of the Emperor and the Empress. In [[Miyakojima, Okinawa]], it was on August 31, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1998:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remnants==
Some Hō-an-den were transferred to other places such as shrines. A number are now used as memorial monuments to the deceased. Preserved Hō-an-den may be found not only within the current territorial boundaries of Japan, but also in [[Sakhalin]], Taiwan, and Brazil (though not in Manchuria). In Kumamoto Prefecture, five Hō-an-den and one Hō-an-ko (safe-type) have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Fumio Uemura[[2010:49-52,165-166,167,168,169,170]]&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve surviving examples have been [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Categories of registered Cultural Properties|registered for protection as Tangible Cultural Properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index_pc.asp |title=Database of National Cultural Properties (search term: 奉安殿) |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6373">A '''Human Capital Contract''' (or "HCC") is a finance product that allows for the provision of funds to an individual through an "equity-like" arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa462.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the provider of the funds receives a portion of the individual's future income for some specified period of time.  Human Capital Contracts have been advocated by a number of Nobel Prize-winning economists, including [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]], and [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, Miguel. "Investing in Human Capital".  Cambridge University Press, 2004.  {{ISBN|0-521-03952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] in [[The Wealth of Nations]] described the knowledge and skills of workers as a form of [[Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lumni.net/about/palacios.pdf|title = Human Capital Contracts "Equity-like" Instruments for Financing Higher Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Capital Contracts are characterized by an initial investment amount by the capital provider, followed by a series of periodic dividend payments made from the receiver of the capital to the provider.  These payments are variable in amount, proportional with the capital receiver's income, and may never total the initial investment amount made the capital provider.  In contrast, a [[loan]] is a form of [[debt]], characterized by interest payments based on a fixed principal amount, where the repayment of the principal is a necessary condition of the loan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmifellows.org/research/EN_S/26-EN-SUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Yale University attempted to replace traditional student loans with human capital contracts under its "Tuition Postponement Option", a program designed by economists Milton Friedman and James Tobin.  However, the program was eventually abandoned as a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Yale to Erase Alumni Debts In 2 Loan Plans, New York Times, April 13, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  Other attempts to use human capital contracts (or student loans with equity-like payoffs) to fund students, have also generally failed because of severe [[adverse selection]] problems — students who opt into such programs are generally those who expect to pursue low-income careers, and are least likely to be able to repay their loans.  In addition, Human Capital Contracts, like income taxes, can contribute to moral hazard, by discouraging borrowers from maximizing their income and encouraging them instead to focus on non-wage based forms of compensation, such as more enjoyable work, better benefits, or lighter schedules.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a number of companies have begun to attempt to commercially underwrite Human Capital Contracts for the first time, including some that are not focused on funding a student population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frugaltopia.com/education/a-new-kind-of-student-loan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cumulusfunding.com/resources/&lt;/ref&gt;

Anand Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, proposed the use of human capital contracts to fund U.S. medical education in their article in ''The Huffington Post'' entitled: "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/healthcare-reform-solving_b_874651.html Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts]".&lt;ref&gt;Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts  By Anand Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, The Huffington Post, June 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The Reddi-Thyssen plan is being vetted by the American Medical Association.  The University of California system is also currently evaluating Human Capital Contracts as a possible solution for providing more affordable, sustainable tuition assistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fixuc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a plan to use human capital contracts in global health.&lt;ref&gt;Human capital contracts for global health: a plan to increase the number of physicians in resource limited settings.  AIDS. 2012 Sep 24;26(15):1979-80.  {{PMID|22992581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparing the merits of Human Capital Contracts with loans, proponents have noted that providers of HCCs are better aligned with the financial interests of the receiver of the funds, and the stream of payments required should be relatively more affordable to individuals who experience adverse economic events such as unemployment or other decreases in disposable income.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawschooltuitionbubble.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/thoughts-on-human-capital-contracts/&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to conventional consumer loan structures, however, the regulatory framework related to Human Capital Contracts is underdeveloped and has thus far prevented widespread proliferation of the product despite considerable academic research.&lt;ref&gt;http://chadkdej.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/making-financial-innovation-socially-useful/&lt;/ref&gt;. However work is underway in the UK to combine the benefits of Human Capital Contracts with the legal framework developed for loans under the Consumer Credit Act. It is estimated that this will improve both borrowing costs and returns by lowering the default rate. https://stepex.io/whitepaper/

The '''European Institute of International Relations''' (Institut Européen des Relations Internationales IERI) is an independent research center, providing training and debates on major international issues. It was established in 1997. 

IERI's areas of study and research cover different fields of international relations, including economic, political, strategic and security aspects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieri.be/fr/about |title=Qui sommes-nous ? &amp;#124; IERI |publisher=Ieri.be |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IERI is a founder of an institution of higher education named ADE (Academia Diplomatica Europaea), organizing conferences and representing  a forum for diplomats, military and senior officials.

== Objectives==

The IERI's initiatives are preserved in the perspective of the emergence of diplomatic, geopolitical and strategic culture according to the provisions related to the European External Action Service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieri.be/fr/ade/presentation |title=Présentation &amp;#124; IERI |publisher=Ieri.be |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

At the beginning of 1990, following the German and European reunification, the activation of a political role of the European Community led to a new impetus of European integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/treaties_maastricht_fr.htm |title=Traité de Maastricht sur l'Union européenne |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the year 1992, now named the European Union had in its hands the first tools to assert its existence on the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touteleurope.eu/fr/actions/relations-exterieures/politique-etrangere-et-de-defense/presentation/la-politique-etrangere-et-de-securite-commune-pesc.html |title=Toute l'Europe: La politique étrangère et de sécurité commune (PESC) |publisher=Touteleurope.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is in this perspective that has placed a University professor, Mr. Irnerio Seminatore in the creation of the European Institute of International Relations.

== Organization ==
* '''Disciplinary Fields'''

The studies of IERI include 3 areas: 

# analysis of political and military strategies with the focus on foreign policy, defence and security policy (CFSP/PCSD), including Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asiatic relations

The '''Immanuel Beit Yaakov controversy''' concerns the founding of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] girls' school in the town and [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] of [[Immanuel (town)|Immanuel]] in September 2007. A [[Shas]] Sephardi girls' school, "Ohel Rachel VeLeah", was also founded in Immanuel in September 2007.&lt;ref name="Opinion: Emanuel Isn't Little Rock" /&gt; Although the Hasidic school was founded and attended by members of both the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities,&lt;ref name="bhol1" /&gt; with Rav Shimon Ba'adani as final Rabbinic authority,&lt;ref name="behadrei1" /&gt; the Hasidic school was sued by Yoav Lallum, who does not reside in Immanuel,&lt;ref name="shemayisrael1" /&gt; and his group "Noar KeHalacha", with assistance from the [[New Israel Fund]]&lt;ref name="nif1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIF Exposing Racism"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exposing Racism in Israel's Ultra-Orthodox Schools |publisher=[[New Israel Fund]] |url=http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817081551/http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99 |archivedate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=5 May 2010 |title=Court Orders Emmanuel School to Explain Continued Segregation |url=http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/stories/court-orders-emmanuel.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905145530/http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/stories/court-orders-emmanuel.html |archivedate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Tmura" and "Achoti" organizations;&lt;ref name="jewishideas" /&gt; the allegation—that this was solely an ethnic split between Sephardim and Ashkenazim.&lt;ref name="court1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt;

Attorney Mordechai Bass was sent by the Ministry of Education in January 2008 to investigate the allegations of discrimination. Bass concluded: "I am convinced that there is no ethnic discrimination.... When ethnic discrimination actually occurs, we must combat it with all our might. I express my sorrow about complaints like these – thrown in the air – that increase hatred among Israel, and are totally baseless."&lt;ref name="Bass report"&gt;[http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/Attrorney%20Mordechai%20Bass%27%20evaluation.pdf Bass report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the fathers of the girls who attend the Hasidic school, one-third of whom are Sephardi,&lt;ref name="The Haredi World's New Heroes"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/MagazineFeatures/Article.aspx?id=180822 The Haredi World's New Heroes]&lt;/ref&gt; were jailed by the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] without a trial. There was no hearing, no cross-examination of palintiffs or defendants.&lt;ref name="tragedy of sentencing error"&gt;[http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-49148-00.html?tag=02-34-4549210-00.html?tag=02-33-07 tragedy of sentencing error]&lt;/ref&gt; They were released before the end of their sentence when large-scale protests against what was alleged to be an inhumane and illegal incarceration swept the country. Secular journalist [[Nahum Barnea]] described the court decision as one "made not from the heart, nor from the head, but rather from the belly".

Understanding the expansion of power of the Israeli Supreme Court in the 1990s assists in understanding the Immanuel Beit Yaakov topic. "The Supreme Court ... operates under Aharon Barak's dictum that the Court can hear a case brought by anyone about anything — unlike most countries, such as the US, where a person has to be affected by something in order to bring it to court."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/04/15/emanuel-further-reading/ Cross-Currents: Emanuel: Further Reading]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Aviad Visoli argues that the fact that the Israel Supreme Court held no hearing renders the court's decision illegal. "Each parent should have had a separate trial and been able to give testimony. They were not granted their day in court, not in actuality, not under the law."&lt;ref name="news1.co.il"&gt;[http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-49148-00.html?tag=02-34-4549210-00.html?tag=02-33-07 Tragedy of sentencing error]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sephardi parents of the Hasidic school had presented an emergency appeal to appear before the Supreme Court. They point out that every family was invited to apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/R.%20Stern%27s%20invitation%20to%20apply.pdf] Invitation to apply to either the original or Hasidic Beit Yaakov&lt;/ref&gt; Their request to appear before the court was denied.

The court has since approved a separate school for the Haredi girls in the 2010–2011 academic year, albeit without funding.

==Incident==

===Background===
The Immanuel Beit Yaakov hosts a population of girl students from both [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardic]] schools of Judaism, with many of the parents of the Ashkenazi students coming from the [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hxITkg7pteFI6iSdEpIKJGbIA5oQ|title = Some 50,000 ultra-Orthodox rally in Israel|author = Michael Blum|publisher = AFP|date = 2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim educational institutions are open to all who agree to abide by their school by-laws.&lt;ref name="The Sledgehammer Approach"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=178999 "The Sledgehammer Approach"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2007 two new schools were founded: the Beis Yaakov Chasidi and Ohel Rachel VeLeah. The Beis Yaakov Chasidi consisted of first through eighth grades, and was placed in the vacated part of the original Beis Yaakov that had housed the high school until the high school got its own building in 2004. The Ohel Rachel and Leah, a Shas-Mayan Sephardic school,&lt;ref name="Opinion: Emanuel Isn't Little Rock"/&gt; was located on the first floor of this new high school, had a first grade in 2007, (see Bass report, page 6 paragraph 12)&lt;ref name="Bass report"/&gt; becoming a fully graded school in 2009.

Rav Shimon Ba'adani of Bnei Brak was appointed as final Rabbinic authority of the Beis Yaakov Chasidi. In October 2007 he issued a letter that was placed in every mailbox in Immanuel forbidding the bringing of grievances to the media or secular courts. Rabbi Bar Lev of Immanuel states, "Ministers Pinchasi and Margi of the Shas party were concerned about reports in the media about alleged discrimination. As soon as they saw that Rav Ba'adani was the arbitrator of the school, they were satisfied with the situation and withdrew their investigation."&lt;ref name="behadrei1"/&gt;

Media sources alleged that the founding of the Chassidic Beit Yaakov was solely an ethnic split. In ''Haaretz'', from 2007 until after the fathers were jailed, nearly 30% of whom were Sephardic, the reports continued that this was solely an ethnic split.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

Only after ''Haaretz'' conducted a direct interview with one of the imprisoned fathers, an article in June 2010 concedes: "a third of the group ... are Sephardic themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Yair Ettinger, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/imprisoned-immanuel-father-our-children-will-study-this-in-history-books-1.297539 Imprisoned Immanuel Father: 'Our Children Will Study This in History Books'] ''Haaretz'' 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Supreme Court documents alleged that this was solely an ethnic split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/court%20document%20Aug%206%202009.pdf Supreme court document 20 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/s11/08010670.s11.pd Supreme Court document 6 August 2009]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, there was no trial, no cross examining the defendants or plaintiffs.&lt;ref name="news1.co.il"/&gt;

The New Israel Fund, which assisted the prosecution, claimed on its website and that of its grantee organizations, that this was solely an ethnic split: "The students have been physically separated within this school based solely on ethnicity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/old-fashioned-discrim "Tmura" site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217010125/http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/old-fashioned-discrim |date=17 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NIF organizations protest discrimination against Mizrachi girls in ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazi schools |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=https://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=422 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817081602/http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=422 |archivedate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations in the media arose in 2007 about the physical separation of the new school from the old. Attorney Mordechai Bass notes on Page 7 of his fifteen-page report: "The yard surrounds the school from four directions, and the girls (from both schools) are able to see and play with each other. The (media) portrayal of two completely separate sections of the school yard ... is not true."

Allegedly, the Chassidic school built a fence in the play yard; cement walls in the corridor; using separate staff rooms; different [[dress code]]s; etc., essentially splitting the school in two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, No'ar KaHalakha v. Education Ministry et al.], ''Judge Levy'' Article 2 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chabad]]-Lubavitch girls. school was founded in the late 1990s. Many residents of Immanuel send their children to [[National Religious Party|national-religious]] schools in the neighboring towns of [[Karnei Shomron]], [[Kedumim]], and [[Shavei Shomron]]; to Hasidic schools in Bnei Brak; to vocational schools in Petah Tikva, etc. Thus, there is a wide variety of choices in education for families who live in Emanuel.

===Discrimination allegations===

Before the Chasidi school was founded, outreach programs designed to get all the Beis Yaakov parents to take upon more strict observance, and thus circumvent the need for a new school, had been attempted.&lt;ref name="matzav.com"&gt;http://matzav.com/the-case-of-beis-yaakov-chasidic-school-for-girls-in-emmanuel-israel&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnic self-concept of the parents of the Chassidic school====

When Yaakov Menken asked Rabbi Zaide (who is a member of the Slonimer Chassidic sect) about the ethnic composition of the Chassidic school, he responded, "... every time someone asks this question, I feel sick. Am I supposed to investigate whose parent is this or that?" He could not understand why anyone would have a problem with another child in the classroom that wasn't well-founded on grounds of religious standards....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cross-currents.com/?s=emanuel] Emanuel - Further reading&lt;/ref&gt;

On page 2 of the Bass report: "The percentage of Ashkenazi families in the original school is 23%, and in the new (Chasidi) school, 73%."(Footnote at bottom: "Such figures are not totally accurate – firstly, the schools do not note the ethnicity of their students in the registration – and This is a good thing! Secondly – this figure was ... partially based on the tenor of the family name, which can also be inaccurate." )

The plaintiffs viewed the Chassidic school as opened solely to discriminate against the girls of [[Sephardi]] origin. A belief allegedly shared throughout parts of the [[Sephardi]] community in Israel, who allegedly feel discriminated against by the [[Ashkenazi]] community&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/world/middleeast/18israel.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Isabel | last=Kershner | title=Hasidic Jews in Israel Protest Ruling on School | date=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; – even by the secular parts of the country's [[Ashkenazi]] leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.mli.org.il/Mli_Pdf/Graduate/SephardicMizrahiArab-JewsReflections.pdf|title=Reflections on Critical Sociology and Study of Middle Eastern Jewries within the Context of Israeli Society}} by Harvey Goldberg and Chen Bram&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to the New Israel Fund website, by the [[Haredi]] schools.&lt;ref name="NIF stories schools"&gt;http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/stories/schools.html{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs pointed out that the students in the new section were instructed to pray in the [[Ashkenazi]] tradition and accent, which encouraged their belief about it being a force of discrimination against them.&lt;ref name=accent&gt;http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3592161,00.html (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the original Beis Yaakov instructs in the Sephardi accent for prayer.&lt;ref name="cross-currents.com"&gt;[http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/06/24/i-accompanied-the-women-of-emanuel-to-court-today/#more-3318 I Accompanied the Women of Emanuel to Court Today] 24 June  2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] investigative report in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=79658&lt;/ref&gt;

"The topic has been in the headlines over the past year thanks to the efforts of the NIF (New Israel Fund) family."&lt;ref name="NIF Exposing Racism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIF stories schools"/&gt;

The media paid special attention to the alleged separating wall; this helped the media portray it as segregation. However, Attorney Mordechai Bass states on page 7 of his report: "The yard surrounds the school from four directions, and the girls (from both schools) are able to see and play with each other. The (media) portrayal of two completely separate sections of the school yard ... is not true." See "Bass report" below.

Later the Haredi parents representative, Rav Avrohom Luria, would recognize that the wall was a PR disaster and "a serious mistake".&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"&gt;[http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5770/BLK70aemanuel.htm Background to the situation in Emmanuel]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Yeted Ne'eman, 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Rav Luria and the [[Haredi]] parents disputed the notion that the split occurred due to discrimination. They pointed out that they have 27% of [[Sephardi]] girls in their new section – including the daughter of one of the founders of the new section, Rabbi Yitzhak Bar-Lev, the official [[Sephardi]] [[Rabbi]] of Emmanuel – and also that they allowed their girls to study together with the [[Sephardi]] pupils for decades before the split. The parents association was quoted in the Haredi media saying that "Up to three years ago, even as all other Haredi centers already contained separate schools for every community. i.e. Hasidim; Lithuanians; Sephardim; etc, Immanuel was proud to have only one school, and a wonderful relationship. our daughters were lectured by Sephardi teachers and we had no problem whatsoever".&lt;ref name="hamvaser"&gt;"Guarding the pure education", Hamvaser, 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Rav Luria explained that the split was crucial to the integrity of their children because of a new modern element that moved into town and threatened their lifestyle and the strict education that [[Haredi]] Jews give to their children – in terms of dress, exposure to television and media, music, choice of careers, etc.&lt;ref name="matzav.com"/&gt; In fact the new track adopted rules identical to those in force at all other Haredi institutions throughout the country.&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt; "The nature of the population in Immanuel changed drastically in previous years, and when everybody sent their children to the same school it was a recipe for disaster. We asked for stricter rules that would comply with our standards but this wasn't suitable for other parents. It became clear to both sides that we need to part ways, and simply turn to the model that's already implemented in all other Haredi centers", the parents association told the media.&lt;ref name="hamvaser"/&gt;

===Complaints to Education Ministry===
The contending parents then turned to Yoav Lalum, founder and head of the No'ar KaHalakha organization, which is a New Israel Fund grantee, whose stated aim is to fight against discrimination in Haredi schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenkim.co.il/152566/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%94 About the Organization]. No'ar KaHalakha Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Lalum was fresh off his own court battle with a [[Bais Yaakov]] School in his own neighborhood in [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]], which refused to accept his daughter into the school.&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt; Lalum lost this court battle,&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt; but still was the only [[Sephardi]] of [[Haredi]] origin willing to openly use the secular court system; the [[Shulchan Aruch]] forbids to use the secular law system to solve disputes.

====Bass Report====
At first Lalum turned repeatedly to the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Education Ministry]] that they should step in to end the alleged discrimination. In response to his request the Ministry's Chief Executive appointed the former attorney general to The [[State Comptroller of Israel]], Mordechai Bass, to review the case and determine if the new section is part of a Segregation effort.

After a month Bass submitted his report on 2 March 2008, that he found no discrimination, and that the sole purpose of the separation was due to religious beliefs of the separating parents. he specifically pointed out to the fact that every [[Sephardi]] parent that tried to get in the new section was accepted, and that none of the complaining parents ever actually tried to get into the new section and got rejected, to what he applies rhetorically: "If there is no rejection, where is the discrimination? [אם סירוב אין, אפליה מנין?]".

In the report he also revealed that after meeting with some of the complaining parents he actually found some ground for the proposition of the [[Hasidic]] parents that some of the [[Baal tshuva]] parents in the original school were still not fit to blend within the [[Haredi]] community. By example, that one parent repeatedly used [[profanity]] to describe his [[Ashkenazi]] opponents, even though it is strictly forbidden in the Haredi community.

{{hidden begin|titlestyle=text-align: center|border=#aaa 1px solid|title=Attorney Mordechai Bass' Evaluation of the Beis Yaakov Emanuel Case}}
This is a partial English translation of the report of Mordchai Bass. The Hebrew version can be viewed on the following blog:

http://beisyaakovemanuel.blogspot.com/

Page 1

Invitation to investigate

"On January 28, 2008 I was invited to evaluate the complaints of ethnic discrimination made against the Beis Yaakov Emanuel administration. I have thoroughly reviewed relevant material ... and have met with administrators from the ministry of education, the 'chinuch Atzmaei' (independent religious schools' network, which Beis Yaakov is a part of), and I visited the two schools in question."

Page 2

Evaluation of ethnicity

"The percentage of Ashkenazi families in the original school is 23%, and in the new (Chasidic) school, 73%."

(Footnote at bottom: "Such figures are not totally accurate – firstly, the schools do not note the ethnicity of their students in the registration – and this is a good thing! Secondly – this figure was ... partially based on the tenor of the family name, which can also be inaccurate." )

Were any families refused admission to the Beis Yaakov Chasidi, Emanuel?

"All parents wanting to sign up their daughters to the new school, and were ready to accept upon themselves the school's conditions, were accepted (lit. 'not refused'). Since there was no rejection (of any applicants), where is the discrimination?"

Page 5

Description of Emanuel Community

"A varied population dwells in Emanuel – Chassidic, Lithuanian, Sephardic, some families have been Haredi for generations, some for one generation, some are newly religious for a few years. In larger towns, this variety is expressed in a variety of schools. Until this year there was only one (Haredi) school in the town."

Attorney Bass notes the tensions between the stricter, sheltered factions and the more open, lenient factions.

Page 6

Attorney Bass notes the founding of the Sephardic girls' school in Emanuel, Beit Rachel and Leah, under the Mayan-Shas network, which at the time had only a small first grade.

He notes the various options that the parents explored – having different tracts in the same building, or opening a new school. In the end, a new school was founded.

Page 7

"The two schools are administrated separately, with two different principals.:

Physical separation between the two schools – fact or fiction?

"... photographers claimed that the cloth that was placed on the (pre-existing) fence prevented the girls from seeing each other. This is not true. Only part of the fence was covered. The yard surrounds the school from four directions, and the girls (from both schools) are able to see and play with each other. The (media) portrayal of two completely separate sections of the school yard ... is not true."

Page 8

"Were the students in the two schools divided according to ethnicity? The plaintiffs claim yes (the top of this page exhibits the plaintiffs' claim).... The original school has 107 Sephardic girls and 32 Ashkenazim. The percentage of Ashkenazim is thus 23%. The new (Chasidi) school has 58 Ashkenazi girls and 21 Sephardim. The percentage of Sephardim is thus 27%.... I repeat that ... anyone interested in registering their daughters in the new school and ready to accept the school's way of life was not refused.

"I spoke to the plaintiffs and asked for one instance of parents who asked to register their daughter and was refused and they had no such case.

He goes on to discuss the legal technicalities of opening a new school, licensing, and so forth.

Page 11

Again – physical separation between the two schools – fact or fiction?

Attorney Bass reiterates that accusations of physical barriers between the two schools were exaggerated and that indeed there was free access between the girls of both schools. He notes that the new school occupies (the third floor) rooms, which were unused. (The third floor had housed the high school, and was vacated in September 2004 when the high school got its own building.)

Paragraphs 4 and 5 address the plaintiffs' accusation that the times of school starting and recess were at different times. Attorney Bass found this to be untrue.

Paragraph 6 on page 11 addresses the plaintiffs' accusation that the girls in each school were forbidden contact with each other. Attorney Bass notes that there was no such ordinance issued by the school.

Page 12

More on the culture of Emanuel – Sheltering children. Here, Attorney Bass sensitively notes the great variety that exists in the Haredi world, despite its outward uniform appearance in dress. He suggests that non-Haredim attempt to understand the mentality of sheltering from the outside world, and that the more strict and sheltered Haredim would understandably be wary of having their children have close contact with more lenient and worldly Haredim.

Page 13, paragraph 22

Was there ethnic discrimination in the Beis Yaakov Emanuel?

"The division was not ethnic, it was religious. I am convinced that there is no ethnic discrimination."

Conclusion

"When ethnic discrimination actually occurs, we must combat it with all our might. I express my sorrow about complaints like these – thrown in the air – that increase hatred among Israel, and are totally baseless."

Signed

Attorney Mordechai Bass

Bass still found that the opening of a new section under the same permit and symbol of the old school was a violation of the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry]]'s administration regulations and therefore the school, and/or its parent organization shall be punished accordingly.

===Lalum turns to the court===
The day following the release of the Bass report, as he realized that the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Education Ministry]] would not intervene, Lalum decided to turn to the legal system – something almost unprecedented in [[Haredi]] history. Lalum, however, had already done that before, and with permission of his spiritual guide Rabbi [[Yaakov Yosef]], eldest son of the renowned [[Sephardi]] Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]] (although they had an estranged relationship in the past), he petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] on 4 February 2008 to order the Education Ministry, the local municipality board of [[Immanuel (town)|Immanuel]], the Haredi Independent Education Center and the parents' organization of the [[Beit Yaakov]] school, to stop their aid to and/or close the new section.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The three judges selected by Chief Justice [[Dorit Beinish]] to hear this case were [[Edmund Levy]], [[Hanan Melcer]], and [[Edna Arbel]]. They accepted the case on 14 July 2008, and Levy was appointed by Beinish as the head of the panel.&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt;

===Negotiations===
The Education Ministry immediately responded that it accepts the findings of the Bass Report about the illegal use of one permit for two schools without reporting it to the ministry, and that in itself is grounds enough to revoke the school's license. They warned the [[Independent Education Center (Israel)|Independent Education Center]], the parent organization of the Beit Yaakov school, that they should reunite both sections as one general school, and that it is only allowed to organize a separate ''track'' with different classes for the two streams but not fully divided sections. If the center and/or school will not comply then they might lose their license and/or their government funding.&lt;ref name="ruling1"&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, Noa'ar Kahalocho against Education Ministry and others], Judge Levi, Article 6 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the meantime the Ministry refused to get involved in the discrimination issue, saying that it lacks the criteria to decide this, and therefore the [[Independent Education Center (Israel)|Independent Education Center]] should be liable to assure there is no segregation in the school.&lt;ref name="ruling1"/&gt;

In the midst of all this there were ongoing negotiations between the [[Independent Education Center (Israel)|Independent Education Center]] and the Ministry. In August both parties agreed that the sections will be reunited, if the school will accept new binding policies for the "Hasidic track". The first version included, among others, the following rules:&lt;ref name="ruling2"&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, Noa'ar Kahalocho against Education Ministry and others] , ''Judge Levi'', Article 7 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The prayers will be conducted in [[Hebrew]], but in [[Ashkenazi]] accent. The pupils should also use this accent at home, to facilitate on the students that aren't used to this accent at home.
*The rabbinical authority for the Hasidic track will be the official [[Sephardi]] Rabbi from Emmanuel, Rabbi Yitzhok Bar-Lev. The parents pledge to assure there is no conflict between the spiritual authority at home and the Rabbi.
*For modesty reasons, the girls will not be allowed to drive bicycles outside of their home.
*The parents shell control with whom their daughters associate after school, that they should only be with other girls whose lifestyle doesn't contradict with the Beit Yaakov teachings.
*The parents should be clothed modestly, in accordance with the ''Modesty laws'' of Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner]].
*There should be no radio at home, No television, No computer where they could watch movies, and No access to the internet.
*Parents shell refrain from taking their kids to Hotels and other entertainment facilities.
*The kids shouldn't stay at the homes of non-observant relatives.

This version was shown to the court, where [[Edmond Levy (judge)|Justice Levy]], himself an Iraqi descendant, quipped on the first rule about the Ashkenazi accent that "even of you give me a thousand whips I won't be able to talk with a [[Misnagdim|Lithuania]]'n accent".&lt;ref name="accent"/&gt;
However, a Beis Yaakov student clarified: "The teacher instructs one accent for prayer. In the original Beis Yaakov, we were instructed in the Sephardi accent. In the Chassidic Beis Yaakov, they teach the Ashkenazi accent. But no girl is ever corrected if they use their accent from home, never. Yemenites pronounce their Chet's and Ayin's in their [sic] gutteral way, and have a special lilt to the HaMotzi blessing. Those who wish to use the Galicianer accent, which is not taught in either of the Beis Yaakovs, may do so."&lt;ref name="cross-currents.com"/&gt;

After further deliberations, and by instruction of the court, the first rule was removed.&lt;ref name="court decision"&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3655796,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; So was the rule about using the ''Modesty laws'' from [[Shmuel Wosner|Rabbi Wosner]] changed after the court viewed him as "too strict", to a "Panel of authoritative Rabbi's from the [[Independent Education Center (Israel)|Independent Education Center]]".&lt;ref name="ruling2"/&gt; The changes were accepted by all parties, including the Hasidic Parents of Emmanuel.

However, both, the court and the Ministry, also demanded that the divider be removed; that they reunite the staff room, and use the same dress codes. The Hasidic parents were ready to remove any physical divider, but refused to oblige to the demands to reunite the school, claiming that they wouldn't send their children in one school with the other girls from homes that they don't want their daughters associating with.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Allegations of court bias===

Understanding the expansion of power of the Israeli Supreme court in the 1990s assists in understanding the Immanuel Beit Yaakov topic. Aharon Barak was President of the Supreme Court of Israel from 1995 to 2006. Richard A. Posner, a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, contrasts the American model of government checks and balances to Aaron Barak's concept of law: "In Barak's conception of the separation of powers, the judicial power is unlimited.... What he means by separation of powers is that the executive and legislative branches are to have no degree of control over the judicial branch.... If each of the powers (executive, legislative, and judicial) were administered by a branch that was wholly independent and thus could ignore the others, the result would be chaos. The branches have to be mutually dependent...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/print/article/enlightened-despot "Enlightened Despot"], ''The New Republic'' 23 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Daphna Barak-Erez has commented: "One of the most significant impacts of Judge Aaron Barak on Israeli law is found in the change which he led with regard to all matters of justiciability. Under the leadership of Judge Barak, the Supreme Court significantly increased the [range of] fields in which it is [willing to intervene]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hapraklit.co.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/nun1_2.pdf Hapraklit (Hebrew)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article, "Tragedy of Sentencing Error"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-49148-00.html?tag=02-34-4549210-00.html?tag=02-33-07 Tragedy of Sentencing Error]&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli attorney Aviad Visoli provides legal context on the Israeli Supreme Court. Here is a partial English translation:
"The only law that falls upon the parents is mandatory education – to register the child in an educational institution and to ensure their continuous attendance. There is no doubt that the parents fulfilled this.

"On the seventh of April, 2010, the parents were included in the suit.

"The Supreme Court has no authority to preside in judgment over the parents. Paragraph 15 of the basic law of judgment states the following on the authority of the court: '(The Supreme Court) may give orders to government bodies, municipal bodies, and those individuals who fulfill a public function according to the law. (These orders) can be to force action or to prevent action in the fulfillment of their public duties according to the law.' The Supreme Court has no authority to issue an order against anyone who is not fulfilling a public role. The Court, by law, cannot instruct an individual citizen to send his child to a particular school.

"Thus, the Supreme Court has no authority to give any order to any private individual who is not fulfilling a public duty. According to the law, the Supreme Court has no authority to order anyone to send his child to any particular school.

"The Supreme Court is duty bound to enforce the laws passed by the Knesset. It has no authority to create new laws, and certainly not new laws that expand its own authority.

"The court's decision in ordering the parents to send their daughters to a school they do not wish to is supposedly based upon the law that applies to recalcitrant citizens. However, it appears that this decision itself is illegal as it exceeds the power granted by the legislature. This is not a "marginal" violation, but a broad and systemic violation of the law."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

"Shurat HaDin", an organization of human rights, 
filed a petition on 18 June 2010 for the immediate release of the fathers: "The Supreme Court is authorized to give orders to those working in a public capacity only, that is, those who are fulfilling a public duty.... The law does not allow the Supreme Court to rule on private individuals or to give orders to private individuals, and the court cannot grant itself this authority...."&lt;ref name="ladaat.net"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723175123/http://ladaat.net/article.php?do=viewarticle&amp;articleid=8208 Appeal to BaGaTz:Court decisIon is illegal]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The head of Shurat HaDin, Attorney [[Nitsana Darshan-Leitner]], clarifies, "the Supreme Court has stretched its interpretation of the law to its limit. But no reinterpretation can grant  authority that the law specifically does not allow."&lt;ref name="ladaat.net"/&gt; 
 
Attorney Aviad Visoli states that the incarceration was illegal noting that the parents never had a trial, "each parent should have had a separate trial and been able to give testimony. They were not granted their day in court, not in actuality, not under the law."&lt;ref name="ladaat.net"/&gt;

Journalist Shmuel Kofer comments on judicial activism of the Israeli Supreme Court, "when judges use their position as a political – ideological platform, this is not merely politicization of justice, nor does it merely invalidate the decisions of the knesset and government, it degrades the Supreme Court itself."&lt;ref name="Shmuel Kofer in HaTsofar"&gt;[http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/Article%20by%20SHmuel%20Kofer%20on%20Tsofar.pdf Shmuel Kofer in HaTsofar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327162257/http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/Article%20by%20SHmuel%20Kofer%20on%20Tsofar.pdf |date=27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor Daniel Freedman, "the actions of Edmond Levi show how justice degenerates when 'law is everywhere'."&lt;ref name="Shmuel Kofer in HaTsofar"/&gt;

[[Ben-Dror Yemini]], journalist on legal affairs for ''Maariv'', comments, "when there is a case against Sephardim or the religious, Edmond Levy is put at the forefront to avoid any accusations of anti-Sephardic or anti-religious bias."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/Article%20on%20NRG.pdf Ben Dror Yemini - NRG]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hasidic parents constantly claimed that Levy, an Iraqi descendant and the only Mizrahi/Sephardi judge on the court, took an unusual and personal interest in the case. Rav Luria, the above mentioned spokesperson for the parents claimed that "The behavior of Justice Levy was strange, to speak mildly. One of the petitioners even said that Levy gave him his email and his cell phone number so that he could be sure to stay up to date on all developments".&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt;

He then added: "During the arguments, Edmond Levy spoke as if he was the petitioner. Some of this is reflected in the transcripts. [His comments] give the clear impression, and please allow us to be shocked, [of] interference from the Court in Haredi education. This interference is without precedent, even in the days of [[Aharon Barak]]. It lacks any legal basis. The judges just decide according to their gut feelings".&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt;

Attorney Rabbi Mordechai Green, founder of Betzedek, represented the parents before the High Court. In his brief, he pleaded that the Court not allow "a clash that is of a religious, value-oriented and conscience driven nature, that does serious harm to the legal rights of the parents as anchored in the Basic Laws of the State of Israel.... The Court is deviating from its liberal approach in an exceptional way and it is forcing the individual a specific way of behavior that is against his free choice and inner convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5770/BLK70aemanuel.htm Background on the Situation at Emmanuel]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court ruling==
On 6 August 2009, the court ruled unanimously that it considers the division in Emmanuel as segregationist in nature, and it should therefore be ended immediately.&lt;ref name="court decision"/&gt;  There was no hearing, no cross-examination of plaintiffs or defendants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-49148-00.html?tag=02-34-4549210-00.html?tag=02-33-07 Tragedy of Sentencing error]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judge Levy delivers the court opinion===
The lead judge [[Edmund Levy]] wrote the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, No'ar KaHalakha v. Education Ministry et al.] {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his syllabus he quotes the Bass Report, which concluded that there was no ethnic discrimination, and that the separation was based only on religious criteria because the "Hasidim aren't interested to reveal their daughters to a modern lifestyle, which includes, according to them, inappropriate language and behavior that doesn't match the strict modesty laws they practice".

After a long summary of the events leading up to the ruling, and the legal statues for the case, Levy sums up the legal dilemma:

{{quotation|Indeed, some say – and so claimed the external assessor, attorney Bass – that there are behavioral; cultural; and ethnic characteristics that discriminate the particular sector, but are part of the inherent religious worldview of the various sectors. Meaning that at the colliding of the two rights – the right to education and the right to equality – there are certain characteristics required to conserve the values of one, but which will then conflict with the other. What requires us to balance between the competing rights.|'''Judge Levy's ruling|Article 21'''}}

Levy then determines that:
{{quotation|A institution may hold a unique trend in which students will study ways of religion and worldview of a certain community. So may the institution determine the rules of conduct applicable to students in this trend, for the purpose of implementing the teachings taught in the framework.

However, the institution must enable each student that meets the terms of the relevant threshold, and is willing to adopt the accompanying lifestyle, to learn where he wants. Above all, it is clear that a student's ethnicity isn't a relevant condition for applying to a certain trend, and that creating a separation in one institution – by separating the students throughout the entire learning day; the introduction of a different uniform; separation of staff room; and the collection of extra fees – isn't a relevant measure for the purpose of the student's studies. The educational institution may distinguish between students just for the studies ''of the special content for those trends only'' [emphasis added], and the routine school rules must be common to all students of the institution throughout the entire school day.|'''Judge Levy's ruling|Article 24'''}}

Afterward Levy turns to the factual side of the case and finds that:

{{quotation|In the case before us the purpose of the rules – some of which are found in the school code of the Hasidic trend, and some were put into practice without official regulations – as proven in the report of Attorney Bass, was one and only: the separation of the Hasidic girls from their Sephardi friends. This determination is based first of all on the end result which shows that there were actually two departments in the school. These departments – which were first known as two completely separate schools, and then just two trends – were characterized by a non-accidental segmented population, that points ''like a thousand witnesses'' to the discriminatory intent of the initiators of the separation. This is a gap, on "[Whom] it is said that it speaks for itself" ''(Vice-President M. Cheshin in HCJ 240/98, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel V. Minister of Religious Affairs, P"D 52(5) 167, 178 (1998))''.

This discrimination was also clearly expressed in the 'School code' that was brought for approval to the Director-General of the Education Ministry, and a handful of its articles were mentioned above. A review of the code reveals that we aren't dealing with "a trend that aims to teach the Hasidic way of life", but with an attempt to separate between the segments of the population on a sectarian basis, and this under the guise of cultural difference. The preference of students from a certain group to get into the Hasidic trend, while piling on bureaucratic difficulties for parents from a different group wanting to register their daughters to this trend, severely violates their right to Equality. Same is with school's demand to the parents of students that they live by the religion standard of the institution, and the request – that's good that it was omitted from the provisions of the regulations – that the Prayer language would be only in the Ashkenazi accent.

All these are there only to serve an unacceptable purpose, and this is to close the Hasidic trend's doors to Sephardi girls only because of their origin.|'''Judge Levy's ruling|Article 26'''}}

Therefore:

{{quotation|We order the Independent Education Center to remove any indication, both formal and substantive, of the phenomenon of discrimination that was common at the school. We also order the Education Ministry that as long he finds that the Independent Education Center does not comply with this provision, it must take all legal measures to remedy the situation, including revoking of license of the school and stopping its funding.|'''Judge Levy's ruling|Article 29'''}}

===Judges Arbel and Melcer===
Judges [[Edna Arbel]] and [[Hanan Melcer]] agreed to Levy's ruling and added their comments.

Like Levy, Arbel also pointed to the proposed article that all prayers should be in Ashkenazi accent as proof that the "real intention" of the separation was segregation between Sephardim and Ashkenazim.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; She added that the same argument applies to another rule in the proposed school code that "all students and their parents are required to adhere to the authority of the chosen Ashkenazi Rabbi", even if they are from Sephardi origin and they should have been allowed to follow the teachings of their own, Sephardic, rabbis. ''"This broad and unrestrained requirement through the code shows in my opinion the real desire that stands behind it, to separate between communities and not between different religious levels"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, Noa'ar Kahalocho against Education Ministry and others], ''Comments of Judge Arbel'' page 25 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; (Although she probably didn't realize that the proposed authoritative Rabbi over the "whole" new section, Rabbi Bar-Lev, is himself from Sephardi origin. Nevertheless, the word "Ashkenazi" next to Rabbi never appeared in the code).  
Rav Shimon Ba’adani of Bnei Brak had been appointed as arbitrator and final authority of the Beis Yaakov Chasidi&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhol.co.il/Article.aspx?id=16328 Rav of Immanuel: "Lallum has the Wrond Address"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719205749/http://www.bhol.co.il/Article.aspx?id=16328 |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviad Visoli states that the Supreme Court held no hearing, no cross-examination of plaintiffs or defendants, rendering the court's decision illegal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Melcer wrote longer comments, wherein he tried to compare this ruling to the historic [[Brown v. Board of Education]] that ended segregation in the US and outlawed the "separate but equal" mentality.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; he goes farther than his colleagues and declares the "religious argument" as a hidden "camouflage" for discrimination, without any explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, Noa'ar Kahalocho against Education Ministry and others], ''Comments of Judge Meltzar'', Article 6 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; He also throws in that, contrary to the United States, religious freedom "still hasn't gotten constitutional status" in Israel. In the end he agrees to the ruling of judge Levy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/o24/08010670.o24.pdf Ruling 1067/08, Noa'ar Kahalocho against Education Ministry and others] , ''Comments of Judge Melcer'' page 27 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court aftermath==
At this point the Hasidic parents were already angered with the court, in what they believed to be a forcible meddling of the court in the strict Haredi lifestyle and an attack on their right to self-education,&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt; being as the Haredim in Israel have a long and ongoing feud with the High Court whom it views as hostile to the ultra-orthodox Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/LocalIsrael/InJerusalem/Article.aspx?id=82098&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents of the Chassidic school then sent their daughters to a Chassidic school in Bnei Brak.&lt;ref name="The Haredi World's New Heroes"/&gt; After one day,the court forbid the parents to send their daughters to the school in Bnei Brak or any other school besides the original Beis Yaakov, or even home school them, lest they be held in contempt of court.&lt;ref name="The Sledgehammer Approach"/&gt;

As the start of the new school year approached, the Hasidic parents were determined not to send their daughters in one school with the other, less strict, Haredi pupils, so they tried to find a way that would satisfy the court and still will not force them to compromise on their religious beliefs.

===Founding of new Sephardi school===
"Ohel Rachel and Leah", under the Sephardic [[Shas]]-based "[[Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani]]" education network had been founded in the same year that the Beis Yaakov Chassidi was founded – 2007 (see Bass report, page 6 paragraph 10). 108 students from the original school switched to the new Sephardi school, 104 of those were Sephardi girls.&lt;ref name="decision1"&gt;http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/670/010/k39/08010670.k39.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"... no one calls the entirely Sephardic Ma'ayan HaChinuch school in Emanuel racist...."&lt;ref name="Opinion: Emanuel Isn't Little Rock"/&gt;

Some 160 students remained in the old school, about 80 girls in the original section, and 74 in the Hasidic section. Physical dividers were removed. Both sections used the same entrance; uniform; staff room; And so on. The sections were only fully divided during the study hours.

All the parties involved were satisfied. Ezra Gershi, one of the original petitioners and then mayor of Immanuel, sent an official municipality letter to Yoav Lelum declaring the matter closed.&lt;ref name="yeted lelum"/&gt;

==Additional lawsuit by Lalum==
In 2010, an additional civil suit was brought before the Supreme Court of Justice by Sephardi Yoav Lalum, who had already initiated a similar suit against a [[Beit Yaakov]] school in Jerusalem two years earlier (the earlier suit was thrown out by the court). At this point the Hasidic group established a private school for their students in private apartments. The Supreme Court then fined both schools' operators with 5000 [[Israeli New Sheqel|NIS]] per day (approximately 1300 [[USD]]), with the Ministry of Education issuing a closure order for the private school.

On 15 June 2010 the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the parents of the Chassidic school to return their children to the Immanuel Beit Yaakov, and announced a two-week prison term for any of the parents who had not complied by 16 June.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/high-court-to-west-bank-parents-desegregate-school-or-face-jail-time-1.296299&lt;/ref&gt; The parents rejected the court order as a violation of religious independence, and voluntarily submitted to incarceration on 17 June.

===Reaction and subsequent events===
This issue has become a [[cause célèbre]] for Haredim in Israel, and over 100,000 turned up in Jerusalem for protests against the imprisonment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=178759|title=Emmanuel parents enter prison as 100,000 protest in J'lem |date=2010-06-17|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; clerics of both Ashkenazi and [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardi]] strains of Israeli Haredi Judaism (including [[Tuvia Blau]] and [[Yaakov Yosef]]) have also entered into rabbinical negotiations on the issue.

On 18 June 2010 two of the parents lodged an emergency appeal against their imprisonment. The appeal is on the grounds of lack of due process, since the parents were never given a hearing in their alleged contempt of court. Another  appeal was lodged on 20 June 2010 by Shurat Hadin  on the grounds that the actions of the court were [[ultra vires]], since the Supreme Court of Justice is explicitly excluded from giving judgement against individuals.&lt;ref name="ladaat.net"/&gt; That same day, negotiations for withdrawing the complaint fell through.

It has been noted that the Hasidic stream at the Immanuel school has a much higher percentage of Sephardim than the membership of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="tragedy of sentencing error"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officehours.com/rebecca/beisyaakovemanuel/Article%20on%20NRG.pdf Ben Dror Yemini in NRG]&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Importance section|date=July 2010}}

===Legal irregularities===
Observers have noted that the decision by the commission headed by supreme court justice Edmond Levy, to imprison the mothers ''after'' the end of the school year (once the fathers are freed), is contrary to the law stipulating that court-ordered imprisonment can only be used as an inducement to obey court orders, but never as ''punishment''.

==Impact==
The charges of segregation of students at the Immanuel Beit Yaakov have reflected long-running divisions in Israeli Jewish culture between religious Ashkenazim, religious Sephardim and Mizrahim, and [[hiloni|secular Israelis]] who have resided for most of Israel's history in a system that has allegedly given concessions and jurisdictions to the Jewish religious authorities, in addition to far greater perks to secular institutions, including subsidies for theaters and sports sites. The challenge of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] against Ashkenazi religious dictates is also perceived as casting light upon a long-running perception of the High Court as being biased in favor of secular Israeli concerns.  Note that the court approved a separate school for the chasidic girls in the 2010 academic year, albeit without funding. A number of sephardic girls whose families consented to the school's modesty code are attending, as well.

'''John Taylor Gatto'''&lt;ref&gt;After learning he was regularly confused with another teacher named John Gatto, he added Taylor to his [[pen name]].&lt;/ref&gt; (December 15, 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenmorse.com/birthday/birthday2.html |title=Birthdatabase (.com) |publisher=Stephenmorse.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; – October 25, 2018) was an American [[author]] and school [[teacher]] who taught in the classroom for nearly 30 years. He devoted much of his energy to his teaching career, then, following his resignation, authored several books on modern [[education]], criticizing its ideology, history, and consequences. He is best known for his books ''[[Dumbing Us Down|Dumbing Us Down: the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling]]'', and ''[[The Underground History of American Education|The Underground History of American Education: A Schoolteacher’s Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling]]'', which is sometimes considered to be his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.

He was named [[New York City Teacher of the Year]] in 1989, 1990, and 1991, and [[New York State Teacher of the Year]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="nysed2007"&gt;[http://www.regents.nysed.gov/meetings/2004Meetings/February2004/0204heppd2.htm New York's Teachers of the Year], New York State Education Department (accessed April 5, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gatto was born to Andrew Michael Mario and Frances Virginia ({{nee}} Zimmer) Gatto in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]], a steel town near [[Pittsburgh]]. In his youth he attended public schools throughout the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area]] including [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania|Swissvale]], Monongahela, and [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]] as well as a Catholic boarding school in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]]. He did undergraduate work at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]], then served in the [[U.S. Army]] medical corps at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[Texas]]. Following army service he did graduate work at the [[City University of New York]], [[Hunter College]], [[Yeshiva University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and Cornell.

He worked as a writer and held several odd jobs before borrowing his roommate's license to investigate teaching. Gatto also ran for the [[New York (state)|New York]] [[New York State Senate|State Senate]], 29th District in 1985 and 1988 as a member of the [[Conservative Party of New York]] against incumbent [[David Paterson]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DC1639F933A25752C1A96E948260 THE ELECTIONS; New York State Senate]". ''[[New York Times]]''. November 10, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He was named New York City Teacher of the Year in 1989, 1990, and 1991, and New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991.&lt;ref name="nysed2007"/&gt; In 1991, he wrote a letter announcing his retirement, titled ''I Quit, I Think'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationrevolution.org/blog/i-quit-i-think/ |title=I Quit, I Think |publisher=Jerry Mintz |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the op-ed pages of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]],'' saying that he no longer wished to "hurt kids to make a living." He then began a public speaking and writing career, and has received several awards from [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] organizations, including the ''[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] Award for Excellence in Advancement of Educational Freedom'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.schoolandstate.org/Bios/HistoryTocqueville.htm]". ''Alexis de Tocqueville Award''. April 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatto promoted [[homeschooling]], and specifically [[unschooling]] and [[Open Source Learning|open source learning]]. Wade A. Carpenter, associate professor of education at [[Berry College]], has called his books "scathing" and "one-sided and hyperbolic, [but] not inaccurate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wade A. Carpenter|url=http://www.pilambda.org/styles/pilambda/defiles/v85-3.pdf?phpMyAdmin=7ef832b5771aeb8f8ed4cd00c2e37023&amp;phpMyAdmin=-zoWw3mdi0AafcwcegVd7BGSXS5|title=For Those We Won't Reach: An Alternative|work=Educational Horizons|volume=85|issue=3|year=2007|page=153n8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722191020/http://www.pilambda.org/styles/pilambda/defiles/v85-3.pdf?phpMyAdmin=7ef832b5771aeb8f8ed4cd00c2e37023&amp;phpMyAdmin=-zoWw3mdi0AafcwcegVd7BGSXS5|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes himself as in agreement with Gatto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wade A. Carpenter|title=Behind Every Silver Lining: The Other Side of No Child Left Behind|work=Educational Horizons|volume=85|issue=1|url=http://www.pilambda.org/styles/pilambda/defiles/v85-1.pdf?phpMyAdmin=7ef832b5771aeb8f8ed4cd00c2e37023&amp;phpMyAdmin=-zoWw3mdi0AafcwcegVd7BGSXS5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821051340/http://www.pilambda.org/styles/pilambda/defiles/v85-1.pdf?phpMyAdmin=7ef832b5771aeb8f8ed4cd00c2e37023&amp;phpMyAdmin=-zoWw3mdi0AafcwcegVd7BGSXS5|archivedate=2011-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatto was featured in the 2011 documentary film, ''IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America'', and worked {{when|date=September 2018}} on a 3-part documentary about compulsory schooling, titled ''The Fourth Purpose''. He says he was inspired by [[Ken Burns]]'s ''[[The Civil War (documentary)|Civil War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/fourthpurpose/gatto.htm The Fourth Purpose Documentary Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403235110/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/fourthpurpose/gatto.htm |date=2009-04-03 }}, Fourth Purpose Films (accessed March 21, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Gatto had two major strokes which occurred after he completed the filming of "The Ultimate History Lesson: A Weekend with John Taylor Gatto"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQiW_l848t8 |title=The Ultimate History Lesson: A Weekend with John Taylor Gatto (Intro + Hour 1 of 5) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in early 2012 by Tragedy and Hope Communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tragedyandhope.com/th-films/the-ultimate-history-lesson/ |title=The Ultimate History Lesson: A Weekend with John Taylor Gatto |publisher=Tragedyandhope.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main thesis==
Gatto asserts the following regarding what school does to children in ''Dumbing Us Down'':

# It confuses the students. It presents an incoherent ensemble of information that the child needs to memorize to stay in school. Apart from the tests and trials, this programming is similar to the television; it fills almost all the "free" time of children. One sees and hears something, only to forget it again.
# It teaches them to accept their [[socio-economic class|class]] affiliation.
# It makes them indifferent.
# It makes them emotionally dependent.
# It makes them intellectually dependent.
# It teaches them a kind of self-confidence that requires constant confirmation by experts (provisional self-esteem).
# It makes it clear to them that they cannot hide, because they are always supervised.&lt;ref&gt;See John Taylor Gatto, Dumbing Us Down''. The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling'', Iceland Gabriola: New Society Publishers, 2005, p. 2–11&lt;/ref&gt;

He also draws a contrast between communities and “networks,” with the former being healthy, and schools being examples of the latter. He says networks have become an unhealthy substitute for community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor Gatto, "Why Schools Don't Educate", The Natural Child Project https://www.naturalchild.org/guest/john_gatto.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published online by the [[Foundation for Economic Education]] described John Taylor Gatto as having mentored "millions of people in writing their own scripts". In his book, ''Dumbing us Down'', John Gatto urged parents to control the education of their children. He made a critical analysis of state education and described the system as comprehensive, informal, historical, and philosophical. John wrote several profound lectures which disclosed a significant conclusion which encouraged splitting institutional schools and removing certification from teaching. His belief was privatization of education along with a free market system was the most viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/john-taylor-gatto-taught-millions-to-write-their-own-scripts/|title=John Taylor Gatto Taught Millions to Write Their Own Scripts {{!}} C. Edward Kelso|date=2017-03-02|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatto's book serves as inspiration for education advocates and the inception of [[Praxis test]]s. This testing measured academic competence and knowledge of specific subjects required for teaching. Praxis tests are taken by potential educators as part of certification required by state and professional licensing entities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ets.org/praxis/|title=Praxis|website=www.ets.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Joseph Kargé''' (July 4, 1823 in Poznan, [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] &amp;ndash; December 27, 1892 in New York City) was a military officer and educator. He was involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions in Poland and was sentenced to death. He fled to France, then England, and arrived in [[New York City]] in 1851 as a political refugee. He taught classes in classical literature and foreign languages until the Civil War. He was commissioned the military as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry]]. He was wounded at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in 1862, did not heal fully, and was rendered inactive for most of the War. A later Congressional Record from 1894 noted he suffered a gunshot wound that effectively ended his career in the military.&lt;ref name="Princeton1893"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 1893|title=Professor Joseph Kargé, Ph.D.|journal=The Princeton University bulletin|volume=5|issue=2|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University|pages=25–34|issn=|oclc=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IwQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
Kargé was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the new [[2nd New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry]] in November 1863 and took part in raids of Tennessee and Alabama. His victory over General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] at Bolivar, Tennessee, resulted in a rare cavalry victory over Forrest, who developed a reputation as a superb cavalry leader. In December 1864 Col. Kargé led the 1st. Brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin Grierson]]'s 2nd Cavalry Division. The 1st. Brigade included the [[2nd New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry|2nd New Jersey Cavalry]] – Lt. Col. P. Jones Yorke, [[7th Indiana Cavalry Regiment|7th Indiana Cavalry]] – Capt. [[Joel H. Elliott|J. H. Elliott]], [[4th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry|4th Missouri Cavalry]] – Capt. Hencke, and the 1st Mississippi Rifles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breckinridgegreys.org/galvanized2.html breckinridgegreys.org: Joseph Kargé]- Retrieved 2017-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Kargé was [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] by Lincoln on March 13, 1865, "for gallant and meritorious services during the war" at the recommendation of Benjamin Grierson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinkowski|first=Edward|date=October 1963|title=Joseph Kargé, 1823-1892|journal=Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical Society|volume=81|issue=|location=|publisher=|issn=0096-8935|url=http://www.poles.org/db/K_names/Karge_J/KargeJ_02.html|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221091547/http://www.poles.org/db/K_names/Karge_J/KargeJ_02.html|archivedate=2014-02-21|deadurl=no|via=poles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kargé briefly rejoined the regular army in 1867 and served in Arizona with the [[8th U.S. Cavalry]]. His service was cut short when he resigned in 1871.

== Education ==
Koedinger received his [[bachelor's degree]] in Mathematics and Computer Science from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], working with Richard Lehrer, and his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He then obtained his [[Ph.D.]] in Cognitive Psychology from [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Koedinger CV | year = 2011 | url = http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/koedinger/koedingerCV.html  | accessdate = 2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral advisor was [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Robert Anderson]]. 

== Career ==
Koedinger worked as a Research Scientist in the [[Human-Computer Interaction Institute]] at Carnegie Mellon University. Eventually, Koedinger became an Associate Professor and subsequently a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Koedinger CV | year = 2018 | url = http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/koedinger/koedingerCV.html | accessdate = 2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has had many prestigious graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, in particular [[Neil Heffernan]] and [[Vincent Aleven]].

== Research ==
'''Knowledge-Learning-Instruction Framework (KLI Framework)'''

Koedinger studied and developed the KLI framework of Learning Science. In 2012, Koedinger, along with his colleague [[Albert_T._Corbett|Albert Corbett]] from the [[HCII]] and [[Charles Perfetti]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], introduced the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koedinger|first1=Kenneth R.|last2=Corbett|first2=Albert T.|last3=Perfetti|first3=Charles|title=The Knowledge-Learning-Instruction Framework: Bridging the Science-Practice Chasm to Enhance Robust Student Learning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=July 2012|volume=36|issue=5|pages=757–798|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01245.x|ref=http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/pubs/Koedinger,%20Corbett,%20Perfetti%202012-KLI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The propositions within the KLI framework can help generate research questions within specific domains and instructional situations that, with further work, yield precise and falsifiable predictions. The KLI framework relates a set of observable and unobservable events: Learning Events, Instructional Events, Assessment Events and Knowledge Components.
* Instructional Events: Variations, typically planned, in the learning environment that are intended to produce learning. Instructional Events cause Learning Events. 
* Learning Events: Changes in cognitive and brain states that can be inferred from data, but cannot be directly observed or directly controlled.
* Assessment Events: Involve student responses that are evaluated. Assessment Events are usually test items that can be directly observed, but they can also be embedded in the context of instruction.
* Knowledge Components: A description of a mental structure or process that a learner uses, alone or in combination with other knowledge components&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knowledge component - Pslc|url=http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Knowledge_component|website=www.learnlab.org|accessdate=6 February 2018|ref=http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Knowledge_component|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to accomplish steps in a task or a problem. A knowledge component is also closely related to an assessment event, since it is an acquired unit of cognitive function or structure that can be inferred from performance on a set of related tasks.

'''Cognitive Tutor'''

Koedinger has a huge contribution to the [[Intelligent_tutoring_system|Intelligent Tutoring System]] (ITS), and developed several [[cognitive tutor]] software to aid the traditional classroom learning. Among which the "Cognitive Tutor Algebra" is one of the precursors of the ITS. In 2006, Koedinger and [[Albert_T._Corbett|Albert Corbett]] invented the Cognitive Tutor Algebra from their Cognitive Tutor research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koedinger|first1=Kenneth R.|last2=Corbett|first2=Albert T.|title=Cognitive tutors : technology bringing learning science to the classroom.|journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences|date=Jan 2006|page=61-77|ref=http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/koedinger/pubs/koedingercorbett06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is intended to provide students with immediate step by step hints and feedback, which traditional classroom practice can not provide.

In 2011, Koedinger, and his colleagues Ido Roll, [[Vincent Aleven]] and Bruce McLaren introduced the Help Tutor, an enhanced version of the Geometry Cognitive Tutor that is capable of giving immediate metacognitive feedback on students' help-seeking errors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roll|first1=Ido|last2=Aleven|first2=Vincent|last3=McLaren|first3=Bruce M.|last4=Koedinger|first4=Kenneth R.|title=Improving students’ help-seeking skills using metacognitive feedback in an intelligent tutoring system|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=April 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=267–280|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2010.07.004|ref=http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/pubs/Roll%20JLI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As an enhanced version, the Help Tutor teaches help-seeking skills by giving metacognitive feedback on students' help-seeking errors in the context of learning a domain-specific problem-solving skill. The Help Tutor messages include only domain-independent metacognitive content for several reasons: to encourage students to focus more on the metacognitive feedback (and not be distracted by domain content), to help students generalize the help-seeking skills, and to make the Help Tutor reusable with different Cognitive Tutors.

'''Les Glénans''' is a French sailing school, operating as a non-profit organization. Most of its instructors are volunteers. It was founded in 1947 by Philippe and Hélène Viannay, who had been involved with the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. Its first site was the [[Glénan islands|Glénan archipelago]], about {{convert|10|nmi|km|-1}} off the coast of southern [[Brittany]]. Among its first boats was a 12-meter Bermudian cutter called Sereine, which is now a French listed monument and still sails after having been entirely refurbished in 2005.

Its headquarters are in [[Paris]], [[France]], and it operates five sites in France: [[Paimpol]], l'[[Ile-d'Arz]] and l'Archipel (as the Glénan archipelago is referred to by Glénans adepts) in [[Brittany]], [[Marseillan, Hérault|Marseillan]] in Southern France and [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]] in [[Corsica]]. Sailing takes place in most of the western Mediterranean basin, the UK, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. Cruises cross the Atlantic Ocean and, in the past, have visited Iceland.

Les Glénans teaches [[catamaran]] sailing, [[dinghy]] sailing, [[kite surfing]] and [[windsurfing]], but 70% of its activity is [[yachting]]. Every year up to 14,000 students and 800 instructors sail for 100,000 days.

The school also issues a book on sailing techniques. Initially, the idea of gathering knowledge on sailing and basic ship maintenance was for internal purpose as the founders were not seasoned sails men. They gathered information by being taught by local fishermen and sailors, organized the knowledge and improved it with experience and feedback from their members. Year after year, this book (called in French "Cours de navigation des Glénans") grew, and is now considered as a "must have" by sailing enthusiasts.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The fleet of Les Glénans consists of a wide variety of boats which are usually adapted specially for the purposes of the school. On the water, these boats are usually recognizable by a red stripe across the mainsail.

The podcast hosts, Mark Horstman and Mike Auzenne, are both graduates of [[West Point]], the United States Military Academy, which is where they met.&lt;ref name="showabout"&gt;Manager Tools podcast about their Background http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-show-about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Auzenne spent nearly two decades in Corporate America as a manager and executive.&lt;ref name="mike"&gt;"30- Leveraging Corporate Skills to Successful Entrepreneurship" http://strugglingentrepreneur.com/2008/03/02/wwwmanaagertoolscom-leverages-leadership-experience/%&lt;/ref&gt; His corporate career includes executive assignments in technology and Program Management for [[MCI Inc.]] and [[Bell Atlantic]] as well as several entrepreneurial pursuits in the restaurant and retail fitness industries.

Mark Horstman was a manager and executive in sales and marketing at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]. Mark has been coaching and training managers and executives since 1988.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt;

==History==
Horstman and Auzenne learned about podcasting in 2005 and decided that this could be a way to disseminate their knowledge about effective management.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Auzenne said he didn’t want to create a model where he would only give away half of a solution and then require the audience to pay for the rest of the solution.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"&gt;Mike Auzenne in: Manager Tools: Making Money from Podcasting article by David Spark on http://www.sparkminute.com/2009/09/29/manager-tools-making-money-from-podcasting/&lt;/ref&gt;  The co-founders have stated that they believe they can change the world by changing management, and that the way to change it is one manager at a time.&lt;ref name="mtweb" /&gt; After starting with the weekly free podcasts, both hosts completely dedicated their work time, and became co-founders of Manager Tools LLC, a management consulting firm.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt; They regularly consult to and train managers in [[Fortune 1000]] companies around the world.&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;Career Tools Wins Business Category of People's Choice Podcast Awards http://www.eworldwire.com/pressreleases/211975&lt;/ref&gt; Their company also sells transcripts of the podcasts on-line through membership, and they organize public and in-company conferences to practice the Manager Tools.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"/&gt; As of 2012, the company has five full-time employees.

Manager Tools main podcasts are available on the webpage and also through [[iTunes]] and [[RSS]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;List of Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts&lt;/ref&gt; The podcasts often refer to each other which in the past has created issues with new listeners.

Manager Tools casts help ''90 percent of the people, 90 percent of the time''.&lt;ref&gt;Feedback From Your Directs - What To Say - Part 1 http://www.manager-tools.com/2012/04/feedback-your-directs-what-say-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; And the great majority of the casts are timeless instead of just timely.&lt;ref name="Newsletter"&gt;Mark Horstman, "Things I Think I Think" newsletter from 26 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Management]] is about doing the right things repeatedly. Successful managers do them over and over again; and is about '''Behaviors'''.&lt;ref&gt;One-on-Ones: The Single Most Effective Management Tool http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manager Tools '''"Basics"''' — is a special collection of podcasts on the essentials of effective managerial behavior and the base of all the Manager Tools advanced material.

The podcasts are often articulated around the 'Manager Tools Philosophy'.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Its main parts are ''''The Management Trinity'''' and the ''''Horstman's Laws''''. The founders focus on specific action steps that managers can apply to their job as opposed to theoretical management models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atkinsonadvisor.com/hits-bytes/www-manager-tool-com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Content and theories==

===Foundational Principles - The Management Trinity===

The hosts often refers to the ''''Management Trinity'''':&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manager-tools.com/2013/01/positive-feedback-before-its-time&lt;/ref&gt; One on Ones, Feedback, and Coaching, plus their silent fourth partner, Delegation. These are at the heart of everything Manager Tools recommends.&lt;ref&gt;The Management Trinity http://www.manager-tools.com/2009/10/management-trinity-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; All Of The Manager Tools Trinity Tools are ''Teachable Equivalents'' that the hosts have developed. Most casts are based on these tools.

They usually include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics"&gt;List of Basic Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Managing Responsibilities http://www.ymresourcer.com/documents/Managing_Responsibilities.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
*One on Ones (Weekly meetings in order to reinforce relationships) - recognised as "the best business practice of all time" by profitguide.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profitguide.com/article/78170--the-30-best-business-practices-of-all-time&lt;/ref&gt; -
*Feedback (reinforcing or correcting behaviours)

Other foundational principles as described in the 'basics' podcasts include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt;
* Running Effective Meetings
* Methods for rolling out the Manager Tools Trinity
* 'Solution to a Stalled Technical Career'

===DISC - Management adapted to the personality of the direct report===
Manager Tools podcasts often refer to the [[DISC assessment]] when adapting management and communication styles to individuals.

The DiSC model provides nonjudgmental language for exploring behavioral issues across four personality traits ('''D'''ominance, '''I'''nfluence, '''S'''teadiness and '''C'''onscientious.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inscapepartners.com/discclassic/&lt;/ref&gt; These four traits can be grouped in a grid with "D" and "I" sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and "C" and "S" below representing introverted aspects. "D" and "C" then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and "I" and "S" share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal dimension represents "Open" vs. "Guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[[DISC assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
There are also some recurring references to other 'rules' or 'laws'. These are mostly referred to verbally in the podcasts:&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/hortsmans-laws-podcast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/horstmans-laws-01&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masaryk University''' ({{lang-cs|Masarykova univerzita}}; {{lang-la|Universitas Masarykiana Brunensis}}) is the second largest [[university]] in the [[Czech Republic]], a member of the [[Compostela Group]] and the [[Utrecht Network]]. Founded in 1919 in [[Brno]] as the second Czech university (after [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]] established in 1348 and [[Palacký University, Olomouc|Palacký University]] existent in 1573–1860), it now consists of nine faculties and 35,115 students.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | title =Detailed Statistical Data | publisher =Masaryk University | url =http://www.muni.cz/general/statistics?lang=en | accessdate =2014-05-05 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160827184158/http://www.muni.cz/general/statistics?lang=en | archivedate =27 August 2016 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], the first president of an independent [[Czechoslovakia]] as well as the leader of the movement for a second Czech university.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite web | title =MU Brief History | url =http://www.muni.cz/history/summary?lang=en | publisher =Masaryk University |accessdate=2016-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 the university was renamed ''Jan Evangelista Purkyně University'' after [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]], a Czech biologist. In 1990, following the [[Velvet Revolution]] it regained its original name.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web | title =MU Important Dates in the History | url =http://www.muni.cz/history/milestones?lang=en | publisher =Masaryk University |accessdate=2008-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1922, over 171,000 students have graduated from the university.

==History==

Masaryk University was founded on 28 January 1919 with four faculties: Law, Medicine, Science, and Arts. The founding of the second Czech university was possible only after the fall of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[monarchy]] because of the resistance of the German-controlled city council, which feared giving power to the Czech residents of Brno.&lt;ref name="summary" /&gt; Brno was at that time a bilingual city. A notable demonstration in favour of establishing a university in Brno happened in 1905.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

From the beginning, the university suffered from a lack of money for development. The fragile state of public finances in 1923–1925 and 1933–1934 led to proposals to abolish both the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science. Both faculties eventually survived until 17 November 1939 when the whole university was closed following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. A number of professors of Masaryk University were executed or tortured; for example, the Faculty of Science lost one quarter of its teaching staff.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; Many of the executions took place in the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen concentration camp]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

The renewal of university life after the end of World War II was interrupted by the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)#Stalinization|Communist takeover]]. The percentage of students expelled in various faculties ranged from 5 percent at the Faculty of Education to 46 percent at the Faculty of Law, which was completely closed in 1950. In 1953, the Faculty of Education (founded in 1946) was separated from the university. In August 1960, a government decree abolished the Pharmaceutical Faculty and the University was renamed ''Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Brno''.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt;

Relaxation occurred in 1964 with the reintegration of the Faculty of Education into the university and with the reestablishment of the Faculty of Law in 1969. But conditions changed again rapidly with the [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]] of the 1970s after the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)#Warsaw Pact intervention and the end of Prague Spring|1968 invasion]] of [[Warsaw Pact]] troops into Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt;

The University was renamed ''Masaryk University in Brno'' in 1990, then regaining its original name by dropping the "in Brno" from the title in 2006. A new era of development began after the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989 and the establishment of the Faculty of Economics and Administration in 1991, the Faculty of Informatics in 1994, the Faculty of Social Studies in 1998, and the Faculty of Sports Studies in 2002.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

A new University campus has been under construction in [[Brno-Bohunice]] since 2002. The last stage of development should be completed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Podprogram 233 332 – Výstavba univerzitního kampusu MU v Brně-Bohunicích (UKB) | url=http://www.muni.cz/general/events/p233332?lang=en | language =Czech | publisher =Masaryk University | accessdate =2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campus houses most Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Sports Studies, part of Faculty of Sciences as well as several research facilities such as [[Central European Institute of Technology]] and Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment Cetocoen.

In 2013, university signed a long term lease with the city of Brno, creating [[University Cinema Scala]] in place of movie theatre with over 80 years tradition which was closed down in 2011. The place has various academic functions, hosting official university ceremonies as well as lectures and conferences. Cinema's programming is managed by Aeropolis, which shares the costs with the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.muni.cz/scala | title=University Cinema Scala | accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures were established to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]) by [[James Watson]] (1928) and [[Francis Crick]] (1916-2004). The Mendel Lectures are named in honour of [[Gregor Mendel|Gregor Johann Mendel]] (1822-1884), the founder of [[genetics]], who lived and worked in the [[St Thomas's Abbey, Brno|Augustinian Abbey]] in [[Brno]] 1843-1884. Based on his experiments conducted in the abbey between 1856 and 1863, Mendel established the basic rules of [[heredity]], now referred to as the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]]. The Mendel Lectures are organized by the [[Masaryk University]], the [[Mendel Museum of Masaryk University|Mendel Museum]], the St. Anne´s University Hospital Brno, and the [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology|Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP)]] in Vienna, Austria. The fourteenth season of the Mendel Lectures is running at present. More than 100 top scientists, including many [[Nobel Prize]] winners, have visited [[Brno]] to give a Mendel Lecture, for example [[Tim Hunt]], [[Jack W. Szostak]], [[John Gurdon]], [[Elizabeth Blackburn]], [[Paul Nurse]], [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]], [[Günter Blobel]], [[Kurt Wüthrich]], [[Jules A. Hoffmann]], [[Aaron Ciechanover]], [[Ada Yonath]], [[Paul L. Modrich|Paul Modrich]], [[Eric F. Wieschaus]] and others.

== History ==
The first idea of the Mendel Lectures occurred during the international conference ´[[European Molecular Biology Organization|EMBO]] Workshop: Genetics after the Genome´ organised by [[Dieter Schweizer]] and [[Kim Nasmyth]] in 2002. Anna and Kim Nasmyth from Oxford, Imma Mautner Markhof from Austria, Jan Motlík from the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] and Jiřina Relichová from the [[Masaryk University]] prepared and organized the very first series of Mendel Lectures. They named the series „The Road to the DNA“ and focused the lectures on the historical context of [[genetics]]. The two first speakers, Sir [[Walter Bodmer]] from Oxford and [[Charles Weissmann]] from London, gave their talks in the [[St Thomas's Abbey, Brno|Augustinian Abbey]] in Old Brno on May 13, 2003. Subsequent series have addressed more topical scientific findings. Since 2003, more than 90 top scientists, including many [[Nobel Prize]] winners, have visited [[Brno]] to give a Mendel Lecture.

The Mendel Lectures are also connected with the establishment of the [[Mendel Museum of Masaryk University|Mendel Museum]] and revitalization of scientific activities in the [[St Thomas's Abbey, Brno|Augustinian Abbey]] in Old Brno in 2003 in the event of the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]). The [[British Council]] donated a copy of the original photograph of [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] and a copy of their model of DNA from 1953 is on loan from [[Gustav Ammerer]] to the [[Mendel Museum of Masaryk University|Mendel Museum]].

Initially, the Mendel Lectures were financially supported by the geneticist [[Gustav Ammerer]] from Vienna through his charity [[Vereinigung zur Förderung der Genomforschung]], by the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] and by the [[British Council]]. Realization of the Mendel Lectures have been also supported by the [[Masaryk University]], Authority of the [[South Moravian Region]], the City of [[Brno]], and the [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology|IMP Vienna]]. Between 2012 and 2014 the lectures were funded by the grant of the [[Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic)|Czech Ministry of Education]] and the European Union (project Pluricell). Since 2015, the Mendel Lectures are supported by the International Clinical Research Center of St. Anne´s University Hospital Brno and its project ICRC. From 2016 Masaryk University established [https://seminarseries.muni.cz/ Seminar Series] and contributes with an essential financial funding.

== Present ==
The Mendel Lectures are now mainly focused on combining cutting-edge interdisciplinary approaches, technologies and methods of [[biochemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[molecular biology]], [[computational modelling]], imaging, [[microbiology]], [[cell biology]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[toxicology]], [[developmental biology]], [[evolutionary biology]] and [[medicine]].

The program of the Mendel Lectures is prepared by a scientific committee composed of [[Aaron Ciechanover]], [[Simon Boulton]], [[Kim Nasmyth]], [[Lumír Krejčí]] and Vít Bryja. The Mendel Lectures are now organized by [[Lumír Krejčí]], Martina Vráblíková and Gabriela Pavlíková from the [[Masaryk University]], Ondřej Dostál and Lucie Vychodilová from the [[Mendel Museum of Masaryk University|Mendel Museum]], St. Anne´s University Hospital Brno, and Manuela Steurer from the [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology|Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP)]] in Vienna, Austria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19441">'''[[Mental health]]''' is often viewed as an adult issue, but in fact, almost half of [[adolescents in the United States]] are affected by mental disorders, and about 20% of these are categorized as “severe.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Any Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health issues can pose a huge problem for students in terms of academic and social success in school.&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF" /&gt; [[Education]] systems around the world treat this topic differently, both directly through official policies and indirectly through cultural views on mental health and [[well being]].

== Prevalence of mental health issues in adolescents ==

According to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], approximately 46% of American adolescents aged 13-18 will suffer from some form of [[mental disorder]]. About 21% will suffer from a disorder that is categorized as “severe,” meaning that the disorder impairs their daily functioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Any Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but almost two-thirds of these adolescents will not receive formal mental health support.&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Mental Health and Academic Achievement|url=https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/.../mental-health-and-academic-achievement-2-24-12.pdf|publisher=National Center for Mental Health Checkups at Columbia University|accessdate=24 November 2017|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of disorders among adolescents as reported by the NIMH is [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], [[phobias]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and others), with a lifetime prevalence of about 25% in youth aged 13-18 and 6% of those cases being categorized as severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Any Anxiety Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-anxiety-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next is [[mood disorders]] ([[major depressive disorder]], [[dysthymic disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]), with a lifetime prevalence of 14% and 4.7% for severe cases in adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Any Mood Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-mood-disorder-in-children.shtmll|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effect of this high prevalence is high suicide rates among adolescents. [[Suicide]] in the United States is the second leading cause of death for adolescents aged 10 to 24. More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. There are an average of over 3,470 attempts by students in grades 9–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Suicide Statistics|url=http://prp.jasonfoundation.com/facts/youth-suicide-statistics/|publisher=Jason Foundation |accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these suicides are because of, or in part due to the stress they are under during school. A similarly common disorder is [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which is categorized as a childhood disorder but oftentimes carries through into adolescence and adulthood. The prevalence for ADHD in American adolescents is 9%, and 1.8% for severe cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on academics and school life ==
Mental disorders can lead to many academic problems, such as poor attendance, difficulties with academic, poor social integration, trouble adjusting to school, problems with behavior regulation, and attention and concentration issues. High school students who screen positive for psychosocial dysfunction report three times as many absent and tardy days as students who do not identify dysfunction, and students with high levels of psychosocial stress are much more likely to view themselves as academically incompetent. This leads to much higher dropout rates and lower overall academic achievement,&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF" /&gt; as well as specific academic and social problems associated with various disorders.

=== Anxiety ===
Students with anxiety disorders are statistically less likely to attend college than those without, and those with [[social phobias]] are twice as likely to fail a grade or not finish high school as students who have never had the condition&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF" /&gt;. Anxiety manifests in many of the same ways as [[ADHD]], and so students with anxiety disorders often experience problems concentrating, filtering out distracting external stimuli, and completing multi-step or complicated tasks. Additionally, anxiety disorders can prevent students from seeking or forming social connections, which negatively affects students' sense of belonging and in turn impacts their school experience and academic performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpr.bu.edu/resources/reasonable-accommodations/jobschool/how-does-mental-illness-affect-my-school-performance|title=How does mental illness affect my school performance? – Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation|website=cpr.bu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression ===
According to the National Center for Mental Health Checkups at [[Columbia University]], "High depression scores have been associated with low academic achievement, high scholastic anxiety, increased school suspensions, and decreased ability or desire to complete homework, concentrate, and attend classes."&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF" /&gt; [[Depression symptoms]] can make it challenging for students to keep up with course loads, or even find the energy to make it through the full school day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Suicide ====
The U.S. Bureau of Vital Statistics indicates that [[suicide in the United States]] exceeds 600 children aged 10 to 19 per year. Some researches estimate that for every successful suicide in adolescence, there are between 50 and 100 unsuccessful attempts. Most suicides reported in [[Ohio]] from 1963 to 1965 revealed that they tended to be social outcasts (played no sports, had no hobbies, and were not part of any clubs). They also suggested that half of these students were failing or near-failing at the time of their deaths. These periods of failure and frustration lower the individual's self-concept to a point where they have little sense of self-worth.&lt;ref name="Reese 1968"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reese |first1=Frederick D. |title=School Age Suicide and the Educational Environment |journal=Theory Into Practice |date=February 1968 |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages=10–13 |jstor=1475581 |doi=10.1080/00405846809542105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, students who perceive their academic performance as "failing" are three times more likely to attempt suicide than those who perceive their performance to be acceptable.&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF" /&gt;

=== Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ===
Attention disorders are the principal predictors of diminished academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Teen Screen PDF" /&gt; Students with ADHD tend to have trouble mastering behaviors and practices demanded of them by the public education system in the United States, such as the ability to sit still and quietly or to apply themselves to one focused task for extended durations. Much like anxiety, ADHD can mean that students have problems concentration, filtering out distracting external stimuli, and seeing large tasks through to completion. These students can also struggle with time management and organization. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Policies in public schools ==
=== United States ===
The United States has done a lot of data gathering and creating statistics of what can wear away at a student’s mental health, but few widely known policies have been put in place at the national level. School systems within the United States, either on the state or city/county level, seem to typically make decisions on what mental health policies should be included.
There has been a growing popularity with [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/6/1839 school based mental health services] in United States public school systems, in which schools have their students covered for mental health care. This concept has potential to allow students to have access to services that can help them understand and work through any stressors they may face within their schooling, as well as a better chance of intervention for those students who need it.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Mental Health Strategy highlights the importance of mental health promotion, stigma reduction, and early recognition of mental health problems in schools to be a priority (Mental Health Commission, 2012). Implementing comprehensive school health and post-secondary mental health initiatives that promote mental health and prevention for those at risk was recommended by the Mental Health Commission of Canada. A major focus of school programming is to promote positive mental health to all students instead of just doing so to those already identified as having a mental health problem. This is a preventative measure as it seeks to promote well-being and emotional regulation in all students to avoid mental health problems from further occurring or escalating. 

=== Bhutan ===
In [[Education in Bhutan|Bhutan]], efforts toward developing education began in 1961 thanks to [[Ugyen Wangchuck]] and the introduction of the [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|First Development Plan]], which provided free primary education. By 1998, 400 schools were established. Students' tuition, books, supplies, equipment, and food were all free for boarding schools in the 1980s, and some schools also provided their students with clothing. The assistance of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]s' [[World Food Programme]] allowed free midday meals in some primary schools. This governmental assistance is important to note in the country's [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH), which is at the forefront of developmental policies and is the responsibility of the government.. Article 9 of the Constitution of Bhutan states that "the state shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness."&lt;ref name="Tobgay 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobgay|first1=Tashi|last2=Dophu|first2=Ugen|last3=Torres|first3=Cristina|last4=Na-Bangchang|first4=Kesara|title=Health and Gross National Happiness: review of current status in Bhutan|journal=Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare|date=2011|pmc=3155859|pmid=21847351|doi=10.2147/JMDH.S21095|volume=4|pages=293–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Gross National Happiness ====
GNH in Bhutan is based on four principles: sustainable and equitable economic development, conservation of the environment, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance. Their constitution prescribes that the state will provide free access to public health services through a three-tiered health system which provides preventative, promotive, and curative services. Because of this policy, Bhutan was able to eliminate iodine deficiency disorder in 2003, leprosy in 1997, and achieved childhood immunization for all children in 1991. It became the first country to ban tobacco in 2004, and cases of malaria decreased from 12,591 cases in 1999 to 972 cases in 2009.&lt;ref name="Tobgay 2011" /&gt; The elimination of these diseases and the strong push for GNH allows for all people (including adolescents who are provided with many necessary items and free education) to live happier lives than they otherwise may have had.

=== United Kingdom ===
The [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Educationin]] [[Education in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] is working on developing a whole organizational approach to support mental health and character education. A [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/634731/Practice_example-Whole_organisational_approach.pdf joint report] published in October 2017 from the Departments for Education and Health outline this approach with regards to staff training, raising awareness of mental health challenges that children face, and involvement of parents and families in students' mental health.

=== Singapore ===
[https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=1635 REACH] is a program in [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]] that looks to provide interventions for students struggling with mental illness. A quote from the REACH website reads, "The majority of children and adolescents do not suffer from mental illness. However, when a student has been identified, the school counselor, with consultation from the school’s case management team, will look into managing the care of the student. When necessary, guidance specialists and educational psychologists from the Ministry of Education will render additional support.

In 2010, the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), in collaboration with National Council of Social Service (NCSS), have also been invited to join this network to provide community and clinical support to at-risk children.
Students/children with severe emotional and behavioural problems may need more help. The REACH team collaborates with school counsellors/VWOs to provide suitable school-based interventions to help these students. Such school/VWO based interventions often provide the requisite, timely help that these students/children need.
Further specialised assessment or treatment may be necessary for more severe cases. The student/child may be referred to the Child Guidance Clinic after assessment by the REACH team for further psychiatric evaluation and intervention. These interventions may include medications, psychotherapy, group or family work and further assessments."

=== Mexico ===
Traditionally, mental health was not considered a part of public health in [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]] because of other health priorities, lack of knowledge about the true magnitude of mental health problems, and a complex approach involving the intervention of other sectors in addition to the public health sector. Among the key documents anticipating the policy change was a report presented by the Mexican Health Foundation in 1995, which opened a very constructive debate. It introduced basic tenets for health improvement, elements for an analysis of the health situation related to the burden of disease approach, and a strategic proposal with concurrent recommendations for reforming the system. Mexico has an extensive legal frame of reference dealing with health and mental health. The objectives are to promote a healthy psychosocial development of different population groups, and reduce the effects of behavioural and psychiatric disorders. This should be achieved through graded and complementary interventions, according to the
level of care, and with the coordinated participation of the public, social, and private sectors in municipal, state, and national settings. The strategic lines consider training and qualification of human resources, growth, rehabilitation, and regionalization of
mental health service networks, formulation of guidelines and evaluation. All age groups as well as specific sub-populations (indigenous groups, women, street children, populations in disaster areas), and other state and regional priorities are considered.

=== Japan and China ===
In [[Education in Japan|Japan]] and [[Education in China|China]], the approach to mental health is focused on the collective of students, much like the national aims of these Asian countries. Much like in the US, there is much research done in the realm of student mental health, but not many national policies in place to prevent and aid mental health problems students face. Japanese students face considerable academic pressure as imposed by society and school systems. In 2006, Japanese police gathered notes left from students who had committed suicide that year and noted overarching school pressures as the primary source of their problems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/why-do-so-many-japanese-schoolchildren-kill-themselves-391648}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, the dynamic of collective thinking—the centripetal force of Japan’s society, wherein individual identity is sacrificed for the functioning benefit of a greater collective—results in the stigmatization of uniqueness. As child psychiatrist Dr. Ken Takaoka explained to CNN, schools prioritize this collectivism, and “children who do not get along in a group will suffer.”

== Alleviation and fostering adjustment ==
=== Prevention ===
Some schools may need recognize that they are not just an institution, but are intended to help shape the lives of students and allow them to participate meaningfully in a social aspect of this environment. Psychologically, this can overshadow the academic aspect, yet often little heed is given. Athletics, faculty-student relationships, clubs, and other social activities are important so that no student is left in a "social limbo year after year." The pressures of school, extracurricular activities, work and relationships with friends and family can be a lot for an individual to manage and at times can be overwhelming. In order to prevent these overwhelming feelings from turning into a mental health problem, taking measures to prevent these emotions from escalating is essential. School-based programs that help students with emotional-regulation, stress management, conflict resolution, and active coping and cognitive restructuring are a few suggested ways that give students resources that can promote their mental health (Mental Health Commission, 2012).  Educators need to pay as much attention to the well-being of their students as they do on the academic aspect to ensure they are setting their students up for success in the future.

=== Belongingness ===
Belongingness in the school environment may be the most important and relevant factors affecting students' performance in an academic setting. School-related stress and an increase in academic expectations may increase school-related stress and in turn negatively affect their academic performance. The absence of social acceptance have been shown to lead lowered interest and engagement because students have difficulty sustaining engagement in environments where they do not feel valued and welcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Diane|last2=Liu|first2=Ruth|last3=Kaplan|first3=Howard|title=School Related Stress in Early Adolescence and Academic Performance Three Years Later: The Conditional Influence of Self Expectations|journal=Social Psychology of Education|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirects|Memory palace|the podcast|The Memory Palace}}

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] discussed the method of loci in his ''[[De Oratore]]''.]]
The '''method of loci''' (''loci'' being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. The method of loci is also known as the '''memory journey''', '''memory palace''', or '''mind palace technique'''. This method is a [[mnemonic]] device  adopted in [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Oratore]]'', and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''). Many [[Memory sport|memory contest]] champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

The term is most often found in specialised works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[Lynn Nadel]] refer to:&lt;blockquote&gt;'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by [[Frances Yates|Yates]] (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.&lt;ref name="cognitivemap"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = O'Keefe| first1 =John |last2 = Nadel |first2 =Lynn| authorlink2 = Lynn Nadel  | title =The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = December 7, 1978| location = Oxford|url =http://www.cognitivemap.net | isbn = 978-0198572060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Roman Room Technique| work = AcademicTips.org| url =http://www.academictips.org/memory/romanrom.html| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Many effective memorisers today use the "method of loci" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the [[World Memory Championship]], was initiated in 1991 and the first [[USA Memory Championship|United States championship]] was held in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Foer| first =Joshua| authorlink =Joshua Foer| title =Forget Me Not: How to win the U.S. memory championship| work =[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = March 16, 2005| url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html| accessdate = October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to [[long-term memory]] a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, "stop" at each locus, and "observe" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.

Memory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time [[World Memory Champion]] [[Dominic O'Brien]] uses this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 1997 World Memory Championships| work = Mind Sports Worldwide| url =http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121614/http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Town_System_for_Languages|title=Memory Town System for Languages - Memory Techniques Wiki|author=|date=|website=mt.artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[World Memory Champion]], [[Clemens Mayer]], used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in "number half marathon", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise [[pi]] to over 65,536 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Using this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. {{cn|date=September 2017}} The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 5 Minute Speed Cards| work = World Memory Statistics| publisher = World Memory Sports Council| url =http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/discipline.php?id=spdcards| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - Coursera|author=|date=|website=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:
# Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and
# Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.

The method of loci has also been shown to help sufferers of [[Major depressive disorder | depression]] remember positive, self-affirming memories.&lt;ref name="Dagleish"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalgleish |first=Tim |last2=Navrady |first2=Lauren |last3=Bird |first3=Elinor |last4=Hill |first4=Emma |last5=Dunn |first5=Barnaby D. |last6=Golden |first6=Ann-Marie |date=12 February 2013 |title=Method-of-Loci as a Mnemonic Device to Facilitate Access to Self-Affirming Personal Memories for Individuals With Depression |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702612468111 |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |doi=10.1177/2167702612468111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Maryland evaluated participants ability to accurately recall two sets of familiar faces, using a traditional desktop, and with a head-mounted display. The study was designed to leverage the method of loci technique, with virtual environments resembling memory palaces. The study found an 8.8% recall improvement in favor of the head-mounted display, in part due to participants being able to leverage their vestibular and proprioceptive sensations.&lt;ref name="EKrokos"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Krokos|first=Eric|last2=Plaisant|first2=Catherine|last3=Varshney|first3=Amitabh |date=16 May 2018|title=Virtual Memory Palaces: Immersion Aids Recall|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with [[elaborative encoding]] (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium Passages on Memory|first=Douglas Boin/Karl|last=Galinsky|date=|website=www.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/quintillian-on-memory-109.html|title=Quintilian on Memory - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=25 November 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.

A variation of the "method of loci" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bremer| first = Rod| title =The Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM)| publisher =  Fons Sapientiae Publishing | date = September 20, 2011| location = Cambridge, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0956990709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/memory-techniques-brazilian-portuguese-795.html|title=New Project: Use Memory Techniques to Learn Brazilian Portuguese - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=18 December 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something that is likely a reference to the "method of loci" techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finger| first =Stanley| title =Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = October 11, 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 333 | isbn = 978-0195146943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/first-place-second-place-5806.html|title="In the First Place, in the Second Place" - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=12 January 2015|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot [[Timothy Doner]] described in his 2014 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donor|first1=Timothy|title=Breaking the language barrier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book "How to learn and memorise German vocabulary". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.

==Applicability of the term==
The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the [[art of memory]], [[Art of memory#Origins and history|the origins of which are related]], according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]] and the collapsing banquet hall.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from [[The Art of Memory|Frances Yates]]) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the [[art of memory]]. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gutman| first =Sharon A.| title =Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals| publisher = SLACK Incorporated| date = December 1, 2007 |location =Thorofare, New Jersey| pages = 216| isbn =978-1556428005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the [[art of memory]], hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.

== Spatial mnemonics and specific brain activation ==

Brain scans of "superior memorizers", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the [[Parietal lobe|medial parietal cortex]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], and the [[Hippocampus|right posterior hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation.  In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.

In a classic study in cognitive [[neuroscience]], O'Keefe and Nadel proposed "that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated."&lt;ref This theory has generated considerable debate and further experiment. It has been noted that "[t]he hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal [[neurons]] supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fictional portrayals ==
Fictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myths]]. The method of loci also features prominently in the [[BBC]] series  ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in which the titular main character uses a "mind palace" to store information. In the original [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] stories, [[Sherlock Holmes]] referred to his [[brain]] as an [[attic]].&lt;ref name="Zielinski18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=The Secrets of Sherlock’s Mind Palace|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/secrets-sherlocks-mind-palace-180949567/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Smithsonian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], a detailed description of [[Hannibal Lecter]]'s memory palace is provided.&lt;ref name="harris-thomas-hanibal-rising"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris|first=Thomas|year=2006|title=[[Hannibal Rising]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|isbn=0385339410|pages=1-2,167,178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinez-conde-susana-sciam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez-Conde|first=Susana|title=Neuroscience in Fiction: Hannibal Lecter's Memory Palace|date=April 26, 2013|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4195">'''Nadine Lambert''' (October 21, 1926 – April 26, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychology]] and [[education]] professor. She founded the [[school psychology]] program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], created new instruments for school psychology use, and studied the course of children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). Lambert was a member of the board of directors of the [[American Psychological Association]] from 1984 to 1987.

==Biography==
Lambert was born in [[Ephraim, Utah]], and raised in [[West Hollywood, California]]. After earning an undergraduate degree at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and a master's degree at [[Cal State University Los Angeles]], she received a Ph.D. in psychology from [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadine Lambert, 79; UC scholar was leader in school mental health efforts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/06/local/me-lambert6|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017|date=May 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral studies focused on [[psychometrics]]. 

She taught at University of California, Berkeley and founded the school psychology program at the education school in 1964, her first year there. The [[National Institute of Mental Health]] supported the program for 18 years. Lambert's latest research was on the measurement of [[adaptive functioning]], and on the developmental course of ADHD. A Fellow of the American Psychological Association, she has also served on its board of directors (1984–87) and chaired its Board of Educational Affairs from 1992-94. Lambert wrote such instruments in school psychology as the [[AAMD Adaptive Behavior Scale]] (1981 and 1993 editions) and the [[Children’s Attention and Adjustment Survey]] (1992).

Lambert's other writings include "Educational Reform: Challenges for Psychology and Psychologists," in ''Professional Psychology'' (1996); "Adolescent Outcomes for Hyperactive Children: Perspectives on General and Specific Patterns of Childhood Risk for Adolescent Educational, Social, and Mental Health Problems," in ''American Psychologist'' (1988); "Persistence of Hyperactive Symptoms from Childhood to Adolescence," in ''[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]'' (1987); and "Conceptual Foundations for School Psychology: Perspectives from the Development of the School Psychology Program at Berkeley," in ''Professional School Psychologist'' (1986). She also edited the volume ''How Children Learn: Reforming Schools through Learner-Centered Education'' (1998).

She was involved in several controversies. In 1995, she was one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.&lt;/ref&gt;" an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to the controversy about intelligence research that followed the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.  At the 1998 [[National Institutes of Health]] Consensus Conference on AD/HD, she announced the results of a study suggesting that use of [[Ritalin]] might contribute to later [[drug abuse]]. Of nearly 400 children with ADHD, those treated with Ritalin as children had double the rates of [[cocaine]] use and [[cigarette]] smoking as young adults, compared to those who had not taken Ritalin in childhood.

She was killed in a car accident on her way to work in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/05/04_Lambertobit.shtml Educator Nadine Lambert dies in accident]. [[University of California, Berkeley]]. May 4, 2006. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Maritime Heritage Foundation''' ('''NMHF''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] that manages community [[sailing]] and maritime education programs in [[Washington, D.C.]] In September 2009, the NMHF formally proposed a "National Naval and Maritime Museum" that would be built in Washington, D.C.  The NMHF is in no way connected to the [[Naval Historical Foundation]] (NHF), the official U.S. Navy-endorsed group that raises private funds in support of the National Museum of the U.S. Navy ([[U.S. Navy Museum]]) in Washington, D.C.

==National Naval and Maritime Museum==
On September 18, 2009, the NMHF formally proposed the establishment of a [[public-private partnership]] to raise an estimated $205&amp;nbsp;million to build a 150,000-square-foot (13,935 m²) museum in Washington, D.C., devoted to the history of the [[United States Navy]] and the [[maritime history of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militarytimes.com/static/projects/nextgennavy.pdf |author=National Maritime Heritage Foundation |title=A Proposal to the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command from the National Maritime Heritage Foundation: Building the Next Generation Navy |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further the proposal, the NMHF joined with [[U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation]], the [[U.S. Naval Institute]] and the [[Navy League of the United States|Navy League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/11/navy_museum_plan_110709w/ |last=Faram |first=Mark |title=Nonprofit Hasn't Heard About Museum Plan |publisher=NavyTimes |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 28, 2010, [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] has yet to make a decision on the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2010/03/navy_museum_waterfront_032610w/ |last=Ewing |first=Philip |title=Former SecNavs Urge Navy to Join Museum Effort |publisher=NavyTimes |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oregon State University Ecampus''' is the [[online education]] unit of [[Oregon State University]]. In partnership with the institution's faculty and staff, OSU Ecampus develops and delivers courses, degree programs and certificate programs online and at a distance to students worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/about/ OSU Ecampus About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; Ecampus courses and programs are delivered fully online or in a hybrid (blended) format that combines virtual learning with [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/ctl/hybrid-course-initiative OSU's Hybrid Course Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the Ecampus bachelor's degree programs were ranked top 10 in the nation by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] for the third straight year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kezi.com/story/34229994/osu-online-program-ranked-in-top-10-nationally OSU Online Program Ranked in Top 10 Nationally]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon State Ecampus is a unit within OSU's Division of Extended Campus.

==History==
One of Oregon State University's earliest forays into [[distance education]] was in the 1930s, when it delivered pioneering programs in [[Portland, Oregon]], and on the [[Oregon Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/about/our-story.htm The Story of Oregon State Ecampus]&lt;/ref&gt; OSU's first complete distance degree program was offered in liberal studies via correspondence and video in the 1980s. In 1982, liberal studies courses were offered at [[Central Oregon Community College]] in [[Bend, Oregon]], which paved the way for OSU’s first distance degree program in liberal studies.

In 2002, OSU converted its Distance and Continuing Education program into OSU Ecampus – as the unit exists today – and began building full-fledged online degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.registerguard.com/rg/news/local/30753891-75/online-ecampus-education-courses-osu.html.csp Online by degrees: Oregon universities follow different courses into the e-future]&lt;/ref&gt; Ecampus is now under the leadership of Lisa L. Templeton, who assumed the role of executive director in November 2009. In 2017, she was appointed associate provost of the Division of Extended Campus.

==Academics==
Oregon State Ecampus partners with more than 600 OSU faculty members annually&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ous.edu/sites/default/files/state_board/meeting/dockets/ddoc130111-OSU_Distance_Education-at-a-glance.pdf Oregon University System: Oregon State Ecampus At a Glance]&lt;/ref&gt; to develop and deliver programs and courses online. Ecampus delivers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, graduate certificates and more than 1,000 courses online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandfamily.com/posts/click-your-way-towards-a-college-degree/ Click your way towards a college degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who pursue an education online with Oregon State earn the same diploma and transcript as OSU's on-campus students. OSU's online courses have the same learning objectives and student learning outcomes as the university's on-campus courses.

=== Oregon State courses online ===

Oregon State offers more than 1,000 classes online each year in nearly 100 academic subjects. Working with Ecampus instructional designers to build an online course, OSU faculty use animations, readings, videos, conferences and other interactive materials for students online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailybarometer.com/news/ecampus-adapts-osu-courses/article_6b862258-7719-552e-bb3a-bde6e2d14df2.html Ecampus adapts OSU courses]&lt;/ref&gt; OSU employs a separate effort to measure quality of its existing online courses. Quality Matters, a Maryland-based nonprofit group, offers a means to evaluate and certify the design of online courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.registerguard.com/rg/news/local/30770750-75/online-courses-learning-students-blackboard.html.csp Online classes require new quality controls]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecampus delivers complete chemistry course sequences and labs online,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/online-chemistry-lab-course/ Chemistry and Lab Courses – Online]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as course sequences in eight foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/foreign-languages/ Online foreign language courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oregon State degrees online ===

Ecampus delivers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate programs online, with some hybrid programs that feature face-to-face components. Oregon State is regarded as a leader in delivering [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) programs online&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonbusiness.com/article/sponsored/item/17502-learning-while-you-earn Learning while you earn]&lt;/ref&gt; to learners seeking careers in these high-demand fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2016/10/01/oregon-state/ Oregon State’s New Programs to Address Data Scientist Shortage]&lt;/ref&gt;

PlanetPhysics is also a [[free content|free]], collaborative, online [[physics]], [[mathematical physics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.elsevier.com/categoryController.jsp;jsessionid=306C24FE20EF10B217120B89AD1B5D65.psc1705_b2cst_001?flagName=search&amp;categoryName=Mathematics%20and%20Statistics%7CApplied%20Mathematics&amp;catParentId=EST_SA-6&amp;frPag=SA&amp;locale=en_US] Physics and Mathematical Physics Sources online&lt;/ref&gt; [[computational physics]] and [[mathematics|physical mathematics]] project, including original articles, lectures, books and  [[encyclopedia]] entries.  The emphasis is on openness, [[pedagogy]], real-time content, rigour, interlinked content, and also based on a virtual [[community]], or virtual group, of about 600 people with various physics, mathematical physics, physical mathematics, logic (such as quantum logic, relational logic and many-valued logics), axiomatics and mathematics interests.

==Content==

The main PlanetPhysics.org focus is on both original research and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] entries; with over 3,400 physics and mathematics concepts edited in [[LaTeX]] and rendered in [[HTML]], the PlanetPhysics Encyclopedia is at present the largest Physics encyclopedia written in LaTeX, containing both introductory as well as advanced level presentations. Moreover, its sections on papers and expositions, are second only to [[CERN]] and [[arXiv]] physics preprint archives.

In addition, the PlanetPhysics.org new websites also include extensive graphics illustrations of physics experiments, and also forum discussions. The emphasis is on modern physics contents, including advanced physics and mathematical physics concepts as well.

The project hosts data containing physics, applied physics, engineering and mathematics books, lectures, preprints and research-level papers. A system for both private and semi-private messaging among users is also in place.

{{As of|2012|05|15}}, the Physics and Mathematical Physics projects hosted over 2,000 entries, containing more than 30,000 ''concepts'' in books, lectures, expositions, encyclopedia entries, and papers. Several Wikipedia entries also incorporate text from PlanetPhysics articles, and ''vice versa'', several PlanetPhysics articles contain links or refer to Wikipedia entries.

===Content development models===

PlanetPhysics implements several specific content creation systems based on the ''Noosphere versions 1.0/1.5'', ''Planetary'' (powered by [[Drupal]]), and [[MediaWiki]] currently being updated to allow peer-to-peer review, as well as preprints and encyclopedic contributions. This is significantly different from the so-called ''authority model'' previously adopted by [[PlanetMath]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=collab&amp;id=34] Noosphere's authority model&lt;/ref&gt; Only registered users can create and edit their own entries, or contribute jointly, by agreement, to various topical entries. The [[MediaWiki]] ''version 1.17'' approach is mostly utilized at PlanetPhysics for creating books, uploading PDF files of open access articles, and also for graphics-intensive physics animations and graphical applications to physical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.planetphysics.info/index.php/Main_Page  ''MediaWiki version 1.17'' Applications Main page at PlanetPhysics.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who publishes a new article with ''Noosphere version 1.5'' (created by Aaron Krowne) retains intellectual property ownership of that entry, and is the only person authorized to edit that article, unless the author allows other contributors to edit as part of an editor group selected by the author.  Other users may, however, add corrections and discuss improvements that must be approved by the original author so that the resulting modifications of the article, if any, are always made by the owner.  When there are long lasting (&gt;30 days) unresolved necessary corrections, either the ownership or the entry could be removed by the web site administration.

A major strength of the ''Noosphere'' versions 1.0 and 1.5 ''planetphysics.us'' website is its capability of linking in real time conceptually related entries, as well as automatically listing all the concepts either defined by the article or related to the article in the Physics and Mathematical Physics encyclopedia.  Any PlanetPhysics contributor can explicitly create links to other articles, and the Noosphere 1.0 system also automatically turns certain words into links to the defining articles. The topic area of every article is classified by either the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) or the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC).

'''Susan Elizabeth Blow''' (June 7, 1843 – March 27, 1916) was an American educator who opened the first successful public [[Kindergarten]] in the United States. She was known as the "Mother of the Kindergarten."

[[File:Sketch by Marguerite Martyn of Susan E Blow of kindergarten fame.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Susan E. Blow by [[Marguerite Martyn]], 1909]]

==Early life==
The eldest of nine children, Susan Blow was the daughter of [[Henry Taylor Blow]] and Minerva Grimsley Blow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Movers and Shakers, Scalawags and Suffragettes: Tales from Bellefontaine Cemetery|last=Shepley|first=Carol Ferring|publisher=Missouri History Museum|year=2008|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry owned various lead-mining operations, was president of the Iron Mountain Railroad, was a state senator, and was a minister to Brazil and Venezuela. Minerva was the daughter of a prominent manufacturer and local politician. The Blow children grew up in a deeply religious family surrounded by comfort, wealth, and high German culture. Henry Blow had founded a Presbyterian church in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her grandfather was Captain Peter Blow, the owner of the slave [[Dred Scott]], who later challenged the slavery issue in court.

Due to her family's social status, Blow received her education from her parents, various governesses, private tutors, and schools. Her parents highly valued education for their daughters although this was uncommon for Victorian families. Henry Blow contributed funds to build a public school which was named after him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At age eight, Susan was enrolled at the William McCartney School in New Orleans, Louisiana; she attended classes there for the next two years.  At age sixteen Blow and her sister Nellie enrolled in the New York school of Henrietta Haynes but were forced to return home due to the outbreak of the Civil War. During this time Blow tutored her younger brothers and sister and taught Sunday school at Carleton Presbyterian Church.

At age twenty, Blow met and fell in love with a soldier named Colonel William Cole, but her parents found him to be unsuitable. When Cole was discharged for medical reasons, her father took her to Washington D.C. and introduced her to another military man who was more to his liking. However, Blow never married. She was considered a member of the St. Louis School, a literary, philosophical, and educational movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed Henry Blow minister to Brazil in 1869, and Susan went with him as his secretary. During the next fifteen months, she quickly learned Portuguese. Her bilingual ability helped to ease trade communications between Brazil and the United States.

In 1870, along with her mother and siblings, Blow went abroad to Europe; while there she began studying the philosophies of Hegel and the American Transcendentalists. However, while abroad she came across the kindergarten teaching methods of German idealist and philosopher [[Friedrich Froebel]]. Froebel believed in "learning-through-play" and cognitive development. Susan was inspired to bring these ideas back to St. Louis and her father offered to set up a kindergarten as a private school. Susan felt she could better serve children through the public school system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1871 Blow traveled to New York, where she spent a year being trained at the New York Normal Training Kindergarten, operated by Froebel devotee [[Maria Kraus-Boelté]]. Blow returned to St. Louis in 1873 and opened the nation’s first public kindergarten in Des Peres School in Carondelet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carondelethistory.org/about-us.html|title=The History of the Carondelet Historical Society|last=|first=|date=|website=Carondelet Historical Society|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by then had been annexed by the City of St. Louis. With the help of her two assistants, Mary Timberlake and Cynthia Dozier, Blow directed and taught a kindergarten class consisting of forty-two students. Not only did she pay all expenses to keep the kindergarten running that first year, she was not compensated for her hard work and dedication. About 150 women also volunteered to work at Blow's kindergartens between 1876-1877.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the kindergarten class, students learned from games and songs that Susan translated from Froebel's original German. Students played with different shaped blocks, papers and clay, and tried weaving and modeling to improve dexterity. Children also grew seeds in an outdoor garden. Blow would tell stories from the Bible or myths and legends. The classroom was much more cheerful than upper grades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The experimental class was a success and quickly grew. Within three years, her kindergarten system had fifty teachers and over one thousand students, and by 1883 every public school in St. Louis had a kindergarten.

In 1875, the school board attempted to close the kindergartens in order to save money, but 1,500 signed a petition to keep them open. In 1876, the United States Centennial Commission in Philadelphia gave St. Louis and Blow an award for excellence of kindergarten in public schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Blow was able to open her school, in part, thanks to the support she received from [[William Torrey Harris]], the superintendent of schools in St. Louis. Harris believed the greatest educational concern of the time was the amount of young children who dropped out of school. Blow believed a kindergarten system would improve the dropout rate, for children would be starting school at an earlier age. Although he originally resisted the idea of a public program, he was persuaded by the school board’s support of Blow, her background, and her proposal to direct the program herself.

In 1874 Blow opened a training school to accommodate the in-demand kindergarten teachers. Those in training spent mornings volunteering in the kindergarten classes and afternoons and weekends studying Froebel’s ideas. Through her work, Blow played a significant role in the history and development of early childhood education.

For her pioneering work Blow was recognized with a star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Only ten years after opening her training school Blow withdrew from teaching due to [[Graves' disease]], which is a form of hyperthyroidism. She retired in 1884 and moved to Boston with Laura Fischer, who moved there to direct the kindergarten program at Boston Public Schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In her retirement, Blow wrote a book on Dante in 1890 and five books on Froebel's theories. She also helped found the International Kindergarten Union and held a three-year appointment to the Teachers College of Columbia University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1895, Blow moved to Cazenovia, New York to be near one of her sisters. She lectured on early childhood education all over the county, only stopping about a month before her death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She died in March 1916 in New York City. Most references state she died on March 26, but her tombstone at [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] in [[St. Louis]] declares she died on March 27. At the time of her death, the ''St. Louis Globe-Democrat'' wrote, “A great commander is gone, but the soldiers will go marching on.” In April 1916, St. Louis celebrated Susan with a meeting of the Susan E. Blow Froebel League and a memorial fund was set up in her name to sponsor lectures. The organization did not last long, as many of Blow's ideas were German in origin and the United States entered World War I the following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
An early public elementary school in the Carondolet neighborhood of St. Louis was named for her father. Formerly known as Blow Elementary, it is today named the Lyon Academy at Blow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slps.org/Domain/532 Lyon Academy at Blow].&lt;/ref&gt;

Blow Street, which runs through South St. Louis city from the Mississippi River at S. Broadway to the St. Louis Hills neighborhood, also bears her family name.

Having graduated from the School in 1979 he was employed as the leading soloist of the company [[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre|Tbilisi Z. Paliashvili State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. Since 1989 he is the leading soloist of the Moscow State Theatre "Russian Ballet".

The first number which was produced in newborn theatre was a number “We begin” on medley from products of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Rimsky-Korsakov, Liszt (with sound of kremlin chimes at the beginning). The performers: artistic leader of “New Georgian Ballet” Tamaz Vashakidze, &lt;!-- and art director Maka Makharadze. --&gt;artist on light Vladislav Vlasov (who is technical director of Tovstonogov BDT today), artist on suit Eka Turmanidze. The first-night took place in 1993 in Tbilisi academic theatre of the opera and ballet, the first show outside Georgia — in the same year in St. Petersburg state conservatory.

"I used to visit Georgia and only can say that Tamaz Vashakidze managed to wonderfully translate Georgian spirit in his creation. I’m happy I could see the performance". (Dieter Tanike, Director General of the Theatre Festival in Hamburg and Ganov)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Tamaz Vashakidze has charmed with extraordinary energy and breath-taking beauty of movements". (Nathalie Vim, Deputy Director General of the [[Festival d'Avignon|Avignon Festival]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I believe that the most difficult is to make the spectators of the Montpellier Festival to remember you. Georgians managed to do that. I’m very glad for them. This means that AFFA had made the right decision having supported this project". (Claire Verlet, Chief Manager of dance and theatre programs at AFFA)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The Tbilisi Ballet Art State School named after genius creative personality Vakhtang Chabukiani is celebrating its eighty-fifth jubilee. It is remarkable, that the First “Chabukiani-Balanchine...” International Ballet Art Festival is dedicated to this event. If we may speak today about Georgian contribution in the treasury of the world ballet, then first of all it is the merit of the Vakhtang Chabukiani Tbilisi Ballet Art State School. I’m sure that the First “Chabukiani-Balanchine...” International Ballet Art Festival will write interesting pages in the history of world arts." (Sesili Gogiberidze, Georgian Minister of Culture. Speech at the Festival opening ceremony)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am happy to congratulate the remarkable team of the Vakhtang Chabukiani Tbilisi Ballet Art State School with its 85th anniversary. The name of the great dancer that your School has is much obliging. And it’s joyful to realize that due to everyday efforts of the teachers the glory of Georgian choreography art does not fade away still nowadays. Your students shine not only on Georgian stage, but on many famed stages of the world, including the stages of the Bolshoi Theatre of Russia and Mariinsky Theatre. I wish you much success in this noble field. Today is your holiday. I am sure that the First “Chabukiani-Balanchine...” International Ballet Art Festival held in Tbilisi and dedicated to this memorable anniversary will bring you real joy of meeting with fine art."

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Excerpt from the article “Tamaz Vashakidze” (Newspaper “Sovetskaya Kultura”, Moscow)

[[File:Tech-I.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Logo of the Technopreneurship Institute]]
'''The Technopreneurship Institute''', or '''Tech-I''', is an online educational organisation founded in 2014 by [[Mushtak Al-Atabi]], the author of ''Driving Performance'' and ''Think Like an Engineer: Using systematic thinking to solve everyday challenges and unlocking the inherant value in them''. The institute aims to unleash the potential of individuals through project-based learning and entrepreneurship. Tech-I works on the basis of volunteer hours. Notable academics from around the world volunteer hours to mentor and teach students from all over the world.

== Education Model ==
Students who enroll into Tech-I attend structured courses online and work on projects that will benefit the community that they are living in. Learning portfolios and set learning targets which include successfully completing projects, financial planning and community service is used as a measure of student progress. The academic staff of Tech-I include a wide range of world class academics and industry leaders who have volunteered their time and experties to mentor and supervise the students.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web |title=About Us |publisher=The Technopreneurship Institute |url=http://technopreneurship.institute/about-us |access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission Zero ==
Mission Zero&lt;ref name=about /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mission Zero |website=Think Like An Engineer |url=http://thinklikeanengineer.org/mission-zero/ |access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the driving force of Tech-I. Tech-I sees education as an integral part of helping individuals achieve their full potential. Mission Zero has two parts:
# Bringing the cost of education to zero. Through project-based learning and [[CDIO Initiative|CDIO]], student projects are able to add value to the community in which they are a part of. This allows students an authentic learning experience and making education sustainable.
# Having zero impact on the job market. Every year, large number of graduates leave universities and join the scores of people who are looking for jobs. But who is responsible for creating these jobs? This part of Mission Zero is about developing entrepreneurial graduates who think of creating jobs, not only competing for them. When a cohort of 100 graduates leaves a university, if 5 of them end up creating entrepreneurial undertaking and employing 95 people, they will offset the 95 jobs taken by their fellow graduates. This way we can ensure a steady supply of jobs for everyone. The 5:95 ratio is just an example.

== xGTC ==
Every year, Tech-I organises a global event called the [[Global Technopreneurship Challenge]]. It is a competition aimed at addressing few of the [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering]. It encompasses a preliminary stage through a massive open online course carried out on Open Learning, the finalist will then be selected and invited to attend the finals in the host city. Each year the competition will be hosted by different cities across the globe. Cities bid for the rights to host the event each year. The first Global Technopreneurship Challenge was held in Kuwait in November 2015, with the preliminary stage held from July to September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Main page |url=http://kuwaitgtc.com/ |publisher=Kuwait Global Technopreneurship Challenge 2015 |access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Internship Programme ==
Global Internship Programme is Tech-I's global training platform for individuals who are interested in entrepreneurship and management. The Global Internship Program feeds into the organising committee of the year's GTC. Trainees under the program will experience what it's like to work with people of different cultures and experience the joys and stresses of planning a large scale global event.

K. Samaranayake]], the Statistical Unit was enhanced as the Statistical Consultancy and Data Processing Service Center.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; Starting with this center, in 1985 Samaranayake convinced the university to set up the Department of Statistics and Computer Science (DSCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prof. V. K. Samaranayake - Contributions &amp; Services |url=http://vksamaranayake.org/contributions-services/ |accessdate=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213114141/http://vksamaranayake.org/contributions-services/ |archivedate=13 February 2012 |quote=Starting with the Statistical Unit and the Statistical Computing and Data Processing Centre within the Mathematics Department, Prof. Samaranayake...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered as the starting point of the UCSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake takes over as Director of the UCSC |date=24 May 2010 |url=http://www.itpro.lk/node/6888 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610072050/http://itpro.lk/node/6888 |archivedate=10 June 2010 |quote=UCSC whose roots come from the Department of Statistics and Computer Science celebrates 25 years of...}}&lt;/ref&gt; A batch of 50 students were taken to study computer science, through the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; In 2001, the DSCS separated into the Department of Computer Science (DCS) and the Department of Statistics (DS).&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; Finally, UCSC was formed in 2002 by the merger of the existing Department of Computer Science of Faculty of Science and the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) both of the University of Colombo.

Samaranayake became the founding director of the UCSC.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; After his retirement, he worked in UCSC as an acting director for a short period. In 2004 Dr. Ruvan Weerasinghe became the director of the UCSC and served for next six years. Then Prof. [[Gihan Wikramanayake]] became the director of the UCSC in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake Takes Over As Director Of The UCSC (23rd May 2010) |date=28 June 2010  |url=http://ucsc.lk/node/258 |accessdate=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829012937/http://ucsc.lk/node/258 |archivedate=29 August 2011 |quote=Prof. Gihan Wikramanayake takes over as Director of the UCSC...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart's career as a mathematics popularizer began in 2010 with a video series about "doodling in math class". After these [[recreational mathematics]] videos — which introduced topics like [[fractal dimension]] — grew popular, Hart was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and on [[National Public Radio]],&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2010/12/16/132050207/this-is-for-the-i-hate-math-crowd-not-after-this-you-won-t|title=I Hate Math! (Not After This, You Won't)|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually gaining the support of the [[Khan Academy]] and making videos for the educational site as their "Resident Mathemusician".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Khan Academy|title=Announcement|date=2012-01-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWuAYoHysIo|accessdate=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2012/01/learning-on-speed|title=Learning on Speed|last=Gans|first=Joshua|date=2012-01-24|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Hart's videos combined mathematics and music, such as "[[Twelve-tone technique|Twelve tones]]", which was called "deliriously and delightfully profound" by [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/06/28/the_mad_genius_of_vi_hart/|title=The mad genius of Vi Hart|last=Leonard|first=Andrew|date=2013-06-28|work=Salon|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Henry Segerman, Hart wrote "The Quaternion Group as a Symmetry Group", which was included in the anthology ''The Best Writing on Mathematics 2015''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qL7CCgAAQBAJ|title=The Best Writing on Mathematics 2015|last=Hart|first=Vi|last2=Segerman|first2=Henry|date=2016-01-12|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=|isbn=9781400873371|editor-last=Pitici|editor-first=Mircea|location=|pages=141–153|language=en|chapter=The Quaternion Group as a Symmetry Group|arxiv=1404.6596|bibcode=2014arXiv1404.6596H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hart founded a research group called eleVR, with Emily Eifler and Andrea Hawksley, to research [[virtual reality]] (VR). They created VR videos, and had also collaborated on educational computer games.{{r|eleVR|poly|bias|faq|viele}} They created the game Hypernom, where the player has to eat part of [[4-polytope|4 dimensional polytopes]] which are [[Stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] into 3D and viewed using a [[virtual reality headset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawson-Perfect|first1=Christian|title=Hypernom|url=http://aperiodical.com/2015/07/hypernom/|website=The Aperiodical|accessdate=5 April 2016|language=en-US|date=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Hart|first=Vi|last2=Hawksley|first2=Andrea|last3=Segerman|first3=Henry|last4=Bosch|first4=Marc ten|date=2015-07-21|contribution=Hypernom: Mapping VR Headset Orientation to S^3|title=Proceedings of Bridges 2015: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture|volume=|pages=387–390|arxiv=1507.05707|via=|bibcode=2015arXiv150705707H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the group released an [[open source]] web video player that worked with the [[Oculus Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/elevr-the-first-web-video-player-for-virtual-reality/|title=eleVR: the first web video player for virtual reality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Hart created the playable blog post ''[[Parable of the Polygons]]'' with [[Coming Out Simulator 2014|Nicky Case]]. The game was based on economist [[Thomas Schelling]]'s ''Dynamic Models of Segregation''.{{r|poly|poly2}}
In May 2016, eleVR joined [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] Research (YCR) as part of the [[Human Advancement Research Community]] (HARC) project.{{r|leave}} Hart was listed as a Principal Investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Altman|first1=Sam|title=HARC|url=https://blog.ycombinator.com/harc|website=Y Combinator Blog|accessdate=20 June 2016|language=en-US|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WFF 'N PROOF''' is a game of modern logic, developed to teach principles of logic.
WFF 'N PROOF was developed by Layman Allen&lt;ref name="true"&gt;{{cite article | author= Rachel Erhenberg | title= He's Positively Logical | url= http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/02/Spr02/mt9s02.html | work= Michigan Today | date= 2002 | accessdate= 2008-08-31 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208141433/http://umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/02/Spr02/mt9s02.html | archive-date= 2009-02-08 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former professor of [[Yale Law School]] and the [[University of Michigan - Ann Arbor]].

==Rules==
In the game, students must be able to recognize a "[[well-formed formula]]" (WFF) and use seven different rules of logic to manipulate those WFFs into a proof.  Games are played in groups of two or three.  The first player rolls the cubes and sets a WFF as a Goal.  The goal is the conclusion of a proof.  Each student then tries to construct a proof that ends with the goal.  The Solution to the goal is the Premises which they started their proof with, and the Rules they used to get to the Goal.

Players take turns moving to the Essentials, Permitted Premises, or Permitted Rules sections of the mat. Any cube moved to Essentials must be used in any Solution, and must be an essential part of that solution; any cube in Permitted Premises may be used as part of a premise; any cube in Permitted Rules may be used as part of a Rule. Thus the players themselves shape the Solution, forcing one another to create new Solutions in response to moves.

At any point a player may challenge the last mover, if they feel the last mover has made a mistake. There are three types of Challenges.  A-Flub means that the Challenger can make a Solution using the cubes in Required and Permitted and one more cube from Resources. P-Flub, or Challenge Impossible means the player believes the Mover cannot make a Solution using the cubes in Required, Permitted, and Resources. C-A- Flub means that the Challenger believes that the Mover, or some previous mover, missed an A-Flub.  After a challenge, at least one player must show a correct Solution on paper. 

The scoring goes like this: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The player who wins the challenge scores 10 points. &lt;br&gt;
The loser of the challenge scores 6. &lt;br&gt;
If there is a third player, he must side with or against the Challenger and scores points depending upon that decision.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A game may also end in a Forceout.

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date= December 2015}}
Bullock began dancing at the age of eight at a local dancing school, owned by the world-famous ballroom dancers Syd Perkin and Edna Duffield, in Bullock's home town of [[Stoke on Trent]]. At the age of eleven, he won the British Juvenile Championship at the [[Blackpool Tower]] ballroom. Supported by his late parents, Maurice and Jean, Bullock travelled around the country competing and at the age of 15, made his first British Junior final.

A number of different partners came and went until at the age of 19 he met his last partner now wife, at studio in [[Birmingham]] run by competitive coaches, [[Robin Short]] and Rita Last, who introduced them. Still financed by his parents, Bullock had a string of jobs; of note was a long stint as an airbrush artist.

Bullock and his wife performed in front of [[Prince Michael of Kent]] in 1993 at The Badrutts Palace in [[St Moritz]], Switzerland. An amateur and professional career followed with them being in demand all over the world before finally retiring from competitions at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], South Africa in 1997.

In 1994 Warren and his wife Jane started Zig Zag Dance Factory. Initially as a way of earning an income to continue competing, Zig Zag has grown over the last 20 years to be the UK's largest dance school boasting 13 studios located throughout [[Wolverhampton]], [[Stourbridge]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], Birmingham, [[Wylde Green]], [[Great Barr]] and [[Streetly]]

The Zig Zag Dance Factory produces more competitive couples than any other dance school in the UK and has previously supplied dancers for major events including [[Elton John]]'s birthday and also the Strictly Come Dancing franchise.  In March 2009 they staged an event featuring ''Strictly Come Dancing'' 's [[Matthew Cutler]] and [[Nicole Cutler]].  Since then most of the BBC Strictly Come Dancing professionals have taught or performed at the Zig Zag Studios including Ian Waite and Camilla Dallerup, Trent Whiddon and Gordana, Brian Fortuna and Kristina Rhianoff, Darren Bennett and Lilia Kopylova, James and Ola Jordan and Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace.  Zig Zag has quickly become the leading studio for corporate events and choreography for film and TV.  A pilot programme has already been filmed as the fore-runner of a new TV reality series featuring Zig Zag and the Bullock dynasty.  In 2014 Bullock staged and organised the Galaxy Classique Awards hosted by [[Robin Windsor]] from BBC's Strictly Come Dancing at the Ramada Park Hall Hotel &amp; Spa which was a new event to be the 'Oscars' of the dance world which is now an annual event.

===Charities===
Warren Bullock supports and raises money for a number of charities including Starlight Children's Foundation, Macmillan Cancer Support, Compton Hospice, Birmingham Women's Hospital, Promise Dreams, Birmingham Kidney Kids Appeal, Romanian Orphans, Meningitis Trust.  He has also supported and fund raised for Dean &amp; the late Helen John appeal.  Bullock has also founded the FDA Charity to support dancers in hardship and is involved each year in a charity Strictly Come Dancing event along with various celebrities to raise money for their charities.  Bullock was involved in setting the new Guinness World Record for the longest distance ever danced by training two of his pupils over a period of months to raise money for charity.

'''Why U, Inc'''. is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational organization funded by the Goldman Charitable Foundation.&lt;ref name=whyuweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whyu.org|title=Why U Home Page|website=Why U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why U is dedicated to exploration through the use of digital media, of new education paradigms for the STEM subjects: [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics]]. Why U’s goal is to remove barriers to learning in the STEM subjects, and increase the public’s depth of knowledge of STEM.&lt;ref name=whyuweb/&gt;

Why U develops and provides worldwide access to free animated videos which teach fundamental concepts in math and science in an entertaining format. Why U animated videos are designed to develop conceptual knowledge rather than procedural skill, i.e., instill in the viewer an understanding of the underlying concepts of math and science rather than promoting the memorization of problem solving procedures. The prime focus is to clearly and efficiently explain the conceptual framework at the heart of mathematical and scientific subjects in a way which engages the viewer and holds their interest. Concepts are presented in the context of a dramatic and humorous setting using animated graphics designed to communicate complex ideas in an enjoyable and exciting way. As such, Why U videos are often used as collateral material in formal learning environments around the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Conceptual versus procedural knowledge ==

In recent years, there has been a shift in emphasis by educators from procedural to conceptual knowledge.&lt;ref name="educom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=J.E.|title=A Distinction Between Conceptual Knowledge and Procedural Knowledge|url=http://www.education.com/reference/article/distinction-conceptual-procedural-math/|website=Education.com|publisher=Pearson Allyn Bacon Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One benefit of a strong conceptual understanding is that a person is less likely to forget concepts than procedures. “If conceptual understanding is gained, then a person can reconstruct a procedure that may have been forgotten. On the other hand, if procedural knowledge is the limit of a person's learning, there is no way to reconstruct a forgotten procedure. Conceptual understanding in mathematics, along with procedural skill, is much more powerful than procedural skill alone.”&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; 
“Research has shown that students in a conceptually oriented mathematics class outperform students in a procedurally oriented mathematics class on tests and on measures of attitude toward mathematics. (See, for example, Boaler, 1998; Cain, 2002; Fuson et al., 2000; Masden and Lanier, 1992.)”&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwarftz|first1=James E.|title=Elementary Mathematics Pedagogical Content Knowledge: Powerful Ideas for Teachers|date=June 8, 2007|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0205493750|edition=1|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0205493750?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0205493750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth mainstreaming''' is a [[policy|public policy]] concept. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] describes it in this context:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=170253 |format=PDF |title=Strategic Plan 2006-2008 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Youth Programme]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|National youth development is often the sole responsibility of the government ministry or department where the youth portfolio lies, whereas youth issues should be mainstreamed across various sectors and line ministries such as health, finance, economic development, housing, justice, foreign affairs, education, and agriculture.}}

It is modeled on [[gender mainstreaming]], which the [[United Nations]] defined in the 1990s as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=4652c9fc2 |title=Agreed Conclusions 1997/2 |publisher=[[UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) |accessdate=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated.}}

==Strategy==
Youth mainstreaming is a two-fold strategy for pursuing youth development. Inspired by the experience of [[gender mainstreaming]], it involves ensuring youth is reflected in policy and project stages in various sectors and ensuring there are specific projects addressing youth. Together these add up to a ''youth responsive'' approach.

By reflecting, addressing, being sensitive to, and being responsive to youth issues, mainstreaming is meant to both looking at the impact of a policy/project on young women and men, and involve young men and women in order to ensure [[youth participation]] in the decision-making of those policies and/or projects that affects them.

Advocates of youth mainstreaming point out that young people represent a disadvantaged and marginalised social group, being over-represented among the global poor and unemployed. As such it is argued that "pro-poor" strategies must be "pro-youth", and that any development intervention seeking sustainable impact must address the youth cohort.

===Purposes===
The purposes of youth mainstreaming include:
* Avoiding perpetuating and/or reinforcing the marginalisation of young people
* Confronting [[Adultism|society's stigmatization of young people]] as deviant, criminal, incapable etc.
* Maximizing the positive impact of policies and/or projects upon young people
* Promoting [[Intergenerational equity|inter-generational transfer of knowledge and positive cultural values]]
* Investing in young people: realise the benefits of engaging them as a human resource
* Respecting the [[Youth rights|right of young people]] to participate in decision-making (for under 18s this is enshrined in [[Article 12]] of the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]).
* Benefiting from young people’s knowledge, skills, ideas and practical contributions
* [[Youth empowerment|Empowering young people]], which is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] objective under the "Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=169313 |format=PDF |title=The Commonwealth Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment 2007-2015 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Youth Programme]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process===
The basic steps in youth mainstreaming are to factor youth impacts and youth participation into all stages of a project, of whatever size and sector:
* '''Situation Analysis''': Young women and men’s condition and position need to be researched. Young people can act as peer researchers, informants in the process.
* '''Planning''': Young people should be a target population, and young people’s views and aspirations should be taken into account.
* '''Implementation of Activities''': Young people should be maximally involved, consistent with their informed consent and their education, livelihoods and leisure needs.
* '''Monitoring and Evaluation''': There should be youth-specific indicators, including those related to the quantity and quality of youth participation in the project. M&amp;E should also involve asking young people’s view of how much progress has been made and what the challenges are.
* '''Budgeting''': Specific line items should cover youth-specific activities and the mechanisms to be put in place to secure their participation in all stages of the project.

The steps that institutions can take toward youth mainstreaming are:
* Capacity-building on youth mainstreaming
* Designation of youth mainstreaming focal points within each department
* Integration of youth mainstreaming in planning, budgeting and Monitoring and Evaluation procedures.

===Essential questions===
# Are young women and men part of the target population?
# Will the situation analysis disaggregate data by age-group as well as gender, socio-economic, ethnic group etc?
# Have existing youth structures (e.g. National Youth Councils, youth NGOs and youth clubs, secondary schools, colleges) been consulted as part of background research?
# Will young people be given a role in conducting the Situation Analysis?
# Will young people’s views be canvassed and taken into account when setting goals and objectives?
# Do young people fall under the general goals and objectives?
# Are there youth-specific goals and objectives?
# What are the youth-specific line items in the budget? Will control over any of the budget be shared with/delegated to young people?
# What are the youth-specific activities likely to be?
# How is flexibility built into the project design, so that young people’s decision-making will be given expression?
# What are the youth-specific performance indicators?
# How will young people be involved in monitoring and evaluation?
