The year '''1978''' saw a number of significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]'''.
__TOC__

==Events==
* May 6 – [[Bob Kingsley]], producer of the syndicated "[[American Country Countdown]]," takes over as host. He replaces Don Bowman, who had hosted for the first 4½ years. Kingsley will helm the program for 27 years.
* July – [[WXLP|WHTT]] of [[Moline, Illinois]] but with studios in [[Davenport, Iowa]] switches call letters to WXLP and changes its format from [[country music|country]] to [[album-oriented rock]]. The station adopts the nickname "97X."
* September 18 – In [[television]], [[United States|American]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' (1978–1982), featuring the misadventures of the staff of a struggling [[radio station]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].
* October 7 – "[[American Top 40]]" expands from three to four hours. Several new features are added to the program, which is reaching its peak in popularity.

===No dates===
* Likely fall – [[KUUL|WEMO]] (101.3 FM) of [[East Moline, Illinois]] switches its adult contemporary/MOR format to [[country music]], and changes its call letters to WZZC. The new station, an ancestor to [[WLLR-FM|WLLR]], stabilizes an FM country music format, which – except for a brief run in 1977-1978 on WHTT-FM (96.9 FM) – had been absent from the [[Media in the Quad Cities|Quad Cities market]] for more than five years.
* [[Bill Ballance]] leaves [[KTNQ|KGBS]] for [[KFMB (AM)|KFMB]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], where he is to remain for fifteen years.

*24 December – In [[Sweden]], pirate radio station ''Radio FM in Stockholm'' goes on air.

==Closings==
*29 January - ''Adventure Theater'' (a children's program, not to be confused with ''[[Adventure Theater]]'', a 1956 anthology series on [[NBC]]) ends its run on network radio.&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*31 December – In [[Sweden]], ''Frukostklubben'' ends.

'''Ahmad Amin''' (1886–1954) was an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] historian and writer. He wrote a series of books on the history of the [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]] (1928–1953), a famous autobiography (''My Life'', 1950), as well as an important dictionary of Egyptian [[folklore]] (1953).

== Biography ==

After receiving a traditional religious education the [[University of Al-Azhar]], he worked as [[qadi]] until 1926. He then taught [[Arabic literature]] at [[Cairo University]], where he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Arts, until 1946. Ahmad Amin was one of the most brilliant intellectuals of his time: he was editor of the literary journals ''al-Risalah'' (1933) and ''al-Thakafa'' (1939), founder of ''Ladjnat al-ta'lif wa l-tardjama wa-l-nashr'' ("Literary Committee of Translation and Publication").  He worked as head of the culture department at the Egyptian Ministry of Education before leading the cultural division of the [[Arab League]]. He is most famous for his long history of Islamic culture, in three volumes (''Fajr al-islam'', 1928 ; ''Duha l-islam'', 1933–1936 ; ''Zuhr al-islam'', 1945–1953) which is the first attempt of its kind in the modern history of the Muslim world. He also left an autobiography (Hayati, 1950) while his main articles were published under the title ''Fayd al-khatir''.

Amin lectured on Egyptian literary history between the years of 1939 and 1946.&lt;ref name=Mazyad47&gt;A. M. H. Mazyad, ''Ahmad Amin'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRAVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=shawqi+daif&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xU8v8oACVU&amp;sig=pi4CWrGx4YpRM3oLMJE6MtekJUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7XcrVN3HL4Pkar7HgOgL&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=shawqi%20daif&amp;f=false page 47]. [[Leiden]]: Brill Archive, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Amin stated his initial belief that Egyptians had not contributed to [[Arabic poetry]] during the [[Middle Ages]] the way other Arab populations had. Amin's student [[Shawqi Daif]] claimed that the dearth of properly published Egyptian works from the period made such a judgement tenuous, and suggested that he and Amin republish the Egyptian sections in anthologies of poetry from the period.&lt;ref name=Mazyad48&gt;A. M. H. Mazyad, ''Ahmad Amin'', pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Amin agreed to write the introduction while Daif wrote the preface,&lt;ref name=Mazyad48/&gt; while fellow scholar [[Ihsan Abbas]] assisted the team with editing the folios for printing from 1951 until 1952.&lt;ref name=Mazyad47/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7448">'''Alberto Melloni''' (Reggio nell'Emilia, 6 January 1959) is an Italian church historian, primarily known for his work on the [[Second Vatican Council]].

==Career==
He studied in Bologna, at Cornell and in Fribourg (Switzerland) and he has taught at the [[University of Bologna]] and [[Roma Tre University]]. He is currently Professor of the [[History of Christianity]] at the University of Modena-Reggio Emilia. Holder of the Unesco Chair on religious pluralism and peace, he is Director of the ''Fondazione per le scienze religiose “Giovanni XXIII”'' in Bologna.

He is principal investigator for the European Infraia Rei_Res project headed by the Fondazione, and coordinator of the Resilience research infrastructure project. He spearheaded the establishment of the European Academy of Religion. A research platform which includes institutions, associations, academies, publishers, reviews concerned with the study of religion throughout Europe, the Mediterrean, Middle East, the Balcans, Caucasus and Russia.

He worked on the ''History of the Second Vatican Council'' directed by [[Giuseppe Alberigo]], and directed the ''Edizione nazionale dei diari di A.G. Roncalli'' (Istituto per le scienze religiose, Bologna 2003-2008), the ''Dizionario del sapere storico religioso del 900'' (Il Mulino, Bologna 2010) and ''Cristiani d'Italia. Chiese, stato, società 1861-2011'' (Treccani, Rome 2011).

He is chief editor for the project ''Conciliorum oecumenicorum generaliumqe decreta'' in Brepols's Corpus Christianorum and for the Mansi 3, a digital edition of all the church councils held in the course of history. He is responsible for the European research network on Pope Pius XI, and director of the ''Enciclopedia costantiniana'' for Treccani. He edited ''Benedetto XV. Papa Giacomo della Chiesa nel mondo dell'inutile strage'', 2 voll. (il Mulino, Bologna 2017) and ''Lutero. Un cristiano fra riforme e modernità'' 2 voll. (il Mulino, Bologna 2017), also published in English and German by De Gruyter, 2017.

He has published works on medieval canon law, the church and the state in the twentieth century, on the Conclave. His most recent publications are: ''Papa Giovanni. Un cristiano e il suo concilio'' (Einaudi, Torino 2009), ''Pacem in terris. Storia dell'ultima enciclica di papa Giovanni'' (Laterza, Roma-Bari 2010), ''Le cinque perle di Giovanni Paolo II'' (Mondadori, Milano 2011).

He is an associate of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]], honorary member of the Accademia Rubiconia, alderman for the Académie internationale des sciences religieuses, member of the scientific committee of the [[Enciclopedia Italiana]], member of the trustees board for the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification, board member of Refo500, board member for the Dizionario biografico degli italiani, member of the international board for reviews such as the ''[[Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique]]'' in Leuven, ''Schweizerischen Zeitschrift für Religions- und Kulturgeschichte'' in Fribourg, and ''Studia Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ'' published by the University of South Africa.

He is working on ''La grande storia'' and special hosts for the [[Rai Storia|national broadcasting History Channel]]. He has created and currently hosts ''Il sabbatico'' on Rainews24. He is also a columnist for both ''''[[Il Corriere della Sera]]'''' and ''''[[La Repubblica]]''''.

Professor Melloni is a major contributor to the work on the Second Vatican Council led and promoted by the so-called “scuola di Bologna”. Its research mainly focused on the discontinuity hermeneutics, which differs from the official position of the Church according to a few Italian journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Magister|first1=Sandro|title=Liturgia ed ecumenismo. Come applicare il Concilio Vaticano II|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/155901.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodari|first1=Paolo|title=I nuovi amici del papa - giravolte intellettuali|url=http://temis.blog.tiscali.it/tag/zizola/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict XVI in fact states: "Discontinuity hermeneutics is likely to create an abrupt separation between the pre-conciliar and post-conciliar church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pope Benedict XVI|title=Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the roman curia|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scholars related to the “scuola di Bologna” highlight the fact that the Pope's opinion does not centre exclusively on continuity. According to Melloni it is impossible to read the Pope's words as a mere post-conciliar repentance.

[[Image:Agreement of the People (1647-1649).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''An Agreement of the People'', 1647]]
''''' An Agreement of the People''''' was a series of [[manifesto]]s, published between 1647 and 1649, for constitutional changes to the English state.  Several versions of the ''Agreement'' were published, each adapted to address not only broad concerns but also specific issues during the fast changing revolutionary political environment of those years.  The Agreements of the People have been most associated as the manifestos of the [[Levellers]] but were also published by the [[Agitator]]s and the General Council of the [[New Model Army]].

Major published versions of the ''Agreement'' include:
* "An Agreement of the People for a firme and present Peace, upon grounds of common right and freedome ...",  presented to the Army Council in October 1647.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur074.htm  An Agreement of the People for a firm and present peace upon grounds of common right] October 1647&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An Agreement of the People of England, and the places therewith incorporated, for a secure and present peace, upon grounds of common right, freedom and safety", presented to the [[Rump Parliament]] in January 1649.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur081.htm An Agreement of the People of England, and the places therewith incorporated, for a secure and present peace, upon grounds of common right, freedom and safety] January 1649&lt;/ref&gt;
* "AN AGREEMENT OF THE Free People of England. Tendered as a Peace-Offering to this distressed Nation", extended version from the Leveller leaders, "Lieutenant Colonel [[John Lilburne]], Master [[William Walwyn]], Master [[Thomas Prince (Leveller)|Thomas Prince]], and Master [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], Prisoners in the [[Tower of London]], May the 1. 1649."&lt;ref name=TowerLondon&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/england/english-revolution/may-day.htm AN AGREEMENT OF THE Free People of England. Tendered as a Peace-Offering to this distressed Nation] an extended version from the imprisonment of the Leveller leaders, May 1649&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the [[First English Civil War]], the ''Agreement'' was the subject of the [[Putney Debates]] in 1647.  The major tenets of this first version of the ''Agreement'' were: freedom of religion, the frequent convening of new parliaments and equality for all under the law. These tenets also appeared in the later versions of the manifesto. As these basic proposals were queried, other provisions were added; for example Roman Catholics were exempt from the right to religious freedom, and the electorate was to be made up of adult male property holders. The Levellers hoped to base England's new [[constitution]] on the ''Agreement of the People'', but in the end, the [[New Model Army]] based their demands on an alternative less revolutionary document, the [[Heads of Proposals]], that was proposed and supported by the ''[[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s'' (senior officers) of the Army.

The ''Agreement'' is believed to have "greatly influence[ed] the development of the U.S. Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.mobar.org/civics/Prelude%20to%20Liberty.htm Prelude to Liberty.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062123/http://members.mobar.org/civics/Prelude%20to%20Liberty.htm |date=June 4, 2012 }} "Civics Library of the Missouri Bar".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anita Leocádia Prestes''' (born 27 November 1936 in [[Berlin]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian historian. She is the daughter of political activists [[Olga Benário Prestes]] and [[Luís Carlos Prestes]].

She was born in the Barnimstraße concentration camp and was handed to the care of her paternal grandmother, Leocádia Prestes, at age 14 months. Her mother [[Olga Benário Prestes|Olga]] was sent to [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] and from there to an experimental extermination camp set up at an old psychiatric hospital in [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre]] in 1942, where she was gassed.

In 1964, Prestes achieved a degree in [[Chemistry]] from the then "University of Brazil", now known as the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro|Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ). Two years later she gained a Masters in [[Organic chemistry|Organic Chemistry]].

== Life in the USSR ==

At the beginning of the 1970s, Prestes moved into exile in the [[USSR]]. In August 1972, she was indicted in Brazil for political activities, with the Conselho Permanente de Justiça para o Exército (the Army supreme court) sentencing her in absentia to 4 years and 6 months in prison.

In December 1975 Prestes earned a Doctorate in Political Economics from the Institute of Social Science in [[Moscow]] and four years later in September 1979, the Brazilian courts reduced Prestes's sentence by four years as part of a wider [[amnesty]].

== Return to Brazil ==

In 1989 Prestes received a Doctorate in [[History]] from the [[Fluminense Federal University]], Rio de Janeiro, with a thesis named ''A Coluna Prestes (The Prestes Column)'', which was the movement commanded by her father of almost 1500 men fighting against the presidency of [[Artur Bernardes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/bravo/brazil1924.htm Brazil Prestes Column 1924-1927]&lt;/ref&gt; She is now a retired Associate Professor of Brazilian History, but she continues teaching on the Master's and Doctorate's Compared History Program at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro|Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ).

Kalasuri '''Arisen Ahubudu''' ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: අරිසෙන් අහුබුදු; 18 March 1920 – 26 May 2011) was a writer, orator, scholar, playwright, teacher ([[Guru]]), [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] lyricist, author and poet in [[Sri Lanka]], born in Mudiyallagahawatta in Malalaga, Koggala. He is a member of the [[Hela Havula]]. He has received three government awards for literary works, the title of [[Kalasuri]] from the Government of Sri Lanka, and the [[Sarasaviya Awards]] film award for best composer. As a composer, he is especially noted for writing music performed by [[W.D. Amaradeva]], such as Gilem Obe Guna.

== Early life and education ==

Ahubudu was the second of the three children of the family of Devundara Devamanimendra Heronis De Silva and Wathugedara Laisohami. The child was named as Ariyasena Arsuboda by parents, which he later converted to fairly pure Sinhala name Arisen Ahubudu. He married Sanda Ahubudu on 8 August 1953 and they have one daughter Sanda Samathi Ahubudu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarasaviya.lk/2015/02/12/?fn=sa15021236 |title=Sanda speaks about her late husband |publisher=Sarasaviya |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, at the age of 17, he first involved as a teacher in Piyadigama Saripuththa College, [[Ahangama]]. Munidasa gave an honorary to him as "'''Subas Pathin Kiwithi'''", due to excellent poetry he possess.

== Academic career ==

Ahubudu served 42 years as a teacher, beginning his career at Holy Trinity College in [[Nuwara Eliya]], then he moved to [[Mahinda College]], [[Galle]] and later to Maha Bodhi College, Maradana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/arisen-ahubudu-no-more-11606.html Arisen Ahubudu, no more], Daily Mirror&lt;/ref&gt; His longest stint came even later at [[S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia]] 29 years from 1952 until 1979 where he was among those recruited by warden [[R.&amp;nbsp;S. de Saram]] and who together with [[Sandadas Coperehewa]]  and GL Jinadasa supported by [[D.&amp;nbsp;S. Jayasekera]] he was a leader in the post independence renaissance in teaching of the Sinhala language and literary activities. He taught at Kibiya Government College, [[Katugastota]] Deegala College, Buddhist School, Wellatota also.

While on teaching, in 1947 he published a magazine called ''Ediya'' (means "power") for children. the motto of that magazine was "Ediya produced for improving powers of children". He strongly believed that Sinhalese people were originated from [[Ravana|King Ravana]], and not from [[King Vijaya]].

Prior to his death Arisen Ahubudu was the last surviving prominent member of Hela Havula as well as the last surviving prominent Sri Lankan lyricist. Some of the popular songs that he lyrics are ''Kate Kiri Suwanda'', ''Rena Gira Rena Ambe'', ''Pruthugeese Kaaraya'', ''Punsada Eliyay'', ''Sudata Sude Walakulai'', ''Rejina Mamai Ape Rajje'', and ''Ko Hathuro'', ''Lanka Lanka Pembara Lanka'', ''Dakuna Nagenahira'', ''Mal Gomu Gumu''.

1946, he entered to the drama script writing and wrote very famous dramas at that time, such as ''Wanaraja Kumariya'', ''Hela hethiriya'', ''Sakwithi Ravana'', and ''Lokanthaya saha geta''.

Ahubudu died on 26 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2011/05/110526_ahubudu.shtml Death of a scholar].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">'''Avvisi''' ({{IPA-it|avˈviːzo|lang}}; plural: ''avvisi'') were hand-written [[newsletters]] used to convey political, military, and economic [[news]] quickly and efficiently throughout [[Europe]], and more specifically [[Italy]], during the [[early modern period|early modern era (1500-1700)]].  In the beginning avvisi were very similar to letters written from one dignitary to another, but diverged from such letters in the sixteenth century with more standardized practices.  Avvisi can be divided into two categories: 'public' avvisi and 'secret' avvisi, though each copy was often written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,214,216-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the word '''[[wikt:avviso|avviso]]''' translates to ''notice'', ''warning'', ''advice'', or ''announcement''.

==Origin==
The avvisi found their origins, and peaked, in the early modern Italian world - primarily Rome and Venice.  The popularity and distribution of the avvisi was driven by each court's desire to know what the opposing and even the allied courts are up to.  News networks spread all across Europe, but the avviso itself was generally created in either Rome or Venice, with the rest of Europe simply consuming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Importance==
Avvisi influenced many aspects of the early modern world including public opinion, political battles, the nature of propaganda, careers, and historical records.

'''Public Opinion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi helped to develop public opinion by informing, organizing, and providing a voice for the public.  They allowed the general public to learn of the secret dealings of the nation's leaders, form a response, and then have that response actually be heard by their fellow citizens - essentially making them new players in the game of politics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Politics and War'''&lt;br /&gt;
Though officially renounced by many leaders at the time, avvisi were then used by those very same leaders to wage their political campaigns against one another.  Destruction and [[censorship]] of avvisi was selective, demonstrating that the authorities recognized the importance of spreading news but would have preferred to spread only news that was of benefit to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Competition quickly led to avvisi being used as propaganda devices both as a machine of war{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and in attempts to turn the mob on their own country.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict as a result of avvisi being used as propaganda is certainly not out of the question, either with the public or between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further the avvisi provided the public with political power rarely seen before in the form of 'secret' information that could have allowed them to have influence upon the courts,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and government decisions.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"/&gt;  A minority of people, such as [[Paolo Sarpi]], believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of avvisi and make full use of publication to combat enemy publication.  An example of this includes several pamphlets written by Sarpi in defense of Venice's rights over the Adriatic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Finances and Wealth'''&lt;br /&gt;
Creation and distribution of avvisi required writers, those who can deliver the news, and those who can grant the information that makes the news and this provided many people with jobs, earning them money through standard means.  In addition, invaluable secrets provided by the avvisi could be used in extortion or allowing individuals to influence prices at market.  Those who used the avvisi in this way held the opinion that the information provided by avvisi could not be stopped and it was thus better to capitalize on it.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37,38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi led to a realization of the importance of the after-effects of historical records, whether they be true or not.  [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s work is an excellent example of this, as he states that he may cause more damage dead (through his writing) than he ever had alive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Types==
;Public avvisi
Public avvisi were news letters that were available to anyone who wished to travel to a distribution center in a city.  They were limited to generic, often harmless facts.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,217,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Secret avvisi
Secret avvisi were news letters available to a restricted audience, much akin to duplicated personal letters.  Their content could be considerably more harmful than the public counterpart, as it could include opinions of top officials and the discussions from secret meetings.  This form of communication often had a very specific purpose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Distribution==
Distribution of the avvisi began with the sources of information.  Reporters (newsletter writers, menanti, reportisti, gazzettieri) had networks of contacts filtering information from chancelleries, Catholic churches, Protestant churches, foreign embassies,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and shops.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39,41. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Information was gathered and put together individually or at a [[Scrittoria]] (writer's workshop).  The avvisi would then be distributed by regular news services and organized postal service networks.  Whether newsletters were sent weekly, bi-weekly, or annually depended on the type of news and the writer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,219,224.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the public avvisi were presented the news would quickly spread by word of mouth among the illiterate, no longer relying on the avvisi reporters.  The range of information presented within avvisi was very broad, including countries such as France, Italy, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo.

Writers of avvisi received very little recognition which, quite often, was exactly how they wanted it.  Fear of censorship kept writers from signing work under their own name - for in the early modern era censorship could mean death.  Mutual bonds of trust developed between certain reporters and clients once they found they could trust each other to provide reliable information without any trouble.  The quality of avvisi may fall under question for numerous reasons; the recopying of documents, the translation of documents, and the insertion of opinions for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,219,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
Censorship of avvisi began with [[Pope Pius V]]'s campaign, beginning in 1570CE.  Writers caught distributing what the Catholic Church determined to be defamatory were punished severely - several examples of punishments include death, imprisonment, and torture (sometimes to death).  

The harsh punishments did not prevent writers from continuing in their task, though they were forced to use pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The avvisi were blamed for causing disputes by church officials and writers.  However, institutions that condemned avvisi found they could do nothing to quell the hand-written newsletters and began to use them to their own benefit, even with bans still in place.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 214,215,217&lt;/ref&gt;  

Religious leaders were not alone in banning newsletters - more secular leaders also laid down limitations and prohibitions, including Venice's [[Council of Ten]] who held bans until at least 1567.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A popular reporter, [[Paolo Sarpi]], was a minority in his time for holding the belief that the spread of information could not be stopped so censorship was a waste of resources.  Sarpi believed that the only way to combat the enemy's newsletters is for the government to have their own avviso.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Printed vs. Written==
It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that printed avvisi became more common, and even then Venice and Rome abstained from print.  Due to restrictions from censorship on printed works, a sense of urgency, and a desire for personalization hand written avvisi would not be easily replaced by the printing press.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  

Printed works were produced much more slowly and as a result the public would lose interest in the topic before it came to print.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 48. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Further, printed avvisi were less robust in an effort to avoid censors and cut editing time.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of '''black ceramics''' goes back to [[prehistoric]] times. The oldest articles of black ceramics date back to 6 thousand years BC. They were made in [[Babylon]] and [[Persia]], [[China]] and [[Egypt]], and later in [[Greece]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[United States|America]].

In [[Lithuania]] black ceramics were used since the [[Neolithic Age]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/10078/&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1st millennium AD this technique was used to produce anthropomorphic urns and other cult vessels. This technique was very common in the [[medieval Europe]]. The [[Modern history|Modern Age]] saw enamel techniques gaining prevalence and black ceramics pushed aside. In XX c. black ceramics became rarity. Lithuania is one of the few locations in the world where black ceramics has been preserved and still prospers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16033">'''{{transl|ar|DIN|}}Amadiya''' (or Amadia) was a separate eparchy ([[diocese]]) of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] until it was united with the [[Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Zakho]] in 2013.
 
== History ==
The diocese was established on 1785 and named for the hilltop city of [[Amadiya|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]] in northern [[Iraq]].
 
It lost territory in 1850 to establish the eparchies (dioceses) of [[Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Aqrā|Aqrā]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Zaku|Zaku]] (Zākhō), but on 23 April 1895.04.23 it regained territory from the suppressed daughter-diocese of Aqrā, yet on 24 February 1910.02.24 it lost territory again to re-establish the eparchy of Aqrā.

In 1913 it included [[Amadiya|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]] city itself and sixteen villages in the [[Tigris]] plain near the town of [[Duhok, Iraq|Dohuk]] and in the Sapna and Gomel river valleys.

On 10 June 2013 it was renamed as Diocese of Amadiyah and Zaku or Amadia and Zākhō, having gained territory from the suppressed daughter-eparchy of Zaku.

== Background ==
There were three main concentrations of [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] villages in the {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya region:  in the Sapna valley to the west of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, in the Tigris plain around Dohuk, and in the Shemkan district, around the valley of the Gomel river.   Before the fourteenth century the Sapna valley was part of the diocese of Dasen and Beth Ture ('the mountains'), which lay to the north of Marga and also covered the Berwari region and the Zibar and Lower Tiyari districts.  The villages in the Dohuk district were included in the [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] diocese of Beth Nuhadra, whose bishops resided in the small town of Tel Hesh near Alqosh, and those in the Gomel valley in the diocese of Marga, centred on the {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aqra region.  The last-known bishops of Beth Nuhadra and Dasen, Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb and Mattai, were present at the consecrations of [[Mar Makkikha II|Makkikha II]] in 1257 and [[Mar Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281 respectively, and it is unclear when either diocese came to an end.

No bishops of the {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya region are known from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  After the schism of 1552 the region remained loyal to the Nestorian patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb, and his opponent [[Yohannan Sulaqa]], the first Chaldean patriarch, was martyred in 1554 after an attempt to win over {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya's East Syriac community.  Thereafter the region seems to have been claimed by both patriarchates for some decades.   A metropolitan {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of 'Koma', probably the Sapna village of Komane with its recently revived monastery of Mar {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Kom, was among the signatories of a letter of 1580 from Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on IX Denha to [[pope Gregory XIII]], and the Dasen district was claimed by the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Qochanes patriarch]] Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on XI in 1653.  On the other hand, a bishop Abraham of Beth Ture ('the mountains') is mentioned among the hierarchy of Eliya VIII in the report of 1610.  Given its proximity to [[Alqosh]], it would be surprising to find the region under the influence of the Qudshanis patriarchs, and the surviving manuscripts copied for the Dohuk, Sapna and Shemkan villages (some originating from [[Gazarta]] but the majority from Alqosh) invariably mention patriarchs of the Eliya line.  By the end of the eighteenth century the [[Mosul]] patriarchate had a diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya for the region.

The patriarch Eliya XIII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb consecrated his nephew Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} metropolitan of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya in September 1784 after his withdrawal to {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, with the intention of preserving the patriarchal succession within his family.   Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} made a Catholic profession of faith in 1795, but was felt by the [[Catholic missions|Latin missionaries]] to be insincere.   In 1801 the [[Holy See|Vatican]] informed them that he could not be received as a bishop in the [[Catholic Church]] without 'manifest signs of penitence'.  Shortly afterwards in the same year Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} openly defied the Vatican, consecrating the priest Peter Shawriz metropolitan of [[Seert]].

Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} seems to have become reconciled with [[Yohannan Hormizd]] after the death of Eliya XIII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb in 1804, as in 1808 he was living in his household in Alqosh.  He was 'senior to Yohannan, and governed the diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, but all the same could do nothing without the approval of the metropolitan Yohannan'.  Although he sympathised with Gabriel Dambo's monastic order, his dependence on Yohannan Hormizd occasionally forced him to act against his better judgement.  In 1808 he asserted himself by delivering the monastery of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery|Rabban Hormizd]] to Gabriel Dambo in defiance of Yohannan Hormizd's wishes.  In 1811, however, on Yohannan Hormizd's instructions, he 'became a Nestorian at {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya' and expelled Dambo and his monks from the monastery with the assistance of the civil authorities.  In 1813 he fell mortally ill, and made amends for his harsh treatment of the monks on his deathbed by returning the keys of the monastery to them.  He died shortly afterwards and was buried in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd, 'among the tombs of the patriarchs of the Nestorians'.

== Chaldean bishops of Amadiya ==
[[File:Amedy.jpg|thumb|300px|The hilltop city of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, overlooking the Sapna river valley]]
Some years earlier a Catholic diocese had been established in the region with the consecration by Yohannan Hormizd of his nephew Mattai Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on for {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya on 5 May 1790.  Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on, originally named Yohannan, was the son of Yohannan's brother the priest Giwargis, and appears to have been consecrated on the suggestion of the missionary Maurizio Cherzoni.  There is no need to doubt the sincerity of Yohannan Hormizd's commitment to the Catholic faith at this period, but the appointment was of course also directed against his rival Eliya XIII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb.  After his consecration Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on made a determined effort to convert a number of villages in the Sapna plain and the Zibar district to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Badger, ''Nestorians'', i. 153–5&lt;/ref&gt;    He was killed by brigands not far from the [[Great Zab]] in 1811.

Basil Asmar of [[Telkepe]], a monk of the monastery of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery|Rabban Hormizd]], was consecrated for {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya at [[Amid]] by the patriarchal administrator [[Augustine Hindi]] in April 1824, but seems to have had no contact with his diocese.  He resided in his home village of Telkepe until 1827, apparently in fear of the governor of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, known to be a friend of Yohannan Hormizd, and in 1827 fled to Amid, becoming its metropolitan in 1828.

Basil Asmar was succeeded as metropolitan of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya in 1830 by the energetic [[Joseph Audo]], who was transferred from Mosul to the diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya under the settlement which confirmed Yohannan VIII Hormizd as patriarch and ended the schism in the Chaldean Church.  During his metropolitanate Audo converted many of the villages of the Sapna valley to Catholicism.  After he became patriarch in 1848 he was succeeded as metropolitan of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya in 1851 by {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Thomas Dirsho, a monk of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd, who died in 1859.

The future patriarch [[Audishu V Khayyath|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Giwargis Khayyat]] became bishop of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya in 1860.  He was succeeded in 1874 by Mattai Paul Shamina, who exchanged dioceses in 1879 with Quriaqos Giwargis Goga, bishop of [[Zakho]], who resigned in 1893.  Eliya Joseph Khayyat was elected for {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya in 1893, but at the synod of Alqosh in 1894 the newly elected patriarch {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} V Khayyat asked to retain him as his patriarchal vicar.  As a result, the dioceses of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya and {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aqra were temporarily united under Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob Yohannan Sahhar, bishop of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aqra, who was responsible for the united diocese from 23 April 1895 until his death in 1909.

He was succeeded as bishop of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya by Francis Daoud of Araden (the only nineteenth-century Chaldean bishop from the {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya region), who had been Sahhar's vicar-general for several years previously.  He was consecrated for {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya on 15 August 1910, resided in the Sapna village of Araden, and remained bishop of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya until his death in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdavidf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Daoud's successors were Yohannan Qoryo (1942–6), Raphael Rabban (1947–57), Raphael Bidawid (1957–66), Andrew Sana (1966–7), Quriaqos Musa (1967–8), and Yohannan Qello (1973–2001).&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001 the elderly bishop Yohannan Qello of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, who died on 7 September 2002, was succeeded by Rabban Al-Qas.  Rabban Al-Qas was also apostolic administrator of the Chaldean archdiocese of Erbil, vacant since the death of Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob Denha Scher in 2005, until the appointment of [[Bashar Warda]] in 2010.

In July 2013, the Chaldean diocese of Amadiya was united with the vacant diocese of Zakho. Currently Raban al-Qas is the Bishop of Zakho and Amadiya.

== Population statistics ==
In modern times Assyrians (Including Chaldean groups) comprise 30% of the [[Amadiya District]], and 3,500+ Chaldean people are recorded in the [[Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Zakho|Zakho District]] according to old Church Records from before the merger. After the merger the combined diocese population is 18,500 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/damza.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850 the diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya included the towns of Dohuk and {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya and fourteen villages, all but one either around Dohuk or in the Gomel and Sapna valleys, and contained 466 Chaldean families, with 8 priests and 14 churches (Badger).  The diocese also included at this period the Catholic communities in Herpa and Barzane, and probably other villages in the {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aqra region.

In the 1850s Dohuk and several villages in the Dohuk district and {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aqra region were transferred to the new dioceses of Zakho and {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aqra.  The reduced diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya contained 6,020 Chaldeans, with 10 priests, in 1867 (Martin); and 3,000 Chaldeans, with 13 priests and 16 churches, in 1896 (Chabot).  In 1913 the diocese included {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya and sixteen villages, most of them in the Sapna and Gomel valleys, and contained 4,970 Chaldeans, with 19 priests and 10 churches (Tfinkdji).

A recently published book by Youel Baaba has supplied the Syriac names of the villages in the diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya.&lt;ref&gt;Baaba, ''The Assyrian Homeland'', 69 (Syriac section)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tfinkdji mentioned that the diocese contained about 4,000 'Nestorians' in 1913, a figure not much smaller than its Chaldean population.  This is a remarkably high figure for the Sapna and Shemkan villages, exposed to Catholic influence for over a century; and as Chabot did not mention a substantial traditionalist population in the diocese in 1896, it probably included the population of the East Syriac villages in the Berwari region, perhaps considered nominally part of the diocese of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya after the conversion of the traditionalist bishop Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb of Berwari in 1903.

[[File:Juan Manuel Lopez.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Juan Manuel López (boxer)|Juan Manuel López]] with the WBO Latino Super Bantamweight championship belt]]

A '''championship belt''' is a large, extravagantly designed [[belt (clothing)|belt]] used primarily in combat sports such as [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], and [[professional wrestling]] to signify the champions of the promotion or company, much like a cup or trophy in other sports. There are several companies in the business of constructing championship belts.

==Early history==
The first belt given as a prize for accomplishments within the ring was presented in 1810 by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle]] boxer [[Tom Cribb]], after he defeated [[Tom Molineaux]], an American former slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Boxing==
In boxing, the individual organizations such as the [[World Boxing Council]], the [[World Boxing Association]], the [[International Boxing Federation]], and the [[World Boxing Organization]] each have their own unique championship belt that are awarded to the champions of each [[weight class (boxing)|weight class]].  Boxers strive to win the belt of all four organizations to unify their weight divisions. ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' also created a championship system that is "intended to reward fighters who, by satisfying rigid criteria, can justify a claim as the true and only world champion in a given weight class."

Champions maintain permanent possession of these belts even upon losing their title, with a new belt made when a new champion is crowned.

==Professional wrestling==
{{main|Professional wrestling championship}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:World Heavyweight Championship (WWE) (2002) - present.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|The "[[Big Gold Belt]]", a famous pro wrestling championship belt design used to represent multiple championships over its history.]] --&gt;
[[Professional wrestling]] is a form of entertainment which combines athletics and theatrical performance in a mimicry of combat sports. Many storylines center around the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion's]] [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]], which are represented by championship belts similar to those in boxing. The top title in a major promotion is usually designated a "world heavyweight championship".  Other, lesser championships may carry regional names, be limited to a specific weight class, or be defended in other special circumstances, such as the traditional tag team match.  

Typically, pro wrestling title belts have a unique design for each title, in contrast with boxing and mixed martial arts (MMA) where the title belts of a given sanctioning body are all the same design. The [[Big Gold Belt]] design, for example, is very recognizable and has been used by various wrestling promotions since the 1980s. 

In 2016, [[WWE]] began to streamline their championships, making their top male and female championships have the same design, similar to boxing and MMA. The only differences between them are the colors (to represent if the title belongs to either the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] or [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]]), the name on the belt, and the women's belts are smaller. The tag team championships also have the same design between each other with the only difference being the color of the straps.

==Mixed martial arts==
[[File:UFC Championship Belt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] [[Heavyweight (MMA)|heavyweight]] championship belt.]]

[[Mixed martial arts]] generally follows the boxing model of each sanctioning group, which is also a promotion, awarding its champion in each [[Mixed martial arts weight classes|weight class]] a championship belt. As in boxing, the design of each promotion's belts are the same regardless of weight class, and the champion keeps their belt after losing the title.

==Motorsports==
The [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] offers a championship belt in lieu of the traditional trophy for drivers who win the [[Kobalt 400|Pennzoil 400]] NASCAR Monster Energy Cup race there, owing to the traditional site of Las Vegas as the fight capital of the world.

==Other sports==

Historically, the championship belt was also awarded to the winner of professional golf tournaments. Rodeo tournaments also award special belts, among other prizes.

'''Charles Gibson''' (12 August 1920 - 22 August 1985, Keeseville, N.Y.) was an [[Americans|American]] [[ethnohistorian]] who wrote foundational works on the [[Nahua peoples]] of [[colonial Mexico]] and was elected President of the [[American Historical Association]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Robert A. Potash|es|3=Robert Potash}}, "Charles Gibson (August 12, 1920- August 22, 1985, ''[[Handbook of Latin American Studies]]'', vol. 48, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chevalier, François]] (May 1986).

His dissertation on the Nahua polity of [[Tlaxcala]] (published in 1952 as ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century''), a key ally of the Spaniards in the [[conquest of Mexico]], was the first major study of conquest and early colonial era Nahuas from the indigenous perspective. It remains a model for scholars working on Mesoamerican ethnohistory, or more simply put, history of Mexican Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart,"Charles Gibson and the Ethnohistory of Postconquest Central Mexico."&lt;/ref&gt;  He also contributed to the creation of important bibliographic guides to works in [[Mexican history]], such as the ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'' and Mesoamerican ethnohistory as well as an index to the journal ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]].'' The culmination of his work on colonial-era Nahuas is ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810'' (1964), which "reordered the research priorities for a generation of colonial historians."&lt;ref&gt;Potash, "Charles Gibson," p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eamon Duffy''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries|FSA]] [[Knight of St. Gregory|KSG]]}} (born 9 February 1947) is an Irish historian and academic. He is Professor of the History of Christianity at the [[University of Cambridge]], and a Fellow and former President of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040224073356/http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/people/fellows/allfellows.html Alphabetical list of all fellows], [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Duffy was born on 9 February 1947 in [[Dundalk]], Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name=Cradle&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3aWWI1EOo2cC&amp;pg=PA11 "Confessions of a Cradle Catholic"]&lt;/ref&gt; He describes himself as a "cradle Catholic".&lt;ref name=Cradle/&gt; He was educated at [[St Philip's School]] and undertook [[postgraduate studies]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where his doctoral advisers were [[Owen Chadwick]] and [[Gordon Rupp]].&lt;ref name="bio - Faculty of Divinity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Eamon Duffy FBA|url=http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/eamon-duffy|website=Faculty of Divinity|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Duffy specialises in 15th- to 17th-century religious history of Britain. He is also a former member of the Pontifical Historical Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_mipeople&amp;view=person&amp;id=18&amp;departmentid=2&amp;Itemid=60 Eamon Duffy profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114458/http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_mipeople&amp;view=person&amp;id=18&amp;departmentid=2&amp;Itemid=60 |date=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has done much to overturn the popular image of late-medieval Catholicism in England as moribund, and instead presents it as a vibrant cultural force. On weekdays from 22 October to 2 November 2007, he presented the BBC Radio 4 series ''10 Popes Who Shook the World''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/tenpopeswhoshooktheworld/ Ten Popes Who Shook the World], ''BBC Radio 4''&lt;/ref&gt; – those popes featured were [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]], [[Gregory the Great|Gregory I]], [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]], [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]], [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]], [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]], and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]].

[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disk]]]]
&lt;!-- Note: per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]], topic name should ''not'' be bold because the title of this article is descriptive --&gt;
The formation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] began 4.6 [[bya|billion years ago]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name="Bouvier" /&gt; Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a [[protoplanetary disk]] out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] formed.

This model, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]] was first developed in the 18th century by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]]. Since the dawn of the [[space age]] in the 1950s and the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]] in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.

The Solar System has [[wikt: evolution|evolved]] considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's [[Moon]], may be the result of [[giant impact hypothesis|giant collisions]]. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.&lt;ref name="Gomes" /&gt; This [[planetary migration]] is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.

In roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a [[red giant]]), before casting off its outer layers as a [[planetary nebula]] and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a [[white dwarf]]. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into [[interstellar space]]. Ultimately, over the course of [[Timeline of the far future|tens of billions]] of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses}}
[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]
Ideas concerning the origin and fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories to the existence of a "Solar System", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of [[heliocentrism]], which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the [[Earth]] in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia ([[Aristarchus of Samos]] had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary | title=Solar system | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solar%20system | accessdate=2008-04-15 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current standard [[theory]] for Solar System formation, the [[nebular hypothesis]], has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of [[angular momentum]] when compared to the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michael Mark Woolfson | author-link=Michael Woolfson | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume=313 | title=Rotation in the Solar System | issue=1524 |year=1984 | pages=5–18 | bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W | doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100 | title=Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table | work=New Scientist | author=Nigel Henbest |year=1991 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]'s confirmation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sun: A Biography | author=David Whitehouse | date=2005 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-470-09297-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science | author=Simon Mitton | publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222 | isbn=978-1-85410-961-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] [[B2FH paper|elaborated]] on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called [[red giant]]s [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|created many elements]] heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005/&gt;

Because of the [[conservation of angular momentum]], the nebula spun faster as it collapsed.

The various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chondrule-forming Shock Fronts in the Solar Nebula: A Possible Unified Scenario for Planet and Chondrite Formation|author1=A.

Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies ([[planetesimals]]) of ~10&amp;nbsp;kilometres (km) in size.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973/&gt; These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year over the course of the next few million years.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P.

The [[inner Solar System]], the region of the Solar System inside 4&amp;nbsp;AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like [[iron]], [[nickel]], and [[aluminium]]) and rocky [[silicate]]s. These rocky bodies would become the [[terrestrial planet]]s ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 [[Earth mass]]es ({{Earth mass}}) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000&amp;nbsp;years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see [[#Terrestrial planets|Terrestrial planets]] below).&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

When the terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting [[drag (physics)|drag]] and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of [[angular momentum]], and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits.

The [[giant planet]]s ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) formed further out, beyond the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] elements.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to {{Earth mass|4|link=y}} within about 3&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The combined mass of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is 445.6 Earth masses. The mass of remaining material is ~5.26 Earth masses or 1.1% (see [[Solar System#Notes]] and [[List of Solar System objects by mass]])&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of {{Earth mass|10}}, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.&lt;ref name=ayliffe_bate_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayliffe|first=B.|author2= Bate, M.

T Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger [[stellar wind]]s than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong [[solar wind]] had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, those planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium—not more than {{Earth mass|1}} each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores.&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt; The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete.&lt;ref name="ddl2011" /&gt;  This means that Uranus and Neptune  may have formed closer to the Sun—near or even between Jupiter and Saturn—and later migrated or were ejected outward (see [[#Planetary migration|Planetary migration]] below).&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return from [[Comet Wild 2]] has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006|author=Emily Lakdawalla|work=The Planetary Society|title=Stardust Results in a Nutshell: The Solar Nebula was Like a Blender | url = http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000735/| accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent evolution==
The planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. From that a minimum mass of the nebula i.e. the protoplanetary disc, was derived that was necessary to form the planets - the minimum mass solar nebula. It was derived that the nebula mass must have exceeded 3585 times that of the Earth.

However, this has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the [[Kuiper belt]] was much closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Michael E.

===Terrestrial planets===
At the end of the planetary formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kominami"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Tidal Interaction with a Gas Disk on Formation of Terrestrial Planets|author1=Junko Kominami |author2=Shigeru Ida |place=Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo|year=2001 | doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6811|journal=Icarus|
volume=157|issue=1|pages=43–56|bibcode=2002Icar..157...43K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100&amp;nbsp;million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see [[#Moons|Moons]] below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Solomon2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sean C.

One unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt; One hypothesis for this "eccentricity dumping" is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The "[[gravitational drag]]" of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits.&lt;ref name= Kominami /&gt; However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a "gravitational wake", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final Stages of Planet Formation|author1=Peter Goldreich |author2=Yoram Lithwick |author3=Re'em Sari |journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=614|issue=1|pages=497–507|date=10 October 2004|doi=10.1086/423612|bibcode=2004ApJ...614..497G|arxiv = astro-ph/0404240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asteroid belt===
The outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, is called the [[asteroid belt]]. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of [[planetesimal]]s formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s;&lt;ref name="Bottke2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bottke, William F. |author2=Durda, Daniel D. |author3=Nesvorny, David |display-authors=et al. | title=Linking the collisional history of the main asteroid belt to its dynamical excitation and depletion | journal=Icarus | volume=179|issue=1 | pages=63–94|year=2005 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.017 | url = http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_Icarus_2005_179_63-94_Linking_Collision_Dynamics_MB.pdf|format=PDF | bibcode=2005Icar..179...63B }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3&amp;nbsp;million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically.&lt;ref name="Petit2001"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jean-Marc |last=Petit |first2=Alessandro |last2=Morbidelli |title=The Primordial Excitation and Clearing of the Asteroid Belt |journal=Icarus |volume=153 |issue=2 |pages=338–347 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6702 |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/asteroids.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2001Icar..153..338P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances.

According to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the "wrong place".

According to the [[Nice model]], after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600&amp;nbsp;million years (about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05" /&gt;
The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being [[Interstellar comet|ejected]] from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent.&lt;/ref&gt; Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including [[Pluto]], became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into [[mean-motion resonance]]s.&lt;ref name=Malhorta1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=R. Malhotra | title=The Origin of Pluto's Orbit: Implications for the Solar System Beyond Neptune | journal=Astronomical Journal | arxiv=astro-ph/9504036 |year=1995 | volume=110 | pages=420 | doi=10.1086/117532 | bibcode=1995AJ....110..420M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fogg_nelson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

Another question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the [[Grand tack hypothesis]]), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5&amp;nbsp;AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/News/2011/06/Jupiter%20may%20have%20robbed%20Mars%20of%20mass%20new%20report%20indicates.aspx | title= Jupiter may have robbed Mars of mass, new report indicates | work= Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas | date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Walsh, K.

Impacts are thought to be a regular (if currently infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]] in 1994, the [[2009 Jupiter impact event]], the [[Tunguska event]], the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] and the impact feature [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]].

Over the course of the Solar System's evolution, [[comet]]s were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent thousands of AU outward to form the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by [[galactic tide]]s, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli2006"&gt;{{cite arXiv

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact]] thought to have formed the [[Moon]]]]
Moons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These [[natural satellite]]s originated by one of three possible mechanisms:
* Co-formation from a circumplanetary disc (only in the cases of the giant planets);
* Formation from impact debris (given a large enough impact at a shallow angle); and
* Capture of a passing object.

Jupiter and Saturn have several large moons, such as [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which may have originated from discs around each giant planet in much the same way that the planets formed from the disc around the Sun.&lt;ref name="arxiv0812"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Canup, Robin M. |author2=Ward, William R. |title=Origin of Europa and the Galilean Satellites |publisher=University of Arizona Press |date=2008-12-30 |arxiv=0812.4995|bibcode = 2009euro.book...59C |page=59|isbn=978-0-8165-2844-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_podolak_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2= Podolak, M.|title=Capture and Evolution of Planetesimals in Circumjovian Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2015|volume=806|issue=1|pages=29pp|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/203|arxiv = 1504.04364 |bibcode = 2015ApJ...806..203D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N.

==Future==
Astronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning [[stellar evolution|its evolution]] from the [[main sequence]] of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] and into its [[red giant|red-giant]] phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.

===Long-term stability===
The Solar System is [[chaos theory|chaotic]] over million- and billion-year timescales,&lt;ref name=laskar94&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Large-scale chaos in the solar system

|volume=287
|pages=L9–L12
|year=1994
|bibcode=1994A&amp;A...287L...9L }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 [[orbital resonance]]. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10–20&amp;nbsp;million years (the [[Lyapunov time]]) into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Numerical evidence that the motion of Pluto is chaotic |author1=Gerald Jay Sussman |author2=Jack Wisdom | journal = Science | volume = 241 | pages = 433–437 |year = 1988 | url = http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/pluto-chaos.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.241.4864.433 | pmid = 17792606 | issue = 4864 | bibcode=1988Sci...241..433S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Earth's [[axial tilt]], which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon ([[#Moon–ring systems|see below]]), is incomputable from some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the long term evolution of the spin of the Earth|author=O. Neron de Surgy |author2=J. Laskar|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=February 1997|volume=318|pages=975–989 |bibcode=1997A&amp;A...318..975N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer planets' orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2–230&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=hayes07&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wayne B. Hayes | title=Is the outer Solar System chaotic? | journal=Nature Physics | arxiv=astro-ph/0702179 |year=2007 | volume=3 | issue=10 | pages=689–691 | doi=10.1038/nphys728 | bibcode=2007NatPh...3..689H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all cases this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—[[ellipse|elliptical]].&lt;ref name="Stewart1997"&gt;{{cite book

Ultimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years.&lt;ref name=hayes07/&gt; Beyond this, within five&amp;nbsp;billion years or so Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision.

===Moon–ring systems===
The evolution of moon systems is driven by [[tide|tidal forces]]. A moon will raise a [[tidal bulge]] in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, [[angular momentum]] is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.

The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is [[tidally locked]] to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. Other examples are the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1982MNRAS.201..415G | title=Tidal Heating of Io and orbital evolution of the Jovian satellites | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | author=A. Gailitis | volume=201 | pages=415 |year=1980 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/201.2.415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the larger moons of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Bevilacqua |author2=O.

[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|Neptune and its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], taken by ''[[Voyager 2]]''. Triton's orbit will eventually take it within Neptune's [[Roche limit]], tearing it apart and possibly forming a new ring system.]]
A different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).&lt;ref group=note&gt;In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place. It is the loss of dynamical energy through friction that makes transfer of angular momentum possible.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal deceleration|tidal deceleration]] causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a [[planetary ring]] system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] of Mars (within 30&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;million years),&lt;ref name=Bills2006&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bruce G.

A third possibility is where the primary and moon are [[tidally locked]] to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior to the 2004 arrival of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' spacecraft, the [[rings of Saturn]] were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not expected to survive beyond another 300&amp;nbsp;million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturn Rings Still A Mystery |work=Popular Mechanics |author=Stefano Coledan |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015710/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from the ''Cassini'' mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10&amp;nbsp;km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass is thought to have preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Saturn's recycled rings | journal=Astronomy Now| pages=9 |date=February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into [[carbon]] will begin, leading to a [[helium flash]]; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11&amp;nbsp;times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770&amp;nbsp;K. The Sun will become a [[Horizontal branch|horizontal giant]], burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100&amp;nbsp;million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic giant]]. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=Schroder2008/&gt; This phase lasts about 30&amp;nbsp;million years, after which, over the course of a further 100,000&amp;nbsp;years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a [[planetary nebula]]. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.&lt;ref name=nebula&gt;{{cite web | author=Bruce Balick | title=Planetary nebulae and the future of the Solar System | work=Personal web site | url = http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/| accessdate=2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M57 The Ring Nebula.JPG|thumb|The [[Ring nebula]], a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will become]]
This is a relatively peaceful event, nothing akin to a [[supernova]], which the Sun is too small to undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Gaseous Metal Disk Around a White Dwarf|author1=B.

As the Sun dies, its gravitational pull on the orbiting bodies such as planets, comets and asteroids will weaken due to its mass loss. All remaining planets' orbits will expand; if Venus, Earth, and Mars still exist, their orbits will lie roughly at {{convert|1.4|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}, {{convert|1.9|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}, and {{convert|2.8|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}.

==Galactic interaction==
[[File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg|left|thumb|Location of the Solar System within the Milky Way]]
The Solar System travels alone through the [[Milky Way]] in a circular orbit approximately 30,000&amp;nbsp;light years from the [[Galactic Centre]]. Its speed is about 220&amp;nbsp;km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the [[galactic year]], is in the range of 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml|work=The Physics Factbook (self-published)| author=Stacy Leong| editor=Glenn Elert |year=2002|title=Period of the Sun's Orbit around the Galaxy (Cosmic Year) | accessdate=2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists have speculated that the Solar System's path through the galaxy is a factor in the periodicity of [[mass extinction]]s observed in the Earth's [[fossil record]]. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-03-25
| publisher = The Scientific Research Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's [[spiral arms]]. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright [[blue giant]]s, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as [[supernovae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mass Extinctions and The Sun's Encounters with Spiral Arms|author1=Erik M.

===Galactic collision and planetary disruption===
{{Main article|Andromeda–Milky Way collision}}
Although the vast majority of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as [[tidal force]]s distort their outer arms into vast [[tidal tails]]. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%,&lt;ref name=cox /&gt; the galaxies' [[supermassive black hole]]s will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant [[elliptical galaxy]]. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a [[Starburst galaxy|starburst]].&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an [[active galactic nucleus]]. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.&lt;ref name=cain&gt;{{cite web|title=When Our Galaxy Smashes Into Andromeda, What Happens to the Sun?|author=Fraser Cain|work=Universe Today|url = http://www.universetoday.com/2007/05/10/when-our-galaxy-smashes-into-andromeda-what-happens-to-the-sun/|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Collision Between The Milky Way And Andromeda |author1=J. T. Cox |author2=Abraham Loeb | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |arxiv=0705.1170 |year=2007 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13048.x|volume=386|issue=1|pages=461–474 | bibcode=2008MNRAS.386..461C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although it is true that the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html |author=NASA|title=NASA's Hubble Shows Milky Way is Destined for Head-On Collision |work=NASA |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time, the [[Cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability]] of a chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the [[Big Crunch]] or [[Big Rip]] scenarios for the end of the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1&amp;nbsp;quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Time Without End: Physics and Biology in an open universe|author=Freeman Dyson|place=Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton New Jersey|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=51 | pages=447–460|date=July 1979 | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 |accessdate=2008-04-02 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447|issue=3 | bibcode=1979RvMP...51..447D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{wide image|Solar Life Cycle.svg|600px|alt=Projected timeline of the Sun's life. From Formation To 14Gy}}
The time frame of the Solar System's formation has been determined using [[radiometric dating]]. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years old. The [[oldest rock|oldest known mineral grains]] on [[Earth]] are approximately 4.4&amp;nbsp;billion years old.&lt;ref name=Wilde&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=175–8 | title= Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago |author1=Simon A.

To estimate the age of the Solar System, scientists use [[meteorite]]s, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the [[Canyon Diablo meteorite]]) are found to have an age of 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date=2000 |author=Gary Ernst Wallace|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Earth's Place in the Solar System|title=Earth Systems: Processes and Issues|pages=45–58|isbn=0-521-47895-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of discs around other stars have also done much to establish a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10&amp;nbsp;million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

'''Frederick Alexander''' (known primarily as '''Fred Alexander''') (12 April 1899 – 1996) was an Australian historian who specialised in foreign affairs and policy. He was the founding Head of the [[University of Western Australia]]'s Department of History, where he was instrumental in the development of the history curriculum.&lt;ref name="De Garis 1988"&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Brian De Garis|de Garis, Brian]] | year = 1988 | chapter = Fred Alexander: A tribute | editor = [[Brian De Garis|de Garis, Brian]] | title = Studies in Western Australian History '''VI''' | publisher = Department of History, [[The University of Western Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Limb" &gt;{{Cite journal|last= Limb |first=Peter |title=An Australian historian at the dawn of apartheid: Fred Alexander in South Africa, 1949-50 | journal=The Electronic Journal of Australian and New Zealand History |url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/aff/history/pdf/limb.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of a primary school headmaster,&lt;ref name="Alexander 1987"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Alexander, Fred | year = 1987 | title = On Campus and Off: Reminiscences and Reflections of the First Professor of Modern History in The University of Western Australia, 1916–1986 | publisher = [[University of Western Australia Press]] | id = 0855642645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Alexander was born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 12 April 1899.&lt;ref name="De Garis 1988"/&gt; He attended [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]], and in 1916 won an exhibition to attend lectures at [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]] during his studied at the [[University of Melbourne]], where he intended to gain a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree. However, he   developed an interest in history under the influence of  Professor [[Ernest Scott]], and deferred his law studies to obtain a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with [[First Class Honours]] in history. He then completed his third year of law studies, but in 1920 he won an [[Orient Line]] scholarship that enabled him to pursue studies at the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]].&lt;ref name="Limb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander 1987"/&gt;

During his second year at Balliol, he suffered from a recurrent illness, and in 1923 he was advised by his doctors to take a long sea voyage. That year, he sailed for Melbourne; when his ship docked at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], he took the opportunity to visit [[Edward Shann]], the foundation professor of History and Economics at the University of Western Australia. The following year, after returning to England, receiving the [[Herbertson Prize in History]] along with a M.A., and getting married, he received from Shann an offer of appointment as Assistant Lecturer at the University of Western Australia. He arrived in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in September 1924.

In 1949-50, he spent four months in South Africa as a [[Carnegie Fellow]], an experience which caused him to concentrate on Commonwealth history.&lt;ref name= "Limb" /&gt; He retired in 1966, and later served as Chairman of the Library Board of Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Alexander |first1=Fred | title=Library Board collection | publication-date=1976 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32319573 | accessdate=17 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alexander Library Building]] is named after him.

'''Historicity''' is the historical actuality of persons and events, meaning the quality of being part of [[history]] as opposed to being a historical [[myth]], [[legend]], or [[fiction]]. Historicity focuses on the true value of knowledge claims about the past (denoting historical actuality, authenticity, and factuality). The historicity of a claim about the past is its factual status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wandersee | first1 = J. H. | year = 1992 | title = The historicality of cognition: Implications for science education research | url = | journal = J. Res. Sci. Teach | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 423–434 | doi = 10.1002/tea.3660290409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harre, R., &amp; Moghaddam, F.M. (2006). Historicity, social psychology, and change. In Rockmore, T. &amp; Margolis, J. (Eds.), History, historicity, and science (pp. 94-120). London: Ashgate Publishing Limited., [http://fathalimoghaddam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1324346188.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theoreticians characterize historicity as a dimension of all natural phenomena that take place in space and time. Other scholars characterize it as an attribute reserved to certain human phenomena, in agreement with the practice of [[historiography]].&lt;ref name="Blaga"&gt;Jones, Michael S., "Lucian Blaga, The Historical Phenomenon: An Excerpt from The Historical Being" (2012). Faculty Publications and Presentations. Paper 1. [http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/phil_fac_pubs/1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Marcuse]] explained historicity as that which “defines history and thus distinguishes it from ‘nature’ or from the ‘economy’” and “signifies the meaning we intend when we say of something that is ‘historical’.”&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''Hegel’s Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'', trans. by Seyla Benhabib (Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England: The MIT Press, 1987), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy defines historicity as "denoting the feature of our human situation by which we are located in specific concrete temporal and historical circumstances." For [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], historicity identifies human beings as unique and concrete historical beings.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin, N., &amp; Yu, J. (2004). The Blackwell dictionary of Western philosophy. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub. [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067959_ss1-63]&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions regarding historicity concern not just the issue of "what really happened," but also the issue of how modern observers can come to know "what really happened."&lt;ref&gt;[[William J. Hamblin]], professor of history at Brigham Young University. Two part article on historicity, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/enigmaticmirror/2014/04/22/dh-19-historicity-1/] and [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/enigmaticmirror/2014/04/23/dh-20-historicity-2/]&lt;/ref&gt; This second issue is closely tied to historical research practices and methodologies for analyzing the reliability of [[primary sources]] and other evidence. Because various methodologies thematize historicity differently, it's not possible to reduce historicity to a single structure to be represented. Some methodologies (for example [[historicism]]), can make historicity subject to constructions of history based on submerged value commitments.&lt;ref name="Hall1"&gt;Hall, J. (2007).

Questions of historicity are particularly relevant to partisan or poetic accounts of past events. For example, the [[historicity of the Iliad]] has become a topic of debate because later archaeological finds suggest that the work was based on some true event.

Questions of historicity also arise frequently in relation to historical studies of religion. In these cases, value commitments can influence the choice of research methodology.&lt;ref name="Hall2" /&gt;

YouTube began as an [[angel investor|angel-funded]] enterprise working from a makeshift office in a garage. In November 2005, venture firm [[Sequoia Capital]] invested an initial $3.5 million,&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Woolley|url=http://members.forbes.com/global/2006/0313/027.html|title=Raw and Random|work=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|date=March 3, 2006|accessdate=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roelof Botha]] (a partner of the firm and former CFO of PayPal) joined the YouTube board of directors.

According to the website Hitwise.com, YouTube commanded up to 64% of the UK online video market.&lt;ref name="YouTube Google Zeitgeist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=1837|title=Google pays the price to capture online video zeitgeist|work=Eureka Street|volume=16|number=15|author=James Massola |publisher=Jesuit Communications Australia|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube planned to continue operating independently, with its co-founders and 68 employees working within Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/10/09/technology/googleyoutube_deal/index.htm?cnn=yes|title=Google to buy YouTube for $1.65 billion|date=October 9, 2006 |accessdate= October 9, 2006|agency=[[CNN]]|department=[[CNNMoney]]|first=Paul R.|last=La Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with [[MGM]], [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], and [[CBS]], allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called "Shows". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as [[Hulu]], which features material from [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MGM to Post Full Films on YouTube|author=Brad Stone and Brooks Barnes|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10mgm.html?ref=technology |accessdate=November 29, 2008|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043001853.html|title=It's Official: Disney Joins News Corp., NBCU In Hulu; Deal Includes Some Cable Nets|accessdate=April 30, 2009|date=April 30, 2009|author=Staci D.

Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: "We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube redesigns website to keep viewers captivated |agency=AFP |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-technology/youtube-redesigns-website-to-keep-viewers-captivated-20100401-rfbc.html |author=Chapman, Glenn |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402234432/http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-technology/youtube-redesigns-website-to-keep-viewers-captivated-20100401-rfbc.html |archivedate=April 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day, which was "nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = YouTube serving up two billion videos daily |author=Chapman, Glenn |agency=AFP |work=Sydney Morning Herald |url = http://www.smh.com.au/technology/youtube-serving-up-two-billion-videos-daily-20100518-v8sf.html |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, YouTube reported on the company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day.&lt;ref name="48_hours" /&gt; In January 2012, YouTube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day.&lt;ref name="60_hours" /&gt;

On October 17, 2007, it was announced that a Hong Kong version had been launched. YouTube's Steve Chen said its next target will be Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pshweb01.881903.com/apps/news/html/news/20071017/2007101715593573500.htm 881903.com Commercial Radio]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223205642/http://pshweb01.881903.com/apps/news/html/news/20071017/2007101715593573500.htm |date=December 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inews.i-cable.com/webapps/news_detail.php?id=250154&amp;category=2 CableTV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315023733/http://inews.i-cable.com/webapps/news_detail.php?id=250154&amp;category=2 |date=March 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model, advertising, and profits==
[[Image:Youtubeheadquarterssanbruno.jpg|thumb|right|250px|YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno from 2006 to 2010]]

Before being purchased by Google, YouTube declared that its business model was advertisement-based, making 15 million dollars per month.

Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as "[[materiality (auditing)|not material]]" in a regulatory filing.&lt;ref name=Moneyclip&gt;{{Cite news |first=Yi-Wyn |last=Yen |date= March 25, 2008 |url= http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2008/03/25/youtube-looks-for-the-money-clip/ |title= YouTube Looks for the Money Clip |accessdate= March 26, 2008 |work=fortune.CNN.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, a ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.&lt;ref name="Forbes08"&gt;{{Cite news |first= Quentin |last=Hardy |author2= Evan Hessel |url= https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0616/050.html |title= GooTube |work= Forbes Magazine |date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate= August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some industry commentators have speculated that YouTube's running costs (specifically the network bandwidth required) might be as high as 5 to 6 million dollars per month,&lt;ref&gt;[http://willy.boerland.com/myblog/youtube_bandwidth_usage_25_petabytes_per_month "Youtube bandwidth usage: 25 Petabytes per month"]. Willy Dobbe. July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby fuelling criticisms that the company, like many Internet startups, did not have a viably implemented business model. Advertisements were launched on the site beginning in March 2006. In April, YouTube started using Google [[AdSense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=YouTube: a history |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/7596636/YouTube-a-history.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube subsequently stopped using AdSense but has resumed in local regions.

Advertising is YouTube's central mechanism for gaining revenue. This issue has also been taken up in scientific analysis. [[Don Tapscott]] and Anthony D. Williams argue in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'' that YouTube is an example for an economy that is based on [[mass collaboration]] and makes use of the Internet.
: "Whether your business is closer to Boeing or [[P&amp;G]], or more like YouTube or flickr, there are vast pools of external talent that you can tap with the right approach. Companies that adopt these models can drive important changes in their industries and rewrite the rules of competition"&lt;ref name=Tapscott-2006&gt;Tapscott, Don and Williams, Anthony D. (2006). [http://bochica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Wikinomics_-_Tapscott___Williams__Penguin__2006_.pdf ''Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything'']. New York: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-1-59184-138-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} "new business models for open content will not come from traditional media establishments, but from companies such as Google, Yahoo, and YouTube. This new generation of companies is not burned by the legacies that inhibit the publishing incumbents, so they can be much more agile in responding to customer demands. More important, they understand that you don't need to control the quantity and destiny of bits if they can provide compelling venues in which people build communities around sharing and remixing content. Free content is just the lure on which they layer revenue from advertising and premium services".&lt;ref name=Tapscott-2006/&gt;{{rp|271sq}}

Tapscott and Williams argue that it is important for new media companies to find ways to make a profit with the help of peer-produced content. The new Internet economy, (that they term Wikinomics) would be based on the principles of "openness, peering, sharing, and acting globally". Companies could make use of these principles in order to gain profit with the help of [[Web 2.0]] applications: "Companies can design and assemble products with their customers, and in some cases customers can do the majority of the value creation".&lt;ref name=Tapscott-2006/&gt;{{rp|289sq}} Tapscott and Williams argue that the outcome will be an economic democracy.

There are other views in the debate that agree with Tapscott and Williams that it is increasingly based on harnessing open source/content, networking, sharing, and peering, but they argue that the result is not an economic democracy, but a subtle form and deepening of exploitation, in which labour costs are reduced by Internet-based global outsourcing.

The second view is e.g. taken by Christian Fuchs in his book "[[Internet and Society]]". He argues that YouTube is an example of a business model that is based on combining the gift with the commodity. The first is free, the second yields profit. The novel aspect of this business strategy is that it combines what seems at first to be different, the gift and the commodity. YouTube would give free access to its users, the more users, the more profit it can potentially make because it can in principle increase advertisement rates and will gain further interest of advertisers.&lt;ref name=Fuchs-2008&gt;Fuchs, Christian (2008), [http://fuchs.uti.at/books/internet-society/ ''Internet and Society: Social Theory in the Information Age'']. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0415961327}}. 408 Pages.&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube would sell its audience that it gains by free access to its advertising customers.&lt;ref name=Fuchs-2008/&gt;{{rp|181}}

: "Commodified Internet spaces are always profit-oriented, but the goods they provide are not necessarily exchange-value and market-oriented; in some cases (such as Google, Yahoo, MySpace, YouTube, Netscape), free goods or platforms are provided as gifts in order to drive up the number of users so that high advertisement rates can be charged in order to achieve profit."&lt;ref name=Fuchs-2008/&gt;{{rp|181}}

In June 2009, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'' reported that, according to San Francisco-based IT consulting company RampRate, YouTube was far closer to profitability than previous reports, including the April 2009, projection by investment bank Credit Suisse estimating YouTube would lose as much as $470 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://newteevee.com/2009/04/03/analyst-youtube-could-lose-470m-this-year Analyst: YouTube Could Lose $470M This Year]". Chris Albrecht, Gigaom, April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; RampRate's report pegged that number at no more than $174 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2009/06/maybe_google_is.html "Maybe Google Isn't Losing Big Bucks on YouTube After All"], Rob Hof, ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', June 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program to begin offering some content providers the ability to charge $0.99 per month or more for certain channels, but the vast majority of its videos would remain free to view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22474715|title=YouTube launches pay-to-watch subscription channels|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23184159/youtube-providers-could-begin-charging-fees-this-week|title=YouTube providers could begin charging fees this week|last=Nakaso|first=Dan|work=[[San Jose Mercury News|Mercury News]]|date= May 7, 2013|accessdate= May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canals of the United Kingdom|British canal syste]]m of [[water transport]] played a vital role in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]'s [[Industrial Revolution]] at a time when roads were only just emerging from the medieval mud and long trains of [[packhorse]]s were the only means of "mass" transit by road of raw materials and finished products. (It was no accident that amongst the first canal promoters were the [[The Potteries|pottery manufacturers]] of [[Staffordshire]].) The UK was the first country to acquire a nationwide canal network.&lt;ref name="N/A 1978 990"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader's Digest Library of Modern Knowledge|publisher=London: Readers Digest|year=1978|page=990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Anderton Boat Lift.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Anderton Boat Lift]]]]
The canal system dates to [[Roman Britain]], but was largely used for irrigation or to link rivers. The navigable water network in the British Isles grew as the demand for industrial transport increased. It grew rapidly at first, and became an almost completely connected [[transport network|network]] covering [[South of England|the South]], [[English Midlands|Midlands]], and parts of the [[North of England]] and [[Wales]]. There were canals in [[Scotland]], but they were not connected to the English canals or, generally, to each other (the main exception being the [[Monkland Canal]], the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] and the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] which connected the [[River Clyde]] and [[Glasgow]] to the [[River Forth]] and [[Edinburgh]]). As building techniques improved, older canals were improved by straightening, [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]]s, cuttings, tunnels, [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]]s, [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]]s, and [[boat lift]]s, which together snipped many miles and [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], and therefore hours and cost, from journeys. However, there was often fierce opposition to the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/transportcomms/canalsrivers/overview/canal-acts/ |title=Canal Acts - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The modern canal network came into being because the Industrial Revolution (which began in Britain during the mid-18th century) demanded an economic and reliable way to transport goods and [[Commodity|commodities]] in large quantities. Some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries&lt;ref name = burton-canals-2-skempton&gt;Skempton, quoted in Burton, (1995). Chapter 2: ''The River Navigations''&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the [[Thames]] locks and the [[River Wey Navigation]]. The biggest growth was in the so-called "narrow" canals which extended water transport to the emerging industrial areas of the Staffordshire potteries and Birmingham as well as a network of canals joining Yorkshire and Lancashire and extending to London.

===19th century===
The 19th century saw some major new canals such as the [[Caledonian Canal]] and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. By the second half of the 19th century, many canals were increasingly becoming owned by [[railway company|railway companies]] or competing with them, and many were in decline, with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive. After this, the less successful canals (particularly narrow-locked canals, whose boats could only carry about thirty [[ton]]s) failed quickly.&lt;ref name=CanalAge&gt;{{cite book |last= Hadfield|first= Charles |title= The Canal Age|edition= Second|year= 1981|publisher= David &amp; Charles|isbn= 0-7153-8079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Falkirk Wheel Boat Entry SMC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|upright|The Falkirk Wheel]]
The 20th century brought competition from road haulage, and only the strongest canals survived until the [[Second World War]]. After the war, there was a rapid decline in trade on all the remaining canals, and by the mid 1960s only a token traffic was left, even on the widest and most industrial waterways.

In the 1960s the infant canal leisure industry was only just sufficient to prevent the closure of the remaining canals, but then the pressure to maintain canals for leisure purposes increased. From the 1970s, increasing numbers of closed canals were restored by enthusiast volunteers. The success of these projects has led to the funding and use of contractors to complete large restoration projects and complex civil engineering projects such as the restoration of the Victorian [[Anderton Boat Lift]] and the new [[Falkirk Wheel]] rotating lift.

===21st century===
Restoration projects by volunteer-led groups continue. There is now a substantial network of interconnecting, fully navigable canals across the country. In places, serious plans are in progress by the [[Environment Agency]] and [[British Waterways Board]], later the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]],&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; for building new canals to expand the network, link isolated sections, and create new leisure opportunities for navigating "canal rings", for example the [[Fens Waterways Link]] and the [[Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway]].

==Early history==

===Roman Britain===
The first [[Canals of the United Kingdom|British canals]] were built in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times as [[irrigation]] or [[drainage system (agriculture)|land drainage]] [[canal]]s or short connecting spurs between navigable rivers, such as the [[Foss Dyke]], [[Car Dyke]] and [[Bourne-Morton Canal]]; all in Lincolnshire. ''See [[Roman Britain]]'' and ''[[list of Roman canals]]''.

===Middle Ages===
A spate of building projects, such as castles, monasteries and churches, led to the improvement of rivers for the transportation of building materials.&lt;ref name = rolt-inland&gt;Rolt, ''Inland Waterways''&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Acts of Parliament]] were passed regulating transportation of goods, tolls and horse towpaths for various rivers.&lt;ref name = rolt-inland/&gt;&lt;ref name = burton-canals-2&gt;Burton, (1995). Chapter 2: ''The River Navigations''&lt;/ref&gt; These included the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]], [[River Witham|Witham]], [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Yorkshire Ouse]].&lt;ref name = rolt-inland/&gt; The first Act for navigational improvement in [[England]] was in 1425, for improvement of the [[river Lea]], a major tributary of the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeandstort.co.uk/Fairclough/THE%20NAVIGATION%20OF%20THE%20RIVER%20LEE.pdf History of the Lee Navigation (1190-1790)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canalmuseum.org.uk/history/lee.htm London Canal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-medieval transport systems===
In the post-medieval period, some natural waterways were "canalised" or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century. The first Act of Parliament was obtained by the City of [[Canterbury]] in 1515, to extend navigation on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]] in [[Kent]], followed by the [[River Exe]] in 1539, which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel, the [[Exeter Canal]].&lt;ref name = burton-canals-2/&gt; Simple [[flash lock]]s were provided to regulate the flow of water and allow loaded boats to pass through shallow waters by admitting a rush of water, but these were not purpose-built canals as we understand them today.

The transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads (although there were some surfaced [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] roads). There was also a small amount of traffic carried along navigable rivers. In the 17th century, as early industry started to expand, this transport situation was highly unsatisfactory. The restrictions of coastal shipping and river transport were obvious, and horses and carts could only carry one or two [[ton]]s of cargo at a time. The poor state of most of the roads meant that they could often become unusable after heavy rain. Because of the small loads that could be carried, supplies of essential commodities such as [[coal]] and [[iron ore]] were limited, and this kept prices high and restricted economic growth. One horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time, faster than road transport and at half the cost.&lt;ref name="N/A 1978 990"/&gt;

Some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="burton-canals-2-skempton"/&gt; In 1605, the government of King James I established the [[Oxford-Burcot Commission]], which began to improve the system of [[locks and weirs on the River Thames]], which were opened between Oxford and Abingdon by 1635.&lt;ref&gt;Fred. S. Thacker ''The Thames Highway: Volume I General History'' 1920 - republished 1968 David &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt; In 1635 [[Richard Weston (1591-1652)|Sir Richard Weston]] was appointed to develop the [[River Wey Navigation]], making [[Guildford]] accessible by 1653.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography - Sir Richard Weston&lt;/ref&gt; In 1670 the [[Stamford Canal]] opened, indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks. In 1699 legislation was passed to permit the [[Aire &amp; Calder Navigation]] which was opened 1703, and the Trent Navigation which was built by [[George Hayne]] and opened in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=12328 History of Burton from 'British History Online']&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Kennet Navigation|Kennet]] built by [[John Hore]] opened in 1723, the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation|Mersey and Irwell]] opened in 1725, and the [[Bristol Avon Navigation|Bristol Avon]] in 1727. [[John Smeaton]] was the engineer of the [[Calder and Hebble Navigation|Calder &amp; Hebble]] which opened in 1758, and a series of eight [[pound lock]]s was built to replace [[flash lock]]s on the River Thames between Maidenhead and Reading, beginning in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Fred. S. Thacker ''The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs'' 1920 - republished 1968 David &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt; The net effect of these was to bring most of England, with the notable exceptions of [[History of Birmingham#Transport and the growth of the town|Birmingham]] and [[History of Staffordshire|Staffordshire]], within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of a waterway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L.T.C. Rolt|title=Navigable Waterways|year=1969|publisher=Longmans, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Industrial Revolution==
The modern canal system was mainly a product of the 18th and early 19th centuries. It came into being because the [[Industrial Revolution]] (which began in Britain during the mid-18th century) demanded an economic and reliable way to transport goods and commodities in large quantities.

By the early 18th century, river navigations such as the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]] were becoming quite sophisticated, with [[pound lock]]s and longer and longer "cuts" (some with intermediate locks) to avoid circuitous or difficult stretches of rivers. Eventually, the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a "pure" canal, a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go, not where a river happened to be.

The claim for the first pure canal in [[Great Britain]] is debated between "Sankey" and "Bridgewater" supporters.&lt;ref name = burton-canals-3&gt;Burton, (1995). Chapter 3: ''Building the Canals''&lt;/ref&gt; The first true canal in the [[United Kingdom]] was the [[Newry Canal]] in [[Northern Ireland]] constructed by [[Thomas Steers]] in 1741.

===The Sankey Brook Navigation===
{{Main article|Sankey Canal}}
The [[Sankey Canal|Sankey Brook Navigation]], which connected [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] with the [[River Mersey]], is often claimed as the first modern "purely artificial" canal, because although it was originally a scheme to make the Sankey Brook navigable, it included an entirely new artificial channel that was effectively a canal along the Sankey Brook valley.&lt;ref name = rolt-inland/&gt;&lt;ref name = burton-canals-3/&gt; However, "Bridgewater" supporters point out that the last quarter-mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) of the navigation is indeed a canalised stretch of the Brook, and that it was the Bridgewater Canal (less obviously associated with an existing river) that captured the popular imagination and inspired further canals.&lt;ref name = rolt-inland/&gt;&lt;ref name = burton-canals-3/&gt;

===The Bridgewater Canal===
{{Main article|Bridgewater Canal}}
In the mid-18th century the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], who owned a number of [[coal mine]]s in northern England, wanted a reliable way to transport his coal to the rapidly industrialising city of [[Manchester]]. He commissioned the engineer [[James Brindley]] to build a canal to do just that. Brindley's design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the [[River Irwell]]. This was an engineering wonder which immediately attracted tourists.&lt;ref name = rolt-inland/&gt;&lt;ref name = burton-canals-3/&gt; The construction of this canal was funded entirely by the Duke and it was called the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. It opened in 1761 and was the longest canal constructed in Britain to that date.

The new canals proved highly successful. The boats on the canals were horse-drawn with a [[towpath]] alongside the canal for the horse to walk along. This horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the British canal network. Commercial horse-drawn canal boats could be seen on the UK's canals until as late as the 1950s, although by then diesel powered boats, often towing a second unpowered boat, had become standard.

The canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time with only one horse pulling&lt;ref name="N/A 1978 990"/&gt; - more than ten times the amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart. Because of this huge increase in supply, the Bridgewater Canal reduced the price of coal in Manchester by nearly two-thirds within just a year of its opening. The Bridgewater Canal was also a huge financial success: it repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years.

===The Golden Age===
This success proved the viability of canal transport, and soon industrialists in many other parts of the country wanted canals. After the Bridgewater Canal, the early canals were built by groups of private individuals with an interest in improving communications. In Staffordshire the famous potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]] saw an opportunity to bring bulky cargoes of clay to his factory doors, and to transport his fragile finished goods to market in Manchester, [[History of Birmingham#Transport and the growth of the town|Birmingham]] or further afield by water, minimising breakages. Within just a few years of the Bridgewater's opening, an embryonic national canal network came into being, with the construction of canals such as the [[Oxford Canal]] and the [[Trent &amp; Mersey Canal]].&lt;ref name="CanalAge"/&gt;

The new canal system was both cause and effect of the rapid industrialisation of the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] and the north. The period between the 1770s and the 1830s is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of British canals.

For each canal, an Act of Parliament was necessary to authorise construction, and as people saw the high incomes achieved from canal tolls, canal proposals came to be put forward by investors interested in profiting from dividends, at least as much as by people whose businesses would profit from cheaper transport of raw materials and finished goods.

In a further development, there was often out-and-out speculation, in which people would try to buy shares in a newly floated company simply to sell them on for an immediate profit, regardless of whether the canal was ever profitable, or even built. During this period of "[[Canal Mania|canal mania]]", huge sums were invested in canal building, and although many schemes came to nothing, the canal system rapidly expanded to nearly 4,000 miles (over 6,400 kilometres) in length.&lt;ref name="N/A 1978 990"/&gt;

Many rival canal companies were formed and competition was rampant. Perhaps the best example was [[Gas Street Basin|Worcester Bar]] in Birmingham, a point where the [[Worcester and Birmingham Canal]] and the [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal Navigations Main Line]] were only {{convert|7|ft}} apart. For many years, a dispute about tolls meant that goods travelling through Birmingham had to be portaged from boats in one canal to boats in the other.&lt;ref name=WestMidlands&gt;{{cite book|last= Hadfield|first= Charles |title= The Canals of the West Midlands|edition= |year= 1966|publisher= David &amp; Charles|isbn= 0-7153-4660-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The people===
For the first era of canals until toll cuts to combat railway competition family boating did not exist.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Crews were all male and their families lived in cottages on the bank. The practice of all male crews for steamers continued until after the [[World War I|First World War]]. Wives and children came aboard as extra labour and to save rental costs during the latter part of the 19th century. About this time boat decoration of "Roses and Castles" began to appear.
During this period, whole families lived aboard the boats. They were often marginalised from land-based society. The church of [[St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford]], under the curacy of John Jones, acquired in 1839 an innovative "Boatman's Floating Chapel", a [[houseboat]] to serve the families working on the river and the canals.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Hibbert
 | first =Christopher &amp; Edward
 | title =The Encyclopaedia of Oxford

 | isbn = 0-333-39917-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This boat was St Thomas' first [[chapel of ease]]; it was donated by H. Ward, a local coal merchant, and used until it sank in 1868. It was replaced by a chapel dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]], which remained in use until 1892.

Others tried to care for the boat people. [[Mary Ward (nurse)|Mary Ward]] (1885–1972) acted as a nurse for decades from the rope shop at [[Stoke Bruerne]].

==Standard locks==
For reasons of economy and the constraints of 18th-century engineering technology, the early canals were built to a narrow width. The standard for the dimensions of narrow [[canal lock]]s was set by Brindley with his first canal locks, those on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] in 1776. These locks were {{convert|72|ft|7|in|m}} long by {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m}} wide.&lt;ref name = burton-canals-3/&gt; The narrow width was perhaps set by the fact that he was only able to build [[Harecastle Tunnel]] to accommodate {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide boats.&lt;ref name = burton-canals-3/&gt;

His next locks were wider. He built locks {{convert|72|ft|7|in|m}} long by {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide when he extended the [[Bridgewater Canal]] to [[Runcorn]], where the canal's only locks lowered boats to the River Mersey.

The narrow locks on the Trent and Mersey limited the width (beam) of the boats (which came to be called ''[[narrowboat]]s''), and thus limited the quantity of the cargo they could carry to around thirty tonnes. This decision would in later years make the canal network economically uncompetitive for freight transport, and by the mid 20th century it was no longer possible to work a thirty-tonne load economically.

==Geography==
Brindley believed it would be possible to use canals to link the four great rivers of England: the Mersey, Trent, Severn and [[River Thames|Thames]]. The Trent and Mersey Canal was the first part of this ambitious network, but although he and his assistants surveyed the whole potential system, he did not live to see it completed - coal was finally transported from the Midlands to the Thames at [[Oxford]] in January 1790, eighteen years after his death. Development of the network was left to other engineers, notably [[Thomas Telford]], whose [[Ellesmere Canal]] helped link the Severn and the Mersey.&lt;ref name="CanalAge"/&gt;

The bulk of the canal system was built in the industrial [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the [[Northern England|north of England]], where navigable rivers most needed extending and connecting, and heavy cargoes of manufactured goods, raw materials or coal most needed carrying. Most of the traffic on the canal network was internal. However, the network linked with coastal [[port]] cities such as London, [[Liverpool]], and [[Bristol]], where cargo could be exchanged with seagoing ships for import and export.&lt;ref name="Hadfield's British Canals"&gt;Boughey, Joseph. (1998) ''Hadfield's British Canals'', Sutton Publishing Ltd, {{ISBN|0-7509-1840-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The West Midlands and the North West of England===
The [[North West England|North West]] and [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] regions contain a dense network of canals.

The great manufacturing cities of Manchester and [[Birmingham]] were major economic drivers for the 'canal mania' which reached its peak in 1793, and both benefited from a network of canals, most of which survive.

In the industrial conurbation of Birmingham and the [[Black Country]], a dense network of nearly {{convert|160|mi}} of canals, dubbed the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]] (BCN) was constructed to serve the network of industries.&lt;ref name="Hadfield's British Canals"/&gt;

A similarly dense network of canals was constructed in the [[Greater Manchester]] area, serving the local textile industries: The [[Bridgewater Canal|Bridgewater]], [[Rochdale Canal|Rochdale]], and [[Ashton Canal|Ashton]] canals were examples of these.

Manchester had a canal connection to the nearby port of Liverpool via the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. However, in the nineteenth century, Manchester's merchants became dissatisfied with the poor service and high charges offered by the Liverpool docks, and the near-monopoly of the railways. They decided to bypass the Liverpool monopoly on coastal trade by converting a section of the [[River Irwell|Irwell]] into the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which opened in 1894, turning Manchester into an inland port in its own right.&lt;ref name="Hadfield's British Canals"/&gt;

Birmingham's canals linked to the national network in several directions. To the north, several trunk cross-country canals, linking Birmingham to Manchester were constructed, including the Trent and Mersey and [[Shropshire Union Canal]]. The [[Coventry Canal]], the Oxford Canal, and what is now the [[Grand Union Canal]] linked southwards to London. And to the south-west, the Worcester &amp; Birmingham and [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal|Staffordshire &amp; Worcestershire]] canals linked to the River Severn.

===Yorkshire and the East of England===
The industrial revolution saw [[Yorkshire]] towns and cities such as [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]], [[Bradford]] and [[Huddersfield]] develop large [[textile]] and coal mining industries, which required an efficient transport system. As early as the late 17th century, the [[Aire and Calder Navigation|Aire and Calder]] and [[Calder and Hebble Navigation|Calder and Hebble]] navigations had been canalised, allowing navigation from Leeds to the [[Humber Estuary]], whereas the [[River Don Navigation]] connected Sheffield to the Humber.&lt;ref name="Hadfield's British Canals"/&gt;

Later in the 18th century, the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] was constructed, creating an east-west link, giving access to the port at Liverpool allowing export of finished goods. The [[Rochdale Canal|Rochdale]] and Huddersfield [[Huddersfield Broad Canal|Broad]] and [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal|Narrow]] canals connected to Manchester.

The [[East Midlands]] cities of [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] were connected to the national network via the canalised River Trent and [[River Soar]], whilst Leicester had a connection to London via the [[Grand Union Canal (old)|Grand Union Canal]].

===London and the South East===
By contrast, London was a [[port]], served by already-navigable rivers like the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Lea]], (which was canalised). It needed canals only to take goods in and out from seagoing ships, where such rivers were unavailable.

As early as 1790 London was linked to the national network via the River Thames and the Oxford Canal. A more direct route between London and the national canal network; the [[Grand Junction Canal]] opened in 1805.

Apart from this, relatively few canals were built in London itself; the few that were included the [[Limehouse Cut]], the [[Regent's Canal]] and the now defunct [[Grand Surrey Canal|Grand Surrey]] and [[Croydon Canal|Croydon]] canals.

To the south of London, the [[Wey and Arun Canal]] linked [[London]] to [[Portsmouth]]. However, the canal was a financial failure and closed in 1871.&lt;ref name="Lost Canals &amp; Waterways of Britain"/&gt;

===South Wales and South West England===
[[File:Stroudwater.jpg|thumb|right|A newly restored section of [[Stroudwater Navigation]] which linked the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] to the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal|Gloucester and Sharpness]] and the River Severn]]
The [[South West England|South West of England]] had several east-west ''cross-country'' canals, which connected the [[River Thames]] to the River Severn and the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]], allowing the cities of [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to be connected to London: These were [[Thames and Severn Canal]] which linked to the [[Stroudwater Navigation]], the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] and the [[Wilts and Berks Canal]], which linked to these three rivers; all of these linked into the national canal system via the Oxford Canal and the River Severn (via the Worcester &amp; Birmingham and [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal|Staffordshire &amp; Worcestershire]] canals). All of these east-west canals fell derelict in the early 20th century, and only the Kennet and Avon is today navigable, having been restored.&lt;ref name="Lost Canals &amp; Waterways of Britain"/&gt;

A few self-contained canals, not connected to the national system, were built in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], such as the [[Bude Canal]] and the [[St. Columb Canal]]. The same was true for [[South Wales]], with several isolated canals running along the [[South Wales Valleys]]. These included the [[Swansea Canal]], the [[Neath and Tennant Canal]], the [[Glamorganshire Canal]] and the [[Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal]]. Nearly all of these canals were constructed to serve local industries, and fell derelict when faced with competition from other modes of transport.&lt;ref name="Lost Canals &amp; Waterways of Britain"&gt;Russell, Ronald. (1983) ''Lost Canals &amp; Waterways of Britain'', Sphere Books Ltd, {{ISBN|0-7221-7562-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Within Scotland, the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] connected the major cities in the industrial [[Central Belt]]; they also provide a short cut for boats to cross between the west and the east without a sea voyage. The [[Caledonian Canal]] provided a similar function in the [[Highland (council area)|Highlands]] of Scotland. The [[Crinan Canal]] avoided the need for a long diversion around the [[Kintyre]] [[peninsula]], and the [[Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal]] was intended to link these three places directly to the west coast of Scotland, but never reached beyond [[Johnstone]]. The [[Monkland Canal]] was conceived in 1769 by tobacco merchants and other entrepreneurs as a way of bringing cheap coal into Glasgow from the coalfields of the Monklands area.

==Operations==
On the majority of British canals, the canal-owning companies did not own or run a fleet of boats since this was usually prohibited by the [[Acts of Parliament]] setting them up to prevent monopolies developing. Instead, they charged private operators tolls to use the canal. These tolls were also usually regulated by the Acts. From these tolls they would try, with varying degrees of success, to maintain the canal, pay back initial loans and pay dividends to their shareholders.

In winter special icebreaker boats with reinforced hulls would be used to break the ice. The boats used on canals were usually derived from local coasting or river craft, but on the narrow canals the {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} narrowboat was the standard. Their {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} length came from the boats used on the Mersey estuary, with their width of {{convert|7|ft}} chosen as half that of existing boats, and adopted to make canals cheaper to build. All boats on the canals were horsedrawn. Packet boats carried packages up to {{convert|112|lb|kg}} in weight as well as passengers at relatively high speed day and night. To compete with railways, the flyboat was introduced, cargo-carrying boats working day and night. These boats were crewed by three men, who operated a watch system whereby two men worked while the other slept. Horses were changed regularly. When steam boats were introduced in the late nineteenth century, crews were enlarged to four. The boats were owned and operated by individual carriers, or by carrying companies who would pay the captain a wage depending on the distance travelled, and the amount of cargo.

==Gradual decline==

===Railway competition===
From about 1840 [[railway]]s began to threaten [[canals]], as they could not only carry more than the canals but could transport people and goods far more quickly than the walking pace of the canal boats. Most of the investment that had previously gone into canal building was diverted into railway building.

Canal companies were unable to compete against the speed of the new railways, and in order to survive, they had to slash their prices. This put an end to the huge profits that canal companies had enjoyed before the coming of the railways, and also had an effect on the boatmen who faced a drop in wages. Flyboat working virtually ceased, as it could not compete with the railways on speed and the boatmen found they could only afford to keep their families by taking them with them on the boats. This became standard practice across the canal system, with in many cases families with several children living in tiny boat cabins, creating a considerable community of boat people. Though this community ostensibly had much in common with [[Romani people|Gypsies]] both communities strongly resisted any such comparison, and surviving boat people feel deeply insulted if described as 'water gypsies'.

By the 1850s the railway system had become well established and the amount of cargo carried on the canals had fallen by nearly two-thirds, lost mostly to railway competition. In many cases struggling canal companies were bought out by railway companies. Sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors' territory, but sometimes canal companies were bought out, either to close them down and remove competition or to build a railway on the line of the canal. A notable example of this is the [[Croydon Canal]]. Larger canal companies survived independently and were able to continue to make profits. The canals survived through the 19th century largely by occupying the niches in the transport market that the railways had missed, or by supplying local markets such as the coal-hungry factories and mills of the big cities.

Overall, the canals adapted to the appearance of railways and in 1900 the canal network differed little from its extent in 1830.

===Limited modernisation to ''broad'' canals===
During the 19th century in much of continental Europe the canal systems of many countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands were drastically modernised and widened to take much larger boats, often able to transport up to two thousand [[tonne]]s, compared to the thirty to one hundred tonnes that was possible on the much narrower British canals. As it is economic to transport freight by canal only if this is done in bulk, the widening ensured that in many of these countries, canal freight transport is still economically viable.

This canal modernisation never occurred on a large scale in the UK, mainly because of the power of the railway companies who owned most of the canals and saw no reason to invest in a competing, and from their point of view obsolete, form of transport. In view of this attitude, there was little point in the non-railway owned canals modernising, since they controlled only parts of the system. The only significant exception to this was the modernisation carried out on the [[Grand Union Canal]] in the 1930s. Thus almost uniquely in Europe, many of the UK's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century: mostly operated with narrowboats less than {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|70|ft|m}} long (although in parts of the country slightly larger canals were constructed, called 'broad' or 'wide' canals, which could take boats that were {{convert|14|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|70|ft|m}} long). A major exception to this stagnation was the Manchester Ship Canal, newly built in the 1890s using the existing [[River Irwell]] and River Mersey, to take ocean-going ships into the centre of Manchester via its neighbour [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].&lt;ref name="CanalAge"/&gt;

===20th century nationalisation===
The canal network gradually declined. During the early 20th century, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, many canals, mostly in rural areas, were abandoned due to falling traffic, caused mainly by competition from road transport. However, the main network saw brief surges in use during the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s and still carried a substantial amount of freight until the early 1950s. The final blow was delivered by technological change.

Most of the canal system and inland waterways were [[Nationalisation|nationalised]] in 1948, along with the [[railways]], under the [[British Transport Commission]], whose subsidiary Docks and Inland Waterways Executive managed them into the 1950s. A report in 1955 by the [[British Transport Commission]] placed the canals in the UK into three categories according to their economic prospects; waterways to be developed, waterways to be retained, and waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Palmer (chairman)|1955|pp=68–70.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s freight transport on the canals declined rapidly in the face of mass road transport, and several more canals were abandoned during this period. Most of the traffic on the canals by this time was in coal delivered to waterside factories which had no other convenient access. In the 1950s and 60s, these factories either switched to using other fuels, often because of the [[Clean Air Act 1956|Clean Air Act]] of 1956, or closed completely. The last regular long distance narrow boat carrying contract, to a jam factory near London, ended in 1971, although lime juice continued to be carried between Brentford and Boxmoor until 1981, substantial tonnages of aggregates were carried by narrow boat subsequently on the Grand Union (River Soar) until 1996 and more recently between Denham and West Drayton.

Under the Transport Act of 1962, the canals were transferred in 1963 to the British Waterways Board (BWB), which later became [[British Waterways]], and the railways to the [[British Railways Board]] (BRB). In the same year a [[Winter of 1962–1963 in the United Kingdom|remarkably harsh winter]] saw many boats frozen into their moorings, and unable to move for weeks at a time. This was one of the reasons given for the decision by BWB to formally cease most of its narrow boat carrying on the canals - with boats and traffics transferred to a private operator, Willow Wren Canal Transport services. By this time the canal network had shrunk to just two thousand miles (3,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres), half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century. However, the basic network was still intact; many of the closures were of duplicate routes or branches.

===Transport Act 1968===
The [[Transport Act 1968]] classified the nationalised waterways as:
* '''Commercial''' - Waterways that could still support commercial traffic;
* '''Cruising''' - Waterways that had a potential for leisure use, such as cruising, fishing and recreational use;
* '''Remainder''' - Waterways for which no potential commercial or leisure use could be seen.

British Waterways Board was required, under the Act, to keep Commercial Waterways, mainly in the north-east, fit for commercial use; and Cruising Waterways fit for cruising. However, these obligations were subject to the caveat of being by the most economical means. There was no requirement to maintain Remainder waterways or keep them in a navigable condition; they were to be treated in the most economic way possible, which could mean abandonment. British Waterways could also change the classification of an existing waterway. Parts, or all, of a Remainder Waterway canal, could also be transferred to local authorities, etc.; and this transfer could, as happened, allow roads and motorways to be built over them, mitigating the need to provide (expensive) [[accommodation bridge]]s or aqueducts. The act also allowed local authorities to contribute to the upkeep of Remainder Waterways.&lt;ref name=1968act&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(UK+Public+General)&amp;title=transport&amp;Year=1968&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2462774&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2462930&amp;filesize=97370 |title=Transport Act 1968 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930083440/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+%28UK+Public+General%29&amp;title=transport&amp;Year=1968&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2462774&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2462930&amp;filesize=97370 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
Though commercial use of the UK's canals declined after the Second World War, recreational use gradually increased as people had more leisure time and disposable income. The establishment in 1946 of a group called the [[Inland Waterways Association]] by [[L. T. C. Rolt]] and [[Robert Aickman]] has helped revive interest in the UK's canals to the point where they are a major leisure destination.

Since the formation of the [[Basingstoke Canal]] Purchasing Committee in March 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Squires (2008), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; [[waterway restoration]] organisations have returned many hundreds of miles of abandoned and remainder canals to use, and work is still ongoing to save many more. Many restoration projects have been led by local canal societies or trusts, who were initially formed to fight the closure of a remainder waterway or to save an abandoned canal from further decay. They now work with local authorities and landowners to develop restoration plans and secure funding. The physical work is sometimes done by contractors, sometimes by volunteers. In 1970 the [[Waterway Recovery Group]] was formed to co-ordinate volunteer efforts on canals and river navigation's throughout the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Squires (2008), p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Waterways]] began to see the economic and social potential of canalside development, and moved from hostility towards restoration, through neutrality, towards a supportive stance. Whilst British Waterways was broadly supportive of restoration, its official policy was that it would not take on the support of newly restored navigations unless they came with a sufficient dowry to pay for their ongoing upkeep. In effect, this meant either reclassifying the Remainder Waterway as a Cruising Waterway or entering into an agreement for another body to maintain the waterway.&lt;ref name=1968act/&gt;

There has also been a movement to redevelop canals in inner city areas, such as Birmingham, Manchester, [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and Sheffield, which have both numerous waterways and urban blight. In these cities, waterways redevelopment provides a focus for successful commercial/residential developments such as [[Gas Street Basin]] in Birmingham, [[Castlefield]] Basin and [[Salford Quays]] in Manchester, [[Victoria Quays]] in Sheffield. However, these developments are sometimes controversial. In 2005 environmentalists complained that housing developments on London's waterways threatened the vitality of the canal system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1404354,00.html Guardian article on London waterways developments]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the major majority of canals in England and Wales are managed by the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]] which, unlike its predecessor British Waterways, tries to have a more positive view on canal restoration and in some cases actively supports ongoing restoration projects such as the restoration projects on the [[Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal]] and the [[Grantham Canal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">'''Ahmad b. Furtu''' or '''Ibn Furtu''' (sometimes also called '''Ibn Fartuwa''') lived in the sixteenth century. He was the grand [[Imam]] of the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]] and the chronicler of ''Mai'' [[Idris Alooma]] (1564–1596).

He wrote two chronicles in Arabic, ''K. ghazawat Barnu'' ("The Book of the Bornu Wars") in 1576 and ''K. ghazawat Kanei'' ("The Book of the Kanem Wars") in 1578. The first book describes in geographical order the military expeditions of ''Mai'' Idris Alooma: 1. against the Sao-Gafata in the region of the [[Komadugu Yobe]]; 2. against the town of Amsaka south of [[Lake Chad]]; 3. against the town of [[Kano]] west of Bornu; 4. against the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of [[Aïr Mountains|Aïr]]; 5. against the [[Margi]] and against [[Mandara Kingdom|Mandara]] south of Lake Chad; 6. against the [[Ngizim people|Ngizim]] west of Bornu and 7. against the Sao-Tatala at the edge of Lake Chad and against some towns of the [[Kotoko kingdom|Kotoko]]. Except a few details on the military achievements of the five predecessors of Idris Alooma he focusses his attention on the expeditions of his Sultan during the first twelve years of his reign. The book on the Kanem wars deals with seven consecutive expeditions against the Bulala from ca. 1573 to 1578. Information on earlier events at the beginning and the end of the book concern the destruction of the national relic called [[Mune]] by [[Dunama Dabbalemi]] (1203–1242), the expulsion of the [[Sayfawa dynasty|Sayfawa]] from [[Kanem Region|Kanem]] by the [[Bulala]] and the temporary reoccupation of the ancient capital of Kanem [[Njimi]] by [[Idris Katakarmabe]] (1487–1509). Some classical poems and quotations from lexicographical books bear witness of the solid education of the author. His somewhat contrived style is characterized by its archaism.

'''Jacob Bronowski''' (18 January 1908 – 22 August 1974) was a Polish-born British mathematician and historian. He is best known for developing a humanistic approach to science, and as the presenter and writer of the thirteen part 1973 [[BBC]] television [[documentary film|documentary]] series, and accompanying book, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'', which led to his regard as "one of the world's most celebrated intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Tim. "[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/15/ascent-man-jacob-bronowski-review The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski]". ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 April  2011. Retrieved 29 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronowski's family moved to Germany and then to England while he was a child. In England won a scholarship to study mathematics at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His interests have been described as ranging "widely, from biology to poetry and from chess to [[Humanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://humanistheritage.org.uk/articles/jacob-bronowski/]". humanistheritage.org.uk. Retrieved 29 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II he led the field of [[operations research]] and worked to increase the effectiveness of Allied bombing. After the war he headed the projects division of [[UNESCO]], and taught mathematics at the [[University College Hull]] between 1934 and 1942. Bronowski wrote poetry and had a deep affinity with [[William Blake]]. From 1950 to 1963 he worked for the [[National Coal Board]] in England. From 1963 he was a resident fellow of the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in San Diego, until his death in 1974 in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton, New York]], just a year after the airing of his ''Ascent of Man''.

==Early life and education==
Jacob Bronowski was born to a Polish-Jewish family in [[Łódź]], [[Congress Poland]], in 1908. His family moved to Germany during the First World War, and to Britain in 1920, Bronowski's parents having been married in Britain in the London house of his maternal grandfather in 1907. Although, according to Bronowski, he knew only two English words on arriving in Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bronowski |first=Jacob | title = The Common Sense of Science | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1967 | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-674-14651-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he gained admission to the [[Central Foundation Boys' School]] in [[London]] and went on to study at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he graduated as a [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gB6ILzCgQ9YC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;dq=bronowski+wrangler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L2yDjPF56Z&amp;sig=ToKNCu9hp3LsBXZil_smnxxVPE4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBGoVChMI5vTUiMqNxwIVRroUCh0t4wDh#v=onepage&amp;q=bronowski%20wrangler&amp;f=false ''New Scientist'' profile 23 November 1961 p 483]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mathematics student at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], Bronowski co-edited—with [[William Empson]]—the literary periodical ''Experiment'', which first appeared in 1928. Bronowski would pursue this sort of dual activity, in both the mathematical and literary worlds, throughout his professional life. He was also a strong chess player, earning a [[Blue (university sport)|half-blue]] while at Cambridge and composing numerous chess problems for the [[British Chess Magazine]] between 1926 and 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Winter | first = Edward | title = Chess Notes | url =  http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter34.html |accessdate = 23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Ph.D. in [[mathematics]] in 1935, writing a dissertation in [[algebraic geometry]]. For a time in the 1930s he lived near [[Laura Riding]] and [[Robert Graves]] in [[Majorca]]. From 1934 to 1942, he taught mathematics at the [[University of Hull|University College of Hull]]. Beginning in this period, the British secret service [[MI5]] placed him under surveillance believing he was a security risk, which may have restricted his access to senior posts in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sanchia |last=Berg |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9444000/9444270.stm |title=MI5 'said Bronowski was a risk' |work=BBC News |date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime work in military analysis==
[[File:J Bronowski.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Jacob Bronowski]]
During the [[Second World War]] Bronowski worked in [[operations research]] for the UK's [[Ministry of Home Security]], where he developed mathematical approaches to bombing strategy for [[RAF Bomber Command]].

At the end of the war, Bronowski was part of a British team of scientists and [[civil engineer]]s that visited [[Japan]] to document the effects of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] for the purpose of studying the effects of the atomic bomb and its implications for future UK [[civil defence]]. Bronowski, in conjunction with Professor W. N. Thomas of the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff]], subsequently produced the secret "''Report of the British Mission to Japan on an Investigation of the Effects of the Atomic Bombs Dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki''" which was passed to various government departments and consulted in the design of future UK public buildings.

==Post-war biological analysis==
Following his experiences of the after-effects of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, he discontinued his work for British military research and turned to [[biology]], as did his friend [[Leó Szilárd]], and many other physicists of that time, to better understand the nature of violence. Subsequently, he became Director of Research for the [[National Coal Board]] in the UK, and an associate director of the [[Salk Institute]] from 1964.

In 1950, Bronowski was given the [[Taung Child|Taung child's]] fossilised skull and asked to try, using his statistical skills, to combine a measure of the size of the skull's teeth with their shape in order to discriminate them from the teeth of apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swetz |first1=Frank J. |date=March 1985 |title=Mathematics: A Vehicle for Better Global Understanding  |jstor=27964452 |journal=The Mathematics Teacher |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=207–215 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on this turned his interests towards the biology of humanity's intellectual products.

==Public science education==
In 1967 Bronowski delivered the six [[Silliman Memorial Lectures]] at [[Yale University]] and chose as his subject the role of imagination and symbolic language in the progress of scientific knowledge. Transcripts of the lectures were published posthumously in 1978 as ''The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination'' and remain in print. He first became familiar to the British public through appearances on the [[BBC]] television version of ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' in the late 1950s. His ability to answer questions on many varied subjects led to an offhand reference in an episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' where one character states that "He knows everything."

Bronowski is best remembered for his thirteen part series ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' (1973), a BBC television documentary about the history of human life and  scientific endeavor. This project was intended to parallel art historian [[Kenneth Clark]]'s earlier "personal view" series ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' (1969) which had covered cultural history.

During the making of ''The Ascent of Man'', Bronowski was interviewed on the British chat show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]''. Host [[Michael Parkinson]] later recounted that Bronowski's description of a visit to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where he had lost many of his family during [[the Holocaust]], was one of Parkinson's most memorable interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Bronowski |first=Jacob |interviewer=Michael Parkinson |date=8 February 1974 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nyy41 |title=Dr. Jacob Bronowski |work=[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]] |publisher=BBC Television |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bronowski married Rita Coblentz in 1941.&lt;ref name="Jardine"&gt;Lisa Jardine [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/22/rita-bronowski-obituary Obituary: Rita Bronowski [Coblentz&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,] ''The Guardian'', 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children, all daughters, the eldest being the British academic [[Lisa Jardine]] and another being the filmmaker Judith Bronowski. He died in 1974 of a heart attack in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943740,00.html "Milestones, Sep. 2, 1974",] ''Time'' website (n.d., reprint of contemporary item)&lt;/ref&gt; a year after ''The Ascent of Man'' was completed, and was buried in the western side of London's [[Highgate Cemetery]], near the entrance. Rita Bronowski died in California in September 2010, aged 92.&lt;ref name="Jardine"/&gt;

'''Jacob Gottwals Francis''', also known as '''J.G.''' or '''Jay G.''' (January 13, 1870 in [[Oaks, Pennsylvania]] – August 27, 1958) was an American author, a historian, a photographer, and a [[Church of the Brethren]] minister.

Francis was born in [[Oaks, Pennsylvania]] to John Umstead and Mary Jane (Gottwals) Francis [http://www.etown.edu/library/files/francis-article.pdf].  In 1891, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Ursinus College]][http://www.libraries.psu.edu/do/digitalbookshelf/26832966/26832966_part_1025.pdf].  He is credited with helping to found [[Elizabethtown College]] in 1899 located in [[Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania|Elizabethtown]], Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Francis, however, preferred other sites to Elizabethtown, and thus saw himself as the "instigator" of the college, rather than its founder, believing that the location of the college in Elizabethtown was in "violation of Brethren principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francis|first1=J. G.|title=The Church of the Brethren (Dunkers) in Lebanon County|date=1916|publisher=Lebanon County Historical Society|page=117|url=https://archive.org/details/churchofbrethren00fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895, he was named minister of the Green Tree Church of the Brethren in [[Oaks, Pennsylvania|Oaks]], Pennsylvania.[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/do/digitalbookshelf/30954824/30954824_part_064.pdf].  He was known for travelling throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey on a bicycle.

Francis is joint author of a work of more than six hundred pages on the "History of the Brethren Church in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania" &lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/historyofchurcho00east/historyofchurcho00east_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and author of the "History of the Brethren in Lebanon County."

On January 11, 1900, Francis married Mary Frantz Zug.  They had six children: Mary Irene, Willard Zug, Monica, Michael Ulrich, Susanna Royer, and Anna Marthella [http://www.libraries.psu.edu/do/digitalbookshelf/30954824/30954824_part_064.pdf]

He died in Lebanon, [[Pennsylvania]].  He is buried in Midway Cemetery in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania]].

The '''''Journal of World History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that presents historical analysis from a global point of view, focusing especially on forces that cross the boundaries of [[culture]]s and [[civilization]]s, including large-scale population movements, economic fluctuations, transfers of [[technology]], the spread of [[infectious disease]]s, long-distance trade, and the spread of [[religious faith]]s, ideas, and values.

The journal was established in 1990 by [[Jerry H. Bentley]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]] to serve as the official journal of the [[World History Association]]. It is published by the [[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press]]. Initially produced twice a year, it became a quarterly in 2003.

In 2000, it was included in [[Project MUSE]], which now contains archives going back to vol. 7 (1996). In 2009, it was included in [[JSTOR]], with a [[moving wall]] of 3 years.

{{History of Colombia}}

'''''La Violencia''''' ({{IPA-es|la βjoˈlensja}}, '''The Violence''') was a ten-year [[civil war]] in [[Colombia]] from 1948 to 1958, between the [[Colombian Conservative Party]] and the [[Colombian Liberal Party]], fought mainly in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Stokes |year=2005 |title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia |publisher=Zed Books |page= |isbn=1-84277-547-2 |quote=Azcarate quotes a figure of 300,000 dead between 1948–1959...}}{{Page needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutierrez |first=Pedro Ruz |date=31 October 1999 |title=Bullets, Bloodshed And Ballots |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-10-31/news/9910290631_1_political-violence-carlos-galan-political-maneuvering |dead-url=no |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6iXVer9Sp?url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-10-31/news/9910290631_1_political-violence-carlos-galan-political-maneuvering |archive-date=2016-06-25 |access-date= |quote=Political violence is not new to that South American nation of 38 million people.

''La Violencia'' is considered{{by whom|date=October 2016}} to have begun with the 9 April 1948 [[assassination]] of the popular politician [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]], a Liberal Party presidential candidate for the [[Colombian presidential election, 1949|election in November 1949]]. His murder provoked the ''[[Bogotazo]]'' rioting that lasted for ten hours and killed some 5,000 people.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Livingstone |first=Grace |author2=foreword by Pearce, Jenny |year=2004 |title=Inside Colombia: Drugs, Democracy, and War |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0-8135-3443-7 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative historiography{{by whom|date=October 2016}} proposes as the start the Conservatives' return to power following the [[Colombian presidential election, 1946|election of 1946]].

''La Violencia'' took place between the [[paramilitary]] forces of the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] and the [[Colombian Conservative Party]], which organized as armed self-defense groups and as [[guerrilla]] military units. Both also fought against the paramilitary forces of the [[Colombian Communist Party]] (PCC).

The conflict caused millions of people to abandon their homes and property. Media and news services failed to cover events accurately for fear of revenge attacks. The lack of [[public order]] and [[civil authority]] prevented victims from laying charges against perpetrators. Documented evidence from these years is rare and fragmented.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The majority of the population at the time was [[Catholic]]. During the conflict there were press reports that [[Catholic Church]] authorities supported the Conservative Party. [[La Violencia#Anticlerical conspiracy theory|Several priests were accused]] of openly encouraging the murder of the political opposition during [[Mass (liturgy)|Catholic mass]], including the [[Santa Rosa de Osos]] Bishop [[Miguel Ángel Builes]], although this is unproven. No formal charges were ever presented and no official statements were made by the [[Holy See]] or the Board of Bishops. These events were recounted in the 1950 book ''Lo que el cielo no perdona'' ("What heaven doesn't forgive"), written by the secretary to Builes, Father Fidel Blandon Berrio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berrio |first1=Fidel Blandon |title=Lo que el cielo no perdona. |date=1996 |publisher=Planeta |isbn=9789586145169 |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/lo-que-el-cielo-no-perdona/oclc/777958769/editions?referer=di&amp;sd=desc&amp;start_edition=1&amp;se=yr&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq= |accessdate=7 August 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gil Jaramillo |first1=Rosa Carolina |title= Interpretación del sacerdote, la guerrilla liberal y la policía en ''Lo que el cielo no perdona'' |journal=Historia y sociedad |page= 103|date=June 2018 |issue=34 |doi=10.15446/hys.n34.66232 |url=http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/hiso/n34/0121-8417-hiso-34-00103.pdf |accessdate=7 August 2018}} Article at URL contains a short English-language abstract.

After releasing his book, Blandon resigned from his position and assumed a false identity as Antonio Gutiérrez. However, he was eventually identified and legally charged and prosecuted.{{Why?|date=February 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

As a result of ''La Violencia'' there were no liberal candidates for the presidency, congress, or any public corporations in the [[Colombian presidential election, 1950|1950 elections]]. The press accused the government of [[pogroms]] against the opposition. [[Censorship]] and reprisals were common against journalists, writers, and directors of news services. In consequence many media figures left the country. Jorge Zalamea, director of ''Critica'' magazine, fled to [[Buenos Aires]]; Luis Vidales to [[Chile]]; Antonio Garcia to [[La Paz]], and Gerardo Molina to [[Paris]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Conclusion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

Most of the armed groups (called guerrillas liberales, a pejorative term) were demobilized during the amnesty declared by General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] after he took power on 13 June 1953. The most prominent Guerrilla leaders, Guadalupe Salcedo and Juan de la Cruz Varela, signed the 1953 agreement.

Some of the guerrileros did not surrender to the government and organized into criminal bands or bandoleros, which caused intense military operations against them in 1954. One of them, the guerrillero leader [[Tirofijo]], had changed his political and ideological inclinations from being a Liberal to supporting the Communists during this period, and eventually he became the founder of the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or [[FARC]].

Rojas was removed from power on 10 May 1957. Civilian rule was restored after moderate Conservatives and Liberals, with the support of dissident sectors of the military, agreed to unite under a bipartisan coalition known as the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]] and the government of [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]] and which included a system of alternating the president and power-sharing both in cabinets and public offices.

In 1958, Lleras Camargo ordered the creation of the Commission for the Investigation of the Causes of "La Violencia". The commission was headed by the Bishop [[Germán Guzmán Campos]].

The last bandolero leaders were killed in combat against the army. Jacinto Cruz Usma, alias ''Sangrenegra'' (Blackblood), died in April 1964 and Efraín Gonzáles in June 1965.

==Humanitarian consequences==
Due to incomplete or non-existent statistical records, exact measurement of ''La Violencia'''s humanitarian consequences is impossible. Scholars, however, estimate that between 200,000 and 300,000 lives were lost; 600,000 to 800,000 were injured; and almost one million people were displaced. ''La Violencia'' directly or indirectly affected 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Bailey, 1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Norman A. |author-link=Norman Bailey (government official) |year=1967 |title=La Violencia in Colombia |jstor=164860 |journal=Journal of Inter-American Studies |publisher=Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Miami |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=561–75 |doi=10.2307/164860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Violencia'' did not acquire its name simply because of the number of people it affected; it was the manner in which most of the killings, maimings, and dismemberings were done. Certain death and torture techniques became so commonplace that they were given names—for example, ''picar para tamal'', which involved slowly cutting up a living person's body; or ''bocachiquiar'', where hundreds of small punctures were made until the victim slowly bled to death. Former Senior Director of International Economic Affairs for the [[United States National Security Council]] and current President of the [[Institute for Global Economic Growth]], [[Norman Bailey (government official)|Norman A. Bailey]] describes the atrocities succinctly: "Ingenious forms of quartering and beheading were invented and given such names as the 'corte de mica', 'corte de corbata' (aka [[Colombian necktie]]), and so on. Crucifixions and hangings were commonplace, political 'prisoners' were thrown from airplanes in flight, infants were bayoneted, schoolgirls, some as young as eight years old, were raped ''en masse'', unborn infants were removed by crude Caesarian section and replaced by roosters, ears were cut off, scalps removed, and so on."&lt;ref name="Bailey, 1967"/&gt; While scholars, historians, and analysts have all debated the source of this era of unrest, they have yet to formulate a widely accepted explanation for why it escalated to the notable level it did.

==Historical interpretations==
The death of the bandoleros and the end of the mobs was not the end of all the violence in Colombia. One [[communist]] guerrilla movement, the [[Peasant Student Workers Movement]], started its operations in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moir.org.co/mosquera/Tres_vias_a_la_revolucion.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626143728/http://www.moir.org.co/mosquera/Tres_vias_a_la_revolucion.htm |date=June 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, other organizations such as the FARC and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] emerged, marking the beginning of a guerrilla insurgency.

From the point of view of members of the FARC and the PCC, the Liberal and Conservative elites, though they had instigated the original violence, soon grew to fear the consequences of it and thus formed a loose alliance to preserve their shared desire for political hegemony from possible revolutionary challenges.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Credence in conspiracy theories as causes of violence===
As was common of 20th-century eliminationist political violence, the rationales for action immediately before ''La Violencia'' were founded on conspiracy theories, each of which blamed the other side as traitors beholden to international [[cabal]]s. The left were painted as participants in a global [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]] against Christianity, and the right were painted as agents of a [[Nazi]]-[[Falangist]] plot against democracy and progress.

====Anticlerical conspiracy theory====
After the death of Gaitán, a conspiracy theory circulating among the left, that leading conservatives and militant priests were involved in a plot with Nazis and Falangists to take control of the country and undo the country's moves toward progress, spurred the violence.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=218}} This conspiracy theory supplied the rationale for Liberal Party radicals to engage in violence, notably the [[anti-clerical]] attacks and killings, particularly in the early years of ''La Violencia''. Some propaganda leaflets circulating in Medellín blamed a favorite of [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] conspiracy theorists, the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), for the murder of Gaitán.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=277}}

Across the country, militants attacked churches, convents, and monasteries, killing priests and looking for arms, since the conspiracy theory maintained that the religious had guns, and this despite the fact that not a single serviceable weapon was located in the raids.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=218}} One priest, [[Pedro María Ramírez Ramos]], was slaughtered with machetes and hauled through the street behind a truck, despite the fact that the militants had previously searched the church grounds and found no weapons.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=277}}

Despite the conspiracy theories and propaganda after Gaitán's killing, most on the left learned from their errors in the rioting on 9 April, and stopped believing that priests had harbored weapons.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=278}}

The claims by both camps of the existence of some sort of conspiracy made the political environment toxic, increasing the animosity and suspicion of both parties.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=185}}

====Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory====
{{See also|Opposition to Freemasonry within Christianity#Catholic Church|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory}}

Conservatives likewise had been motivated to fight against a supposed international Judeo-Masonic conspiracy by eliminating the Liberals in their midst.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=217}} In the two decades prior to ''La Violencia'', Conservative politicians and churchmen adopted from Europe the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory to portray the Liberal Party as involved in an international anti-Christian plot, with many prominent Liberal politicians actually being [[Freemasons]].{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=142}}

Although the rhetoric of conspiracy was in large part introduced and circulated by some of the clergy, as well as by Conservative politicians, by 1942 many clerics were critical of the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory. Jesuits outside of Colombia had already questioned and published disputes of the authenticity of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', pushing the concept of a global Judeo-Masonic conspiracy. Colombian clergy were also increasingly influenced in this matter by U.S. clergy; and [[Pius XI]] had asked U.S. Jesuit [[John LaFarge, Jr.]] to draft an encyclical against [[anti-Semitism]] and racism.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=197}} Allegations of a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy played most prominently in the politics of [[Laureano Gómez]], who directed the Colombian Conservative Party from 1932 to 1953.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=178}}  More provincial politicians followed suit, and the fact that prominent national and local politicians were voicing this conspiracy theory, rather than just a portion of the clergy, gave the idea greater credibility while it gathered momentum among the party members.

The atrocities that had happened at the outset of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 were seen by both sides as a possible precedent for Colombia, causing both sides to fear it could happen in their country; this also spurred the credibility of the conspiracies and the rationale for violence.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=185}} Catholics everywhere were shocked by the wave of [[Red Terror (Spain)|anticlerical violence in the Republican zones in Spain]] in the first months of that war where [[anarchism|anarchists]], socialists and communists burned churches and murdered nearly 7,000 priests, monks, and nuns.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=185}}

'''Lisa Anne Jardine''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRS|FRHistS}} (née '''Bronowski'''; 12 April 1944 – 25 October 2015) was a British [[historian]] of the [[early modern period]].

From 1990 to 2011, she was Centenary Professor of [[Renaissance]] Studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/professors-and-speakers/lisa-jardine www.gresham.ac.uk  "Lisa Jardine"], Gresham College.&lt;/ref&gt; and Director of the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters at [[Queen Mary University of London]].

Jardine was a Member of Council of the [[Royal Institution]], until 2009. On 1 September 2012, she relocated with her research centre and staff to [[University College London]] (UCL) to become founding director of its Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in the Humanities.&lt;ref name=natureobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=rsbm/&gt;

==Education and personal life==
Jardine was born on 12 April 1944 in Oxford,&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{Who's Who|surname=JARDINE|othernames=Prof. Lisa Anne|id=U21837|volume=2015|edition=online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GRILisaBron&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=pxptHIFOZ17IS1pZtypODQ&amp;scan=1|title=Births index entry|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest of four daughters of mathematician and polymath, [[Jacob Bronowski]], and the sculptor, Rita Coblentz.&lt;ref name="Jardine"&gt;Lisa Jardine [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/22/rita-bronowski-obituary Obituary: Rita Bronowski [Coblentz&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronowski, who died in 1974 and was known for his 13-part television series, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' (1973), was the subject of Jardine's [[Conway Memorial Lecture]], "Things I Never Knew About My Father", delivered at the [[Conway Hall Ethical Society]] on 26 June 2014.

An avid reader with an interest in history from a very young age, Jardine won a mathematics scholarship to [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] and later attended [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], and the [[University of Essex]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; For two years she took the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] before, in her final year and under the influence of [[Raymond Williams]], she read English. Fluent in eight languages (including Greek and Latin), she studied for an MA in the Literary Theory of Translation with Professor [[Donald Davie]] at the [[University of Essex]]. She was awarded a PhD from the University of Cambridge with a dissertation on ''Francis Bacon: Discovery and the Art of Discourse'' (subsequently published by [[Cambridge University Press]]).&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lisa Jardine, April 12, 1944–October 25, 2015|url=http://www.rsa.org/blogpost/856879/230887/Lisa-Jardine-April-12-1944-October-25-2015|website=Renaissance Society of America|publisher=Graduate Center, CUNY|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In striking out on her own career path Jardine recalled that she initially found her father's celebrity something of a burden, noting that she was "very, very conscious" of being his daughter. When in 1969 she married Cambridge historian and philosopher of science, Nicholas Jardine,&lt;ref&gt;Marriage registration Cambridgeshire 4a 992, Jul–Sep 1969&lt;/ref&gt; she was relieved to assume her husband's surname, which she continued to use after the couple's divorce in 1979.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/26/bookerprize2001.thebookerprize|title=Prize fighter|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a son and a daughter. "Until 1999, the name Bronowski never occurred in cuttings about me, and it was broadly unknown that I was his daughter", she later stated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11955153/Lisa-Jardine-historian-obituary.html "Lisa Jardine, historian - obituary"], telegraph.co.uk, 26 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, she married architect John Hare,&lt;ref&gt;Marriage registration Westminster 15 1624, Jul–Sep 1982&lt;/ref&gt; with whom she had one son.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She was reported to have said that her greatest achievement was her three "well-balanced children".&lt;ref&gt;''Telegraph'' UK, Obituary (26 Oct 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jardine had been raised in a secular Jewish household, but when appointed new chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Britain’s fertility regulator, she expressed her loyalty to her observant grandparents' Orthodox faith, which she described as going back "all the way back to whenever – Abraham", and her reluctance to clash with the Catholic Church on embryology.&lt;ref&gt;Sholto Byrnes, [http://www.newstatesman.com/life-and-society/2008/05/jardine-science-human "Lisa Jardine On Life and Death"], ''New Statesman'', 22 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, she was awarded the [[President's Medal (British Academy)|President's Medal]] by the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Academy President's Medal|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/british-academy-presidents-medal|website=British Academy|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific and distinguished historian, with a special interest in the history of science, she impacted public life through her broadcasts and general writings, and her service on many public bodies. Among her 20 books, several of which have won major awards, are works on Bacon, Erasmus, Wren and Hooke. She has advised the Society on its archives, and, during a period of formal secondment to the Society, she edited the on-line 'Hooke Folio', published in 2007; she gave the Wilkins Lecture in 2003. She is in great demand as a lecturer, and has given [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values|Tanner Lectures]] in both Cambridge and Yale. She has received numerous honorary doctorates and fellowships; in 2012 she received the [[British Academy]] President's Medal.

She has served on the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and as Trustee of the V and A Museum.

She is the 2012/13 President of the [[British Science Association]] – a signal honour for a historian – and continues as a frequent broadcaster, noted for her 'Points of View' on Radio 4 and most recently for her 'Seven ages of science' series.

For nearly four decades, Lisa Jardine has combined high-level scholarship with extensive outreach, and has been extraordinarily energetic and effective in spanning the 'two cultures'. She has, in particular, been an enthusiastic advocate of the Society; election as an Honorary Fellow is recognition that she richly deserves and would deeply appreciate.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F2015%2F58%27)|title=Certificate of election: EC/2015/58 Lisa Jardine|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|archivedate=25 October 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cYMbBDVw?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F2015%2F58%27%29|location=London, UK|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jardine held honorary doctorates of Letters from the [[University of St Andrews]], [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[Open University]], and an honorary doctorate of Science from the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref name=livesnletters/&gt;

In November 2011, she was made an Honorary Bencher of the [[Honourable Society of the Middle Temple]].

'''Mapuche silverwork''' is one of the best known aspects of [[Mapuche]] material culture.&lt;ref name=Painecura15&gt;Painecura 2011, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The adornments have been subject to changes in fashion but some designs have resisted change.

==History==
In the later half of the 18th century, Mapuche [[silversmith]]s began to produce large amounts of silver finery.&lt;ref name=Aldunate&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aldunate |first=Carlos |last2= |first2= |year=1984 |title=Reflexiones acerca de la platería mapuche |url=http://repositoriodigital.uct.cl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/329/CUHSO_0716-1557_03_1984_1_art1.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=Cultura-Hombre-Sociedad |publisher= |volume=1 |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203065926/http://repositoriodigital.uct.cl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/329/CUHSO_0716-1557_03_1984_1_art1.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surge of silversmithing activity may be related to the [[Parliament of Quillín (1641)|1641 parliament of Quillín]] and the [[1726 parliament of Negrete]] that decreased hostilities between Spaniards and Mapuches and allowed trade to increase between [[colonial Chile]] and the free Mapuches.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26/&gt; In this context of increasing trade, Mapuches began in the late 18th century to accept payments in [[silver coin]]s for their products; usually cattle or horses.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt; These coins and silver coins obtained in political negotiations served as raw material for Mapuche metalsmiths ([[Mapudungun]]: ''rüxafe'').&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kangiser/&gt; Old Mapuche silver [[pendant]]s often included unmelted silver coins, something that has helped modern researchers to date the objects.&lt;ref name=Kangiser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kangiser Gómez |first=María Fernanda |last2= |first2= |year=2002 |title=Conservación en platería mapuche: Museo Fonck, Viña del Mar |url=http://www.museodevalparaiso.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_27.pdf |journal=Conserva |publisher= |volume=6 |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234953/http://www.museodevalparaiso.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_27.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the Spanish silver coins originated from mining in [[Potosí]] in [[Upper Peru]].&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26&gt;Painecura 2011, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The great diversity in silver finery designs is indebted to the fact that designs were done to be identified with different ''reynma'' (families), ''lof mapu'' (lands) as well as specific [[lonko]]s and [[machi (shaman)|machi]]s.&lt;ref name=Painecura27-28&gt;Painecura 2011, pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Mapuche silver finery was also subject to changes in [[fashion]] albeit designs associated with philosophical and spiritual concepts have not undergone major changes.&lt;ref name=Painecura27-28/&gt;

In late 18th century and early 19th century, Mapuche silversmithing activity and artistic diversity reached it climax.&lt;ref name=Painecura30&gt;Painecura 2011, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All important Mapuche chiefs of the 19th century are supposed to have had at least one silversmith.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt; The [[Occupation of Araucanía|1869 war between Chile and independent Mapuches]] provoked a famine among Mapuches in the winter of 1869, with the situation being worsened by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=Bengoa224&gt;Bengoa 2000, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation led some Mapuches to sell their silver adornments in the towns of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]] to obtain food.&lt;ref name=Bengoa224/&gt;

As of 1984, Mapuche scholar Carlos Aldunate noted that there were no silversmiths alive among contemporary Mapuches.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;

==Appearance==
Although these adornments showed some variation in form, the principal one appears to be a set of three separate columns of flattened silver links joined to each other by square alternating links.  At the top of the set of columns, and holding them together, is a flat two-headed bird figure and at the base is a flat semicircle or trapezoid that usually has a series of small disks dangling from its base.  The wearer would place the object hanging from his/ her neck and down the chest.

'''Medieval archaeology''' is the study of humankind through its material culture, specialising in the period of the European [[Middle Ages]]. At its broadest, the period stretches from the 5th to the 16th century and refers to post-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] but pre-modern remains. The period covers the upheaval caused by the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] and cultures such as the [[Vikings]], [[Saxons]], and [[Franks]]. [[Archaeologists]] often specialise in studying either the [[Early Middle Ages]] ([[Migration Period]]) or the [[High Middle Ages]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], although many projects and professionals move across these chronological boundaries. The rich nature of the medieval written record has meant that archaeology has often been seen as the "handmaiden to history",&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, R. 1994. 'Chapter 1. The Handmaid's Tale'. In Gilchrist, R. ''Gender and Material Culture''. London: Routledge, pp. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the later medieval period. Analysis of material culture may enrich or call into question written evidence from the medieval period and the two sources of evidence need to be used together. Medieval archaeology has examined the development of medieval settlements, particularly the development of medieval towns and [[Medieval castle|castles]]. It has also contributed to understanding of the spread and development of [[Christian monasticism]] during the medieval period.

==History of the study of medieval archaeology==
The Society for Medieval Archaeology (United Kingdom) was founded in 1957. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, several publications examined the history of the society and the sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, R. and Reynolds, A., eds. (2009) ''Reflections: 50 Years of Medieval Archaeology, 1957-2007''. Society for Medieval Archaeology Monographs, 30. Maney, Leeds&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerrard, C. (2007). "Retrospect and Prospect: 50 years of Medieval Archaeology", webpage: [http://www.medievalarchaeology.co.uk/index.php/the-sma/sma-retrospect-and-prospect/ MA-uk].&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Gerrard's 2003 book ''Medieval Archaeology'' also charts the move in the United Kingdom from antiquarianism, through Victorian medievalism, on to the emergence of medieval archaeology as a sub-discipline in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrard, C.M. (2003). Medieval Archaeology. ''Understanding traditions and contemporary approaches''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of expertise==
The study of medieval archaeology often focuses on specific kinds of settlement pattern.

===Rural settlements and landscapes===
Pattern of medieval rural settlements are often quite different from modern time villages. This is true in terms of architecture, outline of the settlements and social structure.

===Medieval towns===
There is a broad spectrum of pre-urban and urban settlements in the Middle Ages (e.g. early medieval trading places at the Northern Sea and the Baltic Sea, former Roman cities and town foundations of the late Middle Ages).  
An important field of research is urban archaeology in still existing towns, which is determeined by rescue archaeology.
(which medieval towns?)

===Medieval castles===
[[File:Castle holt 2.webm|thumb|thumbtime=9|350px|A reconstruction of Holt Castle in 1495]]

[[Castles]] are medieval fortified structures.

===Medieval monasteries===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] left many monastic sites abandoned. Where monasteries have survived or been converted for other uses, "[[buildings archaeology]]" has also been applied to study their history. Medieval monasteries often held large estates and the study of monastic landscapes is an area of specialised research.&lt;ref&gt;Aston, M. (2000) ''Monasteries in the Landscape.'' Revised Edition. The History Press&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two main waves of research in medieval monastic and church archaeology: 1970-1995 and 1995-present. The first wave was influenced by landscape history and processual archaeology; scholarship focused principally on historical, economic and technological questions and targeted individual sites and monuments for study. The second wave has been informed by post-processual approaches and considers change and complexity in religious landscapes and perspectives on religious space, embodiment and agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-025845|title=Monastic and Church Archaeology|last=Gilchrist|first=Roberta|date=2014-10-21|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-025845|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">The '''National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism''', {{lang-de|Nationalfonds der Republik Österreich für Opfer des Nationalsozialismus}}, is a fund created by the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]] to seek to apply restitution for property confiscated by the [[Nazi]]s during [[World War II]].  The fund was established in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.nationalfonds.org/cgi-bin/dynamic?id=20060412150504005&amp;temp= |title=National Fund -&gt; Acknowledgment of Victims -&gt; Background |publisher=National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism |accessdate=2009-01-15 |quote=The National Fund was set up in 1995 as a gesture of the moral co-responsibility for the consequences of the NS regime in Austria. The National Fund Law applies basically to all survivors of National Socialist violence, who are awarded a symbolic payment of EUR 5,087.10 (ATS 70,000). |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622142813/http://www.en.nationalfonds.org/cgi-bin/dynamic?id=20060412150504005&amp;temp= |archivedate=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Settlement Fund==

The General Settlement Fund is constituted to seek to compensate victims of Nazi persecution from all of the persecuted minorities, religious, cultural, ethnic, handicapped, and those who left Austria in order to escape persecution.  The claim for compensation passes to the [[beneficiary|heirs]] of the original victims on their death.&lt;ref name="eligibility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.nationalfonds.org/cgi-bin/dynamic?id=20060526141210005&amp;temp= |title=General Settlement Fund -&gt; Monetary Compensation -&gt; Eligibility |publisher=National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism |accessdate=2009-01-15 |quote=In addition, heirs of eligible claimants and the legal successor of an association that became defunct under the NS regime are also entitled to file an application. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821060345/http://www.en.nationalfonds.org/cgi-bin/dynamic?id=20060526141210005&amp;temp= |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications to the General Settlement Fund closed in May 2003.&lt;ref name="eligibility" /&gt; In May 2010 final payments are being received from this fund.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">'''Nicephorus Gregoras''' ({{IPAc-en|g|r|ɪ|ˈ|g|ɔr|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|grc|Νικηφόρος Γρηγορᾶς}}, ''Nikephoros Gregoras''; c. 1295 – 1360) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Byzantine astronomy|astronomer]], [[Byzantine history|historian]], and [[Byzantine theology|theologian]].

== Life ==
Gregoras was born at [[Heraclea Pontica]]. At an early age he settled at [[Constantinople]], where his reputation for learning brought him under the notice of [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]], by whom he was appointed ''[[chartophylax]]'' (keeper of the archives). In 1326 Gregoras proposed (in a treatise which remains in existence) certain reforms in the calendar, which the emperor refused to carry out for fear of disturbances; nearly two hundred years later they were introduced by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] on almost the same lines.

When Andronicus was dethroned (1328) by his grandson [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]], Gregoras shared his downfall and retired into private life. Attacked by [[Barlaam of Calabria]], he was with difficulty persuaded to come forward and meet him in a war of words, in which Barlaam was bested. This greatly enhanced his reputation and brought him a large number of pupils.

Gregoras remained loyal to the elder Andronicus to the last, but after his death he succeeded in gaining the favour of his grandson, by whom he was appointed to conduct the unsuccessful negotiations (for a union of the Greek and Latin churches) with the ambassadors of [[Pope John XXII]] (1333).

Beginning in 1346, Gregoras took an important part in the [[Hesychast controversy]] at the encouragement of the Empress [[Anna of Savoy|Anna]], by publishing a tract in which he staunchly opposed [[Gregorius Palamas]], the chief supporter of the doctrine. Although he persuaded some prominent churchmen, such as [[Joseph of Ganos]] and [[Arsenios of Tyre]], his opinion was opposed to those of Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzene]]. Although he presented his views at length at the synod of 1351, that synod declared his views heretical and the doctrines of Palamas orthodox. He and other dissidents were given the opportunity to recant, and he refused.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Nicol, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), pp. 232f&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the doctrine of Gregorius Palamas came to be accepted by the majority of the Orthodox Church, Gregoras persisted in campaigning against what he considered a heretical doctrine forced upon the Church by a robber council. He became a monk and devoted himself to campaigning against the Palamites, destroying his friendship with John Cantacuzene. He was first placed under house arrest, then confined to the [[Chora Monastery]]. When he was released from the monastery in 1354, Gregoras returned to his preaching and denunciations. Gregoras devotes two of the 37 books of his ''Roman History'' on his objections to the doctrine of Palamas; according to Donald Nicols, "It is disappointing that Gregoras the philosopher and historian should have degenerated into a ranting polemicist in his declining years."&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, ''Last Centuries'', p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
Gregoras' chief work is his Byzantine History'', in 37 books, covering the years 1204 to 1359. It partly supplements and partly continues the work of [[George Pachymeres]]. Gregoras shows considerable industry, but his style is pompous and affected. This work and that of [[John VI Cantacuzenus|John Cantacuzene]] supplement and correct each other, and should be read together.

The other writings of Gregoras, which (with a few exceptions) still remain unpublished, attest his great versatility. Amongst them may be mentioned a history of the dispute with Palamas; biographies of his uncle and early instructor John, metropolitan of Heraclea, and of the martyr [[Codratus of Antioch]]; funeral orations for [[Theodore Metochites]], and the two emperors Andronicus; commentaries on the wanderings of [[Odysseus]] and on [[Synesius]]'s treatise on dreams;&lt;ref&gt; Niceforo Gregora, Explicatio in librum Synesii de insomniis, a cura di P. Pietrosanti, Collana Pynakes, Levante, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; tracts on orthography and on words of doubtful meaning; a philosophical dialogue called ''Phlorentius'' or ''Concerning Wisdom''; astronomical treatises on the date of [[Easter]], on  the preparation of the [[astrolabe]] and on the predictive calculation of solar eclipses;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mogenet, A. Tihon, R. Royez, A. Berg, Nicéphore Grégoras - Calcul de l’éclipse de soleil du 16 Juillet 1330, ''Corpus des astronomes byzantins'', I, Gleben, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and an extensive correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;I. Sevcenko, Some autographs of Nicephore Gregoras in ''Recueil des travaux de l'Institut d'études byzantines'', VIII, pp. 435-450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Editions: in Bonn ''Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae'', by [[Ludwig Schopen|L. Schopen]] and [[August Immanuel Bekker|I. Bekker]], with life and list of works by [[Jean Boivin the Younger|J. Boivin]] (1829–1855); [[Jacques Paul Migne|J. P. Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', cxlviii., cxlix.; see also [[Karl Krumbacher]], ''Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur'' (1897).

'''''Odysseus Acanthoplex''''' ({{lang-grc|Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀκανθοπλήξ}}, ''Odysseus Akanthoplēx'', "Odysseus [[Stingray injury|wounded by]] a spine"; also known as ''Odysseus Wounded'', ''Odysseus Spine-struck'' and ''Odysseus Wounded by the Spine'') is a lost play by the [[Athens|Athenian]] dramatist [[Sophocles]].  Several fragments are extant.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  The plot told of [[Odysseus]]' death, accidentally killed by his son [[Telegonus]].&lt;ref name=plot&gt;{{cite book|title=Troy: from Homer's Iliad to Hollywood epic|editor=Winkler, M.M.|page=172|author=Ahl, F.|chapter=Troy and the Memorials of War|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe that another Sophocles' title, '''''Niptra''''' (Νιπτρα, "The Footwashing", "The Washing"), is the same play as ''Odysseus Acanthoplex''.&lt;ref name=fragments&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles Fragments|author=[[Sophocles]]|others=[[Hugh Lloyd-Jones|Lloyd-Jones, H.]], translator|pages=236–241, 377|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-99532-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=webster&gt;{{cite book|title=An introduction to Sophocles|author=[[Thomas B. L. Webster|Webster, T.B.L.]]|pages=175, 178|year=1969|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dana Sutton, however, disputes this, suggesting that ''Niptra'' was a separate play dealing with Odysseus' return to [[Ithaca]] but not with his death.&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

==Plot==
The plot of ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'' was based on ''[[Telegony]]'', which was part of the ''[[Epic Cycle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Literature and western civilization, Volume 1|author1=Daiches, D.  |author2=Thorlby, A. |lastauthoramp=yes |page=182|year=1972|publisher=Aldus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As background to the plot of the play, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' tells of Odysseus spending a year with the goddess [[Circe]].&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;  In the version of the myth that ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'' was based on, Odysseus and Circe had a son from this dalliance, [[Telegonus]].

From what we know of the plot of the play, Telegonus arrived at [[Ithaca]] to reveal himself to his father.  However, a fight ensued and Telegonus killed Odysseus without knowing who Odysseus was.&lt;ref name=plot/&gt;&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite book|title=Gods, goddesses, and mythology, Volume 11|editor=Littleton, C.S.|author=Claybourne, A.|pages=1032–1039|chapter=Odysseus|year=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7559-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the myth, Telegonus used a spear that had a [[venom]]ous [[stingray]] spine to kill Odysseus.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;  The plot also dealt with the subsequent marriages between Telegonus and Odysseus' wife [[Penelope]] and between Circe and Odysseus' son by Penelope, [[Telemachus]].&lt;ref name=plot/&gt;

Two of the extant fragments from the play refer to the oar Odysseus carried to appease the sea god  [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  Several extant fragments make reference to the [[oracle]] of [[Zeus]] at [[Dodona]].&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  Other than one reference in ''[[Trachiniae]]'', these are the only extant references to Dodona in Sophocles' works.&lt;ref name=hoey&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Date of the ''Trachiniae''|author=Hoey, T.F.|pages=220, 232|journal=Phoenix|volume=33|issue=3|year=1979|jstor= 1087433|doi=10.2307/1087433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classicist T.F. Hoey believes that the thematic development of ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'' was similar to that of ''Trachiniae''.&lt;ref name=hoey/&gt;  According to [[archaeologist]] [[Thomas B. L. Webster]], the plot of ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'' had a [[diptych]] form, i.e., in two parts, analogous to Sophocles' extant ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', ''[[Trachiniae]]'' and ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles the Dramatist|author=Waldock, A.J.A|page=55|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutton speculated that the play partially unfolded as follows.  Early in the play, Odysseus related the directions from [[Teiresias]] described in ''The Odyssey'' in which he was supposed to carry an oar far inland as a sacrifice to Poseidon.  He also related an oracle he received at Dodona telling him that he would be killed by his son.  Believing that the oracle referred to Telemachus, he would have taken precautions against Telemachus killing him, but was unprepared when another son who he did not know of arrived and a fight ensued.  The wounded Odysseus was brought on stage lamenting his wounds and denouncing the oracle for failing to predict that he would die at the hands of this stranger.  Then Telegonus arrived on stage, and a recognition scene occurred in which Telegonus discovered that he killed his father and Odysseus realized that the oracle had come to pass.&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

Webster, who believes that ''Niptra'' and ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'' are the same play, believes that the play began with Odysseus' return home to Ithaca and his recognition by [[Eurycleia]], who in ''The Odyssey'' washed Odysseus' feet.&lt;ref name=webster2&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sophocles|author=[[Thomas B. L. Webster|Webster, T.B.L.]]|pages=7, 177–178|year=1936|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] used the plot of ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'', under the title ''Odysseus Wounded'', as one of three examples of an effective type of plot for tragedy in which a character performs a horrific deed to a relative in ignorance and only learns the truth after the fact.&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;&lt;ref name=hoey/&gt;&lt;ref name=poetics&gt;{{cite book|title=Claasical Literary Criticism|chapter=Poetics|author=[[Aristotle]]|pages=74–75, 175|year=1965|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044651-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shards&gt;{{cite book|title=Shards from Kolonos: studies in Sophoclean fragments|author=Sommerstein, A.H.|pages=266, 269|year=2003|publisher=Levante|isbn=978-88-7949-307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other examples Aristotle gave of this type of effective plot were Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' and a play about [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]] by 4th century BCE tragic playwright [[Astydamas]].&lt;ref name=hoey/&gt;&lt;ref name=poetics/&gt;&lt;ref name=shards/&gt;

Roman philosopher [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusculanae disputationes'' 2.21.49&lt;/ref&gt; praised [[Pacuvius]]' play ''Niptra'', which was an imitation of Sophocles' ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'', because in Pacuvius' play Odysseus does not lament his wounds excessively, as Cicero believed the character did in Sophocles' play.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;

==Date==
In ''The Lost Sophocles'', D. F. Sutton suggests that ''Odysseus Acanthoplex'' was possibly first produced by about 414 BCE, which Sutton suggests is the same timeframe as Sophocles' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]''.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Sophocles|author=Sutton, D.F.|pages=88–94, 182|year=1984|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-4030-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Webster believes it was produced at a date close to that of ''[[Women of Trachis]]'', which he dates to sometime before 431, due to perceived similarities with the structure of that play.&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18699">In [[English Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[London]], '''playing company''' was the usual term for a company of [[actor]]s. These companies were organized around a group of ten or so [[shareholder]]s (or "sharers"), who performed in the plays but were also responsible for management.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of the legal complications involved in the share structure, see: [[Susan Baskervile]]; [[Richard Baxter (actor)|Richard Baxter]]; [[Robert Dawes]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sharers employed "hired men"{{snd}} that is, the minor actors and the workers behind the scenes. The major companies were based at specific theatres in [[London]]; the most successful of them, [[William Shakespeare]]'s company the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], had the open-air [[Globe Theatre]] for summer seasons and the enclosed [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in the winters. The [[Admiral's Men]] occupied the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] in the 1590s, and the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]] in the early 17th century.

Less fortunate companies spent most of their existences touring the provinces; when [[Worcester's Men]] gained official permission to perform in London in [[1602 in literature|1602]], they were, in a manner of speaking, "coming in from the cold" of a life of constant touring.

==Origins==
The development of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries was not an isolated phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to greater or lesser degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate.&lt;ref&gt;English actors toured Denmark and Saxony in 1586&amp;ndash;87, and reached as far as Sweden in 1592. Connections between English and Scottish theatre developed strongly after the Scottish King James assumed the English throne in 1603.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the following discussion applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.

In the later [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods, wealthy and powerful English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe of half a dozen "players", just as noblemen kept [[jester]]s or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] kept a company of players called the "Lusores Regis", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Thomson, "England" in ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'', Martin Banham, ed.; Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period the difference between players, [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]s and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could defray expenses by touring to various cities and performing for profit{{snd}} a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of [[English Renaissance theatre]] in the early and middle 16th century derives.

One curious development of this era was the development of companies of pre-pubescent boy actors. The use of the [[boy player]] in companies of adult actors to play female parts can be traced far back in the history of [[medieval theatre]], in the famous [[mystery play]]s and [[morality play|moralities]]; the employment of casts of boys for entire dramatic productions began in the early 16th century, which utilized the boys' choirs connected with cathedrals, churches, and schools. In time the practice took on a professional aspect and companies of child actors would play an important role in the development of drama through the [[Elizabethan era]] and into the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and [[Caroline era|Caroline]] periods that followed. (See: [[Children of the Chapel]]; [[Children of Paul's]]; [[Beeston's Boys]]; [[King's Revels Children]].)

{{English Renaissance playing company timeline}}

==Costs==
The playing companies did not need to spend money on scenery, and their stage props were often basic (necessarily, since every company made a substantial portion of its income by touring, and some companies toured consistently with no home theatre).&lt;ref&gt;A partial exception to the rule of simplicity in stage props: companies that maintained stable long-term residences in London theatres, like the Admiral's Men and the King's Men, accumulated stores of props. Henslowe's catalogue of the Admiral's props is quoted more than once in the scholarly literature; see Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 187-8. Still, most plays were performed with a minimum of the simplest properties.&lt;/ref&gt; Their costs in costumes, however, were high: actors playing kings, cardinals, princes, and noblemen had to look the part. Companies had hundreds of pounds of value invested in their costumes, in "glaring satin suits" and "sumptuous dresses"&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} "cloaks in scarlet with gold laces and buttons, and in purple satin adorned with silver;" doublets of "carnation velvet, flame, ginger, red and green; and women's gowns in white satin and cloth of gold."&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1605, Edward Alleyn estimated that his share in the "apparell" of the [[Admiral's Men]] was worth £100{{snd}} and Alleyn was one of nine sharers in the company at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 2, pp. 186–7; see also pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt; When a company got itself into financial difficulties, the members sometimes had to pawn their costumes, as [[Pembroke's Men]] did in the plague year of 1593.

In 1605 the actor [[Augustine Phillips]] left specific pieces of his wardrobe to an apprentice in his last will and testament{{snd}} including his "mouse-colored" velvet hose, purple cloak, white taffeta doublet, and black taffeta suit. To a modern sensibility, this may sound quaint and odd; but when "a doublet and hose of seawater green satin cost £3",&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; the monetary value of Phillips' items was not negligible. Actors could face serious penalties for appropriating the costumes of their companies. [See [[Robert Dawes]] for an example.] (The players could defray some of their costs in the used clothing market. As an example, the King's Men bought discarded items of Gondomar's wardrobe for the actor playing the Black Knight in ''[[A Game at Chess]]''. &lt;ref&gt;Melissa D. Aaron, ''Global Economics: A History of the Theatre Business, the Chamberlain's/King's Men, and Their Plays, 1599–1642,'' Newark, DE, University of Delaware Press, 2003; p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, "eminent lords and knights at their decease" would leave articles of their finery to their servants{{snd}} much of it "unseemly" for servingmen and women to wear. Such garments would end up the property of the actors.)&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage,'' pp. 194, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid as little as £6 to £7 per play (or about the price of two suits).&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet since the companies acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. [[Philip Henslowe]]'s Diary records dozens of titles for the 1597&amp;ndash;1603 period; when [[Worcester's Men]] were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.

The sharers in the company also paid wages to their hired men and boys. Wages differed somewhat over time and from company to company and case to case; but the general average minimum was 1 [[shilling]] per man per day, the same wage as that of an artisan worker. Boys cost perhaps half as much, though they were often maintained under some version of an apprenticeship arrangement, which could vary widely in details.

==Scheduling==
Performances at the public theatres were generally allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays like [[Good Friday]]. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they could. They were supposed to cease playing entirely during [[Lent]]{{snd}} but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the [[Lord Strange's Men]] played daily at the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]].

One restriction that the players observed, one that was too serious to violate, was the prohibition enforced whenever [[bubonic plague]] rose from endemic to epidemic levels. Through much of the English Renaissance period, the theatres were shut down when the death figures in the plague bill (the weekly mortality report for London and some suburban parishes) rose above a certain level. In 1604 that cut-off number was set at 30 per week; in 1607 it was raised to 40. A serious epidemic closed the theatres almost entirely from June 1592 through April 1594; 11,000 Londoners died of plague in 1593. (The plague tended to abate in the colder weather of winter; the theatres opened for short seasons during the winter months of those years.) 1603 was another bad plague year, with 30,000 deaths in London; the theatres were closed from March 1603 to perhaps April 1604.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 371–2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other serious epidemics caused theatre closures in 1625 (for eight months, to October) and from May 1636 to October 1637. These periods of closure were always traumatically difficult for the acting troupes; some survived by touring cities and towns outside London...and some didn't survive at all.

==The Elizabethan Age==
The explosion of popular drama that began when [[James Burbage]] built the first fixed and permanent venue for drama, [[The Theatre]], in [[1576 in literature|1576]] was the one great step away from the medieval organizational model and toward the commercial theatre; but that evolution was, at best, a "work in progress" throughout the English Renaissance. Throughout this period, troupes of actors needed to maintain the patronage of a noble household. The prevailing legal system in England&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, a 1572 Act amending the Tudor Poor Law, which criminalized minstrels, bearwards, fencers and "Comon Players in Enterludes" who did not enjoy noble patronage. Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; defined "masterless men" who traveled about the country as vagabonds, and subjected them to treatments of varying harshness. Local authorities tended to be more hostile than welcoming toward players; the Corporation of London, from the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] and aldermen down, was famously hostile to acting troupes, as were the [[Puritan]]s. Noble patronage was, at the very least, the legal fig leaf that allowed professional players to function in society.

In some cases, more so toward the end of the period, noble patronage was nothing more than that legal fig leaf; a company of actors was an independent entity, financially and otherwise. Conversely, some noblemen were beneficent patrons of their players. The Lords Hunsdon{{snd}} [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]] (c. 1524&amp;ndash;96), and his son [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon]] (1547&amp;ndash;1603){{snd}} were valuable protectors of their own company, and, when they served in the office of [[Lord Chamberlain]] (1585&amp;ndash;96 and 1597&amp;ndash;1603 respectively), of English drama as a whole.

That company of Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was organized somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept of which was just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in [[1594 in literature|1594]], after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: [[Philip Henslowe]] functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (The silver lining in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. ([[Francis Langley]], builder of the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]], operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.)     

Drama in the age of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] was at best an organized disorder; suppression of individual companies, and even the profession as a whole, for political reasons was not unknown. [See: ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]''.] Local residents sometimes opposed theatres in their neighborhoods. Individual companies of actors struggled and failed and recombined; tracking the changes has been the obsession of scholars and the bane of students. 

Yet the drama was also enormously popular, from the Queen and Court down to the commonest of the common people; indeed, the odd polarity of the theatre audience in this period, with the High and the Low favoring the drama, and the middle class generally more hostile with the growth of Puritan sentiments, is a surprising and intriguing phenomenon. Theatres proliferated, especially (though not exclusively) in neighborhoods outside the city's walls and the Corporation's control{{snd}} in [[Shoreditch]] to the north, or the [[Bankside]] and Paris Garden in [[Southwark]], on the southern bank of the [[River Thames]]: the [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]], the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose]], the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan]], the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune]], the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfrairs]]{{snd}} a famous roster.

==The Jacobean and Caroline Eras==
King [[James I of England|James]], "VI and I", was passionately fond of drama; and theatrical activity at Court accelerated from the start of his reign. Consider the following figures.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In roughly the last decade of Elizabeth's reign, 1594&amp;ndash;1603, there were 64 theatrical performances at Court, for an average of 6 or 7 a year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Chamberlain's Men
|32
|-
|Admiral's Men
|20
|-
|other adult companies
| 5
|-
|boys' companies
| 7
|-
|}

Compare a total of 299 for a somewhat longer period in the first portion of James' reign, 1603&amp;ndash;16, an average of more than 20 per year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|King's Men
|177
|-
|Prince Henry's Men
| 47
|-
|other adult companies
| 57
|-
|boys' companies
| 18
|-
|}

The major companies acquired royal patronage: the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] became the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and the [[Admiral's Men]] became Prince Henry's Men, under the patronage of the King's eldest son. A company of [[Queen Anne's Men]] was built out of the pre-existent [[Oxford's Men|Oxford's ]] and [[Pembroke's Men]], companies that were largely devoted to touring the provinces in the previous reign. In 1608 a company was organized under the title of the King's second son, the eight-year-old Charles; this company, the Duke of York's Men, was called [[Prince Charles's Men]] after Prince Henry unexpectedly died in 1612.

Companies continued to form, evolve, and dissolve in the early Jacobean era{{snd}} the [[King's Revels Children]], the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]]; but by the midpoint of James' reign, around the time of Shakespeare's death in [[1616 in literature|1616]], the dramatic scene had generally stabilized into four important companies. These were: the King's Men, at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres; [[Admiral's Men|Palsgrave's Men]] (formerly the Admiral's and Prince Henry's Men), at the Fortune; [[Prince Charles's Men]], at the [[Hope Theatre|Hope]]; and [[Queen Anne's Men]], at the [[Red Bull Theatre]].

Theatrical evolution continued, sometimes tied to the lives and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded with the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of [[Queen Henrietta's Men]]. Occasionally there were other new companies like [[Beeston's Boys]], and new theatres like the [[Salisbury Court Theatre|Salisbury Court]]. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 1636&amp;ndash;37, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in a dizzying confusion. (Only the King's Men were exempt.) Political suppressions also came along in the Stuart era, though they affected only single offending companies{{snd}} until a general political suppression closed the theatres from [[1642 in literature|1642]] to [[1660 in literature|1660]], and brought the age of [[English Renaissance theatre]] to its end.

{{Politics of Iran}}
'''Khomeinism''' is the founding ideology of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. Impact of the religious and political ideas of that leader of the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]],  [[Grand Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] include replacing Iran's millennia-old monarchy with theocracy.  Khomeini declared Islamic jurists the true holders of not only religious authority but political authority, who must be obeyed as "an expression of obedience to God",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031206165617/http://www.wandea.org.pl/khomeini-pdf/hukumat-i-islami.pdf Islamic Government] ''Islam and Revolution I, Writings and declarations of Imam Khomeini'', 1981, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; and whose rule has "precedence over all secondary ordinances [in Islam] such as [[salat|prayer]], [[sawm|fasting]], and [[hajj|pilgrimage]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Hamid Algar, `Development of the Concept of velayat-i faqih since the Islamic Revolution in Iran,` paper presented at London Conference on wilayat al-faqih, in June, 1988] [p.135-8]. Also ''Ressalat'', Tehran, 7 January 1988, online http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Laws_in_Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his death, politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran have been "largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy", according to at least one scholar, and "staying faithful to his ideology has been the [[litmus test]] for all political activity" there.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Republic''
"Khamenei vs. Khomeini" by Ali Reza Eshraghi, August 20, 2009, tnr.com [http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=4e1625b7-77b2-4e48-b912-55838bd983d3 dead link] [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2009/08/24/khamenei-vs-khomeini/ quotation from article] accessed 9-June-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vali Nasr]], outside of Iran, Khomeini's influence has been felt among the large Shia populations of [[Iraq]] and [[Lebanon]].  In the non-Muslim world, Khomeini had a great impact on the West and even Western popular culture where it is said he became "the virtual face of Islam" who "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nasr, Vali ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|Shia Islam}}
Ayatollah Khomeini was a senior Islamic jurist cleric of Shia  ([[Twelvers]]) Islam. Shia theology holds that [[Wilayah]] or [[Islamic leadership]] belongs to divinely-appointed line of [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|Shia Imams]] descended from [[Muhammad|the Prophet Muhammad]], the last of which is the 12th Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]. The God-given ([[Infallibility#Additional Shi'a teachings|Infallible]]) knowledge and sense of justice of the Imams makes them the definitive reference for (Shia) Muslims in every aspect of life, religious or otherwise, including governance. However, the twelfth Imam disappeared into what Shia believe is "occultation" (''ghaybat'') in 939 AD and so has not been present to rule over the Muslim community for over thousand years.

In the absence of the Imam, Shia scholars/religious leaders accepted the idea of non-religious leaders (typically a sultan, king, or shah) managing political affairs, defending  Shia Muslims and their territory, but no consensus emerged among the scholars as to how Muslims should relate to those leaders. Shia jurists have tended to stick to one of three approaches to the state: cooperating with it, becoming active in politics to influence its policies, or most commonly, remaining aloof from it.&lt;ref&gt;Moojan Momen, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'' (1985), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some years, Khomeini opted for the second of these three,  believing Islam should encompass all aspects of life, especially the state, and disapproving of Iran's weak [[Qajar dynasty]], the western concepts and language borrowed in the [[Iranian Constitution of 1906|1906 constitution]], and especially the authoritarian secularism and modernization of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi Shahs]].  Precedents for this approach included the theory of "co-working with the just sultan" put forward by [[Sayyed Murtaza]] during the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid era]] in his work "Al-Resala Al-Amal Ma'a Sultan" about 1000 years ago, and his idea was developed further by [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]. Clerical political influence was institutionalized during the [[Safavid Empire]] about 500 years ago. In modern times the [[Grand Ayatollah]] [[Mirza Shirazi]] intervened against [[Nasir al-Din Shah]] when that Qajar Shah gave a 50-year monopoly over the distribution and exportation of tobacco to a foreign non-Muslim. Shirazi issued the famous [[fatwa]] against the usage of tobacco as part of the [[Tobacco Protest]].

In 1970 Khomeini broke from this tradition developing a fourth approach to the state, a revolutionary change in Shia Islam proclaiming that monarchy was inherently unjust, and religious legal scholars should not just become involved in politics but rule.

==Legacy==

At least one scholar has argued that Khomeini's "decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements" have outlasted his theological works because it is the former and not the latter that the Islamic Republic of Iran "constantly reprints." Without the decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements "there would have been no Khomeinism [ideology]. Without Khomeinism there would have been no revolution. And without the Islamic Revolution, Khomeini would have been no more than a footnote to Iranian history." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iQgS6ZRg9gQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=khomeinism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJ5c_1XBAp&amp;sig=KK439T-VPfFs8wc8cEZ-iL9Hgsg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0wvcTJj0AaOBnAeEy5AX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Abrahamian, Ervand. ''Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic''], Cambridge University Press, 2008, (p.12)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvisational ability===

Outside of his doctrinal beliefs, Khomeini has also been noted for being a "brilliant tactician,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNpWhrg09C0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=brilliant+tactician+khomeini&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qw246RqW6q&amp;sig=m5dLybsWL8gepBGkCTxNduLH5kk&amp;hl=en|title=The Rushdie Affair|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a great "ability to improvise."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Khomeini once protested the shah's enfranchisement of women, and then encouraged women to participate in his revolution and vote for his government when he needed their numbers. He once promised that clerics would hold only temporary positions in government and then allowed them to hold the most senior positions. He pledged to continue the war against Iraq until its defeat and then abruptly made peace. He once said that the fact that "''I have said something does not mean that I should be bound by my word.''" Indeed, it is that suppleness, that ability to improvise that has outlived Khomeini and that continues to pervade the Islamic Republic, keeping it going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D9153EF934A1575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The People's Shah|date=27 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least one scholar has argued that Khomeini's ability to swing from one "religiopolitical ... perspective to another" has been exploited by followers to advance their various and competing agendas. In particular reformists such as [[Muhammad Khatami]] in search of more democracy and less theocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001) p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;  Another argues that Khomeini's "ideological adaptability" belie the "label of fundamentalist" applied to him in both the West and in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeiniism'', p.3, 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===

====Rulers====
As to how jurists should influence governance, Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership changed direction over time as his views on governance evolved.  On who should rule and what should be the ultimate authority in governance: 
*Khomeini originally accepted traditional Shia political theory, writing in "Kashf-e Asrar" that, "We do not say that government must be in the hands of" an Islamic jurist, "rather we say that government must be run in accordance with God's law ... "&lt;ref&gt;1942 book/pamphlet ''Kashf al-Asrar'' quoted in ''Islam and Revolution'', p.170&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting a parliament of Shi'a jurists could choose a just king. ( امام خمينى، كشف الاسرار: ۱۸۷ - ص ۱۸۵)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharghnewspaper.com/840312/html/spc13.htm#s237666|title=sharghnewspaper.com|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Later he told his followers that "Islam proclaims monarchy and hereditary succession wrong and invalid." &lt;ref&gt;''Velayat-e Faqih, Hokumat-e-Eslami'' or Islamic Government,  quoted in ''Islam and Revolution'' p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Only rule by a leading Islamic jurist ([[Guardianship of the jurists (doctrine)|velayat-e faqih]]   &lt;ref&gt;1970 book ''Velayat-e Faqih, Hokumat-e-Eslami'' or Islamic Government,  quoted in ''Islam and Revolution''&lt;/ref&gt;) would prevent "innovation" in ''[[Sharia]]'' or Islamic law and insure it was properly followed. The need for this governance of the faqih was "necessary and self-evident" to good Muslims.
{{main article|Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)}}
*Once in power and recognizing the need for more flexibility, he finally insisted the ruling jurist need not be one of the most learned, that ''Sharia'' rule was subordinate to interests of Islam ([[Maslaha]] - `expedient interests` or `public welfare`&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''A History of Modern Iran'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.165&lt;/ref&gt;), and the "divine government" as interpreted by the ruling jurists, who could overrule Sharia if necessary to serve those interests.   The Islamic "government, which is a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God, is among the primary ordinances of [[Islam]], and has precedence over all secondary ordinances such as [[salat|prayer (salat)]], [[sawm|fasting (sawm)]], and [[hajj|pilgrimage (hajj)]]." &lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=roy-177&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Olivier |title=The Failure of Political Islam |others=translated by Carol Volk|publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1994 |page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjijSP5DeAoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=issued+a+public+letter+of+reply,+on+January+7,+1989&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VgvJputYR2&amp;sig=NKBSsoXjiov0gRpsop_fy2HqqIk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PxJNVeujL9jnoAToqoGYCg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=issued%20a%20public%20letter%20of%20reply%2C%20on%20January%207%2C%201989&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Machinery of government====
While Khomeini was keenly focused on the ulama's right to rule and the state's "moral and ideological foundation", he did not dwell on the state's actually functioning or the "particulars" of its management. According to some scholars (Gheissari and Nasr) Khomeini never "put forward a systematic definition of the Islamic state and Islamic economics; ... never described its machinery of government, instruments of control, social function, economic processes, or guiding values and principles." &lt;ref&gt;Gheissari, Ali ''Democracy in Iran: history and the quest for liberty'', Ali Gheissari, Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, Oxford University Press, 2006. p.86-7&lt;/ref&gt;  In his plan for Islamic Government by Islamic Jurists he wrote: "The entire system of government and administration, together with necessary laws, lies ready for you. If the administration of the country calls for taxes, Islam has made the necessary provision; and if laws are needed, Islam has established them all. ... Everything is ready and waiting. All that remains is to draw up ministerial programs ..." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031206165617/http://www.wandea.org.pl/khomeini-pdf/hukumat-i-islami.pdf Islamic Government] ''Islam and Revolution I, Writings and declarations of Imam Khomeini'', p.137-8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Danger of conspiracies====
Khomeini preached the danger of plots by foreigners and their Iranian agents throughout his political career.  His belief, common among all political persuasions in Iran, can be explained by the domination of Iran's politics for the past 200 years until the Islamic revolution, first by Russia and Britain, later the United States. Foreign agents were involved in all of Iran's three military coups: [[Attempts at Constitutionalization in Iran#1908 coup|1908]] [Russian], [[Rezā Shāh#1921 coup|1921]][British] and 1953 [UK and US].&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism'', p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

In his series of speeches in which he argued for rule of the Muslim (and non-Muslim) world by Islamic jurists, Khomeini saw the need for theocratic rule to overcome the conspiracies of colonialists who were responsible for

&lt;blockquote&gt;the decline of Muslim civilization, the conservative `distortions` of [[Islam]], and the divisions between nation-states, [[Shi'a–Sunni relations|between Sunnis and Shiis]], and between oppressors and oppressed. He argued that the colonial powers had for years sent [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] into the East to misinterpret Islam and the [[Qur'an|Koran]] and that the colonial powers had conspired to undermine Islam both with religious quietism and with secular ideologies, especially [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], monarchism, and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name=abrahamian-122/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He claimed that Britain had instigated the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|1905 Constitutional Revolution]] to subvert Islam: "The Iranians who drafted the constitutional laws were receiving instructions directly from their British masters.`"

Khomeini also held the West responsible for a host of contemporary problems. He charged that colonial conspiracies kept the country poor and backward, exploited its resources, inflamed class antagonism, divided the clergy and alienated them from the masses, caused mischief among the tribes, infiltrated the universities, cultivated consumer instincts, and encouraged moral corruption, especially gambling, prostitution, drug addiction, and [[Alcohol in Islam#Alcohol|alcohol consumption]].&lt;ref name=abrahamian-122&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism'', p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one scholar ([[Ervand Abrahamian]]) sees "far-reaching consequences" in legacy of belief in ever-present conspiracy.  If conspiracy dominates political action then 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"those with view different from one's own were members of this or that foreign conspiracy. Thus political activists tended to equate competition with treason, ... One does not compromise and negotiate with spies and traitors; one locks them up or else shoots them. ... The result was detrimental for the development of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]] in Iran. ... Differences of opinion within organizations could not be accommodated; it was all too easy for leaders to expel dissidents as `foreign agents.`&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iQgS6ZRg9gQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=khomeinism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJ5c_1XBAp&amp;sig=KK439T-VPfFs8wc8cEZ-iL9Hgsg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0wvcTJj0AaOBnAeEy5AX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic''], p.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abrahamian believes that what he calls this "paranoid style" paved the way for the [[Casualties of the Iranian Revolution#Casualties of the Islamic government|mass executions of 1981-82]], where "never before in Iran had firing squads executed so many in so short a time over so flimsy an accusation." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iQgS6ZRg9gQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=khomeinism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GJ5c_1XBAp&amp;sig=KK439T-VPfFs8wc8cEZ-iL9Hgsg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0wvcTJj0AaOBnAeEy5AX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic''], p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Populism====
One scholar argues that Khomeini, "his ideas, and his movement" (an ideology he dubs "Khomeinism") bears a striking resemblance to populist movements in other countries, particularly those of South America such as [[Juan Perón]] and [[Getúlio Vargas]]. Like them Khomeini led a "movement of the propertied middle class" that  mobilized "the lower classes, especially the urban poor" &lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.17"&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; in a "radical but pragmatic" protest movement "against the established order." It attacked "the upper class and foreign powers," but not property rights, preaching "a return to `native roots` and eradication of `cosmopolitan ideas.`&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.38"&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism'', p.38&lt;/ref&gt;  It claimed "a noncapitalist, noncommunist `third way` towards development," &lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.38"/&gt; but was intellectually "flexible",&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism'',  p.2&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing  "cultural, national, and political reconstruction," not economic and social revolution."&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.17"/&gt;

Like those movements it celebrated the oppressed poor which it designated with a label (''mostazafin'' by Khomeini, ''descamisados'' (coatless ones) by Peron,  ''trabalhadores'' by Vargas), while actual power flowed from its leader who was "elevated ... into a demigod towering above the people and embodying their historical roots, future destiny, and revolutionary martyrs." &lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.38"/&gt;

Others would say Islam is distinct from Roman Catholicism and that its Middle Eastern beginnings separate it from Fascism.

====Democracy====
{{See also|Islamic democracy}}
Whether Khomeini's ideas are compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be [[democracy|democratic]] is disputed. Notable Iranians who believe he did not include [[Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi]] (a senior cleric and main theorist of Iranian ultraconservatives who opposes democracy), [[Akbar Ganji]] (a pro-democracy activist and writer who is against Islamic government) and [[Abdolkarim Soroush]] (an Iranian philosopher in exile),  according to Reza Parsa writing in the state-run ''Aftab News''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcdzn0ytj05s.html Ganji, Sorush and Mesbah Yazdi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629045409/http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcdzn0ytj05s.html |date=2010-06-29 }}(Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; Other followers of Khomeini who believe he did support democracy and that the Islamic Republic is democratic include [[Ali Khamenei]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parstech.org/detail.php?id=1313 The principles of Islamic republic from viewpoint of Imam Khomeini in the speeches of the leader](Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammad Khatami]] and [[Morteza Motahhari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motahari.org/asaar/books/downlowd/32/book.zip About Islamic republic]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}(Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/14?ck=nck|title=Ayatollah Khomeini and the Contemporary Debate on Freedom|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini preached for theocratic rule by jurists, but did not completely disavow "[[democracy]]", making statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to it.&lt;ref&gt;"Democracy? I meant theocracy",  by Dr. Jalal Matini, Translation &amp; Introduction by Farhad Mafie, August 5, 2003, ''The Iranian'',  http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2003/August/Khomeini/&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, telling a huge crowd of Iranians a month after his return to Iran, "Do not use this term, `democratic.` That is the Western style,`" &lt;ref&gt;1979 March 1, quoted in  Bakhash, Shaul  ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs,'' p.72, 73)&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for this contradiction is what Khomeini meant by "democracy." According to scholar [[Shaul Bakhash]], it's highly unlikely Khomeini defined the term to mean "a Western [[parliamentary democracy]]" when he told others he wanted Iran to be democratic.&lt;ref&gt;He agreed during his meeting with Karin Samjabi in Paris in November 1978 that the future government of Iran would be `democratic and Islamic`. Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs,'' (1984), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; 
Khomeini believed that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution meant that Iranians had already voted in a `referendum` for an Islamic republic,&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1984), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and that in Muslim countries Islam and Islamic law,  
&lt;blockquote&gt;truly belong to the people. In contrast, in a republic or a constitutional monarchy, most of those claiming to be representatives of the majority of the people will approve anything they wish as law and then impose it on the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution,'' (1982), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In drawing up the constitution of his Islamic Republic, he and his supporters agreed to include Western-democratic elements, such as an elected parliament and president, but some argue he believed Islamic elements, not Western-style elected parliaments and presidents, should prevail in government.&lt;ref&gt;source: Yusef Sane'i, ''Velayat-e Faqih'', Tehran, 1364/1986, quoted in Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah'', Thomas Dunne Books, c2000, p.226&lt;/ref&gt;   After the ratifying of the Islamic constitution he told an interviewer that the constitution in no way contradicted democracy because the `people love the clergy, have faith in the clergy, and want to be guided by the clergy` and that it was right that [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] oversee the work of the non-clerical officials `to make sure they don't make mistakes or go against the law and the Quran.' &lt;ref&gt;Fallaci, Oriana. "Interview with Khomeini", ''New York Times'', 7 October 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the revolution was consolidated terms like "democracy" and "liberalism" - considered praiseworthy in the West - became words of criticism, while "revolution" and "revolutionary" were terms of praise.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.228&lt;/ref&gt;

Still another scholar, non-Iranian Daniel Brumberg, argues that Khomeini's statements on politics were simply not "straightforward, coherent, or consistent," and that in particular he contradicted his writings and statements on the primacy of the rule of the jurist with repeated statements on the importance of the leading role of the parliament, such as `the Majlis heads all affairs`,&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and `the majlis is higher than all the positions which exist in the country.`&lt;ref&gt;Address by Ayatollah Khomeini on the Occasion of the Iranian New Year,` broadcast 20 March 1979, FBIS-MEA-80-56, 21 March 1980 quoted in Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001) p.113&lt;/ref&gt;  This, according to Brumberg, has created a legacy where his followers "exploited these competing notions of authority" to advance "various agendas of their own." Reformist seizing on his statements about the importance majlis, and theocrats on those of rule by the clergy.

Over the decades since the revolution Iran has not evolved towards a more [[liberal democracy|liberal representative democratic system]] as some reformists and democrats had predicted, nor has [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|theocratic rule of Islamic jurists]] spread to other countries as its founder had hoped.

====Human rights====
Before taking power Khomeini expressed support for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]],  "We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence.",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahifeh Nour]]'' (Vol.2, Page 242)&lt;/ref&gt; However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: "I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth."&lt;ref&gt;in Qom, Iran, October 22, 1979, quoted in, ''The Shah and the Ayatollah : Iranian Mythology and Islamic Revolution'' by Fereydoun Hoveyda, Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2003, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini believed that since Islamic government was essential for Islam, what threatened the government threatened Islam.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Since God Almighty has commanded us to follow the Messenger and the holders of authority, our obeying them is actually an expression of obedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution'', (1981), p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Iran adopted an alternative human rights declaration, the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], in 1990 (one year after Khomeini's death), which differs from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, requiring law to be in accordance with [[Sharia]],&lt;ref name="Denny2004"&gt;Mathewson Denny, Frederick. "Muslim Ethical Trajectories in the Contemporary World" in ''Religious Ethics'', William Schweiker, ed. Blackwell Publishers, 2004. {{ISBN|0-631-21634-0}}, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; denying complete equality with men for women, and forbidding speech that violates the "dignity of Prophets", or "undermines moral and ethical values."

One observer, Iranian political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]], believes that some of the more well-known violations of international human rights initiated by Khomeini—the fatwa to kill British-citizen author [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Salman Rushdie]] and the [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|mass executions]] of leftist political prisoners in 1988—can be explained best as a legacy for his followers.  Abrahamian argues Khomeini wanted to "forge unity" among "his disparate followers", "raise formidable -- if not insurmountable -- obstacles in the way of any future leader hoping to initiate a detente with the West," and most importantly to "weed out the half-hearted from the true believers",&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'' by Ervand Abrahamian, University of California Press, 1999, p.218-9&lt;/ref&gt;  such as heir-designate Ayatollah [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]] who protested the killings and was dismissed from his position.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'' by Ervand Abrahamian, University of California Press, 1999, p.220-1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economics====
In the realm of economics, Khomeini was known both for his lack of interest and conflicting views on the subject.&lt;ref name="Moin, Khomeini 2001, p.258"&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2001), p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

He famously replied to a question before the revolution about how the Islamic Republic would manage Iran's economy by saying economics was "for donkeys"&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.134&lt;/ref&gt; (also translated as "for fools"&lt;ref&gt;`economics is for fools (eqtesad mal-e khar ast)` from Gheissari, Ali ''Democracy in Iran: history and the quest for liberty'', Ali Gheissari, Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, Oxford University Press, 2006, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;), and  expressed impatience with those who complained about the inflation and shortages following the revolution saying: `I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons,` &lt;ref&gt;(Khomeini July 1979) [quoted in The ''Government of God'' p.111. "see the FBIS for typical broadcasts, especially GBIS-MEA-79-L30, July 5, 1979 v.5 n.130, reporting broadcasts of the National Voice of Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; His lack of attention has been described as "possibly one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the 1979 revolution," (along with the mismanagement by clerics trained in Islamic law but not economic science).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zrpmm4120OUC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=%22economics+is+for+donkeys%22+khomeini&amp;source=web&amp;ots=b_7a0AQJiF&amp;sig=H1TReBjJt9K9LZjItsnjFCPBFQs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=%22economics%20is%20for%20donkeys%22%20khomeini&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to the Modern Middle East|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini has also been described as being "quite genuinely of two minds",&lt;ref name="Moin, Khomeini 2001, p.258"/&gt; and of having "ambiguous and contradictory attitudes" on the role of the state in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian,  ''Khomeinism", p.38&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with conservative clerics and the bazaar (traditional merchant class) on the importance of strict sharia law and respect for the sanctity of private property, but also made [[Populism|populist]] promises such as free water and electricity and government-provided homes for the poor, which could only be provided, if at all, by massive government intervention in the economy in violation of traditional Shariah law.&lt;ref name="Moin, Khomeini 2001, p.258"/&gt; While Khomeini was alive the conflict attitudes were represented in the clash between the populists of the Parliament and the conservatives of the [[Guardian Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Khomeinism'', (p.55)&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death until 1997, the "[[bazaari]] side" of the legacy predominated with the regime of president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]]. Rafsanjani and Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]], emphasized `reconstruction,` `realism,` `work discipline,` `managerial skills,` `modern technology,` `expertise and competence,` `individual self-reliance,` `entrepreneurship,` and `stability.`" &lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Khomeinism, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

The populist side of Khomeini's economic legacy is said to be found in Iran's last president, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], who allegedly "mirrored" Khomeini's disdain for the "donkey" science of economics, wearing "his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour", and overseeing sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment under his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2008/09/iran-economic-ahmadinejad|title="Economics is for donkeys"|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini strongly opposed Marxism.  `Atheistic Marxists` were the one group he excluded from the broad coalition of anti-Shah groups he worked to rally behind his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian ''Iran Between Revolutions'' (1982), p.479&lt;/ref&gt; In his last will and testament, he urged future generations to respect property on the grounds that free enterprise turns the `wheels of the economy` and prosperity would produce `social justice` for all, including the poor. &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam differs sharply from communism. Whereas we respect private property, communism advocates the sharing of all things - including wives and homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, 2008, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  What one scholar has called the populist thrust of Khomeini can be found in the fact that after the revolution, revolutionary tribunals expropriated  "agribusinesses, large factories, and luxury homes belonging to the former elite," but were careful to avoid "challenging the concept of private property." &lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian,  ''Khomeinism'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Khomeini's revolutionary movement was influenced by Islamic leftist and thinker Ali Shariati, and the leftist currents of the 1960s and 1970s.  Khomeini proclaimed Islam on the side of the ''mustazafin'' and against exploiters and imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian ''Iran Between Revolutions'' (1982), p.534&lt;/ref&gt; In part for this reason a large section of Iran's economy was nationalized during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Law for the Protection and Expansion of Iranian Industry"  July 5, 1979 nationalization measure reportedly nationalized most of the privately industry and many non-industrial businesses. Mackey, ''Iranians,'' (1986) p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Iran's public sector and government work force remains very large. Despite complaints by free marketers, "about 60% of the economy is directly controlled and centrally planned by the state, and another 10%-20% is in the hands of five semi-governmental foundations, who control much of the non-oil economy and are accountable to no one except the supreme leader." &lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', Jan 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women in politics====
Before the Revolution, Khomeini expressed the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In an Islamic order, women enjoy the same rights as men - rights to education, work, ownership, to vote in elections and to be voted in. Women are free, just like men to decide their own destinies and activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Pithy Aphorism: Wise Sayings and Counsels'' (by Khomeini), quoted in ''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c2000, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Revolution, Khomeini opposed allowing women to serve in parliament, likening it to prostitution. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are against this prostitution. We object to such wrongdoings ... Is progress achieved by sending women to the majlis? Sending women to these centers is nothing but corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Speech in Qom quoted in Esfandiari, ''Iran: Women and Parliaments Under the Monarch and Islamic Republic'' pp.1-24, quoted in ''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c2000, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious philosophy, fiqh, teachings===
Khomeini made a number of changes to Shia clerical system. Along with his January 1989 ruling that sharia was subordinate to the revolution, he affirmed against tradition that the fatwa pronounced by a grand ayatollah survived that ayatollah (such as the fatwa to kill Salman Rushdie), and defrocked Ayatollah [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]],&lt;ref name=roy-179&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Olivier |title=The Failure of Political Islam |others=translated by Carol Volk|publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1994 |page=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjijSP5DeAoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=issued+a+public+letter+of+reply,+on+January+7,+1989&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VgvJputYR2&amp;sig=NKBSsoXjiov0gRpsop_fy2HqqIk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PxJNVeujL9jnoAToqoGYCg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=issued%20a%20public%20letter%20of%20reply%2C%20on%20January%207%2C%201989&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a political opponent.

====Fiqh====
In ''[[Fiqh]]'', (Islamic jurisprudence) some scholars have argued Khomeini championed innovative reinterpretations of doctrine, prompted by the challenges of managing a country of 50 million plus.

*Use of ''[[Maslaha]],'' or ''maslahat'' (`expedient interests` or `public welfare`). This was a common concept among Sunni, but "before the 1979 revolution most" Shi'ite jurists had "rejected maslahat as a dangerous innovation ([[Bid‘ah]])." &lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), p.61&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wider use of "secondary ordinances". Clerics had traditionally argued that the government could issue these "when addressing a narrow range of contractual issues not directly addressed in the Qur'an." Khomeini called for their use to deal with the deadlock between the [[Majlis of Iran|Majles]] and the [[Council of Guardians]] &lt;ref&gt;`Khomeyni Addresses Majlis Deputies January 24` broadcast 24 January 1983, quoted in Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), p.129&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ijtihad]] {{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

====Esmat====
''[[Esmat]]'' is perfection through faith. Khomeini believed not only that truly just and divine Islamic government need not wait for the return of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|12th Imam/Mahdi]], but that "divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin" (''esmat'') was not the exclusive property of the prophets and imams. ''Esmat'' required "nothing other than perfect faith"&lt;ref&gt;Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'', p. 463, quoting Khomeini, ''Jehad-e Akbar'' (Greater Jihad), pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and could be achieved by a Muslim who reaches that state. [[Hamid Dabashi]] argues Khomeini's theory of Esmat from faith helped "to secure the all-important attribute of infallibility for himself as a member of the awlia' [friend of God] by eliminating the simultaneous theological and Imamological problems of violating the immanent expectation of the Mahdi." &lt;ref&gt;(Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'', p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by "securing" this "attribute of infallibility for himself", Khomeini reassured Shia Muslims who might otherwise be hesitant about granting him the same ruling authority due the 12 Imams.

====The Prophets====
Khomeini believed the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophets]] have not yet achieve their "purpose".   In November 1985 he told radio listeners, "I should say that so far the purpose of the Prophets has seldom been realized. Very little." Aware of the controversial nature of the statement he warned more conservative clerics that "tomorrow court mullahs . . . [should] not say that Khomeini said that the Prophet is incapable of achieving his aims." &lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' p.133&lt;/ref&gt; He also controversially stated that [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad, was superior in status to the prophets of God.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ofra Bengio|author2=Meir Litvak|title=The Sunna and Shi'a in History: Division and Ecumenism in the Muslim Middle East|date=8 Nov 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230370739|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini's authority and charismatic personality prevented less popular jurists from protesting these changes as un-Islamic [[Bid‘ah]].

====Istishhad====

=====Iran–Iraq War=====
Perhaps the most significant legacy of Khomeini internationally is a broader definition of [[martyr]]dom to include [[Istishhad]], or "self-martyrdom".&lt;ref&gt;Ruthven, Malise ''A Fury For God'', Granta, (2002), p.?&lt;/ref&gt;  Khomeini believed martyrdom could come not only from "inadvertent" death but "deliberate" as well. While martyrdom has always been celebrated in Islam and martyrs promised a place in heaven, (Q3:169-171) the idea that opportunities for martyrdom were important has not always been so common. Khomeini not only praised the large numbers of young Shia Iranians who became "shahids" during the Iran–Iraq War  but asserted the war was "God's hidden gift",&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (200)) p.249, 251&lt;/ref&gt; or as one scholar of Khomeini put it, "a vital outlet through which Iran's young martyrs experienced mystical transcendence."&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the great martyr (Imam [[Husayn ibn Ali]]) ... confined himself to praying ... the great tragedy of Kabala would not have come about ... Among the contemporary ulema, if the great Ayatollah ... Shirazi ... thought like these people [who do not fight for Islam], a war would not have taken place in Iraq ... all those Muslims would not have been martyred." &lt;ref&gt;`Ayatollah Khomeyni Message to Council of Experts,` broadcast 14 July 1983, FBIS-SAS-83-137, 15 July 1983; Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini''p.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Death might seem like a tragedy to some but in reality ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you have any tie or link binding you to this world in love, try to sever it. This world, despite all its apparent splendor and charm, is too worthless to be loved&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution'', p.357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Khomeini never wavered from his faith in the war as God's will, and observers have related a number of examples of his impatience with those who tried to convince him to stop it. When the war seemed to become a stalemate with hundreds of thousands killed and civilian areas being attacked by missiles, Khomeini was approached by Ayatollah [[Mehdi Haeri Yazdi]], a grand ayatollah and former student with family ties to Khomeini. He pleaded with Khomeini to find a way to stop the killing saying, "it is not right for Muslims to kill Muslims." Khomeini answered reproachfully, asking him, "Do you also criticize God when he sends an earthquake?"&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.120&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion a delegation of Muslim heads of state in Tehran to offer to mediate an end to the war were kept waiting for two hours and given no translator when Khomeini finally did talk to them.&lt;ref&gt;Niaz Naik, former Pakistan foreign secretary who accompanied General Zia on trip, in interview with Nasr in Lahore 1990. In Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq====
While suicide martyrdom did not win the [[Iran–Iraq War]] for Iran, it did spread to [[Lebanon]], where it won victories for the Iraqi Islamic Da'wa party, Shia 'allies' of the Islamic Revolution there.  The 1983 bombings against U.S. and French peacekeeping troops by Hizballah killed over 300 and drove the US and French from Lebanon. Another longer bombing campaign did likewise to the Israeli army.  Khomeini is credited by some with inspiring these "suicide bombers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-kramer091901.shtml Comment September 19, 2001 8:20]&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of shaheed operations as a military tactic has been described by Shia Lebanese as an equalizer where faith and piety are used to counter superior military power of the Western unbeliever:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You look at it with a Western mentality. You regard it as barbaric and unjustified. We, on the other hand, see it as another means of war, but one which is also harmonious with our religion and beliefs. Take for example, an Israeli warplane or, better still, the American and British air power in the Gulf War. .... The goal of their mission and the outcome of their deeds was to kill and damage enemy positions just like us ... The only difference is that they had at their disposal state-of-the-art and top-of-the-range means and weaponry to achieve their aims. We have the minimum basics ... We ... do not seek material rewards, but heavenly one in the hereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, a Hezbollah fighter quoted in ''Hezbollah : Born with a vengeance'' by Hala Jaberp,92-93&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The victory of Hezbollah is known to have inspired [[Hamas]] in Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;Hamas Statement, ''BBC Summary of World Broadcasts'' (July 23, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[al-Qaeda]] in its worldwide bombing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;`Bin Laden's Sermon for the Eid al-Adha`, Middle East Media Research Institute, Special Dispatch Series, n. 476 (March 5, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after Khomeini's death, "Martyrdom operations" or "suicide bombing" have spread beyond Shia Islam and beyond attacks on military and are now a major force in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;"Devotion, desire drive youths to 'martyrdom' : Palestinians in pursuit of paradise turn their own bodies into weapons", ''USA Today'', June 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/03/14/7682/ March 14, 2008 The Independent/UK "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber" by Robert Fisk ] "month-long investigation by The Independent, culling four Arabic-language newspapers, official Iraqi statistics, two Beirut news agencies and Western reports"&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically and tragically, in the last few years, thousands of Muslims, particularly Shia, have been victims, not just initiators, of martyrdom operations, with many civilians and even mosques and shrines being targeted, particularly in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;According to Scott Atran, in just one year in one Muslim country alone - 2004 in Iraq - there were 400 suicide attacks and 2000 casualties. [http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism] p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Wahhabi extremist [[Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi]] has quoted [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] urging his followers to kill Shi'a of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al Jazeera]] article: "Al-Zarqawi declares war on Iraqi Shia", Accessed Feb 7, 2007. [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/archive/archive?ArchiveId=14984 Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231193836/http://english.aljazeera.net/News/archive/archive?ArchiveId=14984 |date=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 some of the Shia [[ulema]] have responded by declaring suicide bombing [[haraam|haram]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"حتي كساني كه با انتحار مي‌آيند و مي‌زنند عده‌اي را مي‌كشند، آن هم به عنوان عمليات انتحاري، اينها در قعر جهنم هستند"&lt;br&gt;"Even those who kill people with suicide bombing, these shall meet the flames of hell."&lt;ref&gt;Feb 2007 interview with [[Christiane Amanpour]] of [[CNN]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.roozonline.com/archives/2007/02/002139.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208183310/http://www.roozonline.com/archives/2007/02/002139.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IIS&gt;{{cite web|title=Shia-Sunni Conflicts – What are the issues?|url=http://www.csss-isla.com/iis/iis-index.html|website=Institute of Islamic Studies|accessdate=30 October 2015|quote=Ayatollah Yousef Saanei.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Shia rituals===
Khomeini showed little interest in the rituals of Shia Islam such as the [[Day of Ashura]]. Unlike earlier Iranian [[shah]]s or the [[Nawab of Awadh|Awadh's nawabs]], he never presided over any Ashura observances, nor visited the enormously popular [[Imam Reza shrine|shrine of the eighth Imam]] in [[Mashad]]. This discouraging of popular Shia piety and Shia traditions by Khomeini and his core supporters has been explained by at least one observer as a product of their belief that Islam was first and foremost about [[sharia|Islamic law]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.135&lt;/ref&gt; and that the revolution itself was of "equal significance" to [[Battle of Karbala]] where the [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husayn]] was martyred.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

This legacy is reflected in the surprise sometimes shown by foreign Shia hosts in Pakistan and elsewhere when visiting Iranian officials, such as Fawzah Rafsanjani, show their disdain for Shia shrines.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; And perhaps also in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's May 2005 statement that "the Iranian revolution was of the same `essence` as Imam Husayn's movement."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===Sternness and austerity===
Companions and followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini have many stories of his disinterest in his personal wealth and comfort and concern for others.&lt;ref&gt;''Khomeini: life of the Ayatollah,''  By Baqer Moin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/completeman/ Rays of the Sun: 83 Stories from the Life of Imam Khomeini (ra)] "He would never pass on his work to anyone else":&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Imam was sometimes flexible over doctrine, changing positions on divorce, music, birth control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html|title=Khomeini's REVERSALS of Promises|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was much less accommodating with those he believed to be the enemies of Islam. Khomeini emphasized not only righteous militancy and rage but hatred,
&lt;blockquote&gt;And I am confident that the Iranian people, particularly our youth, will keep alive in their hearts anger and hatred for the criminal Soviet Union and the warmongering United States. This must be until the banner of Islam flies over every house in the world.
&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''In the Name of God'' 1989, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Satanic Verses controversy#Rushdie's apology|Salman Rushdie's apology]] for his book (following Khomeini's fatwa to kill the author) was rejected by Khomeini, who told Muslims: "Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and wealth, to send him to Hell." &lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini felt let down by advisers who he felt had persuaded him to make unwise decisions against his better judgment, appointing people to posts who he later denounced.  "I swear to God that I was against appointing Medi Bazargan as the first prime minister, too, but I considered him to be a decent person. I also swear to God that I did not vote for Bani Sadr to become president either. On all these occasions I submitted to the advice of my friends." &lt;ref&gt;letter to Montazeri March 1989. Moin ''Khomeini'', (2000), p.289, p.306-7
&lt;/ref&gt; Before being revised in April 1989,&lt;ref&gt;(Moin ''Khomeini'' (2000) p.293&lt;/ref&gt; the Iranian constitution called for the supreme leader to be a leading cleric ([[Marja'|Marja]]), something Khomeini says he opposed "since from the very beginning." &lt;ref&gt;A letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution (by Ayatollah Meshkini), setting out his instructions for the future of the leadership" source: Tehran Radio, 4 June 1989, SWB, 6 June 1989] quoted in Moin p.308&lt;/ref&gt;

He also preached of Islam's essentially serious nature
&lt;blockquote&gt;Allah did not create man so that he could have fun. The aim of creation was for mankind to be put to the test through hardship and prayer. An Islamic regime must be serious in every field. There are no jokes in Islam. There is no humor in Islam. There is no fun in Islam. There can be no fun and joy in whatever is serious. Islam does not allow swimming in the sea and is opposed to radio and television serials. Islam, however, allows marksmanship, horseback riding and competition ...&lt;ref&gt;[source: Meeting in Qom "Broadcast by radio Iran from Qom on 20 August 1979." quoted in Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985) p.259)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and the all-encompassing nature of Islam, and thus of its law and its government,
&lt;blockquote&gt; Islam and divine governments ... have commandments for everybody, everywhere, at any place, in any condition. If a person were to commit an immoral dirty deed right next to his house, Islamic governments have business with him. .... Islam has rules for every person, even before birth, before his marriage, until his marriages, pregnancy, birth, until upbringing of the child, the education of the adult, until puberty, youth, until old age, until death, into the grave, and beyond the grave.&lt;ref&gt;(statement to his students in Najaf, 28 September 1977. Found in Khomeini, ''Sahifeh-ye Nur'', vol.I p.234-235) quoted in Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent,'' (1993), p.476-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Muslim and non-Muslim world==

===Spread of Islam===
Khomeini strongly supported the spread of Islam throughout the world.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We shall [[export of revolution|export our revolution]] to the whole world. Until the cry 'There is no god but Allah' resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[11 February 1979 (according to Dilip Hiro in ''The Longest War'' p.32) p.108 from ''Excerpts from Speeches and Messages of Imam Khomeini on the Unity of the Muslims''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not just as a faith but as a state.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Establishing the Islamic state world-wide belong to the great goals of the revolution.` &lt;ref&gt;''Resalat'', 25.3.1988) (quoted in ''The Constitution of Iran'' by Asghar Schirazi, Tauris, 1997, p.69)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which he believed would replace both capitalism and communism

&lt;blockquote&gt;... `We have often proclaimed this truth in our domestic and foreign policy, namely that we have set as our goal the world-wide spread of the influence of Islam and the suppression of the rule of the world conquerors ... We wish to cause the corrupt roots of [[Zionism]], [[capitalism]] and [[Communism]] to wither throughout the world. We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet ... in the world of arrogance.` &lt;ref&gt;''Bayan'', No.4 (1990), p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unity of the Ummah===
Khomeini made efforts to establish unity among Ummah. "During the early days of the Revolution, Khomeini endeavored to bridge the gap between Shiites and Sunnis by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali — an issue that causes much animosity between the two sects. Also, he declared it permissible for Shiites to pray behind Sunni imams."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1175008835987&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs%2FMAELayout#9 Islamonline. Frequently Asked Questions on Iran ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107074118/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1175008835987&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs%2FMAELayout |date=2009-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures have been viewed as being legitimised by the Shia practice of [[taqiyya]] (dissimulation), in order to maintain Muslim unity and fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zulkifli|title=The Struggle of the Shi‘is in Indonesia|date=6 Dec 2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=9781925021301|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerhard Böwering|author2=Patricia Crone|author3=Mahan Mirza|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691134840|page=136|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before he died the famous South Asian Islamist [[Abul Ala Maududi]] paid Khomeini the compliment of saying he wished he had accomplished what Khomeini had, and that he would have like to have been able to visit Iran to see the revolution for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported ''Unity Week''&lt;ref&gt;Ansari, Hamid, ''The Narrative of Awakening'', The Institute for the Compilation and Publication of the works of the Imam Khomeini, (date?), p.253&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[International Day of Quds]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine from the viewpoint of the Imam Khomeini'',  The Institute for the Compilation and Publication of the works of the Imam Khomeini, (date?), p.137&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Sa`id Hawwa]] in his book ''al-Khumayniyya'', Khomeini's real aim was to spread Shi'ism through the use of such tactics as [[taqiyya]] and anti-Zionist rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

This pan-Islamism did not extend to the [[Wahhabi]] regime of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Under his leadership the Iranian government cut relation with Saudi Arabia. Khomeini declared that Iran may one day start good diplomatic relation with the US or Iraq but never with Saudi Arabia. Iran did not re-establish diplomatic relation with Saudi Arabia until March 1991, after Khomeini's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyyR7j6vcc8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=saudi+arabia+iran+%22re+establish+diplomatic%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bHq_UaAO-L&amp;sig=iVecqVLUf1v-5gBot0cqHrjUUzg&amp;hl=en|title=Iran's Persian Gulf Policy|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shia revival===
The Iranian revolution "awakened" [[Shia]] around the world, who outside of Iran were subordinate to Sunnis. Shia "became bolder in their demands of rights and representations", and in some instances Khomeini supported them. In [[Pakistan]], he is reported to have told Pakistan military ruler [[Zia ul-Haq]] that he would do to al-Haq "what he had done to the Shah" if al-Haq mistreated Shia.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Vali Nasr with former Pakistani foreign minister Aghan Shahi, Lahore, 1989. from Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;    When tens of thousands of Shia protested for exemption from Islamic taxes based on Sunni law, al-Haq conceded to their demands.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.138-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia Islamist groups that sprang up during the 1980s, often "receiving financial and political support from Tehran" include the Amal Movement of Musa al-Sadr and later the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, [[Islamic Dawa Party]] in Iraq, [[Hizb-e Wahdat]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tahrik-e Jafaria]] in Pakistan, [[al-Wifaq]] in Bahrain, and the [[Saudi Hezbollah]] and [[al-Haraka al-Islahiya al-Islamiya]] in Saudi Arabia.  Shia were involved in the 1979-80 riots and demonstrations in oil-rich eastern Saudi Arabia, the [[1981 Bahraini coup d'état attempt]] and the [[1983 Kuwait bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neither East nor West===
Khomeini strongly opposed alliances with, or imitation of, [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern]] (Communist) and [[Western Bloc]] (Capitalist) nations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... in our domestic and foreign policy, ... we have set as our goal the world-wide spread of the influence of Islam ... We wish to cause the corrupt roots of Zionism, capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world. We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet ...&lt;ref&gt;''Bayan'', No.4 (1990), p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Last Message, The Political and Divine Will of His Holiness the Imam Khomeini'', there are no less than 21 warnings on the dangers of what the west or east, or of pro-western or pro-eastern agents are either doing, have done or will do to Islam and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/lmnew8.htm The Political and Divine Will of His Holiness the Imam Khomeini] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221721/http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/lmnew8.htm |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular he loathed the United States
&lt;blockquote&gt; ... the foremost enemy of Islam ... a terrorist state by nature that has set fire to everything everywhere ... oppression of Muslim nations is the work of the USA ...&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://server32.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/lmnew1.htm The Prologue to the Imam Khomeini's Last Will and Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822202322/http://server32.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/lmnew1.htm |date=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and its ally [[Israel]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;the international Zionism does not stop short of any crime to achieve its base and greedy desires, crimes that the tongue and pen are ashamed to utter or write.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Khomeini believed that Iran should strive towards self-reliance. Rather siding with one or the other of the world's two blocks (at the time of the revolution), he favored the allying of Muslim states with each other, or rather their union in one state. In his book [[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Islamic Government]] he hinted governments would soon fall into line if an Islamic government was established.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the form of government willed by Islam were to come into being, none of the governments now existing in the world would be able to resist it; they would all capitulate.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution'' (1981), p.122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====In the West====
While the Eastern or Soviet bloc no longer exists, Khomeini's legacy lives on in the Western world. From the beginning of the Iranian revolution to the time of his death Khomeini's "glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture" and "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He is said to have made the word `Ayatollah` "a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-476/_nr-1103/i.html|title=- Qantara.de - Dialogue with the Islamic World|work=Qantara.de - Dialogue with the Islamic World|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[The Satanic Verses controversy#Fatwā by Ayatollah Khomeini|His fatwa]] calling for the death of secular Muslim author [[Salman Rushdie]] in particular was seen by some as a deft attempt to create a [[wedge issue]] that would prevent Muslims from imitating the West by "dividing Muslims from Westerners along the default lines of culture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNpWhrg09C0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=brilliant+tactician+khomeini&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qw246RqW6q&amp;sig=m5dLybsWL8gepBGkCTxNduLH5kk&amp;hl=en Pipes, Daniel, ''The Rushdie Affair''], (1990) p.133&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa was greeted with headlines such as one in the popular British newspaper the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' referring to Khomeini as "that Mad Mullah",&lt;ref&gt;February 15, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; observations in a British magazine that the Ayatollah seemed "a familiar ghost from the past - one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a [[Faqir of Ipi]] or a [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|mad Mullah]], who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire",&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Harly, "Saving Mr. Rushdie?" ''Encounter'', June 1989, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and laments that Khomeini fed the Western stereotype of "the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer." &lt;ref&gt;Marzorati, Gerald,  "Salman Rushdie: Fiction's Embattled Infidel", ''The New York Times Magazine'', January 29, 1989, quoted in Pipes, ''The Rushdie Affair'', (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa indicated Khomeini's contempt for the right to life; for the presumption of innocence; for the rule of law; and for national sovereignty, since he ordered Rushdie killed 'wherever he is found' &lt;ref&gt; Geoffrey Robertson, Mullahs without mercy, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;

This was particularly the case in the largest nation of the Western bloc—the United States (or "Great Satan")—where Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the [[Iran hostage crisis|American embassy hostage taking]] and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks—especially using the Lebanese Shi'a Islamic group [[Hezbollah]]&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), p.28, 33,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for example the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] see:''Hizb'allah in Lebanon : The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis'' Magnus Ranstorp, Department of International Relations University of St. Andrews
St. Martins Press, New York, 1997, p.54, 117&lt;/ref&gt;—and which continues to apply economic [[sanctions against Iran]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}  Popular feeling during the hostage-taking was so high in the United States that some Iranians complained that they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack even at universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/iran-ahmadinejad-government|title=Inside Iran|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy, Marquis d'Argenson''' (18 October 1694{{snd}}26 January 1757) was a [[France|French]] statesman.

==Biography==
D'Argenson, the  eldest son of [[Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1652-1721)|Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson]], was a lawyer, and held successively the posts of councillor at the parlement (1716), ''[[maître des requêtes]]'' (1718), councillor of state (1719), and intendant of justice, police and finance in Hainaut. During his five years’ tenure of the last office he was mainly employed in provisioning the troops, who were suffering from the economic confusion resulting from [[John Law (economist)|John Law’s]] system and the aftermath of the [[Mississippi Bubble]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}}

D'Argenson returned to court in 1724 to exercise his functions as councillor of state. At that time he had the reputation of being a conscientious man, but ill-adapted to intrigue, and was nicknamed "la bête". He entered into relations with the philosophers, and was won over to the ideas of reform. He was the friend of [[Voltaire]], who had been a fellow-student of his at the Jesuit college [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand|Louis-le-Grand]], and frequented the [[Club de l'Entresol]], the history of which he wrote in his memoirs. It was then that he prepared his ''Considérations sur le gouvernement de la France'', which was published posthumously by his son.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}}

D'Argenson was also the friend and counsellor of the minister [[Germain Louis Chauvelin]]. In May 1744 he was appointed member of the council of finance, and in November of the same year King [[Louis XV]] chose him as secretary of state for foreign affairs, his brother, [[Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy, comte d'Argenson|Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson]], being at the same time secretary of state for war. France was at that time engaged in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], and the government had been placed by Louis XV virtually in the hands of the two brothers. The marquis d’Argenson endeavoured to reform the system of international relations. He dreamed of a "European Republic",{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}} and wished to establish arbitration between nations in pursuance of the ideas of his friend the [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|abbé de Saint-Pierre]]. But he failed to realize any part of his projects. The generals negotiated in opposition to his instructions; his colleagues laid the blame on him; the intrigues of the courtiers passed unnoticed by him; whilst the secret diplomacy of the king neutralized his initiative. He concluded the marriage of the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis, the Dauphin]] to 
[[Maria Josepha of Saxony, Dauphine of France|Maria]], a daughter of King [[Augustus III of Poland]], but was unable to prevent the election of the [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis, Grand-Duke of Tuscany]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1745.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}}

On 10 January 1747 Louis XV thanked d'Argenson for his services. He then retired into private life, eschewed the court, associated with Voltaire, Condillac and d’Alembert, and spent his declining years in working at the [[Académie des Inscriptions]], of which he was appointed president by the king in 1747, and revising his ''Mémoires''. Voltaire, in one of his letters, declared him to be "the best citizen that had ever tasted the ministry".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}} He died on 26 January 1757.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=458}}

==Works==
D'Argenson left a large number of manuscript works, of which his son, [[Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1722-1787)|Marc Antoine René, Marquis de Paulmy]], published the ''Considérations sur le gouvernement de France'' (Amsterdam, 1764) and ''Essais dans le goût de ceux de Montaigne'' (Amsterdam, 1785). The latter, which contains many useful biographical notes and portraits of his contemporaries, was republished in 1787 as ''Loisirs d’un ministre d’état''. D'Argenson’s most important work, however, is his ''Mémoires'', covering in great detail the years 1725 to 1756, with an introductory part giving his recollections since the year 1696. They are, as they were intended to be, valuable "materials for the history of his time". There are two important editions, the first, with some letters, not elsewhere published, by the marquis d’Argenson, his great-grand-nephew (5 vols., Paris, 1857 et seq.); the second, more correct, but less complete, published by J. B. Rathery, for the Société de l’Histoire de France (9 vols., Paris, 1859 et seq.). The other works of the marquis d’Argenson, in MS., were destroyed in the fire at the [[Louvre]] library in 1871.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=458–459}}

==Family==
D'Argenson married and had a son:
* [[Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1722-1787)|Marc Antoine René de Voyer]] (1722–1787),  known as the marquis de Paulmy, served as Minister of War and was a noted [[bibliophile]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=458–459}}

'''Sally Gregory Kohlstedt''' (born 1943) is an American historian of science. She is a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences and director of the Program in History of Science and Technology at the [[University of Minnesota]].  Kohlstedt  served as the president of the [[History of Science Society]] from 1992–1993. Her research interests focus on the history of science in American culture and the demographics of scientific practice in institutions such as museums and educational institutions, including gender participation.&lt;ref name="Minnesota"&gt;{{cite web|title=My Research Interests|url=https://www.esci.umn.edu/scitech/research.html|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sally Gregory Kohlstedt|url=https://www.esci.umn.edu/people/sally-kohlstedt|website=Department of Earth Sciences|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Author|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/K/S/au5428158.html|website=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Kohlstedt received her B. A. from [[Valparaiso University]] (1965), her M. A. from [[Michigan State University]] (1966) and her Ph.D. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (1972).&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sally Gregory Kohlstedt|url=https://www.esci.umn.edu/scitech/cv/cv2013.5.21.pdf|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kohlstedt was an assistant possessor at Department of History of [[Simmons College]], 1971-1975; an assistant and later full professor at the Department of History of [[Syracuse University]], 1975-1989. From 1989, she has been a professor at the University of Minnesota (UMN). From 1989 to 1995, she was Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College of Science and Engineering at UMN; from 1997 to 1999 she was director of the Center for Advanced Feminist Studies at UMN; from 2004-2006, Interim Chair of the Department of Anthropology at UMN; and from 2008, the director of the Program in History of Science and Technology.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; Her leadership and work as a teacher and mentor of women faculty and students has been described as "nothing short of heroic".&lt;ref name="Service"/&gt; She has also held visiting appointments at Cornell (1989),  the University of Melbourne (1983), the University of Munich (1997), and the University of Auckland (2008),&lt;ref name="Appt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Henning Schroeder appointed CGS/NSF Dean-in-Residence|url=http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/communications/schroeder.html|website=University of Minnesota|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin (2015).&lt;ref name="Max"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sally G.

'''Scrubs''' are the sanitary [[clothing]] worn by [[surgeons]],  [[nurses]], [[physicians]] and other workers involved in patient care in [[hospital]]s. Originally designed for use by surgeons and other [[operating room]] personnel, who would put them on when sterilizing themselves, or "scrubbing in", before [[surgery]], they are now worn by many hospital personnel. Their use has been extended outside hospitals as well, to work environments where clothing may come into contact with infectious agents ([[veterinarian]]s, [[midwife|midwives]], etc.). Scrubs are designed to be simple (with minimal places for [[contamination|contaminants]] to hide), easy to launder, and cheap to replace if damaged or stained irreparably. In the United Kingdom, scrubs are sometimes known as Theatre Blues.

The spread of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) has increased the use of scrubs but can give wearers a false sense of security that they are 'clean' when in fact they are as easily contaminated as any other clothing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Neely |first=A.

==History of surgical attire==
In contrast to the uniforms long required of [[nurse]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "The Nurse’s Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion", ''Fashion Theory'', Vol.21, No.5. (2015), pp. 523-552. [https://doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090]&lt;/ref&gt; [[surgeon]]s did not wear any kind of specialized garments until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653]&lt;/ref&gt; [[surgery|Surgical]] procedures were conducted in an [[operating theater]]. The surgeon wore his own clothes, with perhaps a butcher's apron to protect his clothing from blood stains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherlock|first=Angela|title=The Origin of Scrubs|url=http://www.medelita.com/blog/the-origin-of-scrubs/|publisher=Medelita Lab Coats &amp; Scrubs|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he operated bare-handed with non-[[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] instruments and supplies.  (Gut and silk [[surgical suture|suture]]s were sold as open strands with reusable hand-threaded needles; packing [[gauze]] was made of sweepings from the floors of cotton mills.)  In contrast to today's concept of surgery as a profession that emphasizes cleanliness and conscientiousness, up to the early 20th century the mark of a busy and successful surgeon was the profusion of blood and fluids on his clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Udin|first=Zaf|title=Nursing Uniforms of the Past and Present|url=http://www.pulseuniform.com/nursing/nursing-uniforms.asp|publisher=Pulse Uniform|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of dress as a badge of one's class in society was paramount and the processes behind the transmission of infection were the subject of controversy within the profession.

With the "[[Spanish flu]]" [[pandemic]] of 1918 and the growing medical interest in [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]]'s [[antisepsis|antiseptic]] theory, some surgeons began wearing cotton gauze masks in surgery; however, this was not to protect the patient from intra-operative [[infection]], but to protect the surgeon from the patient's diseases.  Around the same time, operating theatre staff began wearing heavy rubber gloves to protect their hands from the solutions used to clean the room and equipment, a practice surgeons grudgingly adopted.

By the 1940s, advances in surgical antisepsis (now called aseptic technique) and the science of wound infection led to the adoption of antiseptic drapes and gowns for [[operating room]] use.  Instruments, supplies and dressings were routinely sterilized by exposure to either [[autoclave|high-pressure steam]] or [[ethylene oxide]].

Originally, operating room attire was white to emphasize cleanliness.  However, the combination of bright operating lights and an all-white environment led to eye strain for the surgeon and staff.  By the 1950s and 1960s, most hospitals had abandoned white operating room apparel in favor of various shades of green, which provided a high-contrast environment, reduced eye fatigue, and made bright red blood splashes less conspicuous. {{Clarify|date=August 2011}}

By the 1970s, surgical attire had largely reached its modern state—a short-sleeve V-necked shirt and drawstring pants or a short-sleeve calf-length dress, made of green cotton or cotton/[[polyester]] blend.  Over this was worn a tie-back or bouffant-style cloth cap, a gauze or synthetic textile mask, a cloth or synthetic surgical gown, latex gloves, and supportive closed-toe shoes.  This uniform was originally known as "surgical greens" because of its color, but came to be called "scrubs" because it was worn in a "scrubbed" environment.

== Use ==
In many operating rooms, it is forbidden to wear any exposed clothing, such as a [[t-shirt]], beneath scrubs.  As scrubs are designed to promote a clean environment, the wearing of outside clothing is thought to introduce unwanted pathogens.[[File:Shock Trauma Pic.jpg|thumb|left|American hospital workers in Baltimore, Maryland wearing scrubs in March 2001.]]
Nearly all patient care personnel at hospitals in the United States wear some form of scrubs while on duty, as do some staffers in doctor, dental, and veterinary offices. Doctors in the United States may wear their own clothes with a [[white coat]] except for surgery. Support staff such as custodians and unit clerks also wear scrubs in some facilities. When the physician is not performing surgery, the scrub is often worn under a [[white coat]].

In the UK, all NHS hospital trusts have stringent clothing policies, and many of these specifically forbid wearing the iconic white coat for medical staff, owing to infection control concerns.  This has meant that several hospitals around the UK have opted for scrubs for staff, especially in Accident and Emergency departments.

Scrubs are also sometimes used as [[prison uniform]]s in the U.S and other countries.

==Modern scrubs==
[[File:Dickies scrubs uniforms December 16 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Dickies]] scrubs uniforms on the rack in a [[Work N Gear|Work 'n Gear]] store in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester, Massachusetts]] (December 2012)]]
Today, any medical [[uniform]] consisting of a short-sleeve shirt and pants is known as "scrubs".  Scrubs may also include a waist-length long-sleeved jacket with no [[Jacket lapel|lapels]] and stockinette cuffs, known as a "warm-up jacket".  

===Colors and patterns===
Scrubs worn in surgery are almost always colored solid light grey, light green, light blue or a light green-blue shade.

Non-surgical scrubs come in a wider variety of colors and patterns, ranging from official issue garments to custom made, whether by commercial uniform companies or by home-sewing using commercially available printed [[pattern (sewing)|patterns]].

Some hospitals use scrub color to differentiate between patient care departments (i.e. Surgery, [[Childbirth]], Emergency, etc.) or between licensed patient care personnel (nurses, radiologic technologists, respiratory and physical therapists, etc.), unlicensed assistive personnel, and non-patient care support staff (i.e. portering, dietary, unit clerks, etc...). Hospitals may also extend the practice to differentiate non-staff members/visitors.

Custom-made printed scrub tops, featuring cartoon characters and cheerful prints, are common in [[pediatrician]]s' offices, [[veterinary]] offices, dental clinics and children's hospitals, and prints for various holidays can be seen throughout the year. Some acute care facilities or larger hospitals also have relaxed rules regarding the wear of non-regulation scrubs in non-surgical units, and they are no longer just the classic v-neck scrub tops, but are now offered in many styles and patterns.

The scrub industry, much like maternity wear, used to have very limited fashion options. Indeed, scrubs were generally box shaped and ill fitted; often with limited design choices. Over the past 10  years, the scrub industry has taken notice of the individual preferences of medical professionals and have begun to design and manufacture fashionable and unique designs.

== Cleaning ==
[[File:Laundry that helps to saves lives in the fight against Ebola (16154988230).jpg|alt=Two women with large piles of scrubs and a washing machine|thumb|January 2015 laundry service in a medical facility in [[Sierra Leone]]. The scrubs are cleaned in-house to prevent the spread of disease.]]
Surgical scrubs are not generally owned by the wearer.  Due to concerns about home laundering and sterility issues, these scrubs are usually hospital-owned or hospital-leased through a commercial linen service. And due to these laundering and sterility limitations, disposable scrub suits were introduced in the market.

== Scrub caps ==
Scrub caps have graduated from being functional to also being a personalized accessory both in the operating room and outside. Before the antiseptic focus of the 1940s, hats were not considered essential to surgery. From the 1940s through the 1950s, as a hygienic focus swept the industry, hats became standard wear to help protect patients from contaminants in hair. Full-face hats were even designed for men with beards. These hats have been and continue to be distributed by [[group purchasing organization]]s (GPOs) who supply hospitals with most equipment.

In the medical fashion 'revolution' of the seventies, more and more medical professionals began personalizing their scrubs by either sewing their own hats or buying premade hats made of [[wikt:eclectic|eclectic]] [[textile|fabric]]. Several styles were popular, including the 'bouffant' surgical cap, a utilitarian hairnet-like hat which typically comes in light blue, and the 'milkmaid', a bonnet-like wrap around hat.

Bouffant surgical caps are perhaps the most widely used scrub hats in hospitals, and their usage is not limited to only nurses and surgeons: hospital patients are required to wear a bouffant cap when having surgery of any kind.

In 2016, a controversy emerged around the use of cloth or disposable surgical caps vs mandatory use of bouffant style surgical caps.&lt;ref name=Kowalczyk2016&gt;{{cite web |author=Kowalczyk, Liz |date=2016-08-31 |title=No more surgical caps for surgeons? |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/08/31/hat-wars-flaring/abr7FuB9EZna1FRtECDR1K/story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy ended in state mandates for the use of bouffant caps to comply with [[Joint Commission]] standards.&lt;ref name=skepticalscalpel2016&gt;{{cite web |author=Skeptical Scalpel |title=It's time to discuss surgeon headgear again |date=2016-04-26 |url=http://skepticalscalpel.blogspot.com/2016/04/its-time-to-discuss-surgeon-headgear.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3169">[[Image:Orna139-Hermen.png|thumb|250px|Terminal figures copied from French and Antwerp 16th-century [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] pattern books.]]
In [[Classical architecture]] a '''term''' or '''terminal figure''' (plural: '''terms''' or '''termini''') is a human head and bust that continues as a square  tapering pillar-like form.

The name derives from [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the Roman god of boundaries and boundary markers. If the bust is of [[Hermes]] as protector of boundaries in ancient Greek culture, with male genitals interrupting the plain base at the appropriate height, it may be called a '''[[herma]]''' or '''herm'''.  The crime of [[Alcibiades]] and his drinking-mates, for which [[Socrates]] eventually indirectly paid with his life, was the desecration of herm figures through Athens in the dead of night.

At the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the Lady of Ephesus, whom the Greeks identified with Artemis, was a many-breasted goddess encased in a tapering term, from which her feet protruded. (See illustration at [[Temple of Artemis]]).

In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European [[Renaissance]] and the succeeding [[Classicism|Classical styles]], term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[faun]]s and [[Bacchante]]s especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.

Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called [[Antwerp Mannerism]]. Engravings disseminated the style through Germany and England.

Term figures as table supports or employed as candlestands (French ''guéridon'') were characteristic of the Late Baroque Louis XIV style in France, the Low Countries and England, revived in the neo-Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] and employed again in the French Empire style of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetantiquegazette.com/furniture/1726_gueridon_definition/|title=Gueridon – definition|publisher=Internet Antique Gazette|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleolithic==
*200th millennium BC – In the [[Paleolithic]] period the [[Neanderthal]] Man enters the [[Iberian Peninsula]].
*70th millennium BC
**[[Neanderthal]] [[Mousterian]] culture.
**Beginning of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Last Ice Age]].
*[[40th millennium BC]]
**Beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]].
**The first large settlement of Europe by modern humans, [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]es coming from the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia, characterized by the M173 [[mutation]] in the [[Y chromosome]], defining them as an [[haplogroup]] R population. When the Ice Age reached its maximum extent, these modern humans took refuge in Southern Europe, namely in Iberia, and in the steppes of southern [[Ukraine]] and [[Russian Federation]].
*[[30th millennium BC]] – Modern humans make way into the Iberian Peninsula, coming from southern France. Here, this [[Population genetics|genetically homogenous population]] (characterized by the M173 mutation in the Y chromosome), will develop the [[M343]] mutation, giving rise to the [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] haplogroup, still dominant in modern [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] populations.
**Extinction of the [[Neanderthal]] Man in its last refuge – the west of Iberia
*[[15th millennium BC]] – [[Magdalenian]] cultural period in Europe.

==[[Mesolithic]]==
*[[10th millennium BC]]
**The [[Allerød oscillation]] occurs, an interstadial [[Glaciation|deglaciation]] that weakens the rigorous conditions of the Ice Age.
**End of [[Upper Palaeolithic]] and beginning of the Mesolithic period.
**The populations sheltered in Iberia, descendants of the [[Cro-Magnon]], given the deglaciation, migrate and recolonize all of Western Europe, thus spreading the [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] haplogroup populations (still dominant, in variant degrees, from Iberia to Scandinavia).
**[[Azilian]] culture in southern France and northern Iberia (to the mouth of the [[Douro]] river).

==[[Neolithic]]==
*[[5th millennium BC]]
**Beginning of the [[Neolithic]] in the Iberian peninsula.
**Autochthonous development of agriculture in Iberia.
**Beginning of the [[Megalith|Megalithic European culture]], spreading to most of Europe
**The nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]es of the R [[haplogroup]] (characterized by the M173 [[mutation]] in the Y chromosome) that had taken refuge during the Last Ice Age in the [[steppe]]s of southern [[Ukraine]] and [[Russian Federation]] (and had developed the M17 mutation, originating the R1a Haplogroup), give rise to the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] cultures (speakers of the predecessor of [[Indo-European languages|languages]]), such as the [[Kurgan]] culture.

==[[Bronze Age]]==
*[[1st millennium BC]]
**First wave of migrations into Iberia, of the [[Urnfield culture]] (Oestrimni, speakers of the [[Proto-Celtic language]]).
**Bronze culture ([[Celt]]ic) in the northwest of Iberia (modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern Portugal), maintaining commercial relations with [[Brittany]] and the [[British Isles]]. Emergence of the [[Castro culture]] in this Iberian area.

==[[Iron Age]]==
**The poem ''[[Ora Maritima]]'', written by [[Avienus]] in the 4th century and based on the [[Massaliote Periplus]] of the 6th century BC, states that all of western Iberia was once called for the name of its people, the [[Oestriminis|Oestrimini]], which were replaced by an invasion of the ''Saephe'' or ''Ophis'' (meaning Serpent). From then on western Iberia would have been known as [[Ophiussa]] (Land of the Serpents). The poem probably translates  the impact of the Second wave of Celtic migrations in the 7th century BC. The poem also describes the various ethnic groups present at that time:
***The [[Saephe or Ophis]], today seen as probably [[Hallstatt culture]] Celts, in all of western Iberia (modern Portugal) between the [[Douro]] and the [[Sado River|Sado]] rivers.
***The Cempsi, probably Hallstatt culture Celts, in the [[Tagus]] mouth and the south up to the [[Algarve]].
***The [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Cunetes]] in the extreme south and some cities along the Atlantic coast (such as ''Olissipo'', modern [[Lisbon]]), probably autochthonous Iberian (even if strongly or totally celticized over the next centuries).
***The [[Dragani]], Celt or Proto-Celt of the first wave, in the mountainous areas of Galicia, northern Portugal, [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]].
***The [[Lusis]], probably a first reference to the [[Lusitanians]], similar to the Dragani (Celt or Proto-Celt of the first wave).
*5th century BC
**Development of a 2nd [[Castro culture]] in Galicia and northern Portugal.
*4th century BC
**The Celtic [[Gallaecia|Calaicians or Gallaeci]] inhabit all the region above the [[Douro]] river (modern Galicia and northern Portugal).

==May 19, 2000==
*A group led by [[George Speight]] takes Prime Minister [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and others hostage in the Parliament building of Fiji in [[Suva]].
*Speight names [[Timoci Silatolu]] interim Prime Minister.
*The [[President of Fiji|President]], [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], denounces the coup, and declares a [[state of emergency]].

*The military and police pledge loyalty to Mara.

==May 26, 2000==
*Fifteen soldiers and two officers defect to the coup.

==May 27, 2000==
*The rebels try to break the siege.  Gunfire is exchanged.
*President Mara dismisses Mahendra Chaudhry and appoints [[Tevita Momoedonu|Ratu Tevita Momoedonu]] as Prime Minister in his place.  Momoedonu holds office for only a few minutes: he is appointed in order to "advise" the President to assume emergency powers, something that Chaudhry, in captivity, is unable to do.  Mara claims to be following the [[Great Council of Chiefs]].  Mara offers Speight a [[pardon]], which Speight rejects.  (Mara later accused the Great Council of Chiefs of deception: according to him, they had lost confidence in him also, although that did not become apparent until two days later).

==May 29, 2000==
*Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama]] declares himself head of an Interim Military Government, with the claimed backing of the previous president, and declares martial law.  (In an interview on 29 April of the following year, deposed President Mara denied that he had given Bainimarama his support.  His resignation had been, he said, extorted from him, following his refusal of their request to abrogate the constitution).

==May 30, 2000==
*Bainimarama revokes the 1997 [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitution]] and names [[Epeli Nailatikau|Ratu Epeli Nailatikau]] interim Prime Minister. After opposition from Speight, he withdraws the nomination on 31 May.

==June 7, 2000==
*Fiji is suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

==June 20, 2000==
*Speight rejects an ultimatum demanding he sign an accord.

==July 4, 2000==
*[[Laisenia Qarase]] made interim Prime Minister.

==July 6, 2000==
*Rebels cut off Suva's power supply.

==July 7, 2000==
*Rebels overrun the [[Sukunaivalu Barracks]] in [[Labasa]], on the northern island of [[Vanua Levu]] (see [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état]])
*Gunfire between rebels and military in Suva

==July 9, 2000==
*Speight and the military sign an accord.
*There is rioting in [[Levuka]]

==July 12, 2000==
*Speight's group release 9 hostages.

==July 13, 2000==
*Chaudhry and the other hostages are released.  Ratu [[Josefa Iloilo]] named as interim President.  Ratu [[Jope Seniloli]] is [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]].

==July 27, 2000==
*Speight is arrested in contravention of an earlier accord granting him immunity from prosecution, an accord agreed to by the military, according to Bainimarama, only "under duress."

==November 2, 2000==
*A failed mutiny at Suva's [[Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Suva|Queen Elizabeth Barracks]] leaves four loyal soldiers dead.  Four rebels are subsequently beaten to death.

==November 15, 2000==
*The [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] declares the interim government to be illegal, orders the reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution, of Mara as President and of the Chaudhry government.  Mara resigns, backdating his resignation to 29 May.  The government appeals the ruling.

==March 1, 2001==
*The [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]] upholds the High Court ruling reinstating the constitution.

This is a '''timeline''' of the events surrounding the [[United States]]-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] in 2003.

==March 17==
[[File:George W. Bush's statement on Iraq (March 17, 2003).webm|thumb|U.S. President George W. Bush addresses the world about U.S. intentions regarding Saddam Hussein and Iraq on March 17, 2003.]]
U.S. President George W. Bush delivers a televised address to the world, in which he summarizes the past few months' events between the United States and Iraq. He demands that Saddam Hussein vacate his office and leave Iraq within two days, or else the U.S. and its allies will invade Iraq and depose his regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KZYmmdyMnU|title=Statement|last=Bush|first=George W.|date=March 17, 2003|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March 18==
Protests against a possible invasion of Iraq begin to take place around the world.
* In Australia, a "NO WAR" slogan is painted on the [[Sydney Opera House]] by protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/18/1047749763708.html |title=Opera House defaced in war protest |publisher=The Age |date=18 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2859225.stm |title=Australia to join war on Iraq |publisher=BBC News |date=18 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes as Australia's Prime Minister [[John Howard]] announced he will commit troops to any American-led war against Iraq. A former Navy officer burns his uniform outside Australia's Parliament House. 
* In Denmark, protestors hurl red paint at Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] for his pro-U.S. stance shortly before a press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=escalate the protest|title=Denmark's pro-war premier attacked with red paint |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2003/03/18/15849311.php |publisher=Indy bay |date=18 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iraq invasion map US Army CMH.jpg|thumb|Map of the route of the advance by U.S. and allied forces]]
The first assaults on Baghdad begin shortly following the 01:00 UTC expiry of the United States' 48-hour deadline for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq.
*02:30 UTC: Explosions are reported in [[Baghdad]], damaging civilian buildings. The [[United States Department of Defense]] later states that the assault consisted of 36 [[Tomahawk missile]]s and two [[F-117]]-launched [[GBU-27]] bombs, and that the target was a military bunker thought to contain high-level Iraqi regime officials, including Saddam Hussein himself. Later, on May 29, [[CBS Evening News]] reports that the bunker never existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2003/05/30/int11.htm |title=Saddam’s bunker never existed: TV network |publisher=Dawn News |date=30 May 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*03:15 UTC (March 19 U.S. time): U.S. President George W. Bush states that he ordered the coalition to launch an "attack of opportunity" against specified targets in Iraq. The military action was dubbed "Operation Iraqi Freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://nsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/oif-history.pdf | title=Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) History Brief| work=U.S. Department of Defense |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Iraqi state [[television]] broadcasts an address from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. and the British analyze the footage closely, believing that one of his body doubles may have made the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-03-20/us/sprj.irq.intel_1_saddam-hussein-iraqi-tv-iraqi-leader?_s=PM:US |title=No definitive judgment on body double possibility |publisher=CNN |date=20 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. eventually says it believes the address was indeed delivered by Saddam Hussein himself. It has not yet been ascertained when the address was recorded, however. Speculation begins that Saddam Hussein may have been killed. However, these reports are deemed to be false.
*It is announced that [[Special Forces#United States and Canada|special operations forces]] are operating inside Iraq.  Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all have special operations forces in the area. Soon after the strike on Baghdad, Iraq launches a number of missiles at targets in [[Kuwait]], including at the coalition forces stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/20/iraq6 |title=Iraq launches Scud missiles |publisher=the Guardian |date=20 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2-3 Scud missiles are also intercepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200303/20/eng20030320_113663.shtml |title=Patriot Missiles Intercept Two Iraqi Scuds in Kuwait |publisher=People Daily |date=20 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition report that they caused no damage. Later in the day, both British and U.S. ground troops move into the demilitarized zone between Iraq and its neighbor, [[Kuwait]], and then into Iraq itself. During the night, 12 British military personnel and four American troops are killed when a transport helicopter crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jamie McIntyre |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-03-20/world/sprj.irq.chopper.crash_1_helicopter-crash-ch-46-kuwait?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Helicopter crash in Kuwait kills 16 |publisher=CNN |date=20 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March 22==
*Airstrikes on Baghdad continue, with the attacks now concentrated on the city's outskirts.
*Around midnight UTC (early morning local time), reports indicate that 1,500 Turkish troops had moved into northern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Frank Bruni |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/22/world/a-nation-at-war-ankara-turkey-sends-army-troops-into-iraq-report-says.html |title=A NATION AT WAR: ANKARA; Turkey Sends Army Troops Into Iraq, Report Says |publisher=The New York Times |date=22 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention of Turkish troops had been opposed by the U.S. government. The German government has announced that it will call back the German [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] personnel watching [[NATO]] airspace above Turkey if Turkish troops engage in fights in northern Iraq. Turkey later denies they moved troops into Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2874635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkey denies entering Iraq | date=March 22, 2003 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At 1:15 (UTC), a collision of two [[Royal Navy]] [[Westland Sea King]] helicopters from {{HMS|Ark Royal|R07|6}} over the Persian Gulf kills six Britons and one American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2875615.stm |title=Seven dead in helicopter crash |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At 10:00 UTC, it is reported that U.S. forces are attempting to capture the city of [[Basra]], and are involved in a major tank battle on the western side of the city.
*Kurdish officials report a U.S. missile attack on territory held by the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Islamist]] group [[Ansar al-Islam]].
*According to Iraqi regime reports, two civilians are killed and 207 wounded, consisting of mostly women and children. They claim that there have been no defections or surrenders of Iraqi soldiers, and that footage to the contrary is in fact that of kidnapped Iraqi civilians.
*Five U.S. tanks and numerous vehicles have been destroyed by Iraqi fighters, and coalition forces enter but are later repelled from [[Umm Qasr]].
*The Iraqi regime puts a bounty of 50 million dinars ($33,000USD) for the capture, or 25 million dinars for the killing of each "mercenary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saddam puts $US33,000 bounty on invaders - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/03/21/813260.htm|work=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gm7RF4VI?url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/03/21/813260.htm|archivedate=2009-05-14|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Parts of the city of [[Basra]] are entered by the British.
*A [[hand grenade]] attack on a rear base of the [[101st Airborne Division]] in [[Kuwait]] causes the death of CPT Chris Seifert of the Army and MAJ Gregory Stone of the Air Force and injuries to 14 others. An American soldier, SGT [[Hasan Akbar case|Hasan Akbar]] is arrested for the attack.

== March 23 ==
*American and British forces succeed in taking the [[airport]] outside of [[Basra]], and battle with Iraqi forces for control of the city itself.
*U.S. Marines battle Iraqi forces near the city of [[Nassiriya]], a key crossing of the [[Euphrates]] about {{convert|225|mi|km}} southeast of Baghdad.
*News media report that pictures of British and American soldiers wounded and killed by Iraqi forces were shown by the Arabian [[Al Jazeera]] TV network.
**Sixteen Americans go missing; five of them were shown on Iraqi state-run television as prisoners of war and at least four are shown dead in what appears to be a hospital room.
*In another incident about ten U.S. Marines are confirmed to be killed, after they ran into an ambush during the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]].
*The British television network [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reports that its reporter [[Terry Lloyd]] was killed near [[Basra]].
*The battles around the Iraqi cities of [[Basra]] and [[Nassiriya]] continue.
*Iraq reports that it has captured a number of American [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. The United States military states that 12 soldiers from a maintenance unit are missing. A videotape of the captured and dead soldiers are released, showing possible [[torture]] and execution-style killings. U.S. officials charge that Iraqi treatment of the captives violates the [[Geneva Conventions]].
*A [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Panavia Tornado]] is shot down by "[[friendly fire]]" by an American [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]] battery.
*Coalition forces take control of a large complex of buildings in [[An Najaf]] Province near the city of [[Najaf]]. Some news sources proclaim that this is a "huge [[chemical weapon]]s plant",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,81935,00.html|title='Huge' Suspected Chemical Weapons Plant Found in Iraq|work=Fox News|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] officials call such announcements "premature" and state that no [[weapons of mass destruction]] had yet been found.
* In Belgium, legal complaints are filed against American officials for "[[crimes against humanity]]". It was reported that an Iraqi representing seven families deposited complaints for violation of human rights against former U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Dick Cheney]], [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] in Belgium. Supported by a socialist deputy and a non-governmental organization ([[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]), the Iraqis denounce the bombing of a shelter which had made 403 civilian victims in [[Baghdad]] in February 1991 during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. This is made possible by the Belgian law of universal competence, which provides justice on war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and can apply to any nationalities. U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] indicates the event was a "serious problem", affecting the ability to go to Belgium, in particular to [[NATO]] in [[Brussels]]. Powell stated that this law was a subject of worry.

== March 24 ==
*An operation of about thirty American attack helicopters attack the Medina Division of the Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched in the Karbala area. One U.S. Army Apache helicopter is shot down and captured by Iraqi civilians, along with its two crewmen, who appear later on Arab satellite T.V. channels. A CNN reporter that was embedded with a helicopter unit that participated in the battle reports the destruction of another helicopter and that helicopters were under heavy fire, with only two of them managing to achieve their objectives. The helicopter's crewmen are later safely recovered.

*Five people, including one woman, are killed when a missile falls down onto their houses in a populated district in the west of Baghdad.
*The United States accuses the Russians of deliveries of weapons to Iraq. [[Ari Fleischer]], the spokesman of the U.S. president, rejects denials by Moscow and claims that Washington has "evidence" of these deliveries, which could give the Iraqis invaluable assets against British and American forces. Devices listed are binoculars for night vision, GPS units, and anti-tank missiles. Fleischer says the U.S. government asked the Russians to immediately put an end to its assistance. The Russian government and the companies mentioned as having delivered armaments to Iraq rejects these allegations on Monday, describing them as "inventions" and reaffirming that Moscow strictly respects the embargo imposed by the U.N. on Baghdad. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects the American charges himself during a telephone conversation with George W. Bush, the U.S. presidential press secretary indicated Tuesday, quoted by the Interfax agency.

==March 25==
*Coalition forces begin fighting Iraqi militia in [[Basra]], second largest city in Iraq. British soldiers reported that the Shiite population of Basra appeared to be rebelling against the Iraqi militia. The anti-Saddam resistance group based in [[Iran]], the [[Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq]], confirmed that the Shiite revolt was taking place in Basra. According to some sources, the Iraqi militia forces were attacking the local Basra civilians, attempting to stop the revolt, with artillery and mortars. The Iraqi Information Minister [[Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf|Muhammed al-Sahhaf]] denied that any uprising was taking place in Basra.
*The Red Cross warned that a humanitarian crisis was emerging in the city. The Red Cross, Save the Children and other organizations are attempting to reach the city. Kuwait also has a caravan of supply trucks heading north into Iraq. Coalition forces announce that the port city of [[Umm Qasr]] was now "safe and open" and divers begin searching for mines off shore. Once the waters are clear, British ships, which are waiting off of the Iraqi coast, land in Umm Qasr with additional medicine, food and water for the area. Coalition forces have a small supply of food and water that they begin to pass out to the citizens of Umm Qasr.
*While fighting in [[Nasiriya]], coalition forces discover and confiscate weapons caches and gear to protect against chemical weapons, including a [[T-55]] tank, over 3,000 chemical suits with masks, and Iraqi munitions and military uniforms. All of this equipment was hidden in a Nasiriya hospital.
* U.S. forces advance toward [[Baghdad]], but are hampered by extreme dust storms.
* Thousands of chemical suits as well as a tank and a large stockpile of weapons are reportedly found by coalition forces in the [[An Nasiriyah]] [[hospital]] in Iraq. Coalition forces enter the hospital after being fired upon by Iraqi soldiers hiding in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,82182,00.html|title=Chemical Suits, Gas Masks Are Some Signs Iraq Planning Chemical Strike|work=Fox News|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. officials report the possibility that [[chemical weapon]]s would be deployed on coalition troops as they approach [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,82145,00.html|title=U.S. Military Officials: Odds of Chemical Attack Increased|work=Fox News|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*According to a U.S. officer, approximately 650 Iraqis were killed around [[Najaf]] "in the last twenty-four hours" while the American forces would not have, on their side, recorded any casualties. This assessment, not confirmed by any independent source, would be the heaviest since the beginning of the offensive, the Thursday prior.

== March 26 ==
*  The American central command in Qatar admits to have carried out bombardments which could have killed civilians because Iraqi military assets were being placed close to civilian areas - within 300 feet (100 m) in some cases. This occurs a few hours after two explosions occurred in on a commercial street of Baghdad which killed 14 Iraqi civilians and injured thirty more, according to Iraqi civil defense.  Also on this day special units of the Iraqi Republican Guard, for the first time, take part in the fights against the American and British forces. Just after the marketplace explosions in Baghdad, Russia calls for "the immediate end of the war against Iraq" and discussions to resume within the Security Council.
* 954 soldiers from the American [[173rd Airborne Brigade]], commanded by Colonel William C. Mayville, conduct a combat parajump into Northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield. Their mission is to secure a northern front to air-land ground units including armor and logistical assets. The paratroopers also assist [[special operations force]]s (SOF) already active in the areas north of [[Kirkuk]] and [[Mosul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/173abnbde.htm|title=173d Airborne Brigade|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.173rdairborne.com/history.htm|title=History of the 173rd Airborne Brigade from WWI to WWII, Vietnam to Iraq and Today|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March 28==
*The [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] unanimously adopts a resolution allowing the resumption of the [[Oil for Food program]], suspended on March 18, and which 60% of the Iraqi population relies upon for sustenance. The Secretary General of the United Nations, [[Kofi Annan]], underlines that this vote should not be confused with a recognition of the war carried out and with a way to legitimize the military action afterwards. The resolution states that the chief responsibility for addressing humanitarian consequences of the war would fall to the United States and the United Kingdom if they take control of the country. This refers to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which defines the responsibilities of a country in wartime to occupying forces.
* U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] accuses [[Syria]] of supplying arms and materiel to Iraq; Syria denies these allegations.

*The Iraqi Information Minister [[Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf]] accuses U.S. forces of killing 140 civilians during the last 24 hours and denies allegations that Iraqi soldiers are disguising themselves as civilians.
*An explosion damaged a shopping center in [[Kuwait City]] before dawn. Initial reports suggest the cause is a malfunctioning U.S. [[cruise missile]], but later reports focused on an Iraqi [[Silkworm missile]] as being responsible. No injuries are reported.
*An Iraqi [[suicide bombing|suicide bomber]], driving a [[Taxicab|taxi]], kills four U.S. soldiers in an attack.

* Journalist [[Peter Arnett]] is fired by [[NBC]] after giving an interview to Iraqi [[television]], which some considered as unfairly critical of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war on Iraq]]. Later in the day, Arnett is hired by a British tabloid, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.
* The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] orders [[Fox News]] embedded reporter [[Geraldo Rivera]] away from its troops and demands him to leave Iraq after accusing him of reporting the positions of U.S. forces.

*U.S. forces search the Latifiyah Explosives and Ammunition Plant, south of Baghdad, and discover thousands of boxes full of vials of a white powdery substance, [[atropine]] (a nerve agent antidote) and Arabic documents on how to engage in chemical warfare. Early reports suggest that the powdery substance is an explosive, although additional tests are needed. Some vials contained a liquid. The facility had been identified by the International Atomic Energy Agency as a suspected chemical, biological and nuclear weapons site. U.N. weapons inspectors visited the plant at least nine times, including as recently as February 18. Later tests show no forbidden weaponry.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

* Two American [[air to surface missile]]s hit [[Al Jazeera]]'s office in [[Baghdad]], killing a reporter and wounding a cameraman. The nearby office of Arab satellite T.V. channel [[Abu Dhabi]] is also hit by air strikes. Al-Jazeera accuses the U.S. of attacking civilian media as censorship. On the same day, an American [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] fires into the fifteens floor of Baghdad's [[Palestine Hotel]], where many foreign journalists are berthed, killing two cameramen and wounding three. In the case of Abu Dhabi, the station airs footage of Iraqi fire coming from underneath the camera's viewpoint.

==April 12==
*Looting and unrest, especially in major cities such as [[2003 invasion of Baghdad|Baghdad]] and [[Basra]] becomes a very serious issue. In Baghdad, with the notable exception of the Oil Ministry, which was guarded by American soldiers, the majority of government and public buildings are totally plundered, to the point where there is nothing of any value left. This includes the [[National Museum of Iraq]], with initial reports stating that 170,000 artifacts have been lost. The reports are later discovered to have been exaggerated, with the actual losses ultimately being determined to have been around 15,000 items. Many major hospitals are also looted. The losses caused by looting and plundering starts to cause more and more damage to Iraqi civilian infrastructure, economy, and culture, than those caused by three weeks of coalition bombing.
