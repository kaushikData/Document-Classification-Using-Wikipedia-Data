      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15950">'''The Russian plague epidemic of 1770–1772''', also known as the '''Plague of 1771''', was the last massive outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in central [[Russia]], claiming between 52,000 and 100,000 lives in [[Moscow]] alone (1/6 to 1/3 of its population).&lt;ref name=M26/&gt; The [[bubonic plague]] [[epidemic]] that originated in the [[Moldova]]n theatre of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|1768–1774 Russian-Turkish war]] in January 1770 swept northward through [[Ukraine]] and central Russia, peaking in Moscow in September 1771 and causing the [[Plague Riot]]. The epidemic reshaped the map of Moscow, as new cemeteries were established beyond the 18th-century city limits.

==Outbreak==

Russian troops in [[Focşani]], Moldova discovered first signs of plague in January 1770; the disease, indigenous to the area, was contracted through prisoners of war and booty.&lt;ref name=M24&gt;Melikishvili, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The news was hailed and exaggerated by adversaries of Russia, and Catherine wrote a reassuring letter to [[Voltaire]], arguing that "in spring those killed by plague will resurrect for the fighting".&lt;ref name=S2&gt;Solovyov, vol. 28 chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Commanding general [[Christopher von Stoffeln]] coerced army doctors to conceal the outbreak, which was not made public until [[Gustav Orreus]], a Russian-Finnish surgeon reporting directly to Field Marshal [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]], examined the situation, identified it as plague and enforced quarantine in the troops. Shtoffeln, however, refused to evacuate the infested towns and himself fell victim to the plague in May 1770. Of 1,500 patients recorded in his troops in May–August 1770, only 300 survived.&lt;ref name=M24/&gt;

Medical [[quarantine]] checkpoints instituted by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] and expanded by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] were sufficient to prevent plague from reaching inside the country in peacetime, but they proved to be inadequate in time of war. The system regarded all epidemics as external threats, focusing on border control, and paid less attention to domestic measures.&lt;ref&gt;Melikishvili, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The epidemic blocked the logistics of Rumyantsev's army,&lt;ref name=S3&gt;Solovyov, vol. 28 chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; and as the state tried to push more reserves and supplies to the theatre, peacetime quarantine controls had to be lifted. Plague swept into [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]; by August 1770 it reached [[Bryansk]].&lt;ref name=GO&gt;Gorelova&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine refused to admit the plague in public, although she was clearly aware of the nature and proportions of the threat, as evidenced by her letters to Governor of Moscow [[Pyotr Saltykov]].&lt;ref name=M25&gt;Melikishvili, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moscow plague==

When [[Peter the Great]] died in 1725, he left behind him the blooming, new capital of [[St. Petersburg]], and the city of [[Moscow]], now unstable because he had transferred the seat of power from that city to St. Petersburg. The now-abandoned Moscow and its suburbs attracted vast numbers of serfs and army deserters, who prompted the government to instigate change by “tightening serfdom and strengthening—or even just creating—administrative and estate institutions, and knitting all three into a seamless web of social control.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexander |last=Martin |title=Sewage and the City: Filth, Smell, and Representation of Urban Life in Moscow, 1770–1880 |journal=[[The Russian Review|Russian Review]] |volume=67 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=234–74 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9434.2008.00483.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increasing population created more waste that needed to be dealt with, and no real solution for getting rid of it. There was human waste, horse waste, and waste from tanneries, slaughterhouses and other slatternly industries, all of which was piling up on each other. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] inherited the throne in 1762 and recognized the social concerns her empire was facing, such as the drastic increase in pollution and decrease in living standards. In 1767, her government decreed that the polluting factories, slaughterhouses, fish markets, and cemeteries be removed from the city, that it was illegal to pollute the waterways, and that dumps be established. Her goal in this was to westernize Moscow as well as St. Petersburg. She contended that by eliminating the foul smells associated with the city, the health of the inhabitants would improve; during the 18th century, the theory of miasma (that disease came from bad smells) was prevalent. By moving the factories out of the city proper, Catherine also ensured a dispersal of the peasants and serfs, whom the city considered to be the source of the putrefaction, and therefore bring the source of the disease outside the city as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John T. |last=Alexander |title=Catherine II, Bubonic Plague, and the Problem of Industry in Moscow |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |year=1974 |pages=637–71 |jstor=1867892 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As her memoires indicate, Catherine herself saw the stench and filth of the city as evidence of its being rooted in the past, before Russia became westernized.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;  She hated Moscow, and before the plague outbreak, Moscow had no formal boundaries, there was no population count, and no real city planning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  This lack of planning was also evidenced by the fact that the city was mostly still built from wood, despite the government urging change to stone structures in this department. While there were some stone buildings, they tended to be located in the center of the city, and the use of stone showed no real sign of spreading.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  There were fires, there was a high crime rate, the filth was unimaginable; the state of the city was a set up for disaster. Catherine attempted to fix these problems through pardons, case reviews, creating jobs for the unemployed and homeless, and strengthening the local government.

Despite her efforts to change the city, Catherine found herself facing an outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]] in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1770. The plague was somewhat of a constant threat in early modern Europe; no one could be sure where or when it would strike. In 1765, rumors circulated that the plague had traveled north from the [[Ottoman Empire]] into [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book |first=John T. |last=Alexander |title=Bubonic Plague in Early Modern Russia: Public Health and Urban Disaster |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-8018-2322-6 |pages=19–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same rumors echoed over the course of the next year, with the plague also supposedly appearing in Constantinople and the Crimea. There was a false alarm of the plague entering Russian territory, and another false alarm of supposed plague around Moscow that turned out to be smallpox. There were efforts made to keep plague out of Russia by creating quarantine stations on the southern border, but these proved to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

In December 1770, a Doctor A. F. Shafonskiy, the chief physician at the Moscow General Hospital, identified a case of the bubonic plague and promptly reported it to German doctor A. Rinder, who was in charge of the public health of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexander |last=Melikishivili |title=Genesis of the Anti-Plague System: The Tsarist Period |journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology |volume=32 |year=2006 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |doi=10.1080/10408410500496763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, Rinder did not trust the former’s judgment, and ignored the report. The next day, the Medical Council met and established the fact that the plague had entered the city, and informed the Senate in St. Petersburg. The response of the national government was to send military guards to the hospital in order to quarantine the cases. However, Shafonskiy and Rinder continued to stand on opposing sides, until Rinder denied Shafonskiy’s claim in January 1771. Shafonskiy submitted a report in February, arguing his case, but the officials chose to believe the German doctor instead. In March, there were definitive signs of the disease, and so Moscow’s government began implementing the established procedures, including setting up field hospitals. In June 1771, Rinder died after contracting the disease from a patient, and by September, the city was in the worst shape yet: the plague had peaked. 20,401 people died in that month alone, and roughly three quarters of Moscow’s population fled the city.&lt;ref&gt;Melikishivili, "Genesis of the Anti-Plague System," 19-31&lt;/ref&gt;  Authorities tried to stop the spread of the disease, but the poor were terrified of the destruction of their contaminated homes, and so hid dead bodies. This was likely one of the reasons that, in the aftermath, Catherine ordered the removal of all cemeteries from city centers and out to the borders and suburbs.

The despair of this month led to the Plague Riots, an uprising against the government and their failed methods of protecting the citizens.

==Riot==

{{main article|Plague Riot}}

The plague peaked in September 1771, killing an estimated thousand muscovites a day (20,401 confirmed dead in September), despite the fact that an estimated three quarters of population fled the city.&lt;ref name=M25/&gt; Many deaths escaped the statistics: residents, fearing that the infested properties would be destroyed by authorities, routinely concealed the casualties, burying the dead at night or simply throwing them on the streets. Authorities set up [[chain gang]]s of prisoners to collect and bury the bodies, but their forces were insufficient even for this single task.

Governor Saltykov, failing to control the situation, preferred to desert his station and fled to his country estate; the police chief followed suit.&lt;ref name=GO/&gt; [[Jacon Lerche]], the newly appointed sanitary inspector of Moscow, declared state of emergency, shutting down shops, inns, taverns, factories and even churches; the city was placed under quarantine. Masses of people, literally thrown into the streets, were denied their regular trade and recreation habits.&lt;ref name=M25/&gt; On September 15, 1771, Moscow residents revolted against the authorities. The mob perceived any emergency measures of the state as a conspiracy to spread the disease. In particular, [[archbishop]] Amvrosy, who removed a revered icon from the public to curtail transmission of the disease by worshippers, was accused of conspiracy, hunted down and killed as "enemy of the people". Active rioting continued for three days; the remaining unrest was finally subdued by [[Grigory Orlov]] in the end of September.

==Emergency measures==

When the riot was still unwinding, empress Catherine dispatched [[Grigory Orlov]] to take control of Moscow; it is not clear whether her choice was an assignment in good faith or an attempt to get rid of a former lover and a leader of an influential political clan.&lt;ref name=GO/&gt; Orlov, accompanied by Gustav Orreus and four regiments of troops, arrived in Moscow on September 26, immediately calling an emergency council with local doctors. They confirmed presence of both bubonic and septicemic forms of plague.&lt;ref name=M25/&gt; Orlov established and supervised an executive medical commission charged with developing the ways to check the epidemic. More important, he succeeded in changing public opinion in favor of the state's emergency measures, at the same improving the efficiency and quality of medical quarantine (in particular, varying quarantine duration for different groups of exposed but yet healthy people, and paying them for the quarantine stay).&lt;ref name=M26&gt;Melikishvili, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The epidemic in Moscow, although still rampant in October, gradually reduced through the year. November 15 Catherine declared that it was officially over, but deaths continued into 1772. Estimates of total death toll in Moscow range from 52 to 100 thousand out of total 300 thousand.&lt;ref name=M26/&gt;

==Consequences==

The plague stimulated local research in disease prevention, which was boosted by discovering indigenous plague in newly conquered territories of the [[Caucasus]]. The epidemic was professionally exposed to Western European academia through ''An account of plague which raged in Moscow 1771'', published in 1798 in [[Latin language|Latin]] by Belgian physician [[Charles de Mertens]]; an English translation was released in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Mertens&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immediate political effect===

Devastation caused by the plague forced the government to reduce taxes and military conscription quotas in the affected provinces; both measures decreased the military capabilities of the state and pushed Catherine to seek [[truce]]. The statesmen divided between supporters of further pressing into Moldova and [[Walachia]] and those who sided with [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]]'s proposal to quit the war and take [[partitions of Poland|Polish territories]] as compensation: nearby Polish lands were seen as cash source while Moldova had to be ceded to the Turks anyway. Catherine preferred to suit both parties and engaged in the [[Partitions of Poland]] while the war in the South protracted until 1774.&lt;ref name=S3/&gt; Orlov, dismissed from the court, retired for a long tour of Europe.

===City planning===

In a move to control disease, authorities banned any burials on the traditional parish cemeteries inside the city of Moscow. Instead, they set up a chain of new cemeteries outside the city limits. This ring of cemeteries, established in 1771 ([[Vagankovo cemetery|Vagankovo]] and others) is mostly extant today; some were razed to make way for the new construction ([[Dorogomilovo|Dorogomilovo cemetery]]), some, also destroyed, are now public parks (Lazarevskoe cemetery). [[Rogozhskoye cemetery]], east of Moscow, became and remains a leading [[Old Believers]] shrine.

The '''AEI World Forum''' is an annual meeting of business and financial executives, [[head of government|heads of government]], government officials, and intellectuals. Held every spring in [[Sea Island, Georgia]], it is sponsored by the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI) and the Vail Valley Foundation, and it features a number of AEI scholars and fellows.&lt;ref name="Vail"&gt;Vail Valley Foundation, "[http://www.vvf.org/vvf/info/education.worldforum.aspx World Forum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609201039/http://www.vvf.org/vvf/info/education.worldforum.aspx |date=June 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:CheneyBeaverCreek.jpg|thumb|right|Vice President Cheney opens Gerald R. Ford Hall at the World Forum site in 2007.]]In 1976, U.S. president [[Gerald Ford]] hosted the [[2nd G7 summit|second G7 summit]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. During his presidency, Ford became close friends with three of the other heads of government present at the summit: British prime minister [[James Callaghan]], French president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], and German chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]]. After his presidency, Ford joined the American Enterprise Institute as its "Distinguished Fellow" and in 1982, he and his wife, [[Betty Ford]], hosted the first AEI World Forum near their home in Beaver Creek. Along with Callaghan, Giscard d'Estaing, and Schmidt, he hoped to enrich discourse among world leaders and explore crucial public policy issues in an intimate setting.&lt;ref&gt;American Enterprise Institute, [http://www.aei.org/publications/contentID.20061227161043762/default.asp In Memoriam: Gerald R. Ford, 1913-2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612102606/http://www.aei.org/publications/contentID.20061227161043762/default.asp |date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford hosted the World Forum until his death in 2006. At the twenty-sixth World Forum in 2007, Vice President [[Richard Cheney]] unveiled Gerald R. Ford Hall in the Beaver Creek Park [[Hyatt]] Hotel, where the World Forum's sessions are held.&lt;ref&gt;White House, [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/06/images/20070623_aeiyg9g8320-515h.html photo release], June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==

The AEI World Forum is private and [[Sub rosa|off the record]]. The World Forum consists of plenary sessions, topical small-group discussion sessions, informal conversational time, and recreational activities. According to the Vail Valley Foundation, "Senior U.S. cabinet officers and legislators provide candid briefings on important policy initiatives. Heads of major international corporations discuss business and financial developments. Government officials from Europe, Asia and the Americas debate international strategic and economic issues in a private, informal atmosphere, far removed from the distractions of day-to-day business."&lt;ref name="Vail" /&gt;

'''Alpine Unity''' was a three night [[New Year]] festival in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]. The first event took place in 2001 with two subsequent events taking place at [[Flock Hill, New Zealand|Flock Hill]], a high country station in [[Te Wai Pounamu]], the [[South Island]] of New Zealand. The largest event in 2002 had approximately 5000 attendees.

It was run as a limited liability company co-owned by Pacific Island Entertainment Ltd. and Middle Earth Productions Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzlbusiness.com/company/struck-off/Alpine-Unity-Limited&lt;/ref&gt;, until two of the Directors of the company and the festival were implicated in a drug bust in 2003&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_3535375"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3535375 |title=More court appearances after international party drugs bust |date=21 November 2003 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/237786 Big LSD bust threatens party]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6228">The {{Nihongo|''' Association of Returnees from China'''|中国帰還者連絡会|Chūgoku Kikansha Renraku Kai}}, often abbreviated to '''Chukiren''', was an organization formed on 24 September 1957 following the repatriation to Japan of soldiers from the former [[Imperial Japanese Army]] who were interned as war criminals in China's [[Fushun War Criminals Management Centre]], where interns were subjected to intensive indoctrination by the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. While the Chinese government chose to prosecute the top Japanese leadership, it [[repatriated]] accused lower-ranking soldiers to Japan.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Once in Japan, they gave testimony about their experience with crimes such as [[Unit 731]], [[comfort women]], and the [[Nanking Massacre]], but often received stringent opposition from Japanese nationalists and militarists, who proclaimed them to be communists or "brainwashed" by the Chinese communist government. Its members included [[Yoshio Shinozuka]], [[Yasuji Kaneko]], Tadayuki Furumi, and [[Ken Yuasa]]; the association was disbanded in 2002.

== Origins ==
1109 individuals were interned by the People's Republic of China, 969 in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre and 140 in the Taiyuan War Criminals Management Centre, on suspicion of having committed war crimes within China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Those held in Fushun had been captured in Manchuria by the USSR and after enduring [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|internment in Siberia]] were transferred to China in 1950. They included many Japanese soldiers as well as Chinese such as [[Puyi]] and [[Zhang Jinghui]]. Those held in Taiyuan included Japanese soldiers who after the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War had joined the Nationalists and fought against the communists during the [[Chinese Civil War]].

In contrast with their time in Siberia, Japanese POWs were given better treatment from the Chinese communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Towle|first=Philip|title=Japanese Prisoners of War|year=2003|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9781852851927|pages=170–171|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a long-term "crime recognition campaign" was imposed at the same time on those soldiers who were believed to have undertaken, supported, and witnessed Japan's numerous and inhumane criminal acts during the war. This involved them reflecting on their own actions up to then and confessing their sins voluntarily, a process later described by Chukiren's detractors as "[[brainwashing]]". During the campaign, some interns killed themselves. 

Under the authority of the "Decision of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] Concerning Punishment of Japanese Troops Who Invaded China" of April 1956, the trials of 45 leading war criminals were undertaken in extraordinary military tribunals set up in [[Shenyang]], [[Liaoning]], and [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]], between June and July. All the rest of the war crime suspects were pronounced at special courts within their internment centres to be exempt from prosecution and to be released immediately.

In 1957 some of these repatriated former war criminals whose sins were forgiven by the Chinese founded the Association of Returnees from China and launched an anti-war, pacifist movement and a campaign for Sino-Japanese friendship.

== Activities and criticism ==
At the heart of Chukiren's mission was exposing the foolishness of war, especially through testifying to the things that they themselves did in the war and on the battlefield. They were known for being very active in testifying about and cooperating with witnesses of things such as [[Unit 731]], [[Koreans in Japan#During World War II|forced labor recruitment of Koreans]], [[comfort women]], and the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Because of this, many of the returnees ended up being branded as "[[communism|red]]" regardless of their personal beliefs and experienced mistreatment in post-war Japan.

Writers such as Toshio Tanabe have also argued that the Japanese officers and men interned at Fushun were brainwashed by China.&lt;ref&gt;Toshio Tanabe, 検証 旧日本軍の「悪行」―歪められた歴史像を見直す (Tokyo: Jiyusha, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The returnees who gained their freedom thanks to China's lenient pardon when they should have been sentenced to a long-term or indefinite imprisonment or death were deeply grateful to the Chinese government, but they don't go so far as to deny the fact that China's true intention was that they, due to their ideological training, were useful people to be set free as disseminators of their ideas under a debt of gratitude to China for letting them off.&lt;ref&gt;NHK Special 「引き裂かれた歳月 ～証言記録 シベリア抑留～」 broadcast 8 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissolution ==
Due to the aging of its members, the Association of Returnees from China was disbanded as a national organization in 2002 and its work was carried on by the "Continuing the Miracle of Fushun Society" composed of younger activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japanfocus.org/-Lukasz-Zablonski/2973&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Benelux Racing League V6''', better known as '''BRL V6''', was a [[touring car racing]] series held in [[The Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] between 2004 and 2009. It is the heavier variant on the [[BRL Light]]. For 2010, BRL cars were allowed into the [[Dutch Supercar Challenge]].

==History==

===Original series===
The BRL V6 was first  launched, as the V6 Oval Series, in July 2003. Entrepreneur Harry Maessen founded the racing series and a test was conducted at his own racetrack, [[Raceway Venray|Circuit de Peel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nieuwe raceklasse krijgt vorm|journal=Peel en Maas|date=3 July 2003|page=3|url=http://peelenmaas.rooynet.nl/issue/PEM/2003-07-03/edition/0/page/3?query=mw%20v6&amp;sort=issuedate%20descending|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car made its competition debut in the [[Dutch Winter Endurance Series]] New Years race at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort]] 2004. Drivers [[Jeroen Reijntjes]] and [[Sandor van Es]] placed the car on pole position, but technical difficulties prevented a strong finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: Snel, spectaculair en betaalbaar: MW V6 Series|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/8916/snel-spectaculair-en-betaalbaar-mw-v6-series|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural season, 2004, featured four race weekends. The series competed at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]], [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]], Zandvoort and [[Motorsport Arena Oschersleben|Oschersleben]]. The initial calendar also featured oval races at [[Raceway Venray]] and a new to construct oval in the German [[Ruhr]]. These did not take place. [[Cor Euser]], racing a [[Jeff Gordon]] resembling paint scheme, won the first pole position. [[Donny Crevels]] and [[Duncan Huisman]] won the first two races at Spa.n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: Grote namen winnen debuutraces BRL (lang)|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/9547/grote-namen-winnen-debuutraces-brl-lang/4|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing heavy competition from Euser and [[Thomas Mutsch]], Crevels went on to win the inaugural season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MW V6 Series 2004 standings|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/brl-v6/2004/|website=DriverDB.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of competition went up the following year with [[Kurt Thiim]] and [[Jeroen Bleekemolen]] joining the series and [[Xavier Maessen]] and [[Marc Goossens]] making guest appearances. The BRL V6 field was joined by the '''BRL Light''' class. The class was the successor of the previous [[VEGE Series]] (2000-2004) and featured a less powerful [[Ford Duratec]] engine. For the inaugural BRL Light season the series kept their VEGE Series [[Ford Sierra]] bodywork before switching to a [[Ford Fiesta]] bodywork in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: BRL Light biedt jong talent mooie kans!|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/36/brl-light-biedt-jong-talent-mooie-kans|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleekemolen joined the [[US Carworld]] team as its sole full-time driver. The [[2004 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] driver won eleven out of fifteen races, dominating the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELF BRL-V6: Bleekemolen pakt de dubbel.

For 2006 a number of technical improvements were made to the car. The car received a softer compound of [[Hoosier Racing Tire|Hoosier]] slicks. Also cooling to the brakes was improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: BRL-V6 verder verbeterd en sneller|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/1798/brl-v6-verder-verbeterd-en-sneller|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Collé Racing]] domination started in 2006, lasting until the final season of the original season in 2009. Collé Racing driver Sandor van Es won the championship in 2006 before teammate [[Donald Molenaar]] won the series in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Early in the 2006 season Collé Racing faced stiff competition from Eurotech Racing drivers Marc Goossens and [[Danny van Dongen]] whom competed for podium finishes. The series also competed during the [[2006–07 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Netherlands|2006 A1GP weekend at Zandvoort]]. Prominent guest drivers joined the series, such as [[Junior Strous]] and [[Jan Lammers]]. Lammers scored a seventh place in the first race with Crevels winning both races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: Fantastische show voor uitverkocht circuit tijdens A1 GP weekend (lang)|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/2696/fantastische-show-voor-uitverkocht-circuit-tijdens-a1-gp-weekend-lang/|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BRL joined the [[2007 Belgian Champ Car Grand Prix|Belgian]] and [[2007 Bavaria Champ Car Grand Prix|Dutch]] rounds of the [[2007 Champ Car season]] at Zolder and Assen. Collé Racing continued reigning supreme in 2007 with Molenaar winning six races and Sandor van Es winning four races in the fourteen race season. The other four races were won by Bleekemolen (who ran a partial schedule) and Donny Crevels, two each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford BRL V6 2007 standings|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/brl-v6/2007/|website=DriverDB.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final races of the season, at Zandvoort, were marred by an incident involving 2005-2006 BRL Light champion [[Marijn van Kalmthout]]. During qualifying Van Kalmthout went off track in a yellow flag zone almost hitting a rescue vehicle and marshal. Van Kalmthout was disqualified for the remainder of the weekend. The disqualification had no effect on the championship standings were Van  Kalmthout remained third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: Marijn van Kalmthout verliest CAR-zaak Finaleraces|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/5105/marijn-van-kalmthout-verliest-car-zaak-finaleraces|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2008 the schedule was reduced to twelve races, with Molenaar again winning eight and the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL-V6 2008 standings|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/brl-v6/2008/|website=DriverDB.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Donny Crevels beat Collé Racing driver Sandor van Es for the second place in the championship. At first it was announced the series would race at [[Racepark Meppen]], also owned by series founder Harry Maessen, but the track was not built in time for the race weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL: Organisatie zoekt naar nieuwe datum en locatie voor raceweekend 29/30 augustus|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/11814/organisatie-zoekt-naar-nieuwe-datum-en-locatie-voor-raceweekend-2930-augustus|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch Supercar Challenge===
During the 2009 season it was announced that the BRL V6 series would cease to exist an independent racing series. The series joined the [[Dutch Supercar Challenge]] roster. The series formed a separate class in the Supersport I and GT field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DSC: Dutch Supercar Challenge ontwaakt uit winterslaap|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/12962/dutch-supercar-challenge-ontwaakt-uit-winterslaap/2|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the races in the Dutch Supercar Challenge had a semi-endurance set-up the BRL V6 cars were modified. The cars were fitted with more durable breaks and a larger fuel tank. The Hoosier tyres were replaced by [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] tyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL nieuws: 'BRL-V6 bereidt zich voor op seizoen 2010'|url=http://raceflash.blogse.nl/log/benelux-racing-league/brl-nieuws-brl-v6-bereidt-zich-voor-op-seizoen-2010.html|website=Raceflash.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teams did not remain in the new series and driver numbers dropped. Compared to previous season the championship battle was very tight. [[Niels Bouwhuis]] claimed the championship in the final round, beating Nelson van der Pol by seven points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch Supercar Challenge - BRL V6 2010 standings|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/dutch-supercar-challenge---brl-v6/2010/|website=DriverDB.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season the BRL V6 was no longer a separate class, but joined the Supersport I class. In the Supersport I class other cars competed such as the [[Porsche 997]] and the [[Aston Martin Vantage (2005)|Aston Martin Vantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch Supercar Challenge - Supersport 1 2011 standings|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/dutch-supercar-challenge---supersport-1/2011/|website=DriverDB.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raceway Venray===
{{see also|Raceway Venray}}

For 2011 Harry Maessen transformed the BRL V6 series into an oval racing series at his own [[Raceway Venray]]. Raceway Venray includes a half mile oval configuration the series used. The series returned to their soft Hoosier tyres. The series invited many [[Stock car racing in the United Kingdom|stock car]] regulars. Donald Molenaar, and Collé Racing, returned to the series. As [[Jacky van der Ende]] won eight races, and Molenaar seven, Van der Ende won the championship. Van der Ende repeated the feat in 2012. [[Renger van der Zande]] won the final championship series in 2013.

===MW-V6 Pickup Series===
{{see also|2014 MW-V6 Pickup Series}}

[[File:MWV6 Pick Up at Raceway Venray.jpg|250px|thumb|MWV6 Pick Up's on display at Raceway Venray]]
In 2014 Maessen sold the cars to the [[Acceleration 2014]] organisation. The cars were transformed into pick-up trucks with a rear-wing to provide more downforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOTO's: Acceleration komt met MW V6 Pick Up Series 2014|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/a1-grand-prix/foto-s-acceleration-komt-met-mw-v6-pick-up-series-2014/n/54465|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to small grids the series folded after one season. [[Danny van Dongen]], the only full-time driver in the series, was crowned champion. The cars were bought again by Harry Maessen and ran a demonstration event at Raceway Venray during the 2015 [[NASCAR Whelen Euro Series]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="De BRL is weer thuis!" vanaf 2016 spectaculaire pick-ups op Raceway Venray|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/ovalracing-venray/de-brl-is-weer-thuis-vanaf-2016-spectaculaire-pick-ups-op-raceway-venray/n/66705|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A calendar for the pick-up series at Assen and Meppen was announced. However, no races were run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRL V6 Pick-Up's vijf keer in actie in 2016, Assen en Meppen op kalender|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/brl-v6/brl-v6-pick-up-s-vijf-keer-in-actie-in-2016-assen-en-meppen-op-kalender/n/71570|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The car==
All the cars in this series are equal. They use the body of a [[Ford Mondeo]]. The [[chassis]] is developed by [[Weytech Technical Assistance]]. The motor is a [[Ford]] 4 L [[V6]]. It has 325 [[horsepower|hp]] and a torque of 440 [[N·m]]. The car as a weight of 925&amp;nbsp;kg. The series uses [[Hoosier Racing Tire|Hoosier]] slicks. They use [[Wilwood]] disk brakes.

==Formula BRL spin-off==
Series founder Harry Maessen purchased twelve [[Reynard Motorsports|Reynard]] 2KF chassis in 2006. Maessen fitted the former [[Formula Chrysler Euroseries]] cars with [[Ford]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Maessen kondigt aan: Formule BRL !|url=http://raceflash.blogse.nl/log/benelux-racing-league/harry-maessen-kondigt-aan-formule-brl.html|website=Raceflash.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, the [[2001 Formula Chrysler Euroseries]], champion, [[Ricardo van der Ende]] tested the renewed car at Zolder. The class ran demonstration races at the [[Rizla]] Racing Days at the TT Circuit Assen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Div: Harry Maessen wil in 2009 met Formule BRL in Dutch Power Pack; Ricardo van der Ende test wagen|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/5335/harry-maessen-wil-in-2009-met-formule-brl-in-dutch-power-pack-ricardo-van-der-ende-test-wagen|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was made up of young talent, such as [[Thomas Hylkema]] and  [[Henk Vuik, Jr.]], and experienced BRL racing names such as [[Barry Maessen]] and [[Henry Zumbrink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coureurs van de Formule BRL race in Assen|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/formule-brl/coureurs-van-de-formule-brl-race-in-assen/n/11768|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vuik, Jr. won the first race, before Hylkema and Maessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henk Vuik wint allereerste race Formule BRL|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/formule-brl/henk-vuik-wint-allereerste-race-formule-brl/n/11777|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second races was a rain spectacle with many drivers, in their first weekend racing the car, struggling in difficult circumstances. The 2003 [[List of Dutch &amp; Benelux Formula Ford champions|Dutch Formula Ford Zetec]] champion [[Nelson van der Pol]] won the second race.

Plans to race a full season in 2009, joining other national series, never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Div: Harry Maessen wil in 2009 met Formule BRL in Dutch Power Pack; Ricardo van der Ende test wagen|url=http://autosport.nl/klasse/nieuws/5335/harry-maessen-wil-in-2009-met-formule-brl-in-dutch-power-pack-ricardo-van-der-ende-test-wagen|website=Autosport.nl|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bad Day in Blackrock''''' is a 2008 novel by [[Kevin Power]]. The plot was loosely based on the real-life [[death of Brian Murphy]] that occurred in Dublin in 2000 as a result of a violent assault outside a nightclub.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;Irish Independent, 5 October 2008/Shock novel based on Anabel's tragic death&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The central protagonist is Richard Culhane, who comes from a wealthy south Dublin neighbourhood. He and his two friends, Stephen O’Brien and Barry Fox, all attended the (fictional) privately run Brookfield College, a secondary school which boasts of producing high-ranking politicians, judges and business leaders. They have now moved on from this and are embarking on university studies. All of the youths are also heavily involved in the Dublin rugby scene. Another of their former schoolmates and rugby teammates is Conor Harris, who was always considered something of an outsider. Both Culhane and Harris had been at one stage or another involved with the much-admired Laura Haines, another of the South Dublin privileged set. Her behaviour at the nightclub is the trigger that finally results in Culhane and his two friends assaulting and accidentally killing Harris.

The story is told in elliptical fashion, moving backward and forward across the span of the story and delving into each of the individuals’ character, background and possible motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Lilliput Press Edition Cover Notes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodreads/Bad Day in Blackrock rviews&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On release, the novel attracted some controversy because of its similarities to a real-life event. A close friend of the families involved was reported as saying that the novel was ‘insensitive’ and that ‘They're horrified and appalled to think that someone would drag up the case again just as the media interest was beginning to die down.’ Author Kevin Power stated that he did not research the Murphy case while writing the book. He was quoted as saying ‘I would hope they won't react badly. If you find something in a society that people aren't talking about, in a sense that is what fiction is for…it's not a question of trampling all over sensitivities, that's absolutely not my project here at all. So I would hope that no-one draws offence from anything I've done.’ &lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

==Critical response==
''Bad Day in Blackrock'' received widespread praise from the critics. Author John Boyne said in his [[Irish Times]] review: 'It's an excellent novel, there's no two ways about that. It comes from the gut, it's raw, it's passionate ... a compulsive read.' &lt;ref&gt;Irish Times Review 11 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;[[The Sunday Business Post]] review, by [[Dermot Bolger]] was similarly enthusiastic: This is a disturbing book and a truly fine one, when was the last time an Irish novel made us properly uncomfortable? This novel marks the debut of a deeply moral and probing writer - and a potentially great one.'&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Business Post October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Murphy in [[Hot Press]] called it ‘A powerful debut and one of the most exciting Irish novels in years.' Professor [[Frank McGuinness]] called it ‘a piercing contemporary novel’.&lt;ref&gt;Lilliput Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
''Bad Day in Blackrock'' was adapted into a film entitled ''[[What Richard Did]]'', which loosely follows the novel's storyline. The film was directed by [[Lenny Abrahamson]] and starred [[Jack Reynor]] as Richard Culhane. Like the book, the film version also attracted widespread critical acclaim and won five awards at the 10th Irish Film &amp; Television Awards.&lt;ref&gt;‘What Richard Did’ is Tribeca Bound/RTÉ 6 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish Film &amp; TV Industry News (IFTN) 11 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ballad of Dog's Beach''''' (in original Portuguese '''''Balada da Praia dos Cães''''') is a [[fiction]] [[novel]] by the Portuguese author [[José Cardoso Pires]], relating the investigation into the [[murder]] of a [[political dissident]], taking place around 1 one month later by 961. The novel is largely based on contemporary reports of a real murder that took place. The real story is the assassination in early 1961 of Army captain Almeida Santos by Jean Jacques, an Army m. d. They were both dissidents of the political regime who escaped from prison with the help of a prison guard. The three men took refuge in a house in Guincho Beach, twenty km outside Lisbon. They were joined by Maria José Maldonado Sequeira, a beautiful young woman who had an affair with A. Santos. While waiting for opportunity to leave the country, Maria José started a love affair with the two men, Santos e Jacques, which caused a fight between them and the death of Santos. Jacques buried him in the beach with the help of the guard. The body was discovered one month later by a dog whose owner was taking a walk.

'''''Basquiat''''' is a 1996 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Julian Schnabel]] based on the life of American [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]]/[[Neoexpressionism|neo expressionist]] artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. Basquiat, born in [[Brooklyn]], used his [[graffiti]] roots as a foundation to create [[collage]]-style paintings on canvas.

[[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] portrays Basquiat, and [[David Bowie]] plays Basquiat's friend and mentor [[Andy Warhol]]. Additional cast members include [[Gary Oldman]] as a thinly disguised Schnabel, [[Michael Wincott]] as the poet and art critic [[Rene Ricard]], [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Bruno Bischofberger]], [[Parker Posey]] as gallery owner [[Mary Boone]], [[Christopher Walken]] as a villainous journalist, and [[Claire Forlani]], [[Courtney Love]], [[Tatum O'Neal]], and [[Benicio del Toro]] in supporting roles as "composite characters".

The film was written by Schnabel and [[Michael Holman (filmmaker)|Michael Holman]], who was also credited for story development, with story by [[Lech Majewski]] and [[John Bowe (author)|John Bowe]]. Holman, a former member of theatrical rock group [[The Tubes]], had first met Basquiat in 1979 and together that year they founded an experimental, industrial/electronica group called Gray.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

== Plot ==

The film is a lightly fictionalised account of Basquiat's life. Initially a struggling artist living in a cardboard box in [[Tompkins Square Park]],&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115632/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis | title=Basquiat (1996)- Plot Summary | work=[[IMDb]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he works his way up the rungs of the New York art world in the eighties, thanks in part to his association with [[Andy Warhol]] ([[David Bowie]]), the art dealer [[Bruno Bischofberger]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), poet and critic [[René Ricard]] ([[Michael Wincott]]), and fellow artist Albert Milo ([[Gary Oldman]]).

Alongside the development of his artistic career, the film also follows Basquiat's tumultuous relationship with Gina ([[Claire Forlani]]), a fellow aspiring artist he meets whilst she is working as a waitress at a diner he frequents with his friend Benny ([[Benicio del Toro]]). Their romance is affected by Basquiat's affair with the so-called "Big Pink" ([[Courtney Love]]), a woman he picks up on the street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/basquiat | title=Basquiat - Reelviews Movie Reviews | work=James Berardinelli | publisher=Reelviews | accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his habitual abuse of heroin. Eventually, Basquiat finds himself isolated by his fame, the death of Warhol and his drug use. The film ends with a title card informing the audience that Jean-Michel Basquiat died of a heroin overdose on August 12, 1988, at the age of 27.

==Production==
===Schnabel's art in film===
As director, Schnabel inserted himself into the film by adding the fictional character, Albert Milo ([[Gary Oldman]]), who he based on himself. Schnabel also added [[cameo appearance]]s by his mother, father, and daughter (as Milo's family). Schnabel himself appeared as an extra as a waiter.

''Basquiat'' was the first commercial feature film about a painter made by a painter. Schnabel said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I know what it's like to be attacked as an artist. I know what it's like to be judged as an artist. I know what it's like to arrive as an artist and have fame and notoriety. I know what it's like to be accused of things that you never said or did. I know what it's like to be described as a piece of hype. I know what it's like to be appreciated as well as degraded."&lt;ref&gt;"Basquiat" Interview. Ingrid Sischy. ''ArtForum'' July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Basquiat died in 1988 of mixed-drug toxicity (he had been combining [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], known as "[[speedballing]]"). Basquiat's estate would not grant permission for his work to be used in the film. Schnabel and his studio assistant Greg Bogin created paintings "in the style of" Basquiat for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Rose interview with Julian Schnabel and David Bowie on the movie ''Basquiat''.

===Critical reception===
{{POV section|date=August 2012}}
The film received positive reviews from critics. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 70% rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/basquiat/ | title=Basquiat | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/basquiat | title=Basquiat reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]]. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960816/REVIEWS/608160301 Basquiat]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. August 16, 1996. Retrieved August 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "bold, attention-getting and more than a little facile, a stylish-looking film without the connective tissue to give it real depth."&lt;ref&gt;Janet Maslin, "Basquiat: A Postcard Picture of a Graffiti Artist" ''New York Times'', August 9, 1996. http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E07E4DF123EF93AA3575BC0A960958260&lt;/ref&gt;

"Directorial Debut Fails as Film, History"; review of ''Basquiat'', by Julian Schnabel, ''San Francisco Examiner'', August 16, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/08/16/WEEKEND8516.dtl | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=David | last=Bonetti | title=Basquiat' trivializes talented painter's life | date=April 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' said that "''Basquiat'' does not seem interested in anything that doesn't advance its director's personal agenda." The review stated that "Though as a writer-director, Schnabel's work is not the total fiasco the debut films of fellow artists [[David Salle]] (''[[Search and Destroy (film)|Search and Destroy]]'') and [[Robert Longo]] (''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'') were, it is fascinating to see what a compendium of Troubled Genius movie cliches he has turned out." Like several of the negative reviews, the review picked out for praise the acting of [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying "''Basquiat's'' only genuine inspiration was casting Jeffrey Wright, who won a [[Tony Award|Tony]] for his work in ''[[Angels in America]]'' on the New York stage, as the artist. An actor whose talent is visible even in this standard role, Wright's ability creates more interest in Basquiat's fate than would otherwise exist."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Turan. "Movie Reivew: ''Basquiat'': The Tortures of Creative Life"
''Los Angeles Times'', Friday August 9, 1996. http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960809-2,0,6464898.story&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviews in the art press focused more on the relation of Schnabel as director to his portrayal of Schnabel as artist in the film, and on changes to the facts of Basquiat's life introduced by Schnabel to make a more accessible film. In ''Art in America'', the art critic Brooks Adams wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Basquiat'' can be seen as a huge, lurking self-portrait of the artist-Schnabel, not Basquiat. So laden is the film with the innumerable coincidences of Basquiat and Schnabel's enthusiasms (among others, for pajamas and surfing) that the movie should be more appropriately called My Basquiat... To a remarkable degree, the movie succeeds, by dint of its authorial slant, in popularizing the myth of Basquiat as a young, gorgeous, doomed, yet ultimately transcendent black male artist, even as it extends and reinflates the myth of Schnabel as a protean, Picassoid white male painter... Yet for all one's apprehension about the very idea of Schnabel making such a film, Basquiat turns out to be a surprisingly good movie...It is also an art work.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks Adams. "Basquiat. - movie reviews" ''Art in America'', Sept, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the film was released, the actor Jeffrey Wright said that "I think my performance was appropriated, literally, and the way I was edited was appropriated in the same way his [Basquiat's] story has been appropriated and that he was appropriated when he was alive. [...] Julian made him out to be too docile and too much of a victim and too passive and not as dangerous as he really was. It's about containing Basquiat. It's about aggrandizing himself through Basquiat's memory."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phoebe Hoban]]. ''Basquiat: A Quick Killing in the Art World'' (second edition). Penguin Books. New York, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing Bowie's portrayal of Warhol to others who've portrayed Warhol prior, [[Paul Morrissey]] (who directed many films that Warhol produced) said "Bowie was the best by far. You come away from ''Basquiat'' thinking Andy was comical and amusing, not a pretentious, phony piece of shit, which is how others show him." He also noted that "Bowie at least knew Andy. They went to the same parties." Bowie was able to borrow Warhol's actual wig, glasses and jacket from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh for the film. Writer Bob Colacello, who edited Warhol's [[Interview magazine|''Interview'' magazine]] in the 70's and early 80's, said "[[Crispin Glover|[Crispin] Glover]] walked the most like [the real] Andy, [[Jared Harris|[Jared] Harris]] talked the most like Andy, and Bowie looked the most like Andy. When I first saw Bowie on the set, it was like Andy had been resurrected."&lt;ref name=PeopleReview&gt;{{Citation| last=Jewel| first=Dan| title=The Art of Being Andy | magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] | volume=46| issue=9| date=26 August 1996|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Delian League}}

The '''Battle of the Eurymedon''' was a double battle, taking place both on water and land, between the [[Delian League]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and her Allies, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Xerxes I]]. It took place in either 469 or 466 BC, in the vicinity of the mouth of the Eurymedon River (now the [[Köprüçay River|Köprüçay]]) in [[Pamphylia]], [[Asia Minor]]. It forms part of the [[Wars of the Delian League]], itself part of the larger [[Greco-Persian Wars]].

The Delian League had been formed between Athens and many of the city-states of the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] to continue the war with Persia, which had begun with the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first]] and [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second]] Persian invasions of Greece (492&amp;ndash;490 and 480&amp;ndash;479 BC, respectively). In the aftermath of the Battles of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]], which had ended the second invasion, the Greek Allies had taken the offensive, besieging the cities of Sestos and [[Byzantium]]. The Delian League then took over responsibility for the war, and continued to attack Persian bases in the Aegean throughout the next decade.

In either 469 or 466 BC, the Persians began assembling a large army and navy for a major offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, it is possible that the expedition aimed to move up the coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general [[Cimon]] took 200 [[triremes]] and sailed to [[Phaselis]] in [[Pamphylia]], which eventually agreed to join the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective.

Cimon then moved to pre-emptively attack the Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing into the mouth of the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet gathered there. Most of the Persian fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.

==Sources and chronology==
[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Thucydides, whose history provides many of the details of this period]]

Unfortunately, the military history of Greece between the end of the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] and the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431-404 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the ''pentekontaetia'' by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece.&lt;ref name = Fin16&gt;Finley, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Kag77&gt;Kagan, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporary with it, is Thucydides's ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account.&lt;ref name = Sea264&gt;Sealey, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fine336&gt;Fine, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin29&gt;Finley, pp. 29&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates.&lt;ref name = Sea248*&gt;Sealey, pp. 248&amp;ndash;250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fine343&gt;Fine, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.&lt;ref name = Sea248*/&gt;

Much extra detail for the period is provided by [[Plutarch]], in his [[Parallel Lives|biographies]] of [[Aristides]] and especially [[Cimon]]. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0182;query=chapter%3D%23241;layout=;loc=Them.%2026.1 Themistocles 25] has a direct reference to Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.137 I, 137]&lt;/ref&gt; In his biographies, he explicitly draws on many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that Thucydides's brief account omits. The final major extant source for the period is the universal history (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'') of the 1st century BC Sicilian, [[Diodorus Siculus]]. Much of Diodorus's writing concerning this period seems to be derived from the much earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]], who also wrote a universal history.&lt;ref name = Fine360&gt;Fine, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from what little we know of Ephorus, historians are generally disparaging towards his history.&lt;ref name = Fin29/&gt; Diodorus, who has often been dismissed by modern historians,&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; is therefore not a particularly good source for this period. Indeed, one of his translators, Oldfather, says of Diodorus's account of the Eurymedon campaign that "...the three preceding chapters reveal Diodorus in the worst light...".&lt;ref name = OldDSXI62&gt;Oldfather, note to Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.62 XI, 62]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a reasonable body of archaeological evidence for the period, of which inscriptions detailing probable tribute lists of the Delian League are particularly important.&lt;ref name = Sea264/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fine, pp. 357&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronology===
Thucydides provides a succinct list of the main events occurring between the end of the second Persian invasion and the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]], but almost no chronological information.&lt;ref name = Sea248&gt;Sealey, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts have been made to reassemble the chronology, but there is no definitive answer. The assumption central to these attempts is that Thucydides is describing the events in the appropriate chronological order.&lt;ref name = Fine344&gt;Fine, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; The one firmly accepted date is 465 BC for the beginning of the [[Delian League#Thasos|Siege of Thasos]]. This is based on an ancient scholiast's annotation of a copy of [[Aeschines]]'s works. The scholiast notes that the Athenians met disaster at the 'Nine-Ways' in the [[archon]]ship of Lysitheus (known to be 465/464 BC).&lt;ref name = Sea248*/&gt; Thucydides mentions this attack on the 'Nine-Ways' in connection with the beginning of the Siege of Thasos, and since Thucydides says that the siege ended in its third year, the Siege of Thasos therefore dates to c.465&amp;ndash;463 BC.&lt;ref name = Sea250&gt;Sealey, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battle of Eurymedon has been dated to 469 BC by Plutarch's anecdote about the Archon Apsephion (469/468 BC) choosing Cimon and his fellow generals as judges in a competition.&lt;ref name = PC8&gt;Plutarch, Cimon, 8&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that Cimon had recently achieved a great victory, and the most likely candidate is Eurymedon.&lt;ref name = Sea250/&gt; However, since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred after the Athenian [[Delian League#Naxos|siege of Naxos]] (but before the Siege of Thasos), the date of Eurymedon is clearly constrained by the date of Naxos. Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this Naxos,&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, note to Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0182;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23241;loc=Them.%2024.1 Themistocles, 25]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Kag45&gt;Kagan, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC.&lt;ref name = Fine338*&gt;Fine, pp. 338&amp;ndash;342.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred before Thasos, the alternative date for this battle would therefore be 466 BC.&lt;ref name = Fine338*/&gt; Modern historians are split, some supporting 469 BC as the most likely date,&lt;ref name = Sea250/&gt;&lt;ref name = Kag47&gt;Kagan, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk132/&gt; and others opting for 466 BC.&lt;ref name = h363&gt;Holland, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fine345&gt;Fine, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Delian League|Wars of the Delian League}}

The Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]], and in particular [[Ionia]], by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Cyrus the Great]] shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a [[tyrant]] in each Ionian city.&lt;ref name = h147&gt;Holland, pp. 147&amp;ndash;151.&lt;/ref&gt; While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline.&lt;ref name = fine&gt;Fine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NjeM0kcp8swC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Ionian+revolt#PPA272,M1 pp. 269&amp;ndash;277.]&lt;/ref&gt; By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of [[Miletus]], [[Aristagoras]]. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy.&lt;ref name = V35&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23804;layout=;loc=5.34.1 V, 35]&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed [[Doris (Asia Minor)|Doris]] and [[Aeolis]], beginning the [[Ionian Revolt]].&lt;ref name = h155&gt;Holland, pp. 155&amp;ndash;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|Map showing main events of the Ionian Revolt and the Persian invasions of Greece]]

The Greek states of [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of [[Sardis]].&lt;ref name = h160&gt;Holland, pp. 160&amp;ndash;162.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the Ionian Revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king [[Darius the Great]] decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt.&lt;ref name = h175&gt;Holland, pp. 175&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref name = h175/&gt;

In the next two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, including some of the most famous battles in history. During the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first invasion]], [[Thrace]], [[Macedon]] and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed.&lt;ref name = h183&gt;Holland, pp. 183&amp;ndash;186.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]].&lt;ref name = h187&gt;Holland, pp. 187&amp;ndash;194.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son [[Xerxes I]].&lt;ref name = h202&gt;Holland, pp. 202&amp;ndash;203.&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes then led the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion]] personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece.&lt;ref name = h240&gt;Holland, pp. 240&amp;ndash;244.&lt;/ref&gt; Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]] on land and at sea respectively.&lt;ref name = h276&gt;Holland, pp. 276&amp;ndash;281.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Greece except the [[Peloponnesus]] thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]].&lt;ref name=h320&gt;Holland, pp. 320&amp;ndash;326.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the [[Battle of Plataea]], ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.&lt;ref name=h342&gt;Holland, pp. 342&amp;ndash;355.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, on the same day as Plataea, the Allied fleet defeated the demoralised remnants of the Persian fleet in the [[Battle of Mycale]].&lt;ref name=h357&gt;Holland, pp. 357&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt; This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, [[Greco-Persian Wars#Greek counterattack (479–478 BC)|the Greek counterattack]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them.&lt;ref name = TI89&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%2389;layout=;loc=1.88.1 I, 89]&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied fleet then sailed to the [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonesos]], still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of Sestos.&lt;ref name = IX114&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231570;layout=;loc=9.115.1 IX, 114]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of [[Byzantium]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]). The siege was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] alienated many of the Allies, and resulted in Pausanias's recall.&lt;ref name = TI95&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%2395;layout=;loc=1.94.1 I, 95]&lt;/ref&gt; The siege of Byzantium was the last action of the Hellenic alliance that defeated the Persian invasion.

[[Image:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Athens and her empire in 431 BC. The Athenian Empire was the direct descendant of the Delian League]]

After Byzantium, Sparta was eager to end her involvement in the war.&lt;ref name = TI95/&gt; The Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible.&lt;ref name = h362&gt;Holland, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; The loose alliance of city states that fought against Xerxes's invasion was dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league. With the Spartan withdrawal, the leadership of the Greeks now explicitly passed to the Athenians.&lt;ref name = TI95/&gt;&lt;ref name = h362/&gt; A congress was called on the holy island of [[Delos]] to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians.  This alliance, now including many of the Aegean islands, was formally constituted as the 'First Athenian Alliance', commonly known as the [[Delian League]]. According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to "avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king."&lt;ref name = TI96&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%2396;layout=;loc=1.95.1 I, 96]&lt;/ref&gt; Forces of the Delian League spent much of the next decade expelling the remaining Persian garrisons from [[Thrace]], and expanding the Aegean territory controlled by the League.&lt;ref name = h362/&gt;

==Prelude==
Once the Persian forces in Europe had largely been neutralised, the Athenians seem to have gone about starting to extend the League in Asia Minor.&lt;ref name = PC12&gt;Plutarch, Cimon, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk133&gt;Cawkwell, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The islands of Samos, Chios and Lesbos seem to have become members of the original Hellenic alliance after Mycale, and presumably were also therefore original members of the Delian League.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231562;layout=;loc=9.105.1 IX, 106]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear exactly when the other Ionian cities, or indeed the other Greek cities of Asia Minor, joined the league, though they certainly did at some point.&lt;ref name = Sea247&gt;Sealey, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides attests the presence of Ionians at Byzantium in 478 BC, so it is possible that at least some of the Ionian cities joined the league in early 478 BC.&lt;ref name = Fine332&gt;Fine, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenian politician [[Aristides]] was said to have died in [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Aristides, 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt;

Cimon's Eurymedon campaign itself seems to have begun in response to the assembly of a large Persian fleet and army at Aspendos, near the mouth of the Eurymedon River.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt; It is usually argued that the Persians were the would-be aggressors, and that Cimon's campaign was launched to deal with this new threat.&lt;ref name = Fine344&gt;Fine, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt;&lt;ref name = Pow19&gt;Powell, p. 19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt; Cawkwell suggests that the Persian build-up was the first concerted attempt to counter the activity of the Greeks since the failure of the second invasion.&lt;ref name = Cawk132/&gt; It is possible that internal strife within the Persian empire had contributed to the length of time it took to launch this campaign.&lt;ref name = Cawk132&gt;Cawkwell, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Cawkwell outlines the Persian strategic problems: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Persia was a land power which used its naval forces in close conjunction with its armies, not free ranging in enemy waters. In any case, secure naval bases were necessary. In the Ionian Revolt with land forces already operating in Ionia and elsewhere along the Aegean seaboard, it was easy for a Royal army and navy to deal with the revolt, but in view of the general revolt of the [Ionian] cities in 479 BC and the subsequent successes of the Greek navies the only way for Persia must have seemed to be to move along the coast restoring order in city after city, with fleet and army moving together."&lt;ref name = Cawk135&gt;Cawkwell, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The nature of naval warfare in the Ancient world, dependent as it was on large teams of rowers, meant that ships would have to make landfall every few days to resupply with food and water.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pp. 219&amp;ndash;220&lt;/ref&gt; This severely limited the range of an Ancient fleet, and essentially meant that navies could only operate in the vicinity of secure naval bases.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Cawkwell therefore suggests that the Persian forces gathered at Aspendos were aiming to move along the southern coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city, until eventually the Persian navy could begin operating in Ionia again.&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt; [[Alexander the Great]] would employ this strategy in reverse in winter of 333 BC. Lacking a navy with which to take on the Persians, Alexander settled instead for denying the Persian navy suitable bases, by capturing the ports of southern Asia Minor.&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt;

Plutarch says that upon hearing that the Persian forces were gathering at Aspendos, Cimon sailed from [[Cnidus]] (in [[Caria]]) with 200 triremes. It is highly likely that Cimon had assembled this force because the Athenians had had some warning of a forthcoming Persian campaign to re-subjugate the Asiatic Greeks. Certainly, no other league business would have required such a great force.&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt; Cimon may have been waiting in Caria because he expected the Persians to march straight into Ionia, along the Royal road from Sardis.&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt; According to Plutarch, Cimon sailed with these 200 triremes to the Greek city of [[Phaselis]] (in [[Lycia]]) but was refused admittance. He therefore began ravaging the lands of Phaselis, but with the mediation of the [[Chios|Chian]] contingent of his fleet, the people of Phaselis agreed to join the league. They were to contribute troops to the expedition, and to pay the Athenians ten [[attic talent|talent]]s.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt; The fact that Cimon pre-emptively sailed to and captured Phaselis suggests that he anticipated a Persian campaign to capture the coastal cities (as outlined  above).&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt; The presence of both army and navy at Aspendos may have persuaded him that there was to be no immediate assault on Ionia. By capturing Phaselis, the furthest east Greek city in Asia Minor (and just to the west of the Eurymedon), he effectively blocked the Persian campaign before it had begun, denying them the first naval base they needed to control.&lt;ref name = Cawk133/&gt; Taking further initiative, Cimon then moved to directly attack the Persian fleet at Aspendos.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;

==Opposing forces==
===Greek===
[[File:Model of a greek trireme.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Reconstructed model of a [[trireme]], the type of ship in use by both the Greek and Persian forces]]

According to Plutarch, the League fleet consisted of 200 [[trireme]]s. These were of the sleek Athenian ''aphract'' (deckless) design, originally developed by [[Themistocles]] primarily for ramming actions,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; although they had been modified by Cimon to improve their suitability for boarding actions.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;

The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines.&lt;ref name = L46&gt;Lazenby, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines,&lt;ref name=VII184&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.184 VII, 184]&lt;/ref&gt; and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes.&lt;ref name = L46/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Chios|Chian]] ships at the [[Battle of Lade]] also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 40&amp;ndash;45 soldiers&amp;mdash;triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; There were therefore probably around 5,000 [[hoplite]] marines with the League fleet.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;

===Persian===
Several different estimates for the size of the Persian fleet are given. Thucydides says that there was a fleet of 200 Phoenician ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source.&lt;ref name = Cawk134&gt;Cawkwell, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch gives numbers of 350 from [[Ephorus]] and 600 from [[Phanodemus]]. Furthermore, Plutarch says that the Persian fleet was awaiting 80 Phoenician ships sailing from Cyprus.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt; Although Thucydides's account is generally to be favoured, there may an element of truth in Plutarch's assertion that the Persians were awaiting further reinforcements; this would explain why Cimon was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no estimates in the ancient sources for the size of the Persian land army. However, the number of Persian marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of Greek marines (c. 5,000), since the Persian ships carried the same complement of troops.&lt;ref name=VII184/&gt; Plutarch quotes Ephorus as saying that [[Tithraustes]] was commander of the royal fleet, and [[Pherendatis]] of the infantry, but says that Callisthenes named Ariomandes as overall commander.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt;

==Battle==
Thucydides gives only the barest of details for this battle; the most reliable detailed account is given by Plutarch.&lt;ref name = OldDSXI62/&gt; According to Plutarch, the Persian fleet was anchored off the mouth of the Eurymedon, awaiting the arrival of 80 Phoenician ships from Cyprus. Cimon, sailing from Phaselis, made to attack the Persians before the reinforcements arrived, whereupon the Persian fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when Cimon continued to bear down on the Persians, they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, the Persian battle line was quickly breached, and the Persian ships then turned about, and made for the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt; Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the naval battle, but it seems likely that most were able to land.&lt;ref name = Cawk134/&gt;

The Persian army now began to move towards the Greek fleet, which had presumably also grounded itself in order to capture the Persian ships. Despite the weariness of his troops after this first battle, Cimon, seeing "that his men were exalted by the impetus and pride of their victory, and eager to come to close quarters with the Barbarians", landed the marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt; Initially the Persian line held the Athenian assault, but eventually, as at the [[Battle of Mycale]], the heavily armoured hoplites proved superior, and routed the Persian army. Fleeing back to their camp, the Persians were then captured, along with their camp, by the victorious Greeks.&lt;ref name = PC13&gt;Plutarch, Cimon, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides says that 200 Phoenician ships were captured and destroyed.&lt;ref name = TI100&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.100 I, 100]&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly unlikely that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale.&lt;ref name = Cawk134/&gt; Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled.&lt;ref name = PC12/&gt; It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies).&lt;ref name = Cawk134/&gt; Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, but it is not clear that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.

Plutarch says that, following his double victory, "though like a powerful athlete he had brought down two contests in one day...Cimon still went on competing with his own victories."&lt;ref name = PC13/&gt; Cimon supposedly sailed with the Greek fleet as quickly as possible to intercept the fleet of 80 Phoenician ships the Persians had expected. Taking them by surprise, he captured or destroyed the entire fleet.&lt;ref name = PC13/&gt; However, Thucydides does not mention this subsidiary action, and some have cast doubt on whether it actually happened.&lt;ref name = Cawk134/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Wars of the Delian League}}

According to Plutarch, one tradition had it that the Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in the aftermath of the Eurymedon.&lt;ref name = PC13/&gt; However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC.&lt;ref name = Fine363&gt;Fine, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king ''acted'' as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again.&lt;ref name = PC13/&gt; It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.&lt;ref&gt;see Cawkwell, pp. 137&amp;ndash;138, note 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eurymedon was a highly significant victory for the Delian League, which probably ended once and for all the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h363&gt;Holland, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; It also seems to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cawkwell, pp. 132&amp;ndash;134.&lt;/ref&gt; The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, pp. 22&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Cimon's massive victory, something of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks do not appear to have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way.&lt;ref name = Fine345&gt;Fine, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the [[Delian League#Thasos|revolt in Thasos]] meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League.&lt;ref name = Fine345/&gt; Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half.&lt;ref name = PC13/&gt; The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity.&lt;ref name = PC13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, pp. 19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt; The next major Delian League campaign against the Persians would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This [[Wars of the Delian League#Egypt|campaign]] would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.&lt;ref name = TI110&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23110;layout=;loc=1.109.1 I, 110]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Falla Crema.jpg|160px|thumb|Cremà of a falla in [[Denia]] (Alicante).]]

The '''cremà''' ([[Valencian]] for "burning") is the act of setting fire to a [[falla monument]], made from materials such as cardboard and wood, during the festivities of several towns in the [[Valencian community]], [[Spain]]. A similar celebration is the [[Bonfires of Saint John]] from [[Alicante]], also in the Valencian community. In all cases the celebration ends with the burning of the monuments.

In the city of [[Valencia]], where this kind of celebration originated, the cremà of each falla is held on the night of [[Saint Joseph]]'s Day, March 19. It consists in burning the monuments erected on the Valencian streets on March 15. The ceremony is preceded by fireworks which are lit by the commission "fallera mayor". Firstly, around 10&amp;nbsp;p.m., the child monument is set on fire and at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. the prize winning falla of the special section is also set on fire. After that, the main monument is burnt at midnight and after half an hour the 1st prize winner of the special section in this category is burnt too. Finally, at 1a.m. the institutional falla monument, which doesn't take part in the competition, is set on fire in the Town Hall Square.

The cremà also takes place for the [[Bonfires of Saint John]], which are lit in [[Alicante]]. It takes place on June 24 and 25 by night, one day after [[St. John's Eve]]. The participants usually cry out to the firemen that supervise the fire to be soaked because of the summer heat and the fire; when they start doing it with hoses begins the Banyà. In Alicante the cremà starts at midnight from the [[Castillo de Santa Bárbara|castle of Santa Bárbara]] and it continues until 4a.m.

In all these celebrations it is usual to burn the monument with a ''traca'' (a wick lined with firecrackers that explode quickly one after another) and lately with fireworks too. Then the monument is set on fire to the beat of folk songs. In order to prevent all the monuments burning down at the same time, they are usually set on fire at different hours, depending on the prize they have won.

'''Dean Faiello''' (born August 31, 1959) is an American criminal currently imprisoned at [[Attica Correctional Facility]] after being found responsible for the April 2003 death of Maria Cruz, to whom he had represented himself as a [[dermatologist]]. Faiello held neither a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] nor a [[Medical license|license to practice medicine]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Faiello was raised in [[Madison, New Jersey]], where he graduated from [[Madison High School (New Jersey)|Madison High School]] in 1977 (and was voted "most likely to succeed" by his classmates).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Andrew. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/nyregion/25doctor.html "Fake Doctor Is Back in U.S. and Facing Murder Charge"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 25, 2005. Accessed March 11, 2011. "Raised in Madison, N.J., Mr. Faiello had worked in construction before getting a job at a day spa, where he became skilled at hair removal and developed an impressive clientele."&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled in [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1977, but left without graduating.

===Career===
Faiello had worked in construction before getting a job at a day spa, where he became skilled at hair removal. In 1996, he began his own practice, SkinOvations, from an office on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]]. (He later moved to an office on 133 East 73rd Street, then to an office at 117 East 18th Street in [[Gramercy, Manhattan|Gramercy Park]].) The [[Day spa|medical spa]] offered [[Intense pulsed light|blood vessel removal]], [[electrolysis]], [[laser hair removal]], laser skin treatments, [[Tattoo#Tattoo removal|tattoo removal]], and [[facial]]s.

In 1998, Faiello was charged with [[Possession (law)|possession]] of a [[controlled substance]], [[forgery]] and possession of a forged instrument. He pleaded guilty to a [[misdemeanor]] count of possession of a forged instrument and was sentenced to three years' [[probation]]. Faiello claimed on his professional website to hold a [[Master of Science]] degree from RPI and the credential of [[Certified Professional Electrologist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skinovations.com/hairRemoval.html |title=SkinOvations - Laser Hair Removal |accessdate=2008-07-18 |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303020427/http://www.skinovations.com/hairRemoval.html |archivedate=2000-03-03 |quote=Our Chief Laserist, Dean A. Faiello, C.P.E., has a master of science in engineering from RPI... |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite it lapsing in 1998 after he failed to earn [[continuing education unit]]s required to maintain certification.

On October 6, 2002, the ''[[New York Post]]'' published an investigation into Faiello titled "He'll Make Your Skin Crawl". He was arrested two days later on three counts of practicing medicine without a license, but was released on bail with the condition that he not continue to treat patients. Faiello subsequently began to see patients out of an apartment at 115 West 16th Street.&lt;ref name="workingafterarrest"&gt;{{cite news |first=Shaila K.; Janon Fisher and Adrienne Lu |last=Dewan |title=Fake Doctor Kept Working After Arrest |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/20/nyregion/fake-doctor-kept-working-after-arrest.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruz death===
On April 13, 2003, [[Filipino people|Filipino-American]] investment banker Maria Cruz had an appointment with Mr. Faiello for laser treatment of [[black hairy tongue]]. She went into [[Seizure|convulsions]] after he injected [[lidocaine]] into her tongue; Faiello contacted an acquaintance who was a physician and was told to rush Cruz to an emergency room. Instead of seeking immediate medical aid, Faiello took Cruz's body in a large suitcase to his home (which formerly belonged to the internationally known opera singer [[Maria Jeritza]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/06/burrough200406?currentPage=2 ''Nightmare on Elwood Avenue''] from ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in the  [[Forest Hill, Newark, New Jersey|Forest Hill]] neighborhood of [[Newark, New Jersey]] and buried her under the garage.&lt;ref name="plead"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anemona |last=Hartocollis |title=Manhattan: Fake Doctor Pleads Guilty in Patient's Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/nyregion/17mbrfs-001.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was found on February 18, 2004.&lt;ref name="workingafterarrest"/&gt;

Faiello fled the country in September 2003, entering [[Costa Rica]] on a three-month visa. He was arrested on February 26, 2004 at a resort in northwestern Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shaila K.; Steven Barry and Tim Rogers |last=Dewan |title=Fake Doctor Is Arrested in Costa Rica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/27/nyregion/fake-doctor-is-arrested-in-costa-rica.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned in Costa Rica and fought [[extradition]], but was ultimately returned to the United States in May 2005 and charged with [[Murder#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]] in the death of Ms. Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Jacobs |title=Fake Doctor Is Back in U.S. And Facing Murder Charge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/nyregion/fake-doctor-is-back-in-us-and-facing-murder-charge.html |work=New York Times |date=2005-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered a [[Plea bargain|plea agreement]] by pleading guilty to first degree [[Assault (tort)|assault]] in exchange for a 20-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="plead"/&gt;

'''''Death and the Maiden''''' is a 1990 play by Chilean playwright [[Ariel Dorfman]]. The world premiere was staged at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London on 9 July 1991, directed by [[Lindsay Posner]]. It had one reading and one workshop production prior to its world premiere.

== Characters ==
* Paulina Salas — 38 years old
* Gerardo Escobar — her husband, a lawyer, around forty-five
* Roberto Miranda — a doctor, around fifty

The time is the present and the place, a country that is probably [[Chile]] but could be any country that has given itself a democratic government just after a long period of dictatorship.

== Synopsis ==
Paulina Salas is a former political prisoner in an unnamed [[Latin American]] country who had been [[rape]]d by her captors, led by a [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] doctor whose face she never saw. The rapist doctor played [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|String Quartet No. 14]], subtitled ''Death and the Maiden'', during the act of rape; hence the play's title.

Years later, after the (also unnamed) repressive regime has fallen, Paulina lives in an isolated country house with her husband, Gerardo Escobar. When Gerardo comes back from a visit to the president, he gets a flat tire. A stranger named Dr. Miranda stops to assist him. Dr. Miranda drives Gerardo home and later in the night he returns. Paulina recognizes Miranda's voice and mannerism as that of her rapist, and takes him captive in order to put him on trial and extract a confession from him.

Unconvinced of his guilt, Gerardo acts as Roberto Miranda's lawyer and attempts to save his life. After hearing the full story of her captivity from Paulina, Gerardo formulates a confession with Roberto to appease Paulina's madness and set her free from her past.

Paulina records the entire confession and has Roberto write it out and sign it. She sends Gerardo out to get Roberto's car so he can go home. While they are alone for the last time, Paulina accuses Roberto of being unrepentant and guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Throughout the play it is uncertain whether details are evidence of Roberto's guilt or Paulina's paranoia.  At the end of the play it is unclear who is innocent.

[[Theresa May]] formed the '''first May ministry''' on 13 July 2016, after having been invited by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to form a new government. Then the [[Home Secretary]], May's appointment followed the resignation of then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref name="BBC16J"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36778350 | title=David Cameron says being PM 'the greatest honour' in final Downing Street speech | work=BBC News | date=13 July 2016 | accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GD13JUL"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister | title=Theresa May becomes Britain's prime minister | work=The Guardian | date=13 July 2016 | accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry, a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority government, succeeded the [[second Cameron ministry]] which had been formed following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. Cameron's government was dissolved as a result of his resignation in the immediate [[Aftermath of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|aftermath]] of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|June 2016 referendum]] on [[Brexit|British withdrawal]] from the [[European Union]]. 

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 snap general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with no party holding an overall majority, May announced her intention to form a [[Second May ministry|new]] [[minority government]] with support from the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (see [[Conservative–DUP agreement]]).&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=May to form 'government of certainty' with DUP backing |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40219030 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Formula Crane 45''' was a single-seater racing series held at [[Autopolis]] in 1991 and 1992.

==History==
Owner of the [[Autopolis]] circuit [[Tomonori Tsurumaki]] ordered 30 Buick powered US built single seater race cars called Sabre FC45 for a race to take place on his circuit's grand opening, on November 1990 consisting of a mixture of invited US [[Champ Car|CART]] drivers such as [[Stan Fox]], [[Johnny Rutherford]], [[Dick Simon]], [[Gary Bettenhausen|Gary]] and [[Tony Bettenhausen]], against local Japanese drivers. The cars were originally built for a [[spec racing]] class to have been run by [[United States Auto Club|USAC]]; however, this class was never realized. After the grand opening, Tsurumaki planned on a series with the cars, known as Formula Crane 45. With only a handful of cars during the 1991 and 1992 season the class was not very successful. When Autopolis went bankrupt the assets including the cars were sold to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formula Crane 45|url=http://www16.tok2.com/home/rhistory/other_fc45/mein.htm|work=Racing History Japan|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3777">The '''Argentine Formula Renault Championship''', formerly known as '''Formula Renault 2.0 Argentina''' and '''Formula Renault 1.6 Argentina''', is an [[open wheel racing]] series founded in 1980. It is based in [[Argentina]].

==Regulations==
Since 2010 the cars have been powered by a 2000cc [[Renault]] production engine. Prior to this (from the series' inception in 1980 to 2009) the cars were powered by a 1600cc [[Renault]] production engine. Tito is currently the only [[chassis]] make allowed. Similar Tito 02 cars are used in the [[Chilean Formula Three Championship]].

Tyres are allocated to each driver in sets of 4 at each race meeting.

==Champions==
All champions were Argentine-registered.

George Donner was born circa 1784 near [[Old Salem|Salem, North Carolina]]. He was the third child and eldest son of George Donner (circa 1752-1844) and Mary Huff (circa 1755-1842). George had three sisters and three brothers, one of whom, Jacob (circa 1789-1846), accompanied him to California as did George's third wife, [[Tamsen Donner]]. &lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1790," database with images, ''FamilySearch'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHK1-Y7F&lt;/nowiki&gt; : accessed 20 August 2018), George Donner, Rowan, North Carolina, United States; citing p. 304, NARA microfilm publication M637, (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.), roll 7; FHL microfilm 568,147.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1810," database with images, ''FamilySearch'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XH2P-Q8Y&lt;/nowiki&gt; : accessed 20 August 2018), George Donnor, Nicholasville, Jessamine, Kentucky, United States; citing p. 36, NARA microfilm publication M252 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.), roll 7; FHL microfilm 181,352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donner Party==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Before emigrating westward, George Donner lived just outside [[Springfield, Illinois]]. On April 14, 1846, he, his brother Jacob, and [[James F. Reed]], along with their families and hired hands, set out for [[California]] in covered wagons as part of the Boggs Company. Three months later, at the [[Little Sandy Crossing (Wyoming)|Little Sandy River]] in Wyoming, George was chosen to lead the group, now known as the [[Donner Party|Donner-Reed Party or Donner Party]]. The Donner Party took the [[Hastings Cutoff]] through the [[Wasatch Mountains]] in [[Utah]] and crossed the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]], rejoining the [[California Trail]] west of [[Elko, Nevada]]. They arrived at the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] late in the season and were trapped by snow on the eastern side of Truckee Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]) west of [[Truckee, California]]. &lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1840," database with images, ''FamilySearch''(&lt;nowiki&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHBJ-JWK&lt;/nowiki&gt; : 15 August 2017), George Donner, Sangamon, Illinois, United States; citing p. 31, NARA microfilm publication M704, (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.), roll 69; FHL microfilm 7,644.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
A rescue party was organized. However, when they arrived Jacob Donner was dead, and George Donner's arm had become [[gangrene|gangrenous]] from an injury to his hand sustained en route to the campsite, while repairing a broken wagon axle. The rescuers took George's daughters Elitha and Leanna, leaving George and his wife behind. The second and third rescue parties found George too weak to travel. When the fourth and last relief party arrived on April 17, 1847, they found George dead in his bed. Some other accounts of George's death indicate that his body had been mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmBe7YrhtpwC|title=Donner-Reed Tragedy|last=Davidson|first=Ted|date=2002-01-01|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9780595214716|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
The children of George Donner's first marriage stayed behind in Illinois, but those of his second marriage (Elitha and Leanna) and third marriage (Frances, Georgia, and Eliza) accompanied him to California. All five of them survived. 

*Elitha Cumi Donner (1831-1923) married Perry McCoon a few months after being rescued, at age 15. After McCoon's death she married Benjamin Wilder, with whom she had seven children. She lived most of her life on a ranch near [[Elk Grove, California]], where she died in 1923.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
*Leanna Charity Donner (1834-1930) lived with Elitha until her own marriage to John App in 1852. She and App had three children. Leanna lived out her life in [[Jamestown, California]] and died there in 1930. She lived to the age of 96 or 95.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
*Frances Eustis Donner (1840-1921) made her home with the [[James F. Reed]] family in [[San Jose, California]], for several years, then went to live with her older half-sister, Elitha. She married Elitha's brother-in-law, William Wilder. She and William had seven children and lived  in [[Byron, California]]. Frances died at her home there in 1921.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
*Georgia Anna Donner and Eliza Poor Donner were taken in by Christian and Maria Brunner (or Bruner) at [[Sutter's Fort]], then moved with them to [[Sonoma, California]] in late 1847. Eliza described their years with the Brunners in her book ''The Expedition of the Donner Party'' (1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donner, Eliza Poor|title=The Expedition of the Donner Party|location=Chicago|publisher= A.C. McClurg and Co.|date= 1911|url=http://www.sierracollege.edu/ejournals/jsnhb/v4n2/houghton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, the sisters went to live with Elitha and Benjamin Wilder.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
*Georgia Anna Donner (1841-1911) married Washington Babcock in 1863. They lived in [[Mountain View, California]] then moved to [[St. John, Washington]]. Georgia died in 1911.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
*Eliza Poor Donner (1843-1922) married [[Sherman O. Houghton]] in 1861. They had seven children and lived in [[San Jose, California]], except for four years where they lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], while Sherman served in Congress. They moved to [[Long Beach, California]] around 1885. Eliza died in 1922.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8074">The '''Golden Speech''' was delivered by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] in the Palace Council Chamber to 141 Members of the Commons (including the Speaker), on 30 November 1601. It was a speech that was expected to be addressing some pricing concerns, based on the recent economic issues facing the country. Surprisingly, she revealed that it would be her final Parliament and turned the mode of the speech to addressing the love and respect she had for the country, her position, and the Members themselves. It is the second such speech for which Queen Elizabeth I was noted, the first, the [[Speech to the Troops at Tilbury]], having been given to English forces in preparation for the [[Spanish Armada]]'s expected invasion. The Golden Speech has been taken to mark a symbolic end of Elizabeth's reign, one which is widely considered one of the Golden Eras of England's history. Elizabeth died 16 months later in March 1603 and was succeeded by her [[Cousin#1stTwiceRem|first cousin twice removed]], [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]].

==Origin of the name==

The 'Golden' label was first coined in "a version of the speech printed near the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Puritan interregnum]]"&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, Stephen, and M. H. Abrams, eds. The Norton Anthology of English Literature. 8th ed. Vol. 1. New York: varun doshi&amp;co.2050 Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
which bore a header beginning 'This speech ought to be set in letters of gold'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=323|title=Elizabeth’s ‘Golden Speech’ (1601)|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was to be reprinted time and time again up to the eighteenth century, whenever England was in danger, as the Golden Speech of Queen Elizabeth. 
Several versions survive, including a printed pamphlet which is thought to have been checked and corrected by Elizabeth herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/elizabeth1.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Queen Elizabeth I of England (b. 1533, r. 1558-1603) Selected Writing and Speeches|publisher=Modern History SourceBook|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

= The Speech = 

A different account by the diarist, [[Hayward Townshend]], who was among those kneeling before her that November afternoon in the Presence Chamber, is used in the text below.''"Mr Speaker,'' ...''We have heard your declaration and perceive your care of our estate. I do assure you there is no prince that loves his subjects better, or whose love can countervail our love. There is no jewel, be it of never so rich a price, which I set before this jewel: I mean your love. For I do esteem it more than any treasure or riches; for that we know how to prize, but love and thanks I count invaluable. And, though God hath raised me high, yet this I count the glory of my Crown, that I have reigned with your loves. This makes me that I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a Queen, as to be a Queen over so thankful a people. Therefore I have cause to wish nothing more than to content the subject and that is a duty which I owe. Neither do I desire to live longer days than I may see your prosperity and that is my only desire. And as I am that person still yet, under God, hath delivered you and so I trust by the almighty power of God that I shall be His instrument to preserve you from every peril, dishonour, shame, tyranny and oppression, partly by means of your intended helps which we take very acceptably because it manifesteth the largeness of your good loves and loyalties unto your sovereign.

''Of myself I must say this: I never was any greedy, scraping grasper, nor a strait fast-holding Prince, nor yet a waster. My heart was never set on any worldly goods. What you bestow on me, I will not hoard it up, but receive it to bestow on you again. Therefore, render unto them I beseech you Mr Speaker, such thanks as you imagine my heart yieldeth, but my tongue cannot express. Mr Speaker, I would wish you and the rest to stand up for I shall yet trouble you with longer speech. Mr Speaker, you give me thanks but I doubt me I have greater cause to give you thanks, than you me, and I charge you to thank them of the Lower House from me. For had I not received a knowledge from you, I might have fallen into the lapse of an error, only for lack of true information.

''Since I was Queen, yet did I never put my pen to any grant, but that upon pretext and semblance made unto me, it was both good and beneficial to the subject in general though a private profit to some of my ancient servants, who had deserved well at my hands. But the contrary being found by experience, I am exceedingly beholden to such subjects as would move the same at first. And I am not so simple to suppose but that there be some of the Lower House whom these grievances never touched. I think they spake out of zeal to their countries and not out of spleen or malevolent affection as being parties grieved. That my grants should be grievous to my people and oppressions to be privileged under colour of our patents, our kingly dignity shall not suffer it. Yea, when I heard it, I could give no rest unto my thoughts until I had reformed it. Shall they, think you, escape unpunished that have oppressed you, and have been respectless of their duty and regardless our honour? No, I assure you, Mr Speaker, were it not more for conscience' sake than for any glory or increase of love that I desire, these errors, troubles, vexations and oppressions done by these varlets and lewd persons not worthy of the name of subjects should not escape without condign punishment. But I perceive they dealt with me like physicians who, ministering a drug, make it more acceptable by giving it a good aromatical savour, or when they give pills do gild them all over.

''I have ever used to set the Last Judgement Day before mine eyes and so to rule as I shall be judged to answer before a higher judge, and now if my kingly bounties have been abused and my grants turned to the hurt of my people contrary to my will and meaning, and if any in authority under me have neglected or perverted what I have committed to them, I hope God will not lay their culps and offenses in my charge. I know the title of a King is a glorious title, but assure yourself that the shining glory of princely authority hath not so dazzled the eyes of our understanding, but that we well know and remember that we also are to yield an account of our actions before the great judge. To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it. For myself I was never so much enticed with the glorious name of a King or royal authority of a Queen as delighted that God hath made me his instrument to maintain his truth and glory and to defend his kingdom as I said from peril, dishonour, tyranny and oppression. There will never Queen sit in my seat with more zeal to my country, care to my subjects and that will sooner with willingness venture her life for your good and safety than myself. For it is my desire to live nor reign no longer than my life and reign shall be for your good. And though you have had, and may have, many princes more mighty and wise sitting in this seat, yet you never had nor shall have, any that will be more careful and loving.

'' 'For I, oh Lord, what am I, whom practices and perils past should not fear? Or what can I do? That I should speak for any glory, God forbid.' And turning to the Speaker and her councilors she said, 'And I pray to you Mr Comptroller, Mr Secretary and you of my Council, that before these gentlemen go into their countries, you bring them all to kiss my hand.' " ''

The '''January 2015 Greek legislative election''' was held in [[Greece]] on Sunday, 25 January, to elect all 300 members to the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in accordance with the [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]]. The election was held earlier than scheduled due to the failure of the Greek parliament to [[Greek presidential election, 2014|elect a new president on 29 December 2014]].&lt;ref name=aje29dec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/12/greece-parliament-fails-elect-president-20141229104433854668.html|title=Greece parliament fails to elect president |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

21 parties, 4 party coalitions and 1 independent candidate applied for participation in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmografos.com/permalink/23996.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kathimerini.gr/799176/article/epikairothta/politikh/21-kommata-kai--4-synaspismoi&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme court decided that 18 parties, 4 party coalitions could participate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/902098/areios-pagos-sunolika-18-kommata-kai-tesseris-sunaspismoi-stis-ekloges&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition of the Radical Left, [[SYRIZA]], won a legislative election for the first time ever, securing 149 out of the 300 seats, 2 seats short of an [[absolute majority]]. On the other hand, conservative and then-ruling [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] lost 53 seats and obtained its worst result ever in terms of seats won. Social-democratic [[PASOK]], ND's coalition partner, was reduced to just 13 seats (from 33 in 2012), falling to 7th place and becoming the last party to surpass the 3% threshold. [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] lost some support and was reduced by one seat to 17, yet became the 3rd political force in Greece thanks to the loss of support by  both PASOK and the nationalist conservative Independent Greeks party, [[ANEL]]. [[Stavros Theodorakis]]' newly-created [[The River (Greece)|To Potami]] party entered parliament with 17 seats and 6.1% of the vote. The [[Communist Party of Greece]] won 15 seats, 3 more than it had won in June 2012. [[DIMAR]], a former coalition partner until June 2013, failed to enter parliament after winning a mere 0.5% of the vote, insufficient to be eligible for seats.

[[Alexis Tsipras]] was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] on 26 January 2015, after reaching a [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|coalition agreement]] with ANEL.

Greece suffered three distinct [[Greek government-debt crisis|economic recessions]] in the turmoil of the [[Global Financial Crisis]] &lt;small&gt;(Q3-Q4 2007, Q2-2008 until Q1-2009, and Q3-2009 until Q4-2013)&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref name="Greek GDP data for 2005–2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/A0704/PressReleases/A0704_SEL84_DT_QQ_03_2014_01_E_EN.pdf |title=Quarterly National Accounts: 3rd Quarter 2014 (Flash Estimates) and revised data 1995 Q1-2014 Q2 |format=PDF |publisher=Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) |date=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114111915/http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/A0704/PressReleases/A0704_SEL84_DT_QQ_03_2014_01_E_EN.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with private markets becoming inaccessible as a lending source since May 2010 (due to a [[Debt-to-GDP ratio]] exceeding 146%), leaving the state to choose between accepting conditional [[Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|bailout funding]] from the Troika ([[Eurogroup]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and [[European Central Bank|ECB]]), or the path of a [[sovereign default]] along with being forced to leave the euro. The outgoing government chose to accept the offered conditional bailout funding, outlining a certain level of economic reforms, privatization and austerity to be achieved throughout the programme period from May 2010 until March 2016. In return, Greece was scheduled to receive: €245.6 billion of long-term bailout loans (with an interest rate [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]] until 2020), and Greece was also rewarded by private creditors accepting a debt restructuring deal - cutting of the debt burden of the state by €127.1 billion in 2012 - while also transforming the remaining debt pile from short-term bonds with high interest rates to long-term bonds with low interest rates.

The [[Cabinet of Antonis Samaras|incumbent government]] was formed after the [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|June 2012 election]] by [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK), and [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR). [[Antonis Samaras]] of New Democracy was Prime Minister. PASOK and DIMAR declined to participate in Samaras' cabinet, which was thus composed of New Democracy members and [[Independent (politics)|independents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18531604|title=Antonis Samaras announces cabinet|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2013, the government held 167 seats, down from 179 elected in the 2012 election.&lt;ref name="smallmaj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/8/58735 |title=Small majority for austerity raises big doubts |work=[[Athens News]] |date=24 March 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125051055/http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/8/58735 |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, nine were expelled for voting against austerity packages, and three left voluntarily.&lt;ref name="smallmaj" /&gt;

===Third bailout package===
{{main|Third bailout package (Greece)}}

In an interview with ''[[Bild]]'' on 10 February 2014, Samaras insisted that Greece did not need a new bailout, despite reports in Germany that the Greek Finance Ministry was working on a plan for one.&lt;ref name="samarasd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_10/02/2014_537226|title=Greece does not need third bailout, Samaras tells Bild|work=[[Kathimerini]]|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samarasd2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/articleview.php?id=5039|title=PM Samaras: Greece does not need a third bailout|agency=[[Athens-Macedonian News Agency]]|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Finance Ministry estimated that a third bailout (if established) would have a size between 10 and 20 billion euros.&lt;ref name="samarasd1" /&gt;

Both of the latest bailout programme audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, there was a new forecast financing gap of: ''€5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016''. The new forecast financing gaps, were needed either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets - or a third additional bailout loan, but could alternatively also be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations.&lt;ref name="EC fourth review 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2014/pdf/ocp192_en.pdf|title=Occasional Papers 192: The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece.

During the second half of 2014, the Greek government again negotiated with the Troika. The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there were a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed ''"Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16"'', while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and concluded that a financing gap of €2.5bn existed (which would have to be covered by additional austerity measures).&lt;ref name="Troika negotiations in autumn 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_16/11/2014_544644|title=Analysis: Markets keep government in check|work=Kathimerini|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Greek government insisted its calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, it submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill to the parliament, which was passed by 155 against 134 votes on  7 December.&lt;ref name="Fiscal budget 2015 passed by parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_08/12/2014_545225|title=Greek Parliament passes 2015 budget as leaders clash|work=Kathimerini|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eurogroup]] met on 8 December and agreed to support a technical two-month extension of the part of the Greek bailout programme under its guidance, making time both for completion of the long-awaited fifth final programme review and assessing the possibility for the [[European Stability Mechanism]] to set up a precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL){{efn|The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, functioning as an extra backup guarantee mechanism with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that its sole existence help calm down financial markets - making it more safe for investors to buy government bonds - and hereby it will aid the attempt for the government to raise funding capital from the private capital market.&lt;ref name="Troika negotiations in autumn 2014"/&gt;}} in place by 1 March 2015.&lt;ref name="Eurogroup December 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/146112.pdf|title=Eurogroup statement on Greece - 8 December 2014|format=PDF|publisher=Eurogroup|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the review of the bailout programme, the outgoing ND led government had proposed to the Troika, immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by [[Hellenic Financial Stability Fund]] (HFSF) (funds in excess from the part of the bailout programme under the guidance of the eurozone), along with establishment of the precautionary ECCL.&lt;ref name="Troika negotiations in autumn 2014"/&gt; In December, the Troika announced it was willing to accept this plan by the Greek government of an early exit from the bailout programme accompanied by setting up an precautionary ECCL, conditional the fifth review of the existing bailout programme first had found Greece in full compliance with its terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2014/14-12-17.ana.html#10|title=German finance ministry forwards to Bundestag Greece's requests for extension and precautionary credit line|agency=Athens News Agency|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election scene is expected to take place between pro- and anti-bailout parties. The parties being pro-bailout (ND, Pasok and Potami) argues there is no viable alternative compared to respecting and completing the existing bailout programme under the guidance of the eurozone - so that it can be exited and replaced by a precautionary ECCL on 1 March 2015. While the anti-bailout left-wing [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) party, argues it will be better to tear apart the existing bailout programme - followed by an attempt to negotiate a new creditor agreement with better terms for Greece.

===Presidential election===
{{main|Greek presidential election, 2014–15}}

On 8 December 2014, Samaras announced that the [[Greek presidential election, 2014|presidential election]] would be brought forward by a few months. The first round of voting was held on 17 December, the second on 23 December and the third on 29 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1231369522|title=Στις 17 Δεκεμβρίου η πρώτη ψηφοφορία για την εκλογή Προέδρου Δημοκρατίας|language=Greek|publisher=in.gr|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2014, Samaras had announced the candidacy of ND politician [[Stavros Dimas]], jointly supported by the ruling ND–PASOK coalition, for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1231369674|title=Σαμαράς: Ο Σταύρος Δήμας υποψήφιος Πρόεδρος Δημοκρατίας|language=Greek|publisher=in.gr|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of no super-majority after the third ballot the [[Greek Constitution]] requires the Parliament to be dissolved within ten days of the vote and snap elections to be called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1231369542|title=Τι προβλέπει το Σύνταγμα για την εκλογή Προέδρου της Δημοκρατίας|language=Greek|publisher=in.gr|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ND–PASOK coalition did not have enough seats in Parliament to ensure the election of a President by itself, there was a high possibility of an impasse on the choice, requiring a snap election.

On 29 December 2014, after failing to elect a presidential candidate in the third round of voting with the required 180 votes,&lt;ref name=aje29dec/&gt; prime minister Samaras asked incumbent president [[Karolos Papoulias]] to dissolve the parliament. On 31 December, Papoulias formally dissolved the parliament by [[presidential decree|decree]] and set the new election to be held on 25 January and the new parliament to reconvene on 5 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/greek-parliament-formally-dissolved-campaigning-begins-1420021930|title=Greek Parliament Formally Dissolved, Campaigning Begins|last=Granitsas|first=Alkman|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2014-12-31|accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial market reaction to the call of a premature election===
The snap parliamentary elections called because of political opposition in the Greek parliament to elect a new Greek president, threatened to endanger the recently gained Greek recovery, according to several international economic analysts.&lt;ref name="Greek recovery endangered by election"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/23/news/economy/greece-election-risk/|title=Stakes rise for Greece as risky election looms|publisher=CNN|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DPA 29-12-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpa-international.com/news/international/early-elections-for-greece-after-parliament-fails-to-pick-president-a-43736464.html|title=Early elections for Greece after parliament fails to pick president|publisher=DPA International|date=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229153222/http://www.dpa-international.com/news/international/early-elections-for-greece-after-parliament-fails-to-pick-president-a-43736464.html|archivedate=29 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters 29-12-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/12/29/uk-greece-vote-result-idUKKBN0K70NH20141229|title=Greece heads to election after PM Samaras loses vote on president|agency=Reuters|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising political uncertainty also caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining financial aid to Greece under its bailout programme, while noting its support would only resume pending the formation of a new-elect government respecting the already negotiated conditions.&lt;ref name="Bailout suspended until formation of a new-elect government"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_29/12/2014_545787|title=IMF suspends aid to Greece ahead of new elections|work=Kathimerini|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polls ahead of the election provided the anti-bailout party [[Coalition of the Radical Left|Syriza]] - which announced it would not comply with the previously negotiated terms in the bailout agreement and demand a "write down on most of the nominal value of debt, so that it becomes sustainable" - with a lead, causing adverse developments on financial markets, with the [[Athens Stock Exchange]] suffering an accumulated loss of roughly 30% since the start of December 2014, and the interest rate of the ten-year government bond rising from a low of 5.6% in September 2014&lt;ref name="Financial market response to election polls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_05/01/2015_545943|title=Greek parties embark on election amid debate on euro|work=Kathimerini |agency=Bloomberg|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 10.6% on 7 January 2015.&lt;ref name="Greek interest rate on 7 Jan 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_07/01/2015_546000|title=Greek 10-year bond yields exceed 10 pct for first time since 2013|work=Kathimerini |agency=Bloomberg|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ECB Executive Board member from France, "It is illegal and contrary to the treaty to reschedule a debt of a state held by a central bank", meaning such a thing would be incompatible with continued membership of the eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_09/01/2015_546061|title=Greek debt held by ECB cannot be restructured, says Coeure|work=Kathimerini |agency=Reuters|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the risk of a [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone]] as a result of the upcoming elections were assessed by economists from [[Commerzbank]] only to be around 25%, assuming the election would end with the same result as measured by the opinion polls in early January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_05/01/2015_545953|title='Grexit' is back: A Greek exit from the euro raises fears of fiscal contagion|work=Kathimerini |agency=Bloomberg|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
9,808,760 registered voters were called up to vote, with voting being [[compulsory voting|mandatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf |title=Constitution of Greece |quote=Article 51, Clause 5:  The exercise of the right to vote is compulsory. |work=[[Hellenic Parliament]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the legally existing penalties or sanctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kerkyra.gr/portal/ekloges/PD_96-2007.doc |script-title=el:Προεδρικό Διάταγμα 96/2007 |trans-title=Presidential Decree 96/2007 |language=Greek |quote=Article 117, Clause 1:  The elector who unjustifiably does not vote is punished with imprisonment of &lt;nowiki&gt;[at least]&lt;/nowiki&gt; one month and up to one year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; have ever been enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=12.06.2004,id=20721500 |script-title=el:Υποχρεωτική η ψήφος αλλά "παγωμένες" οι κυρώσεις |trans-title=Voting is mandatory, but penalties "frozen" |language=Greek |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |accessdate=7  November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217164234/http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=12.06.2004,id=20721500 |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid restrictions required citizens to cast the ballot in the specific voting district they have been registered to. Combined with the absence of [[absentee ballot]]s, [[early voting]] procedures or voting procedures for [[expatriate]] Greeks, many Greeks simply couldn't afford travelling to "their" voting district. With the rising number of expatriates, the turnout was expected to be below the turnout of the 2012 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections 2015 Facts &amp; Figures|work=[[Kathimerini]]|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_21/01/2015_546422|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

250 seats were distributed on the basis of proportional representation, with a [[election threshold|threshold]] of 3% required for entry into parliament. [[blank vote|Blank]] and invalid votes, as well as votes cast for parties that fall short of the 3% threshold, are disregarded for seat allocation purposes. 50 additional seats were awarded as a [[majority bonus system|majority bonus]] to the party that wins a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes, with coalitions in that regard not being counted as an overall party but having their votes counted separately for each party in the coalition, according to the [[Elections in Greece#Electoral law|election law]]. Parliamentary majority is achieved by a party or coalition of parties that command at least one half plus one (151 out of 300) of total seats.

'''J. D. Tippit''' (September 18, 1924 – November 22, 1963) was an American [[police officer]] who was an 11-year veteran with the [[Dallas Police Department]]. About 45 minutes after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, Tippit was shot dead in a residential neighborhood in the Oak Cliff section of [[Dallas]]. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was initially arrested for the murder of Tippit and was subsequently arrested for the killing of President Kennedy. Oswald was charged with both crimes shortly after his arrest. However, Oswald denied involvement in either of the cases. Because Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]] two days after the killings, he could not be prosecuted for either.

==Early life==
Tippit was born near the town of [[Annona, Texas|Annona]] in [[Red River County, Texas]].&lt;ref name=volume26&gt;{{cite book|title=Investigation of the Assassination of President John F.

Tippit married his high school sweetheart, Marie Frances Gasway, on December 26, 1946. The couple had three children: Charles Allan (born 1950), Brenda Kay (born 1953) and Curtis Glenn (born 1958).&lt;ref name="granberry"/&gt; That same year, he went to work for the Dearborn Stove Company.

==Career==
In January 1950, Tippit enrolled in a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] vocational training school at [[Bogata, Texas]].

At the time of his death, Tippit was assigned to Dallas Police vehicle #10, had badge #848 and was earning a salary of $490 a month (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|490|1963}}}} in 2015) as a Dallas police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/jfk50/reflect/20131102-for-slain-officer-j.d.-tippits-family-normal-life-gone-in-a-flash.ece|title=For slain officer J.D.

On November 22, 1963, J.D. Tippit was working beat number 78, his normal patrol area in south [[Oak Cliff]], a residential area of Dallas.&lt;ref name="WCR-C4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

At 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., 15 minutes after Kennedy was shot, Tippit received a radio order to drive to the central Oak Cliff area as part of a concentration of police around the center of the city. At 12:54, Tippit radioed that he had moved as directed. By then several messages had been broadcast describing a suspect in the killing of Kennedy&lt;ref name="WCR-C1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

At approximately 1:11–1:14&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="tapes"&gt;The [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/dpdtapes/tapes2.htm first report of Tippit's shooting] was transmitted over Police Channel 1 some time between 1:16 and 1:19 p.m., as indicated by verbal time stamps made periodically by the dispatcher. Specifically, the first report began 1 minute 41 seconds after the 1:16 time stamp. Before that, witness Domingo Benavides could be heard unsuccessfully trying to use Tippit's police radio microphone, beginning at 1:16. Dale K. Myers, ''With Malice: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Murder of Officer J.D.

One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.&lt;ref name="deathlocation"/&gt;

A short time later, Hardy's shoe store manager Johnny Brewer observed Oswald acting suspiciously as police cars passed nearby with sirens blaring. Oswald then ducked into the [[Texas Theatre]] without purchasing a ticket. The police were notified by the theater's cashier and responded by surrounding the theater. Oswald was arrested after a brief struggle.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 1|1964|pp=7-8}}

Twelve people who witnessed the shooting{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=166}} or its aftermath were mentioned in The Warren Report.&lt;ref&gt;By the evening of November 22, five of them (Helen Markham, Barbara Davis, Virginia Davis, Ted Callaway, Sam Guinyard) had identified Lee Harvey Oswald in police lineups as the man they saw. A sixth (William Scoggins) did so the next day. Three others (Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, Warren Reynolds) subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph. Two witnesses (Domingo Benavides, William Smith) testified that Oswald resembled the man they had seen. One witness (L.J. Lewis) felt he was too distant from the gunman to make a positive identification. Warren Commission Hearings, CE 1968, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0425a.htm Location of Eyewitnesses to the Movements of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Vicinity of the Tippit Killing].&lt;/ref&gt; Domingo Benavides saw Tippit standing by the left door of his parked police car, and a man standing on the right side of the car. He then heard shots and saw Tippit fall to the ground. Benavides stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of the street from Tippit's car. He observed the shooter fleeing the scene and removing spent cartridge cases from his gun as he left.

Benavides waited in his truck until the gunman disappeared before assisting Tippit. He then reported the shooting to police headquarters, using the radio in Tippit's car.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0227b.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides].&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Markham witnessed the shooting and then saw a man with a gun in his hand leave the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 305, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0157a.htm Testimony of Mrs. Helen Markham].&lt;/ref&gt; Markham identified [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] as Tippit's killer in a police lineup she viewed that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 318, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0163b.htm Testimony of Helen Markham].&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Davis and her sister-in-law Virginia Davis heard the shots and saw a man crossing their lawn, shaking his revolver, as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later, the women found two cartridge cases near the crime scene and handed the cases over to police.

That evening, Barbara Davis and Virginia Davis were taken to a lineup and both Davises picked out Oswald as the man whom they had seen.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 342, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0175b.htm Testimony of Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis].

Taxicab driver William Scoggins testified that he was sitting nearby in his cab when he saw Tippit's police car pull up alongside a man on the sidewalk. Scoggins heard three or four shots and then saw Tippit fall to the ground. As Scoggins crouched behind his cab, the man passed within twelve feet of him, pistol in hand, muttering what sounded to him like, "poor dumb cop" or "poor damn cop."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 322–27, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0165b.htm Testimony of William W. Scoggins].&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Scoggins viewed a police lineup and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen with the pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Scott P. |title=The Faces of Lee Harvey Oswald: The Evolution of an Alleged Assassin |year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-8682-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission also named several other witnesses&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Report, pp. 166–169. Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 817, CE 1968, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0425a.htm Location of eyewitnesses to the movements of Lee Harvey Oswald in the vicinity of the Tippit killing].&lt;/ref&gt; who were not at the scene of the murder, but who identified Oswald running between the murder scene and the [[Texas Theatre]], where Oswald was subsequently arrested.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 1|1964|p=8}} Four cartridge cases were found at the scene by eyewitnesses.

It was the unanimous testimony of expert witnesses before the Warren Commission that these spent cartridge cases were fired from the revolver in Oswald's possession to the exclusion of all other weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Report, Appendix 10: Expert Testimony, [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-10.html#revcar Revolver Cartridges and Cartridge Cases].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrest and during subsequent questionings by police, Lee Harvey Oswald denied any involvement in Tippit's murder. Based on eyewitness' statements and the gun found in Oswald's possession at the time of his arrest, he was formally charged with the murder of J.D. Tippit at 7:10 pm. on November 22. During the course of the day, police began to suspect that Oswald was also involved in the shooting of President Kennedy.

At approximately 1:00 am on November 23, Oswald was also charged with assassinating President John F. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Warren Commission|first=|title=The Warren Commission Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpzGMAmH2LEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=jd+tippit+lee+harvey+oswald+denied&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_NHtU-j6D6Sg8AGYkICwAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jd%20tippit%20lee%20harvey%20oswald%20denied&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=0-7607-4997-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald continued to maintain his innocence in connection with both murders. In the late morning of November 24, while being transported from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas County Jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the abdomen by Dallas nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]]. The shooting was broadcast throughout the United States and Canada on [[live television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siracusa, Ph.D.|first=Joseph M. |title=Encyclopedia of the Kennedys: The People and Events That Shaped America|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-539-X|page=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Oswald was killed before he was tried for either crime, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] commissioned a committee of U.S. Senators, Congressmen and elder statesmen to investigate the events surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy, Officer Tippit and Oswald in an effort to answer questions surrounding the events.&lt;ref name=rivera&gt;{{cite book|last=Rivera|first=Sheila |title=Assassination of John F.

The committee, known as the [[Warren Commission]] (named for the commission chairman, Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]), spent ten months investigating the murders and interviewing witnesses.&lt;ref name=rivera/&gt; On September 24, 1964, the Warren Commission released an 888-page report that concluded there was no evidence of a conspiracy and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=William Thaddeus |others=Bliss, Donald T.|title=Counsel for the Situation: Shaping the Law to Realize America's Promise|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-0494-1|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=Willard |last2=Marion|first2=Nancy E.|title=Killing the President: Assassinations, Attempts, and Rumored Attempts on U.S. Commanders-in-Chief|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0-313-36475-3|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Peter|title=The Kennedy Assassination|year=2007|publisher=Univ.

In 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] reported: "Based on Oswald's possession of the murder weapon a short time after the murder and the eyewitness identifications of Oswald as the gunman, the committee concluded that Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippit."&lt;ref name="HCSA-IA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=59 |chapter=I.A.5.

===Conspiracy theories===
{{Main|John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories}}
Some conspiracy theorists have alleged that the murder of Officer Tippit was part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. Implying that two murders could not have happened so closely together by coincidence, his killing is often referred to as the "[[Rosetta Stone]]" to the solution of the Kennedy assassination by critics of the official findings.&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite book|last=McAdams|first=John|title=JFK Assassination Logic: How to Think About Claims of Conspiracy|year=2011|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9781597974899|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OJeNytAOZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 8, 2013|page=175|chapter=Not All Evidence Is Equal: Using Reliable Evidence|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OJeNytAOZkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi 2007 p.816&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics dispute that Oswald shot Tippit, arguing that the physical evidence and witness testimony do not support that conclusion.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=James D. |authorlink= |url=http://cha3u.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/45668088/Conspiracy%20Theories%20in%20American%20History%20%282003%29.pdf |title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia |editor1-first=Knight |editor1-last=Peter |year=2003 |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=1-57607-812-4 |page=391 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics state that Tippit himself was a conspirator, tasked to kill Oswald by organized crime or right-wing politicians in order to cover up the search for other assassins.&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonokowski"&gt;{{cite news |title=JFK's magic lives on&amp;nbsp;... and some called it Camelot's Court |last=Bonokoski |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Bonokoski |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WpdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TDQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4533%2C2089418 |newspaper=The Windsor Star |location=Windsor, Ontario, |date=November 22, 1973 |page=39 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On the evening of the assassination, both Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the new President, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], called Tippit's widow to express their sympathies.&lt;ref name="Funeral"/&gt; [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] wrote a letter expressing sorrow for the bond they shared.&lt;ref&gt;Russo 2013 p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The plight of Tippit's family also moved much of the nation and a total of $647,579 was donated to them following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]. One of the largest individual gifts was $25,000 that Dallas businessman [[Abraham Zapruder]] donated to Frances Tippit after selling his [[Zapruder film|film of the president's assassination]] to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/as-he-filmed-abraham-zapruder-knew-instantly-that-president-kennedy-was-dead/2013/11/20/c2ed8422-4bd2-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html|title=As he filmed, Abraham Zapruder knew instantly that President Kennedy was dead|last=Ruane|first=Michael E.|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1964, Tippit was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor from the [[American Police Hall of Fame &amp; Museum|American Police Hall of Fame]], and he also received the Police Medal of Honor, the Police Cross, and the Citizens Traffic Commission Award of Heroism. A state historical marker to Officer Tippit was unveiled November 20, 2012 at the location where the shooting occurred.&lt;ref name="nbcnews1"/&gt;

Tippit's widow married Dallas police lieutenant Harry Dean Thomas in January 1967. They were married until his death in 1982.

The international film festival, '''Jalari in Corto''', is held annually at Parco Jalari in [[Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto]] in [[Sicily]]. It began in the summer of 2004, having been conceived by young people of the cultural-ethnographic association ''Associazione Culturale Etnografica Ambientale “Jalari”'' and by [[Andrea Italiano]]. Its aim has been to promote, raise awareness and bring the art of [[Filmmaking|cinema]], and the communicative power of artistic expression in general, to as many people as possible through [[short film]]s and meetings with authors, actors and [[Film critic|critics]]. Year after year, the event has gained great fame, standing today as a springboard for both national and international young cinematic artists to gain exposure to a wider audience and increase visibility.

The festival offers film awards in several categories:

# Foreign language (subtitled in [[English language|English]]);
# Schools.

The '''Japan Le Mans Challenge''' (abbreviated '''JLMC''') was an [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] sportscar series based in Japan built around the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] that began in 2006.  It was run by the Sports Car Endurance Race Operation (SERO) sanctioning body and ran under the rules laid out by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO).  It is the first endurance sportscar series in Japan since the demise of the [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship]] in 1992, although the ACO had run a single endurance race since then, the [[1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000 km]].  The series was cancelled in 2007 following two poor seasons.

==Rules==
The rules for the JLMC were based around the rules used by the ACO for the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in France, similar to those used by the [[Le Mans Series]] in Europe and the [[American Le Mans Series]] in North America.  Cars were broken into two general classes, known as [[Le Mans Prototype]]s (LMP) and [[Grand Touring]] (GT).  These classes were further broken down into a larger, more powerful class and a cheaper, less powerful class, which created four classes: LMP1, LMP2, GT1, and GT2.  All four classes raced at the same time on the same track, with a winner being declared for each class as well as an overall race winner.  Points were based on finishing position are awarded for overall championships amongst drivers, teams, and engine builders.  However, unlike the two other Le Mans-based series, the JLMC allowed cars which did not meet ACO guidelines in an attempt to increase the number of entrants.  This was allowed with the belief that by 2008, JLMC would fully adapt to ACO rules and run fully compliant cars.

The ACO planned to also grant automatic entries to the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] for the teams that win the season championships in each class.  However, due to the use of cars which do not meet ACO guidelines, this plan for invitations was also moved to 2008.

==History==
During the brief two seasons of the Japan Le Mans Challenge, the series struggled to provide grids similar to those in the American Le Mans Series and Le Mans Series.  Most races averaged approximately 12 cars total, with only a few meeting actual LMP and GT regulations.  [[Mugen Motorsports]] backed an LMP1 entry using one of their engines, while Hitotsuyama Racing attempted to increase field size by entering cars in two of the four classes.  The LMP2 class however consisted entirely of rebodied single seaters, some of these were modified [[Dallara]] [[Formula Three|F3]]s from the domestic [[Fuji Grand Champion Series|GC21 Championship]].  Even with some factory support and proven Le Mans cars, most teams struggled to survive the 1000&amp;nbsp;kilometer race distances.  The first two races of the 2006 season were won by a Hitotsuyama [[Ferrari 550 Maranello]] in the GT1 class, while the two proper LMP1s failed to finish.  It was not until the final race of 2006 that Mugen's LMP managed to earn an overall victory.

For 2007, Hitotsuyama's [[Zytek]] LMP1 managed to prove reliable enough to earn the first three victories of the season, before it once again struggled to finish in the final race of the year, leaving an LMP2 GC21 to take overall victory.  During that 2007 season, SERO announced that they were relinquishing control of the series due to their failure to promote it and increase not only grid size, but also fan viewership.  The [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]] initially announced that they were to take over the series for 2008.  However, shortly after this announcement, the ACO announced their intentions to cancel the series entirely, citing a continued lack of participants as well as being unable to make contracts with circuits over the lack of ticket sales.

==Asian Le Mans Series==
{{update|section|date=July 2010}}
{{main|Asian Le Mans Series}}
The ACO announced a new Asian-based sports car series in 2009, which will encompass all of Asia in an attempt to increase support from outside Japan. A teasing race was to be held at the [[Shanghai International Circuit]] on November 1–2, 2008 but was later cancelled. The inaugural 2009 season is planned to comprise at least four 3-hour races: two at [[Okayama International Circuit]] on October 30–November 1,&lt;ref&gt;

The ACO aims to attract teams from ALMS, LMS and the [[Super GT]].

He claimed to be a former [[occultist]] who was born into a '[[witchcraft]] family' before converting to [[Christianity]]. He was a primary source for many [[Chick Publications]] works against ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', [[Catholicism]], [[Neopaganism]], and [[Christian rock]].

In his public appearances, Todd made a variety of claims about witches, [[Satanists]], and the [[Illuminati]], who he alleged were conspiring against [[Christians]]. These purported conspiracies often included government officials and leaders of Christian organizations. Investigative reports in magazines and books said there were many inconsistencies in his statements about anti-Christian conspiracies and his own past.

In 1988 Todd was convicted in [[South Carolina]] on charges of rape and sentenced to 30 years in a prison. In 2004 he was released from prison and placed in a psychiatric facility, where he died in 2007.

==Biography==

===Speaking career===
Todd's earliest known public speaking engagements began in 1968, when he was preaching and married to a woman named Linda. He claimed he had been a witch while in the United States Navy, but converted to Christianity while visiting a southern Californian Pentecostal church. After disappearing from public sight for a few months, Todd returned without his wife, saying that God told them to seek other mates. In 1969, Todd joined the [[United States Army]] and was stationed in Germany for a few months before being discharged for psychiatric reasons and drug abuse.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt;

In 1972 Todd became associated with a [[Jesus Movement]] coffeehouse. In 1973, he appeared on a local Christian television show in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and was invited by evangelist Doug Clark to appear on his ''Amazing Prophecies'' show on the [[Faith Broadcasting Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory |first=Jesse |last=Walker |authorlink=Jesse Walker |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-06-213555-1 |pages=208–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, allegations surfaced that he had been making sexual advances toward young women and teenage girls at the coffeehouse, was incorporating witchcraft teachings into his Bible studies, was carrying a [[.38 caliber]] [[handgun]] into church meetings, and was using drugs.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt; In addition, he impregnated his wife's teenage sister.&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt; Todd was dismissed from the coffeehouse ministry, and Clark denounced him on his television show.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;

In 1974 Todd moved to [[Dayton, Ohio]], where he opened an occult bookstore and began recruiting for a [[Wicca]]n coven. In 1976 Todd became the subject of a criminal investigation over reports that he was involving underage girls in sexual initiation rituals for his coven. Following an investigation of his activities by [[neopagan]] leaders [[Isaac Bonewits]] and [[Gavin Frost]], which uncovered drug use and underage sex, Frost's [[Church and School of Wicca]] revoked the charter it had granted to Todd's coven. He was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and given a six-month sentence, but served only two months before being released due to [[epileptic]] fits.&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt;

Todd resurfaced in the evangelical Christian community in late 1977, this time claiming the existence of a vast Satanic conspiracy led by an order of witches called the Illuminati, supposedly including a number of Christian organizations and well-known Christian figures such as [[Jim Bakker]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Billy Graham]], [[Bob Jones, Sr.]],&lt;ref name="Versluis117"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Inquisitions: Heretic-Hunting and the Intellectual Origins of Modern Totalitarianism |first=Arthur |last=Versluis |page=117 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-530637-8 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral Roberts]], and [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Raising the Devil: Satanism, New Religions, and the Media |first=Bill |last=Ellis |authorlink= |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, KY |year=2000 |isbn=0-8131-2170-1 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have given, as a member of the Illuminati, $8 million to Pastor [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]] of [[Calvary Chapel]] to launch the [[Christian rock]] industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Selling Satan: The Evangelical Media and the Mike Warnke Scandal |first1=Mike |last1=Hertenstein |first2=Jon |last2=Trott |page=164 |publisher=Cornerstone Press |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-940895-07-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Todd said was a Satanic invention to entrap Christian young people in rock music and its "demonic beat". He claimed that Falwell had been bribed by the Illuminati with a $50 million donation.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; He also claimed that US President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the [[Antichrist]]&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; and that [[Ayn Rand]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' was the Illuminati's blueprint for unleashing a planned Satanic takeover.&lt;ref name="Barkun31"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Barkun |authorlink=Michael Barkun |title=A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-520-23805-2 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble78-80"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tabernacle of Hate: Seduction Into Right-Wing Extremism |first=Kerry |last=Noble |edition=second |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, NY |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8156-5126-0 |pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; He urged Christians to stockpile weapons and food in preparation for a Satanic takeover in 1980.&lt;ref name="Versluis117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble78-80"/&gt;

Tapes from Todd around 1979 indicate that he was then teaching [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness Pentecostal]] (sometimes called "Jesus Only") theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?267 |title=Cornerstone's Near-Miss Interviews with Madalyn Murray O'Hair and John Todd |work=[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]] |issue=48 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040911095822/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?267 |archivedate=September 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd significantly curtailed his public speaking after 1979, reportedly moving to rural [[Montana]] after issuing warnings that the Satanic takeover had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Barkun |title=A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-520-23805-2 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later reported to have delivered a speech in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]] in 1983 at the invitation of [[Randy Weaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Every Knee Shall Bow |first=Jess |last=Walter |authorlink=Jess Walter |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-06-101131-2 |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Todd was arrested in May 1987 for the rape of a [[University of South Carolina]] graduate student. After his arrest, he was additionally charged with [[child sexual abuse|sexually molesting]] two children who attended a karate school where he worked. He was convicted of the rape in January 1988 and sentenced to 30 years in state prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Survivalist' Protests Verdict |first=Debra-Lynn B. |last=Hook |work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] |date=January 23, 1988 |page=1D |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CS&amp;s_site=thestate&amp;p_multi=CS&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB57F8BC99608EA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Todd was released, but he was put in the care of the Behavioral Disorder Treatment Unit run by the South Carolina Department of Mental Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kollyns v.

==Claims and reactions==
Todd claimed to have served as a Green Beret in the [[Vietnam War]], but his discharge papers list him as a general clerk/typist and do not record him having been in Vietnam. Army medical reports referred to "emotional instability with pseudologica phantastica" (compulsive lying), difficulty in telling reality from fantasy, homicidal threats he had made on another, false suicide reports, and a severe personality disturbance.&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Gary |url=http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?437 |title=The John Todd Story |work=[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]] |issue=48 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006195908/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?437 |archivedate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd also claimed in his testimony to have murdered an officer in Germany and to have escaped prison with the help of the Illuminati, but his records show no such things occurred.&lt;ref name="Metz"/&gt; These records were later recovered by investigative journalists working for ''[[Christianity Today]]'', who found that he had never been to Vietnam. One report concluded that Todd found it difficult to distinguish reality and fantasy.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt; Todd also claimed that [[John F. Kennedy]] was still alive and that he had been Kennedy's "personal warlock".&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt;

While Todd claimed to have left witchcraft in 1972 and converted to fundamentalist Christianity, accounts have him being baptized into a Oneness Pentecostal church in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1968, and leading a Wiccan group in Ohio in 1976. When confronted with the latter by Christian evangelists, Todd said that he had gone through a period of "backsliding" during that time. However, when a number of other inconsistencies in Todd's story were reported in the evangelical Christian media, and Todd began denouncing many Christian leaders as part of the Satanic conspiracy or the Illuminati, many evangelists denounced Todd and cut off any further association. Jack Chick was the only influential evangelist to continue to defend Todd.&lt;ref name="Burack"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sin, Sex, and Democracy: Antigay Rhetoric and the Christian Right |first=Cynthia |last=Burack |year=2008 |publisher=SUNY Press |location=Albany, New York |isbn=978-0-7914-7405-1 |page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HIUfPrw-Wc0C&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22John%20Todd%22%20%22jack%20chick%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=Todd&amp;f=false 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd's speaking engagements during 1978 and 1979 generated controversy and sometimes hysteria at the churches he spoke at. Frequently, there were claims by Todd of gunshots in the parking lot or attacks on his life after the services, but there were no witnesses to confirm his claims.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; Several Christian organizations and publications investigated Todd's claims and published articles disputing them. These included ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]'' magazine, the [[Christian Research Institute]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine, and the book ''The Todd Phenomenon'' by Darryl E. Hicks.

===Similarities to other preachers===
Todd was not the only speaker making the rounds in evangelical Christian circles in the 1970s warning young people against the [[occult]]. Todd's claims of being a Satanic high priest before his conversion&lt;ref name=Medway/&gt; were similar to claims by Hershel Smith and [[Mike Warnke]].&lt;ref name="selling"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Trott |first1=Jon |last2=Hertenstein |first2=Mike |year=1992 |url=http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm |title=Selling Satan: The Tragic History of Mike Warnke |work=[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]] |volume=21 |issue=98 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063019/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one meeting between Todd and Warnke, the two had a backstage confrontation and Todd accused Warnke of stealing his testimony regarding the Illuminati.&lt;ref name="selling"/&gt;

==Publications based on Todd's claims==
Todd has appeared in several of Jack Chick's publications. Chick first promoted Todd's message in comic form in ''The Broken Cross'', a comic that portrays a town controlled by organized Satanists, who ignore ritual murders and teach witchcraft to children in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broken Cross |first=Jack T. |last=Chick |publisher=Chick Publications |year=1974 |oclc=11126870 |pages=6, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another Chick comic book, ''Spellbound?'', a character called "Lance Collins" describes himself as a former [[druid]] and member of the Illuminati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spellbound? |first=Jack T. |last=Chick |publisher=Chick Publications |year=1978 |oclc=54527440 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character claims that Satanists control the rock music industry and are infiltrating churches, and urges Christians to burn their [[rock music]] records, [[Ouija]] boards and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spellbound? |first=Jack T. |last=Chick |publisher=Chick Publications |year=1978 |oclc=54527440 |pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both comics offer "deepest appreciation to John Todd, ex-grand Druid priest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broken Cross |first=Jack T. |last=Chick |publisher=Chick Publications |year=1974 |oclc=11126870 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spellbound? |first=Jack T. |last=Chick |publisher=Chick Publications |year=1978 |oclc=54527440 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd's stories about the Illuminati were published as the comic book ''The Illuminati and Witchcraft'' in 1980 by Jacob Sailor. His claims partially became the basis for a different book, ''Witchcraft and the Illuminati'', published in 1981 by [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]], a [[Christian Identity]] group, and reprinted in 1999 by the [[Christian Patriot]] Association. This book repeated many of Todd's claims, including the alleged power structure of the Illuminati and the idea that ''Atlas Shrugged'' was the Illuminati's secret blueprint, but added Identity beliefs derogatory toward [[Jews]] and [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref name="Barkun31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Barkun |title=Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement |edition=Revised |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-8078-2328-7 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Todd's veracity was questioned and investigated, Chick continued to defend him and publish tracts based on Todd's life. Author Cynthia Burack wrote that Chick often made "excuses for behaviours that were inconsistent with Todd's status as a high-profile Christian convert," and that his "propensities to indulge in conspiracy theory and to lash out at putative allies who question his conclusions" in his defense of Todd and other controversial figures (namely [[Alberto Rivera (activist)|Alberto Rivera]] and Rebecca Brown) resulted in a split between himself and the conservative Christian movement.&lt;ref name="Burack"/&gt;

'''Kirsty Marianne Bentley''' was a teenager living in [[Ashburton, New Zealand]], who went missing while walking her family dog on the afternoon of 31 December 1998. After an extensive search lasting several weeks, her [[cadaver|body]] was found in dense [[scrubland|scrub]] approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km away. [[New Zealand Police|Police]] consider the case to be a [[homicide]], and it remains one of the highest-profile [[cold case|unsolved murders]] in New Zealand.

== Early life ==
Kirsty Marianne Bentley was born on 18 January 1983 at the Christchurch Women's Hospital. She was the second child of her parents, Jill and Sidney Bentley; she had an older brother John.

Bentley was by all accounts a normal teenager. Her mother has described her as vibrant, honest and compassionate. She was confident and direct with people she knew, but could be shy and reserved with those she did not. Bentley had a strong creative streak that she expressed through [[drama]] classes and [[poetry]]. She attended [[Ashburton College]], and at school she was well liked and had a close-knit friend group. She had recently begun dating a local boy from one of her classes.&lt;ref name="jill-book-2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bentley |first1=Jill |last2=Williams |first2=Tony | date=2001 |title=Kirsty: Her Mother Writes with Love |location=New Zealand |publisher=Reed Books |isbn=978-0-7900-0790-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of her disappearance, Bentley met a friend at the Ashburton library at around 10:30am on 31 December 1998. After doing some shopping, they had lunch at [[McDonald's]] around midday.{{r|coronial-report|p=16}} Bentley was dropped off at her home by her friend's sister at around 2:30pm.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=20}}

After returning home, her brother John told her that her boyfriend had called and left a message, asking her to call him back. Phone records show she made a call to her boyfriend at 2:38pm,{{r|jill-book-2001|p=231}} but he wasn't there so she left a message asking him to call her back.

From here, it appears Bentley decided to take the family's black [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] dog,&lt;ref name="press-jan-2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Van Beynan |first1=Martin |last2=Gee | first2=David |date=1999-01-02 |title=Dog found tethered; copter joins search |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abby, for a walk. This was not unusual for Bentley; she often took the dog for a walk to pass the time.&lt;ref name="coronial-report"&gt;{{cite report |first=James |last=Ryan |date=2016-07-15 |title=An inquest into the death of Kirsty Marianne Bentley: Findings of Coroner J P Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; John did not hear her leaving the house.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=232}} A neighbour witnessed her walking by his house with the dog at 3:05pm,{{r|jill-book-2001|p=233}} but from this point on the exact timeline of what happened to her cannot be clearly established.

== Search ==
Bentley's boyfriend called back at 4:30pm,{{r|jill-book-2001|p=19}}&lt;ref name="press-jan9-weekender"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-09 |title=The mystery of Kirsty Bentley |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at this time John noticed his sister was still absent. When his mother, Jill, returned home from work at around 5:15pm,{{r|jill-book-2001|p=13}} he immediately told her Bentley had not come home. After calling Bentley's boyfriend to confirm he did not know where Kirsty was, Jill conducted the first search, by walking the route Bentley would normally take down to the [[Ashburton River / Hakatere|Ashburton River]].{{r|press-jan9-weekender}} However, she was becoming increasingly anxious and soon decided to turn back.

After returning to the house, she and John agreed to wait until 6pm before conducting another search, in case Kirsty came home of her own accord. John left to search the dog walking route just before 6pm, and shortly afterwards Kirsty's father, Sid, returned home. When he was told Kirsty was missing, he immediately notified [[New Zealand Police|police]].{{r|jill-book-2001|p=22}}{{r|press-jan9-weekender}}

After Police became involved the search rapidly grew more intense throughout the evening, with a mixture of police staff, family members and friends canvassing the area looking for Bentley. This first search continued through the entire night. Nothing was found.{{r|coronial-report|p=6}}

The official [[Search and Rescue#New Zealand|Search and Rescue]] operation began at 8am the next day. At around 10am, the family dog, Abby, was found tied to a tree in a patch of dense foliage beside the Ashburton River,{{r|coronial-report|p=7}} close to Robilliard Park.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=34}} The general area had been searched the previous night, but the dog had not been found; the dense foliage means it is possible she was missed during this search. The dog was found tied to a tree with a lead of the same type that the family owned, however the family initially believed the lead did not belong to them.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=55}}

Nearby two items of clothing, underwear and boxer shorts, were found.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=36}} These were later confirmed to belong to Bentley.{{r|coronial-report|p=8}}&lt;ref name="press-jan4-underwear"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-04 |title=Underwear find crushes parents |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 16 days, police and volunteers meticulously searched the Ashburton area of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. Initially the search was focused on the Ashburton township but it expanded out to cover a much larger area of Canterbury. The [[New Zealand Army]] sent troops from [[Burnham, New Zealand|Burnham Military Camp]] to help in the effort also.&lt;ref name="press-jan12-army"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-12 |title=Army helps in river search |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January, two men in the Camp Gully area of Rakaia, roughly 40&amp;nbsp;km away from Ashburton, found a badly decomposed human body lying in a patch of overgrown scrub and planted pine.&lt;ref name="press-jan18-bodyfound"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Hanlon |first1=Sinead |last2=Van Beynan |first2=Martin |date=1999-01-18 |title=Body find may end hunt for girl |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was later confirmed to be Bentley's.&lt;ref name="press-jan21-bodyconfirmation"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bruce |first=Mike |date=1999-01-21 |title=Family devastated at news of Kirsty's murdered body |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body was lying at the bottom of a steep embankment,{{r|coronial-report|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clausen |first=Victoria |date=1999-01-23 |title=Kirsty's killer 'familiar with the area'; Inquiry head rules out early resolution |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered in a thin layer of branches and leaves.{{r|coronial-report|p=9}} She had been placed in the [[fetal position]] and was fully clothed in what she had last been seen wearing, with the exception of the underwear that had previously been found at the scene of her disappearance.{{r|coronial-report|p=10}}{{r|press-jan21-bodyconfirmation}} A large [[paddock]] was at the top of an embankment above her, and the location was close to [[New Zealand state highway network#Touring Routes|State Highway 72]], part of the [[Inland Scenic Route]].

The area she was found is known for being used by illegal [[cannabis]] growers, and the men who found her were out looking for a cannabis patch.&lt;ref name="press-jan19-discoveryday2"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-19 |title=Family's painful wait; There is a chance it is Kirsty - policeman |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they were reluctant to contact police, but decided the discovery was too important not to report.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=83}}

== Investigation ==
After the discovery, Police closed the scene and ordered a no-fly zone over the area as they conducted their investigation.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=80}} They conducted an extensive scene examination over several days, and took plaster casts of tire tracks in the area.{{r|press-jan19-discoveryday2}}&lt;ref name="herald-jan-tracks"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Tony |date=1999-01-19 |title=Clues to Kirsty case in tracks |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=1484 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=[[Auckland, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the height of summer, and so Bentley's body was in an advanced state of [[decomposition]].{{r|coronial-report|p=9}} She was recovered and transported to [[Christchurch Hospital]] where a [[autopsy|post-mortem]] was conducted.{{r|coronial-report|p=11}}{{r|press-jan19-discoveryday2}} It took three days before [[dental records]] were used to formally [[body identification|identify]] the body.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=81,85}}{{r|coronial-report|p=12}}

Bentley was killed by [[blunt force trauma]] to the right-side of the back of her head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-07-16 |title=Coroner: Kirsty Bentley killed by massive blow to the head |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11675677 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=[[Auckland, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blow or blows was inflicted with enough force to severely fracture her [[skull]]. The pathologist determined she would have died shortly after the wound was inflicted.{{r|coronial-report|p=11}} Police initially withheld her cause of death from the public for operational reasons.{{r|press-jan21-bodyconfirmation}} The pathologist believed she was killed soon after she went missing, and likely placed in the Camp Gully area the same night, based on an examination of her stomach contents and the state of her body.{{r|coronial-report|p=16}}

Police asked for help from the public regarding vehicles that may have been seen in the area at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1998-01-29 |title=Police renew Kirsty call |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also asked for [[cannabis]] growers to come forward if they had seen anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clausen |first=Victoria |date=1999-01-26 |title=Police appeal to growers of cannabis |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These calls to the public did not reveal anything useful.

== Funeral ==
A [[funeral]] for Bentley was held at St Stephen's Anglican Church in [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]] on 25 January 1999.&lt;ref name="press-jan26-funeral"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-26 |title=Tears of grief and anger for Kirsty |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 500 and 700 people attended.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=100}} Bentley's body was [[cremation|cremated]], and her ashes sealed in a steel urn. The urn was buried in a specially planted memorial garden at the family home. After Sid's death in 2015, the ashes were transferred to Bentley's mother, Jill.&lt;ref name="press-2015-ashes-transfer"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Livingstone |first1=Tommy |last2=Sherwood |first2=Sam |date=2015-07-03 |title=Ashes returned to Kirsty's mum |url=http://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the-press/20150703/281638188864132 |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
Media coverage of the case was extensive, making it one of the most high-profile unsolved crimes in New Zealand history. At the time, all major news outlets in New Zealand closely followed the case. The intensity of the coverage was both a help and a hindrance to the investigation. For instance, the men who found her body cited seeing Bentley's mother on evening news television broadcasts as the reason they had decided to come forward, despite the fact they were engaged in an illegal activity when they found her.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=83}}

However, the relationship between the media and the police and family would also be strained at times.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=134-139}} Decisions by media to publish reports that Bentley's body had been discovered before she had been formally identified were publicly criticised by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=R J |date=1999-01-22 |title=Letters to the Editor: Identifying Kirsty |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |location=[[Wellington, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the family expressed distress at the pressure they received from media during the several days that Bentley's body remained formally unidentified.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=84}}

== Suspects ==
Police have stated that hundreds of individuals have been considered suspects at one time or another, and a list of several hundred people have never been formally eliminated from the enquiry.&lt;ref name="stuff-2017-tullylinked"&gt;{{cite news |last=Livingstone |first=Tommy |date=2017-03-15 |title=Mother of Kirsty Bentley not convinced new information in the case will bring answers |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/90444218/Mother-of-Kirsty-Bentley-not-convinced-new-information-in-the-case-will-bring-answers |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At times the list of suspects has been as small as 20 people.&lt;ref name="herald-2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=McCracken |first=Heather |date=2010-04-11 |title=New leads in Bentley murder case |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10637659 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=[[Auckland, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some possible suspects have received media attention in relation to the case.

=== Sid and John Bentley ===
At an early stage in the case, media reported that Sid and John were considered suspects in Kirsty's disappearance. Both denied any involvement, although John acknowledged in media interviews that it was only common sense that [[New Zealand Police|police]] should consider them as suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Yvonne |date=1999-01-16 |title=I'm a suspect, says Kirsty's big brother |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion]] |location=[[Wellington, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police later confirmed that they were considered suspects in the investigation.{{r|herald-2010}}

Police conducted a scene examination at the family home in the early stages of the investigation,&lt;ref name="press-jan7-abduction"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-07 |title=Police search Kirsty's home; Abduction theory probed |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including carrying out [[Luminol]] testing.{{r|jill-book-2001|p=65}} However the tests did not find anything of value to the investigation.&lt;ref name="press-jan8"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hanlon |first=Sinead |date=1999-01-08 |title=No new clues in search of home |work=[[The Press]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid was unable to provide a strong [[alibi]] for his whereabouts on that day. He initially claimed he had been in [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]] and [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] at the time, but later claimed he had hit his head on a cupboard door and forgotten that he had actually been in Ashburton for part of the day.{{r|herald-2010}}&lt;ref name="stuff-2015-sid-death"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Livingstone |first1=Tommy |last2=Dally |first2=Joelle |last3=Mann |first3=Brittany |date=2015-07-01 |title=Cancer claims father of murdered Ashburton teen Kirsty Bentley |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69832391/father-of-murdered-ashburton-teen-kirsty-bentley-dies |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuff-2015-killerstillouthere"&gt;{{cite news |last=Livingstone |first=Tommy |date=2015-07-12 |title=Killer is still out here, says Bentley's mum |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/70112815/killer-is-still-out-here-says-bentleys-mum |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His exact whereabouts at the time remain unknown. Family members have stated they believe Sid was embarrassed to admit whatever it was that he was doing on that day, but they do not believe he was involved in the murder in any way.{{r|stuff-2017-tullylinked|stuff-2015-killerstillouthere}}&lt;ref name="stuff-2015-john-comments"&gt;{{cite news |last=Livingstone |first=Tommy |date=2015-07-02 |title=Kirsty Bentley's brother fears her murderer will never be caught |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69898949/kirsty-bentleys-brother-fears-her-murderer-will-never-be-caught?rm=m |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newshub-tully-linked"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017-03-15 |title=Kirsty Bentley killing: Russell John Tully linked to murder |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/03/kirsty-bentley-killing-john-tully-linked-to-murder.html |work=[[Newshub]] |location=[[New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police later consulted retired British [[Detective]] [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]] Chuck Burton, who stated that in his opinion, the perpetrator was likely to have known Bentley and been close with her, based on the nature of the crime and the way her body was left at Camp Gully.{{r|herald-2010}}

Despite this, police never laid [[criminal charge|charges]] against either Sid or John, suggesting no strong evidence of their involvement was ever found. In 2018, Police confirmed they do not believe Sid or John were involved in the crime.&lt;ref name="stuff-dec-2018"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-12-02 |title=Developments in DNA testing could help finally solve 1998 murder of Ashburton teenager Kirsty Bentley |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/developments-in-dna-testing-could-help-finally-solve-1998-murder-ashburton-teenager-kirsty-bentley |work=tvnz.co.nz |location=[[New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green van ===
In the months after Bentley's death, Police asked the public for information about a green [[Commer FC|Commer van]], registration number EP9888, that was of interest to the inquiry.&lt;ref name="herald-2000-greenvan"&gt;{{cite news |authors=NZPA  |date=2000-06-30 |title=Van details fresh lead in Kirsty case |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=105425 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=[[Auckland, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The van was described as a 1961 model set up to be used as a [[campervan|camper]], with a distinctive [[Commer]] branding badge attached to the front. The van was either blue or a faded blue-green. It was last registered with the [[NZ Transport Agency|NZTA]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://carjam.co.nz/car/?plate=EP9888 |title=Record for Registration EP9888 |date= |website=CarJam |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of van was commonly used by tourists and drifters at the time, and in many cases these vehicles were not registered.{{r|herald-2000-greenvan}} The van was rare;&lt;ref name="newscomau"&gt;{{cite news |last=Koubaridis |first=Andrew |date=2016-01-04 |title=Murder of teenager Kirsty Bentley has haunted New Zealand for 17 years |url=https://www.news.com.au/national/crime/murder-of-teenager-kirsty-bentley-has-haunted-new-zealand-for-17-years/news-story/34dfe08f63c622f7a81342c8b495e122 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=[[Australia]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as few as 2 matching its general description are believed to have ever been in New Zealand.

An experienced mechanic originally reported the van to police after seeing it in the area around the time of Bentley's disappearance. Due to the distinctive nature of the van and the man's experience with them, he took special note of the van at the time and was able to give a highly detailed description of it. The van was also seen by other witnesses in the [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]] area in the weeks before Bentley's disappearance, and there were reports it was also seen in the Camp Gully area.

Police believed that such a distinctive vehicle could not go unnoticed by the public, and a sighting could lead to a break in the case. Many people came forward to police with possible sightings, but all were discounted as not being the van that police were seeking; the distinctive nature of the van made it very easy for them to rule out mistaken sightings. No further leads on the camper were ever revealed, and it has never been found.{{r|newscomau}}

In addition to this, police distributed fliers asking for information on a girl seen near the van on Chalmers Avenue, close to where Bentley had disappeared. The girl was known to the [[Dairy (store)|dairy]] owners in the suburb of Netherby as a customer. However, despite this, and repeated public requests by police, the girl never came forward. Her identity and her connection to the suspicious van remains unknown.

=== Russell John Tully ===
In March 2017 media reported that police were investigating whether Russell John Tully, a local man who [[List of massacres in New Zealand|murdered two staff members]] at the [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]] [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)#Work and Income|Work and Income]] office in 2014, may have been involved.{{r|newshub-tully-linked}} Tully had been known to camp in the area of Ashburton Kirsty went missing from.&lt;ref name="stuff-2018-tully-eliminated"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Sherwood |date=2018-05-30 |title=Work and Income double murderer interviewed over Kirsty Bentley cold case |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/104330963/work-and-income-double-murderer-interviewed-over-kirsty-bentley-cold-case |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |location=[[New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tully strongly denied any involvement.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In May 2018 Police announced they had eliminated Tully from the enquiry. He had provided a detailed account of where he had been living and working during the time Bentley disappeared. Police confirmed he had not originally been interviewed because he was living in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] at the time, and was no longer suspected of any involvement.{{r|stuff-2018-tully-eliminated}}

=== Others ===
After Sid's death in 2015, an unidentified woman came forward to say that she suspected her ex-boyfriend had been involved in the murder. He had been a suspect in the original investigation, and they had both been interviewed by police and media at the time in relation to the case. According to an interview with her in 2015, her ex-boyfriend, while intoxicated, had admitted his involvement to her on several occasions.&lt;ref name="herald-2015-woman-changes-statement"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-07-07 |title=Woman changes statement over Kirsty Bentley murder |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11477094 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=[[Auckland, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether she ever came forward to formally change her statement to police.{{or?|date=October 2018}}

== Recent developments ==
In 2014 the case was transferred from [[New Zealand Police#Ranks|Detective Inspector]] Greg Williams to Detective Inspector Greg Murton. At the time he commented that the investigation was open and would continue to be until it was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014-06-10 |title=Police 'will never give up' |url=http://www.guardianonline.co.nz/news/police-will-never-give-up/ |work=[[Ashburton Guardian]] |location=[[Ashburton, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Bentley's father, Sid, died of [[esophageal cancer]].{{r|stuff-2015-sid-death}} His death briefly renewed public interest in the case.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In 2018, Police confirmed that Russell John Tully was no longer of interest to the enquiry.{{r|stuff-2018-tully-eliminated}}

In late 2018, almost 20 years after the disappearance, Detective Inspector Murton announced that there had been advances in DNA testing that he hoped could lead to a break in the case. Items of evidence including the dog lead and underwear have been submitted for further testing at [[Institute of Environmental Science and Research|Environmental Science and Research]].&lt;ref name="herald-dec-2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bayer |first=Kurt |date=2018-12-02 |title=DNA could crack open Kirsty Bentley cold case 20 years after Ashburton schoolgirl's murder |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12168364 |work=nzherald.co.nz |location=[[Christchurch, New Zealand]] |access-date=2018-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case is still under active investigation, with Detective Inspector Murton stating in 2018 that, "the case is still open and being investigated."{{r|herald-dec-2018}}

'''''Li'l Abner''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] with a book by [[Norman Panama]] and [[Melvin Frank]], music by [[Gene De Paul]], and lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]]. Based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' by [[Al Capp]], the show is, on the surface, a broad [[parody|spoof]] of [[hillbilly|hillbillies]], but it is also a pointed [[satire]] on other topics, ranging from American politics and incompetence in the [[United States federal government]] to [[propriety]] and [[gender roles]].

After several other writers and composers considered musicalizing the comic strip, Al Capp finally made a deal in 1955 with the eventual creators for a musical to be financed by [[Paramount Pictures]], which wanted to follow the stage version with a film musical. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on November 15, 1956 and ran for a moderately successful 693 performances. The score and [[Michael Kidd]]'s choreography received critical praise, but some critics felt that the book's adaptation lost the spirit of the comic strip. Kidd and [[Edie Adams]], as Daisy Mae, won [[Tony Awards]], while newcomer [[Peter Palmer (actor)|Peter Palmer]], in the title role, won a [[Theatre World Award]]. Paramount released a [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|film version with the same title in 1959]], with most of the Broadway cast reprising their roles.

==History==
A musical version of the popular comic strip ''Li'l Abner'' was first planned in 1946, with the book to be written by the comic strip's author, Al Capp.&lt;ref name=Calta1946&gt;Calta, Louis. "Luckenbach Joins Producing Ranks", ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 14, 1946, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodgers and Hammerstein|Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II]] were named as potential producers, though reports did not state whether they intended to write the score.&lt;ref name=Calta1946/&gt; However, this version never materialized, and over the next several years, various authors and composers sought to musicalize ''Li'l Abner'', including writers Arnold Horwitt and [[Josh Logan]].&lt;ref&gt;Funke, Lewis. "News and Gossip Gathered on the Rialto", ''The New York Times'', February 13, 1949, p. X1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CaltaMar1953&gt;Calta, Louis. "'Li'l Abner' Bagged by Two Showmen", ''The New York Times'', March 17, 1953, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Alan Jay Lerner]] obtained the rights to the show from Al Capp; the three were to co-produce the show, with Schwartz writing the music and Lerner writing the book and lyrics&lt;ref name=CaltaMar1953/&gt; for an opening during the 1954–55 season.&lt;ref name=CaltaSep1953&gt;Calta, Louis. "Van Johnson Eyes 'Li'l Abner' Role", ''The New York Times'', September 26, 1953, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The familiar comic strip characters were to be retained but Li'l Abner and his longtime sweetheart Daisy Mae would not yet be married in the musical.&lt;ref name=CaltaSep1953/&gt; Hollywood star [[Van Johnson]] expressed interest in the title role, saying he would dye his hair black to match the comic strip character; he had not appeared on Broadway since the 1940 production of ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]''.&lt;ref name=CaltaSep1953/&gt; The Schwartz–Lerner version also fell through, but by the next year Lerner and composer [[Burton Lane]] planned to write the musical. Herman Levin would serve as producer, and rehearsals were scheduled to begin in November 1954.&lt;ref name=ZolotowJun1954&gt;Zolotow, Sam. "Lewis Wondering About 3 New Musicals", ''The New York Times'', June 21, 1954, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; However, later that year, Levin announced a musical version of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', by [[Lerner and Loewe]].&lt;ref name= ZolotowOct1954&gt;Zolotow, Sam.

In 1955, [[Norman Panama]] and [[Melvin Frank]] announced a ''Li'l Abner'' musical to open on Broadway in 1956, followed by a film of the musical.&lt;ref name=ZolotowMay1955&gt;Zolotow, Sam. "Musical Based on 'Li'l Abner'", ''The New York Times'', May 17, 1955, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The music was to be written by [[Gene de Paul]] with lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]]. De Paul and Mercer had previously written the score for the popular movie musical, ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''. [[Michael Kidd]], who had choreographed ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'', was to direct and choreograph ''Li'l Abner''.&lt;ref name=ZolotowMay1955/&gt; Al Capp approved the production and was to receive a share of any profits.&lt;ref name=ZolotowMay1955/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiler&gt;Weiler, A. H. "By Way of Report", ''The New York Times'', October 2, 1955, p. X7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramount Pictures]] was the sole backer of the musical and also paid $300,000 for its film rights, with Panama and Frank slated to adapt, direct, and produce the film version.&lt;ref name=Weiler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Thomas M. "Paramount Backs Musical Onstage", ''The New York Times'', December 19, 1955, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The producers conducted a long search for the actor to play the title role: over 400 actors auditioned for the part, and at one time, [[Dick Shawn]] was reported to be their preferred choice.&lt;ref&gt;Gelb, Arthur. "New Play Slated by Bloomgarden", ''The New York Times'', July 19, 1956, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calta, Louis. "Laughton Slated to Act and Direct", ''The New York Times'', June 28, 1956, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; However, the producers eventually chose unknown singer [[Peter Palmer (actor)|Peter Palmer]], who had been serving in an army entertainment unit; Panama and Frank saw him perform on a segment of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' featuring talented American soldiers.&lt;ref name=Hischak437&gt;Hischak, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ZolotowAug1956&gt;Zolotow, Sam. "Bert Lahr Signed for 'Grand Hotel'", ''The New York Times'', August 10, 1956, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer was a trained singer with a music degree from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], where he had also played football; at 6'4" and 228 pounds, Palmer had the right "look" to play Li'l Abner.&lt;ref name=Hischak437/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZolotowAug1956/&gt; The leading female role, Daisy Mae, was relatively easier to cast. The producers knew that they wanted soprano [[Edie Adams]], who had given a star-making performance as Eileen in the 1953 musical ''[[Wonderful Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotow, Sam. "'Major Barbara'" Lines Up Cast", ''The New York Times'', July 6, 1956, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom and Vlastnik, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, however, had also been offered the lead role in the original production of ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]''. Adams asked director [[George Abbott]], who had directed her in ''Wonderful Town'', which show she should choose, and he advised her to take Daisy Mae, which she subsequently did.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom and Vlastnik, p.323&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, Al Capp had been one of the three judges for the "[[Miss U.S. Television]]" contest broadcast on the [[DuMont Television Network]] in 1950 that first brought Adams national attention.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss U.S. Television of 1950: Edythe Adams," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 5 February 1951, 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act One===
"It's a Typical Day" as the citizens of Dogpatch, U.S.A. go about their daily activities. As usual, sweet, curvaceous Daisy Mae Scragg is pursuing Li'l Abner Yokum who, despite being a strapping, handsome young man, isn't interested in girls or employment. Abner's domineering, diminutive Mammy sends Daisy Mae to tell Abner to come to the Cornpone Meetin' in the town square. At the fishing hole with his friends, Abner lazily reflects that if he could be anyone in the world, he'd rather be himself ("If I had my Druthers"). Daisy Mae tells the young men about the meeting, and they rush into town. Daisy is frustrated because Abner has failed to take any romantic interest in her ("If I Had My Druthers" (reprise)).

The townspeople assemble for the Cornpone Meetin', where parson Marryin' Sam leads a celebration of Dogpatch's founder, "Jubilation T. Cornpone", a bumbling [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general whose leadership was more beneficial to the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] than to the [[Confederate States of America|South]]. Senator Fogbound, Dogpatch's U.S. congressman, tells the citizens that [[United States Congress|Congress]] has declared Dogpatch the most unnecessary town in the U.S., and so it must be evacuated to be used as a nuclear bomb test site. Everyone is thrilled that Dogpatch has been picked out of the entire U.S. ("Rag Offen the Bush"). But Earthquake McGoon reminds them that if they leave Dogpatch, the annual [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] race won't take place: in Dogpatch, the only way anyone can be married is if a young woman catches a boy on Sadie Hawkins Day. Daisy Mae's unscrupulous, filthy relatives, the Scraggs, give Earthquake permission to marry Daisy Mae (mostly due to the $1 bribe he gives them). The townspeople decide to save Dogpatch and Sadie Hawkins Day by proving there is something necessary in the town. Daisy Mae asks Abner if he will let her catch him on Sadie Hawkins Day and tries to persuade him that he deserves to marry a girl like her, and Abner agrees that she should marry a boy like him ("Namely You"). The townspeople lament that their beloved home has been declared an "Unnecessary Town".

[[File:Li'l Abner Broadway play Edie Adams 1956.JPG|thumb|260px|alt=refer to caption|[[Peter Palmer (actor)|Palmer]] as Li'l Abner and [[Edie Adams|Adams]] as Daisy Mae in the original production]]
It turns out that Mammy Yokum's Yokumberry Tonic, which she makes from the one-of-a-kind Yokumberry tree growing outside her home, is what has made Abner so strong and handsome. When a short, pudgy government scientist is given a spoonful, he turns into a tall, muscular man. Abner agrees to go to Washington, accompanied by Marryin' Sam, to present the government with the tonic for testing on the scrawny men of Dogpatch. There, greedy, tyrannical General Bullmoose wants to buy the formula for Yokumberry Tonic, and he is angry that Li'l Abner intends to turn the formula over to the government for free ("What's Good for General Bullmoose"). He hatches a dastardly scheme in which his girlfriend, [[femme fatale]] Appassionata Von Climax, will catch Abner on Sadie Hawkins Day. Once they're married, Bullmoose will kill Abner, and the formula will belong to his widow, Appassionata.

Abner and Marryin' Sam return to Dogpatch with the happy news that "The Country's In the Very Best of Hands". On Sadie Hawkins Day, General Bullmoose and Appassionata arrive in Dogpatch. They hire Evil Eye Fleagle to help Appasionata catch Abner. The race begins, and the young women of Dogpatch pursue the young men ("Sadie Hawkins Day" ballet). Though Daisy Mae, with the help of Stupefyin' Jones (any man who looks at her freezes), almost succeeds in catching Abner, Evil Eye Fleagle uses his evil eye to freeze everyone in the race, and Appasionata calmly walks up to Abner and claims him as hers.

===Act Two===
In Washington, the scientists testing Yokumberry Tonic dream of a time when life will be totally controlled by science ("Oh Happy Day"). In Dogpatch, Daisy Mae concludes that the reason she couldn't win Abner is that she, at age seventeen, is too old and no longer beautiful, and Marryin' Sam joins her lament ("I'm Past My Prime"). Mammy Yokum has a vision in which she sees Bullmoose and Apassionata's plot to kill Li'l Abner. Daisy Mae asks Earthquake McGoon to go to Washington, D.C. to save Li'l Abner, promising to marry him if he does.

In Washington, an engagement party is being held for Li'l Abner and Apassionata. General Bullmoose has Evil Eye Fleagle on hand; since Fleagle's evil eye can require him to do anything requested, Apassionata won't even have to marry Abner to get the formula. The General is planning to simply have Fleagle use his eye on Abner, get the formula for Yokumberry Tonic, and then order Abner to commit suicide. Mammy and Pappy Yokum, Earthquake, Daisy Mae, and the ladies of Dogpatch all show up to sabotage the party. When Fleagle tries to use his evil eye on Abner, Earthquake holds up a mirrored serving tray to protect himself, and the beam from Fleagle's eye bounces off the tray and rebounds onto General Bullmoose. Mammy Yokum questions the General, and he reveals the entire plot. The police arrest him and Apassionata.

The women of Dogpatch go to the laboratory to see the results of Yokumberry Tonic. Their scrawny husbands have been transformed into handsome men, but they have no interest in their wives. The scientists explain that this is an unfortunate side effect of the tonic; since it kills a man's romantic interests, it is of no use to the government. The women beg for the scientists to "Put 'Em Back" the way they were before they took the tonic. Daisy tells Abner that she's promised to marry Earthquake since he came to Washington and saved Abner, but she'd rather marry Abner ("Namely You" (reprise)). Softspoken Pappy Yokum tells Abner that he has a secret potion which will make Abner want to marry Daisy Mae. Abner agrees to take it once they get back to Dogpatch.

Back in Dogpatch, Marryin' Sam is officiating at Daisy Mae and Earthquake's wedding. Before the wedding, Daisy introduces her filthy relatives to Earthquake, saying that they'll be coming to live with them once they are married. Marryin' Sam begins the ceremony by warning Earthquake of the potential consequences of marriage ("The Matrimonial Stomp"). Abner and Pappy interrupt the ceremony, and Abner takes the potion (Pappy whispers to Mammy that it's really just water) and declares that he wants to marry Daisy Mae. Earthquake now happily relinquishes Daisy Mae to Abner. Men from the government arrive, warning that the atomic bombs will arrive soon. As the townspeople try to move the town's statue of Jubilation T. Cornpone, a plaque bearing a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] is revealed: because Cornpone's military blunders almost single-handedly allowed the North to win the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Dogpatch is designated a national shrine. The atomic bombs are cancelled, the scrawny men of Dogpatch return home to their happy wives, and the citizens of Dogpatch honor Jubilation T. Cornpone as Abner kisses Daisy Mae (Finale).

{{main|Li'l Abner (1959 film)}}
A [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|film]] based on the stage musical was made by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and released in 1959, with most of the Broadway cast reprising their roles. The film was shot to resemble a stage set, with the buildings and surroundings in two-dimensions, giving the sense of a "[[proscenium]] dividing audience and performer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=217939&amp;mainArticleId=217927 "Li'l Abner (1959)"] tcm.com, accessed August 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

===Critical reception===
;1956 Original Broadway Production
The 1956 original Broadway production opened to great praise for Michael Kidd's choreography, and the score was generally well received.&lt;ref name=Furia&gt;Furia, Philip. ''Skylark: the life and times of Johnny Mercer'' (2003), Macmillan, {{ISBN|0-312-28720-8}}, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; However, some critics thought that the creators of the musical had not effectively translated the original comic strip to the stage, and there was some critical disagreement about whether the satirical elements were effective. In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', for example, [[Walter Kerr]] praised Kidd's direction and choreography, saying that Kidd "knows how to set fists and feet pounding against the floor. ... Every time he does it the air sizzles and crackles". He also praised the score, stating, "Every time ... the orchestra strikes up for one of Johnny Mercer's and Gene de Paul's salutes to comic-strip fury, the beat is driving, the voices are clamoring. ... It's all done with zip and zingo".&lt;ref name=Suskin390&gt;Suskin, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Arthur Chapman|John Chapman]] of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' found ''Li'l Abner'' very enjoyable, stating, "I decided I was going to like it all very much soon after the curtain rose and this fetching little Edith Adams sidled up to this big hunk, Peter Palmer, and said, shyly, 'Abner, I brought you some worms.' There is a cast which is as remarkable for its ability to entertain as for its picturesqueness". He praised the satirical lyrics, stating, "Johnny Mercer's lyrics bring to mind the salty and saucy days of Lorenz Hart and Ira Gershwin [as they] jab at our personal and national foibles".&lt;ref name=Suskin388&gt;Suskin, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded Michael Kidd's choreography, stating, "If everyone in ''Li'l Abner'' were as talented as Michael Kidd, everything would be as brilliant as the ballets, and probably the world would be gayer, too. But it is difficult to make a fluent musical romance out of some characters who may have hearts of gold but are not very bright in the upper story".&lt;ref name=Suskin388/&gt; Atkinson thought the book of the musical was inferior to the choreography, stating that the book did "not have the lightness, simplicity, and speed of the Dogpatch folks. ... Mr. Kidd has caught the spirit of Dogpatch civilization brilliantly enough to suggest that ballet is a more suitable medium than words for animating Al Capp's cartoon drawings".&lt;ref name=Furia/&gt;

Tom Donnelly of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun]]'' thought that the production had not retained the spirit of the comic strip, stating, "Those aren't real Dogpatch people stompin' and whompin' and cavortin' across that stage. Those are (sob!) Broadway actors done up in funny looking costumes".&lt;ref name=Suskin390/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suskin388/&gt; He also thought that too much of the libretto was spent explaining the Dogpatch milieu, which Donnelly assumed would be familiar to most audience members since ''Li'l Abner'' was at that time a very popular comic strip.&lt;ref name=Suskin390/&gt; Conversely, John McClain of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' thought the show would have been incomprehensible to anyone not already familiar with the comic strip.&lt;ref name=Suskin390/&gt; McClain also thought the show's political satire was of "questionable taste", asserting, "it's poor timing to feature a song about 'The Country's in the Very Best of Hands', which attempts to show it isn't, and to haul out and shove all over the stage that dreary caricature of a relentless millionaire".&lt;ref name=Suskin390/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suskin391&gt;Suskin, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; However, McClain still concluded, "it is sure to be a great big hit. ''Li'l Abner'' is bountiful, lively, and tuneful".&lt;ref name=Suskin391/&gt;

;1998 Encores! Production
In his review of the 1998 ''Encores!'' production, Anthony Tommasini of ''The New York Times'' praised the production, calling it a "stylish revisiting", saying, "everything we have come to expect of [the ''Encores!'' series] is in evidence here: a fresh faced, multitalented cast; imaginative staging from the director, Christopher Ashley; careful attention ... to recreating the original orchestrations; stylish playing from the band, and wonderfully kinetic choreography".&lt;ref name=Tommasini&gt;Tommasini, Anthony. "Those Backwater Folks, Happily Dispensable", ''The New York Times'', March 28, 1998, p. B7&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Tommasini thought the show itself was flawed, pronouncing the book "dated-on-arrival" and saying, "Even in 1956 it must have been hard to find much satirical humor in [the plot]. Today it's downright creepy".&lt;ref name=Tommasini/&gt; He conceded that "the Mercer–De Paul has some tuneful gems" but opined that "Mercer's witty lyrics create a paradox for the actors: characters who sing clever lyrics inevitably sound clever. ...  So the score undermines the dimwitted characterizations".&lt;ref name=Tommasini/&gt; [[Irv Lichtman]] of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' favorably reviewed both the production and the show itself, saying the performance exemplified Encores' "utterly delightful, right-on-the-mark performances".&lt;ref name=Lichtman&gt;Lichtman, Irv. "'Li'l Abner' Deserves 'Encores!'; Vevel Links With Meshel's Co.", Words &amp; Music, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', April 18, 1998, Volume 110, No. 6; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "The successful but largely forgotten 1956 musical ''Li'l Abner'' is certainly not a dud, for it has good-natured energy and a bright and tuneful score by Gene DePaul and Johnny Mercer ... the show serves well as one of those solid "knockabout" shows Broadway turned out with regularity through the '50s".&lt;ref name=Lichtman/&gt; He praised the "playful zest" of the characterizations and "fine re-creations of the original choreography".&lt;ref name=Lichtman/&gt;

;2006 Goodspeed Revival
In ''The New York Times'' review of the 2006 Goodspeed production, Anita Gates generally approved of the new topical references added to the show, noting that "Scott Schwartz's colorful new production at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam has updated some of the political references, but the show's message – typified by the gullible Dogpatchers' song "The Country's in the Very Best of Hands" – remains the same".&lt;ref name=Gates&gt;Gates, Anita. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E5D61E3EF93BA15756C0A9609C8B63 "Those Backwater Folks in Dogpatch"], ''The New York Times'', May 28, 2006. Accessed May 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Gates stated that "the musical is cartoonish by definition and hardly one of Broadway's great treasures, but the show grows on you", opining that "most of the Johnny Mercer–Gene de Paul songs are forgettable, but "Namely Me" ... stands out".&lt;ref name=Gates/&gt; Frank Rizzo of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was more critical of the production, declaring, "even cartoon characters with a diminishing fan base should be shown some respect. This production, helmed with ever-increasing doses of exaggeration by Scott Schwartz, pushes the idiot quotient to new levels and overwhelms the piece's playful political commentary".&lt;ref name=Rizzo/&gt; He praised the show itself, asserting that it contained "many Mercer–de Paul gems in a tuneful, bright score".&lt;ref name=Rizzo/&gt; Rizzo stated that updating ''Li'l Abner'' was "not a bad idea, given that there are perennial themes ... that fit into today's social zeitgeist", but he thought that the updates had not been applied consistently, as the show had retained many 1950s references.&lt;ref name=Rizzo/&gt;

===History===
NASA's [[Lunar Prospector]], [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]], [[Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite]] (LCROSS), the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) and India's [[Chandrayaan-1]] lunar orbiters and other missions, confirmed both water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and hydroxyl (—OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) deposits at high latitudes on the lunar surface, indicating the presence of trace amounts of [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] or bound water are present,&lt;ref name="2013 proposal"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Lunar Flashlight: Mapping lunar surface volatiles using a CubeSat |url=http://sservi.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/7045.pdf |format=PDF |conference=Annual Meeting of the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (2013) |editor-last=Cohen |editor-first=Barbara A. |editor2-last=Sellar |editor2-first=R.

Lunar prospecting missions are intended to pave the way toward incorporating use of space resources into mission architectures. NASA's planning for eventual [[Human mission to Mars|human missions to Mars]] depends on tapping the local natural resources to make oxygen and propellant for launching the return ship back to Earth, and a lunar precursor mission is a convenient location to test such [[in situ resource utilization]] (ISRU) technology.&lt;ref name="SSERVI 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/nasa-looking-to-mine-water-on-the-moon-and-mars/ |title=NASA Looking to Mine Water on the Moon and Mars |work=Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute |publisher=NASA |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

The science goals are to investigate the distribution of [[Lunar water|water]] and other volatiles, as a function of time of day, latitude, and [[lunar soil]] composition.&lt;ref name="Gunters IceCube"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSU Selected"/&gt;

==Payload==
[[File:BIT-3 Iodine 60W with BHC-50E.jpg|thumb|Busek's iodine BIT-3 in operation]]
Lunar IceCube will include a version of the Broadband InfraRed Compact High Resolution Exploration Spectrometer (BIRCHES) instrument, developed by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center|GSFC]].&lt;ref name="August2015"/&gt; BIRCHES is a compact version of the volatile-seeking [[spectrometer]] instrument onbord the ''[[New Horizons]]'' Pluto flyby mission.&lt;ref name="MSU Selected"/&gt;

==Propulsion==

The tiny [[CubeSat]] spacecraft will make use of a miniature electric [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[ion engine]] system based on [[Busek]]'s 3&amp;nbsp;centimeter RF ion thruster, also known as BIT-3.&lt;ref name="MSU Selected"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Busek BIT-3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://busek.com/technologies__ion.htm |title=Busek Ion Thrusters |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes a solid [[iodine]] propellant and an inductively-coupled plasma system that produces 1.1&amp;nbsp;mN thrust and 2800 sec specific impulse from approximately 50W total input power.&lt;ref name="Busek BIT-3"/&gt; It will also use this engine for capture into lunar orbit, and orbit adjustments.&lt;ref name="MSU Selected"/&gt;  It is estimated the spacecraft will take about 3 months to reach the Moon.&lt;ref name="August2015"/&gt;

==Flight software==
The flight software is being developed in [[SPARK_(programming_language)|SPARK/Ada]] by the [[Vermont Technical College]] CubeSat Lab&lt;ref name="CubeSat Lab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cubesatlab.org/IceCube-Software.jsp|title=CubeSat Laboratory, Software Components|date=2017 |accessdate=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[SPARK_(programming_language)|SPARK/Ada]] has the lowest error rate of any computer language, important for the reliability and success of this complicated spacecraft.  It is used in commercial and military aircraft, air traffic control and high speed trains.  This is the second spacecraft using [[SPARK_(programming_language)|SPARK/Ada]], the first being the Basic Low Earth Orbit CubeSat&lt;ref name="BasicLEO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cubesatlab.org/BasicLEO.jsp|title=CubeSat Laboratory, Basic Low Earth Orbit mission|date=2017|accessdate=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; also by the Vermont Tech CubeSat Lab, the only fully successful university CubeSat out of 12 on the NASA ELaNa IV Air Force ORS-3 launch&lt;ref name="ElanaIV"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/past-elana-cubesat-launches|title=Past ElaNa CubeSat Launches|date=2017|accessdate=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Mangaung African Cultural Festival''' ('''MACUFE''') is an annual showcase of African arts, culture and various sports disciplines that takes place in [[Bloemfontein]], [[South Africa]]. It is one of the largest emerging festivals in Africa; it grew from having an audience of 30 000 in 1997 to 140 000 in 2015.&lt;ref name="drum.co.za"&gt;http://www.drum.co.za/entertainment/15-years-of-macufe-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival runs for 10 days beginning on the first week of October each year in the [[Free State]] province of South Africa.

MACUFE consists of a main musical festival, an arts and crafts exhibition, theatre productions, a beauty pageant, the Sparta Macufe Cup which is a soccer league at the Free State stadium and performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sa-venues.com/events/freestate/macufe-festival/|title=Macufe Festival|author=|date=|website=www.sa-venues.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosts an official corporate village where there are brand specific lounges, each with their own client service personnel.

==History==
Even though the unfolding of an arts festival platform after 1994 in the New South Africa was a key development in SA professional theatre, numerous festivals did relatively little to explore and celebrate black South African culture, theatre or productions. Every festival had a small number of black artists taking part in productions, and audiences included a few black theatre-goers, but the participation of the white and Western-oriented producers, as well as audiences, outweighed the contribution from black African and historically put artists and festival-goers at a disadvantage. Apart from some exceptional cases, [[English language|English]] and [[Afrikaans]] were used almost exclusively on the festival stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Mangaung_African_Cultural_Festival#Origins|title=Mangaung African Cultural Festival - ESAT|author=|date=|website=esat.sun.ac.za|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was launched in 1997 by the Free State Provincial Government to celebrate the best local and international African artists in various disciplines.&lt;ref name="drum.co.za"/&gt; At the announcement of the festival in 1997 the general manager of SABC2, Thaninga Msimango, declared that “the concept was initiated because there was no cultural festival that expressed the rich culture of indigenous South Africans.” The Free State MEC for sports, arts and culture, M.W. Molefe, added that “most popular and successful festivals in South Africa are focused on Eurocentric culture, paying scant regard to indigenous African culture". Officially dubbed an “African cultural festival”, rather than an “arts festival”, the intention was clear: to stage an event that would recognise and celebrate indigenous African cultural heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sleeping-out.co.za/events/macufe-festival-bloemfontein|title=The Macufe Festival 2016|author=|date=|website=Sleeping-OUT|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically as a balance to the other arts festivals which were perceived to do little in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Mangaung_African_Cultural_Festival#Aims|title=Mangaung African Cultural Festival - ESAT|author=|date=|website=esat.sun.ac.za|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2076">'''Olympic Day Run''' is an international Olympic Movement activity promoting mass participation of sports held in June organized by [[National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs).

The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) was formally established on 23 June 1894 through the efforts of [[Pierre de Coubertin]] promoting competitive sport as a revival of the ancient Olympic Games.

Due to World War II, Olympic Games had not been held in either 1940 or 1944. The city of London rose to host to the Games of the XIV after World War II. In January 1948, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved the idea of Olympic Day to commemorate the creation of the IOC on 23 June 1894 in Paris, a sort of “ birthday ” of the Olympic Movement at the 42nd IOC Session in St Moritz, Switzerland. Olympic Day was held for the first time on 23 June with a total of 9 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) hosting ceremonies in their respective countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Great Britain, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, Uruguay and Venezuela.

In 1987, in an effort to encourage all NOCs to commemorate and celebrate Olympic Day, the IOC Sport for All Commission launched the Olympic Day Run concept with the objective of promoting the practice of participation in sport by men, women and children from all corners of the world and all walks of life, regardless of athletic ability. The first Olympic Day Run was held in 1987, over a distance of 10&amp;nbsp;km, with 45 participating NOCs. In 2006, there were 161 NOCs promoting Olympic Day Run to their countrymen.

The Olympic Day Run is usually held during June 17–24 by NOCs, with 1.5&amp;nbsp;km '''Olympic Day Fun Run''', 5&amp;nbsp;km, and 10&amp;nbsp;km running activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5888">'''Ostrava Days''' is a three-week-long exposition of contemporary classical music that takes place biennially in the city of [[Ostrava]], [[The Czech Republic]]. The last season (2013) ran from August 12 to August 31, 2013.  The event is considered to be one of the largest of its type in the world. Ostrava Days exposition is organized by the Ostrava Center for New Music  (OCNM), an organization founded in 2000 by a Czech composer living in New York [[Petr Kotík]]. The institution was established solely for the purpose of organizing Ostrava Days, an event that consists of two parts—a summer institute and festival.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, Kurt (26 October 2011).

== Mission ==

The mission of the institute as well as of the festival is described by its founder Petr Kotík as follows. Ostrava Days "give composers, musicians and musicologists an opportunity to work with leading representatives of contemporary music". It is "a working and learning environment focused on orchestral composition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmusicostrava.cz/en/ostrava-days-institute/ Ostrava Days Institute]. newmusicostrava.cz. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==

The festival strives to achieve originality and dissociation from usual and rather mainstream type of programing often observed in the program brochures of other major festivals of classical music in The Czech Republic. Classics of new music are systematically offered along the side of numerous premieres of new works. Festival programs have included major works by composers such as: [[Morton Feldman]], [[John Cage]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Edgard Varese]], [[Galina Ustvolskaya]], [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]],&lt;ref&gt;Hicks,  Michael and Asplund, Christian (2012).

== Timeline ==

The exposition regularly lasts for three weeks in August. Two weeks  are devoted to the institute which events are open to official participants only. Over the course of these two weeks the participating composers, musicians and musicologists interact with each other by means of  attending a number of lectures, seminars, and presentations. They also compose and practice pieces to be presented during the final week of the forum.  The exposition opens to the public during its third week's festival. The festival offers a large number of concerts which program selected compositions by resident students, lecturers, guests, and others. Frank Kuznik, Editor-in-Chief and Culture Editor of ''[[The Prague Post]]'', described Ostrava Days in his blog ''Cultured Cleveland'' as a "gathering of students, players and composers modeled after [[Darmstadt School]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kuznik, Frank (29 September 2013). [http://www.culturedcleveland.blogspot.cz/2013/09/season-openers.html?m=1 "Season Openers"]". Cultured Cleveland .Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rey de Reyes''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was a [[professional wrestling]] event produced by the [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] (AAA) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], which took place on March 18, 2015 at the Auditorio Benito Juarez arena in [[Zapopan, Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. The show was the 19th event held under the [[Rey de Reyes]] name and also the 19th time that the eponymous Rey de Reyes tournament was held. The show was originally scheduled for Sunday March 15, 2015 but due to weather and problems with getting paperwork in order the show was postponed to March 18 instead. The main event marked the first time that [[Rey Mysterio Jr.]] wrestled after leaving [[WWE]] earlier in 2015. Rey Mysterio Jr. teamed up with [[Myzteziz]] to take on the [[tag team]] of [[El Hijo del Perro Aguayo]] and [[Pentagón Jr.]] in the main event of the show. Due to the dates moving the originally scheduled match between [[El Patrón Alberto]] and [[Brian Cage]] was canceled, replaced with a match between [[Blue Demon Jr.]] and [[Villano IV]].

===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] (AAA, or Triple A) has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 show was the 19th Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.   

The Rey de Reyes show was originally scheduled to take place on March 15, 2015, at the Plaza de Toros Nuevo Progreso [[bullfighting]] arena in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]],&lt;ref name=RDRCard2015&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/noticiasaaa/item/2097-cartel-completo-rey-de-reyes-2015.html | title=Cartel Completo: Rey de Reyes 2015 | publisher=Asistencia Asesoría y Administración | language=Spanish | accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, when Guadalajara was hit with a rainstorm, AAA postponed the event for 24 hours and moved it indoors to Auditorio Benito Juarez in Zapopan, Jalisco.&lt;ref name=RDRPostponed&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/118-daily-updates/41647-rey-de-reyes-postponed-due-to-storm | title=Rey de Reyes postponed due to storm | last=Meltzer | first=Dave | authorlink=Dave Meltzer | work=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | date=March 15, 2015 | accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day AAA announced that they were not able to get all permits in time for the show due to it being it being a national holiday, and once again postponed the show to Wednesday March 18 instead. At the same time they announced that the announced match between [[El Patrón Alberto]] and [[Brian Cage]] had been cancelled.&lt;ref name=RDRPostponedAgain&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2015/03/16/ultima-hora-aaa-rey-de-reyes-se-pospone-de-nuevo-para-el-miercoles-18-de-marzo/ | title=Última Hora: De nuevo AAA Rey de Reyes se pospone | date=March 16, 2015 | accessdate=March 16, 2015 | first=Eduardo | last=Cano Vela | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Patrón Alberto later stated that he was legally obligated to compete in Australia later in the week and thus was not able to work the Wednesday show for AAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/VivaDelRio/status/577812456342343681 | title=Aficionados @luchalibreaaa | date=March 17, 2015 | author=VivaDelRio | accessdate=March 17, 2015 | publisher=[[Twitter]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the March 16 show was postponed most of the wrestlers and AAA staff traveled back to Mexico by bus. During the trip one of the buses crashed into a stalled truck in [[Zinapécuaro]], [[Michoacán]], killing one member of the AAA staff, Irma Osorno, while several other staff members were either taken to a hospital or received medical attention at the scene of the accident.&lt;ref name=BusCrash&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2015/03/17/aparatoso-accidente-del-autobus-de-aaa-en-su-camino-de-guadalajara-a-la-ciudad-de-mexico/ | title=Aparatoso accidente del autobús de AAA en su camino de Guadalajara a la Ciudad de México  | date=March 17, 2015 | accessdate=March 19, 2015 | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazinw | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the tragic accident AAA dedicated the entire show to the memory of Irma Osorno.&lt;ref name=RdR2015SL/&gt;

'''Robert Yale Shulman''' (March 28, 1954 &amp;ndash; April 13, 2006) was an American [[serial killer]].  Shulman, a postal worker from [[Hicksville, New York]] on [[Long Island]], was convicted of murdering five [[prostitute]]s between 1991 and 1996, the year when he was arrested.&lt;ref name="nyt000105"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E1D6163BF936A35752C0A9669C8B63|title=An Inmate On Death Row Pleads Guilty In More Killings|last=McQuiston|first=John T.|date=2000-01-05|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Shulman was ultimately convicted of five murders.
*Lori Vasquez, killed August 1991.&lt;ref name="nyt000105" /&gt;
*Unidentified woman, killed June 1992, body dumped in Yonkers.&lt;ref name="nyt000105" /&gt;
*Unidentified woman ("Jane Doe Medford"), found 7 December 1994 in Medford. Beaten and dismembered.&lt;ref name="CA" /&gt;
*Lisa Ann Warner, found 6 April 1995 in Brooklyn, New York. Beaten and dismembered.&lt;ref name="CA" /&gt;
*Kelly Sue Bunting (aka "Melani"), last seen 8 December 1995, found in Brooklyn. Hands amputated; found wrapped in a sleeping bag.&lt;ref name="CA" /&gt;

==Investigation==
Looking for the murder site, a detective canvassing hotels heard about a man driving a blue Cadillac who cruised the area. Trying to track the man down with this information, women were located who led them, not to a hotel, but to a residence where a blue Cadillac was seen. The registration was obtained, and the car was registered to Shulman's brother. Trying to get information about the sleeping bag in which Bunting was found, detectives learned Sears was the only manufacturer. Sears was contacted to see if the brother had purchased one with a credit card. Sears said the brother had no card, but pointed out that Shulman had a card. This was how police were initially pointed towards Shulman as a possible culprit. Women later identified him as the man cruising in the Cadillac, and cadaver dogs signaled the possibility of dead remains having been present in the Cadillac. Police searched Shulman's work place and found trace evidence matching that found on the body. Shulman was arrested on 6 April 1996. After interrogation, Shulman confessed to the three murders. (Shulman confessed to the earliest two murders at a later date.) A search of his room revealed hundreds of bloodstains scattered over almost every surface.&lt;ref name="CA" /&gt;

==Trial and aftermath==

Shulman was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in 1999 for the only murder he committed after New York State reinstated the death penalty in 1995. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for his other murders because New York's death penalty law was not in effect at the time he committed them. His sentence was reduced to [[life in prison]] after the New York State Court of Appeals invalidated the death penalty in 2004.&lt;ref name="nyt000105" /&gt;

He died 13 April 2006 in Albany, New York of undisclosed causes.&lt;ref name="newsday110409"&gt;

Shulman's brother Barry was indicted on charges of hindering prosecution and unlawfully disposing of dead bodies.&lt;ref name="nydn960426" /&gt;

'''STS-41-D''' was the 12th flight of [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program]], and the first mission of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']]. It was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, on 30 August 1984, and landed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, on 5 September. Three commercial [[communications satellite]]s were deployed into orbit during the six-day mission, and a number of scientific experiments were conducted.

The mission was delayed by more than two months from its original planned launch date, having experienced the Space Shuttle program's first launch abort at T-6 seconds on 26 June 1984.

==Mission background==
The launch was originally planned for 25 June 1984, but because of a variety of technical problems, including rollback to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] to replace a faulty [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engine]], the launch was delayed by over two months.  The 26 June launch attempt marked the first time since [[Gemini 6A]] that a manned spacecraft had experienced a shutdown of its engines just prior to launch.

===June launch attempt===
During the 26 June launch attempt, there was a launch abort at T-6 seconds, followed by a pad fire about ten minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wylelabs.com/content/global/documents/Health%20Threats%20-%20Clark.pdf "Risk of Space Flight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228104253/http://www.wylelabs.com/content/global/documents/Health%20Threats%20-%20Clark.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }} (PDF).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mission Specialist Steve Hawley was reported as saying following the abort: "Gee, I thought we'd be a lot higher at MECO (Main Engine Cut-Off)!".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/roundup/online/2007/0607.pdf "Roundup"] (PDF). NASA. June 2007. Retrieved 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; About ten minutes later, the following was heard on live TV coverage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We have indication two of our fire detectors on the zero level; no response. They're side by side right next to the engine area. The engineer requested that we turn on the heat shield fire water which is what could be seen spraying up in the vicinity of the engine engine bells of ''Discovery'''s three main engines."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While evacuating the shuttle, the crew was doused with water from the pad deluge system, which was activated due to a hydrogen fire on the launch pad caused by the free hydrogen (fuel) that had collected around the engine nozzles following the shutdown and engine anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collectspace.com/ubb/Forum40/HTML/000018.html "Photo of the week 19 (8 August)"]. CollectSpace. Retrieved 21 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the fire was invisible to humans, had the astronauts used the normal emergency escape procedure across the service arm to the slidewire escape baskets, they would have run into the fire.&lt;ref name="walker20050317"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Oral History Transcript | date=17 March 2005 | accessdate=29 December 2011 | last=Walker | first=Charles D. | interviewer=Ross-Nazzal, Jennifer | work=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to procedures resulting from the abort included more practicing of "safing" the orbiter following aborts at various points, the use of the fire suppression system in all pad aborts, and the testing of the slidewire escape system with a real person ([[Charles F. Bolden, Jr.]]). It emerged that launch controllers were reluctant to order the crew to evacuate during the STS-41-D abort, as the slidewire had not been ridden by a human.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Examination of telemetry data indicated that the engine malfunction had been caused by a stuck valve that prevented proper flow of LOX into the combustion chamber.

==Mission summary==
STS-41-D finally launched on 8:41&amp;nbsp;am EDT on 30 August after a six-minute, 50-second delay when a private aircraft flew into the restricted airspace near the launch pad. It was the fourth launch attempt for ''Discovery''. Because of the two-month delay, the STS-41-F mission was cancelled (STS-41-E had already been cancelled), and its primary payloads were included on the STS-41-D flight. The combined cargo weighed over {{convert|41184|lbs|kg}}, a record for a Space Shuttle payload up to that time.

The six-person flight crew consisted of Henry W. Hartsfield, Jr., commander, making his second shuttle mission; pilot Michael L. Coats; three mission specialists – Judith A. Resnik, Richard M. Mullane and Steven A. Hawley; and a payload specialist, Charles D. Walker, an employee of [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Walker was the first commercially sponsored payload specialist to fly aboard the Space Shuttle. Resnik became the second American woman to fly any NASA space mission, after [[Sally K. Ride]].

''Discovery''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s primary cargo consisted of three commercial [[communications satellite]]s: SBS-D for [[Satellite Business Systems]], [[Telstar]] 3C for [[Telesat]] of Canada, and [[Syncom]] IV-2, or Leasat-2, a Hughes-built satellite leased to the [[US Navy]]. Leasat-2 was the first large communications satellite designed specifically to be deployed from the Space Shuttle. All three satellites were deployed successfully and became operational.

Another payload was the OAST-1 [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]], a device {{convert|13|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|102|ft|m}} high, which folded into a package {{convert|7|in|mm}} deep. The array carried a number of different types of experimental [[solar cell]]s and was extended to its full height several times during the mission. At the time, it was the largest structure ever extended from a manned spacecraft, and it demonstrated the feasibility of large lightweight solar arrays for use on future orbital installations, such as the [[International Space Station]].

The [[McDonnell Douglas]]-sponsored Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) experiment, using living cells, was more elaborate than the one flown on previous missions, and payload specialist Walker operated it for more than 100 hours during the flight. A student experiment to study [[crystal]] growth in [[microgravity]] was also carried out. The highlights of the mission were filmed using an [[IMAX]] motion picture camera, and later appeared in the 1985 documentary film ''[[The Dream is Alive]]''. Because of an obstruction in the shuttle's external wastewater dumping system, a two-foot "[[urine|pee]]-sicle" formed during the mission; Hartsfield removed it with the [[Remote Manipulator System]].&lt;ref name="walker20050414"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Oral History Transcript | date=14 April 2005 | accessdate=29 December 2011 | last=Walker | first=Charles D. | interviewer=Johnson, Sandra | work=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission lasted 6 days, 00 hours, 56 minutes, 04 seconds, with landing taking place on Runway 17 at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] at 6:37&amp;nbsp;am PDT on 5 September 1984. During STS-41-D, ''Discovery'' traveled a total of {{convert|2490000|mi|km}} and made 97 orbits. The orbiter was transported back to KSC on 10 September. Ominously, STS-41-D was the first Shuttle mission in which blow-by damage to the SRB O-rings was discovered, with a small amount of soot found beyond the primary O-ring. Following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger tragedy]], [[Morton Thiokol]] engineer Brian Russell called this finding the first "big red flag" on SRB Joint and O-ring safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|authorlink=Diane Vaughan|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|pages=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpoc-vWvF_IC&amp;pg=PA490&amp;dq=sts-9#v=onepage&amp;q=sts-9&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission insignia==
The 12 stars within the blue field indicate the flight's original numerical designation as STS-12 in the Space Transportation System's mission sequence. A representation of ''Discovery's'' namesake is manifested in a sailing ship, which is linked to the Shuttle (with the OAST solar array in the payload bay) via a red, white, and blue path, signifying its maiden voyage.

==Wake-up calls==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the [[Gemini program]], and first used music to wake up a flight crew during [[Apollo 15]]. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">The '''Sanibel Symposium''' is an international [[Academic conference|scientific conference]] in [[quantum chemistry]], [[solid-state physics]], and [[quantum biology]]. It has been organized by the Quantum Theory Project at the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], [[United States]], every winter since 1960. It was founded by [[Per-Olov Löwdin]] who was involved in its organization every year from 1960 to his death in 2000. From 1960 to 1978, the symposium was held on [[Sanibel Island]], but later symposia have been held in [[Palm Coast, Florida|Palm Coast]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. In 2005, the Symposium moved to [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons Island, Georgia, United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qtp.ufl.edu/sanibel/history.shtml History of Sanibel Symposium] Last Accessed December 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Symposium is noted for its long history and for the breadth of both the participants and the presentations. The 2010 meeting covers "Forefront theory and computation in quantum chemistry, condensed matter and chemical physics, nanoscience, quantum biochemistry and biophysics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qtp.ufl.edu/sanibel/downloads/poster.pdf 50th Sanibel Symposium poster]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed December 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanibel Symposium is described as a "highly respected regular conference" in a history of the [[Gordon Research Conferences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.iupui.edu/rcc/grccchist.html A Brief History of the Gordon Research Conference on Computational Chemistry] Accessed January 10, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanibel Coefficients, used for example in calculated spin densities, were named after the Symposium where they were widely discussed in the 1960s.

Lectures and posters presented at the meeting are often published in the peer-reviewed journal "[[International Journal of Quantum Chemistry]]" as one or more issues of the journal. Before 1996, papers were published in special supplements of the Journal for Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Biology.

The '''Smile Jamaica Concert''' was a [[concert]] held on December 5, 1976, at the [[National Heroes Park]], [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]], performed by [[Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers]]. Marley originally agreed to perform one song for the 80,000 people in attendance; however, it turned into a whole 90-minute performance—despite his injuries sustained two days earlier when he had almost been killed by gunmen in his own house. 

All Wailers performed except bassist Aston "Familyman" Barrett, who was replaced by Cat Coore of [[Third World (band)|Third World]].

==Overview==
The performance included a horn section. 
The set list for the show was as follows
1.  War/ No More Trouble/ Get Up Stand Up
2.  Crazy Baldhead/ Positive Vibration
3.  Smile Jamaica
4.  Rat Race
5.  TrenchTown Rock
6.  Keep on Moving
7.  Want More
8.  Them Belly Full
9.  Jah Live
10. Rastaman Chant
11. Rebel Music
12. So Jah Seh

After the concert Marley left Jamaica for [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and later [[London]] where he stayed for 16 months until he returned in 1978 for the [[One Love Peace Concert]].

The second '''Smile Jamaica Concert''' was held February 10, 2008{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==In popular culture==
Jamaican Television has a morning show named [[Smile Jamaica]], an obvious nod to the popularity of the concert series.

Stir It Up: The CIA Targets Jamaica, Bob Marley and the Progressive Manley Government, an alternative historical novel by David Dusty Couples, weaves fact and fiction to dramatize the concert.

The novel ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' by [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]] dramatizes the attempt on Marley's life, including other events leading up to the Smile Jamaica concert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobmarley.com/life/live/smilejamaica/ BobMarley.com - Smile Jamaica Concert 1976] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505201726/http://www.bobmarley.com/life/live/smilejamaica/ |date=2006-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Population transfer}}
{{History of Moldova}}
The '''[[USSR|Soviet]] deportations from [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]]''' took place between late 1940 and 1951 and were part of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Soviet power (see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]). The deported were typically moved to so-called "special settlements" (спецпоселения) (see ''[[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]]'').

The deportations began after the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], which occurred in June 1940. According to a secret Soviet ministry of interior report dated December 1965, 46,000 people were deported from [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]] for the period 1940—1953.{{sfn|Mawdsley|1998|p=73}}

==1940–1941==
In 1940, after the Romanian government, as a result of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], was forced to accept the Soviet ultimatum and withdrew from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, these regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]], most of the former being organized as the [[Moldavian SSR]], while the other areas were attributed to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. 

On June 12&amp;ndash;13, 1941,  29,839 members of families of "counter-revolutionaries and nationalists" from the [[Moldavian SSR]], and from the [[Chernivtsi]] (of [[Northern Bukovina]]) and [[Izmail]] oblasts of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] were deported to [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Komi Republic|Komi ASSR]], the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], and the [[Omsk]] and [[Novosibirsk]] oblasts. For the fate of such a deportee from Bessarabia, see the example of [[Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya]]. The Georgian NKVD official [[Sergo Goglidze]], trusted henchman of [[Lavrenty Beria]], was in charge of this deportation from Bessarabia.

===Forced labor===
During 1940 and 1941, 53,356 people from [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]] were deported to the [[Gulag]] forced-labor camp system across the entire territory of the Soviet Union, most of them living and working in poor conditions.&lt;ref name=Casu43&gt;{{cite book|last=Caşu|first=Igor|title=Stalinist Terror in Eastern Europe|year=2010|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719077760|url=https://www.academia.edu/377403/Stalinist_Terror_in_Soviet_Moldavia_1940-1953|editor1-first=Kevin|editor1-last=McDermott|editor2-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Stibbe|accessdate=17 January 2014|chapter=Stalinist Terror in Soviet Moldavia|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Professor [[Rudolph Rummel]] estimated that in 1940 – 1941, 200,000 to 300,000 Romanian Bessarabians were persecuted, conscripted into forced labor camps, or deported with the entire family, of whom 18,000 to 57,000 did not survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. J. Rummel]], [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/USSR.TAB6A.GIF Table 6.A. 5,104,000 victims during the pre-World War II period: sources, calculations and estimates], Freedom, Democracy, Peace; Power, Democide, and War, University of Hawaii.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some estimates, 12% of the population of the two provinces was killed and deported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/en_gb/the_genocide_of_romanians_in_northern_bukovina-2547072 The Genocide of Romanians in Northern Bukovina]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1942==
On  June 22, 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], together with several other countries, including [[Romania]] (which had the primary objective of reintegrating Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina into the Romanian state), attacked the Soviet Union (see [[Operation Barbarossa]]).  After the start of the war, further mass deportations occurred in the USSR. In April 1942, Romanians deportees and some other nationalities were deported again from [[Crimea]] and the [[North Caucasus]]. In June 1942, Romanians and others were also deported from [[Krasnodar Krai]] and the [[Rostov Oblast]].

==1949==
On April 6, 1949, the Political Bureau of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] issued decision number 1290-467cc, which called for  11,280 families from [[Moldavian SSR]] to be deported as [[kulak]]s or collaborators with the [[Nazi Germany|"German fascists occupier"]] during [[World War II]]. Ultimately, 11,239 families, comprising 35,050 persons were detained and deported on July 6, 1949, with the rest either escaping or being exempt due to their contribution to the Soviet war effort or their support for [[collectivisation]].&lt;ref name=Casu49&gt;{{cite book|last=Caşu|first=Igor|title=Stalinist Terror in Eastern Europe|year=2010|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719077760|url=https://www.academia.edu/377403/Stalinist_Terror_in_Soviet_Moldavia_1940-1953|editor1-first=Kevin|editor1-last=McDermott|editor2-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Stibbe|accessdate=17 January 2014|chapter=Stalinist Terror in Soviet Moldavia|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1951==
{{Main|Operation North}}
On February 19, 1951, [[Viktor Abakumov]] delivered to Stalin a secret notice which listed the planned numbers of deported "Jehovists" from [[Ukraine]], [[Belorussia]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Moldova]], with 1,675 persons (670 families) listed for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krotov.info/history/20/1951iego.html "Recalling Operation North"], by Vitali Kamyshev, "Русская мысль", Париж, N 4363, 26 April 2001 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, the [[USSR Council of Ministers]] issued the corresponding decree, followed by an order of the Ministry of State Security of February 6.&lt;!--maybe 6 march ?--&gt; On March 24, the Council of Ministers of the Moldavian SSR issued the decree on the confiscation and selling of the property of the deportees. Operation North started at 4:00 am on April 1, 1951, and the round-ups continued until April 2. The deportees were classified as "[[special settler]]s".&lt;ref name=passat&gt;Валерий Пасат ."Трудные страницы истории Молдовы (1940-1950)". Москва: Изд. Terra, 1994 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, from the Moldavian SSR, there were 723 families (2,617 persons) deported on the night of March 31 to April 1, 1951, all members of neoprotestant sects, mostly [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and qualified as religious elements considered a potential danger for the Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Comisia Prezidenţială pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din România: Raport Final'' / ed.: Vladimir Tismăneanu, Dorin Dobrincu, Cristian Vasile, Bucureşti: Humanitas, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-50-1836-8}}, p. 754 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elena Şişcanu, ''Basarabia sub ergimul bolşevic (1940-1952)'', Bucureşti, Ed.

The '''Sphere Project'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/  Sphere Project]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 1997 to develop a set of minimum standards in core areas of humanitarian assistance.  The aim of the project is to improve the quality of assistance provided to people affected by disasters, and to enhance the accountability of the humanitarian system in disaster response.  One of the major results of the project has been the publication of the handbook, ''Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/  Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang%2CEnglish/ |date=2006-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The 1990s saw a rapid increase in the international activities of humanitarian agencies.  This was particularly the case during [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]] in 1994.  A growing number of donor and NGO evaluations were critical of the responses and actions of many NGOs.  There was growing discussion among humanitarian agencies about the lack of standards for providing humanitarian assistance.  Some of the preliminary conclusions of the multi-donor Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/nordic/ The International Response to Conflict and Genocide:Lessons from the Rwanda Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; were critical of the performance of humanitarian agencies in the Great Lakes crisis.  A number of agencies felt that it was time to get their own houses in order and explored the idea of formulating standards for humanitarian response.

==Original sponsors and observers==
Simultaneously, in 1996, discussions were taking place within InterAction and the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response ([[SCHR]]) about a project for setting standards.  The members of both organizations decided that it would be a good idea to pool their resources and set up a joint project.  Thus, in 1997, the Sphere Project was set up with a management committee made up of representatives from each of the SCHR members and representatives from [[InterAction (organization)|InterAction]].  More than 25 percent of the funds for the first phase of the project came from the member agencies of the management committee and the rest from a few government donors.  From the beginning, three observers were invited to fully participate in the work of the management committee.

Sponsors:
*[[SCHR]] ([[CARE (relief)|Care International]], [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas Internationalis]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], [[International Save the Children Alliance]], [[Lutheran World Federation]], [[Oxfam]], [[World Council of Churches]], and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]])&lt;ref&gt;Walker and Purdin wrongly indicate that MSF only joined the SCHR and the Sphere Project half way through the process.  MSF joined the [[SCHR]]in July 1997 and was a sponsor of the Sphere Project from the beginning, paying their assessed contributions for both Phases 1 and 2. They withdrew from the project at the end of Phase 2. [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0361-3666.2004.00246.x Peter Walker, Susan Purdin (2004) Birthing Sphere.

==Project==
Objective: "The project objective is to develop a humanitarian charter and associated set of minimum standards in collaboration with leading NGOs, interested donor governments and UN agencies, to both disseminate the resultant products widely within the international humanitarian system and to encourage their formal adoption and practice by relief agencies and their donors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/about/ph1_proposal.htm Sphere Project Proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211947/http://www.sphereproject.org/about/ph1_proposal.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997, the first phase of one year of the project began.

Five sectors were chosen to cover the basic sectors in humanitarian response:
*water supply and sanitation
*nutrition
*food aid
*shelter and site planning
*health services

==Phase 1 July 1997 to October 1998==

===Setting minimum standards===
Five sector committees were formed, each with a manager seconded by one of the sponsoring agencies. The sector committees were made up of experts drawn not only from NGOs, but also from the Red Cross and Inter-governmental agencies such as the UNHCR, WHO, and WFP. The sector committees formulated minimum standards of assistance for each of the sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/handbook/html/0_cont.htm Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609035421/http://www.sphereproject.org/handbook/html/0_cont.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the project was that the setting up of minimum standards would help to improve accountability and the overall quality of humanitarian response to those affected by disasters.

===Humanitarian charter===
In early 1998, a working group was established to draft the ''Humanitarian Charter''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/handbook/html/2_hc.htm Humanitarian Charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320032334/http://www.sphereproject.org/handbook/html/2_hc.htm |date=2007-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its final draft highlighted the importance of three principles in particular:
* the right to life with dignity,
* the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, and
* the principle of [[non-refoulement]].

By May 1998, a draft edition of the handbook was posted on the Internet for comments.  Phase 1 was extended by four months to October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;For more detailed descriptions see: [http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/working_papers/wp215.pdf Buchanan-Smith, Margie (2003);  How the Sphere Project Came into Being. ODI Working Paper 215, July 2003] {{ISBN|0-85003-665-8}}   and [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0361-3666.2004.00246.x Peter Walker, Susan Purdin (2004) Birthing Sphere. Disasters 28 (2), 100–111]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase 2 November 1998 to January 2000==
Phase 2 of the project was initiated in November focusing on the publication and dissemination of the standards and the development of training materials. In December, a first draft was published and launched both in Washington, DC, and London. The first draft notes that it was drawn up with the work of some 641 named individuals (plus countless unnamed persons), drawn from 228 organizations, including NGOs, the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement, academic institutions, the United Nations and governmental agencies. It was posted on the Sphere Project site to allow for wide feedback.

===Training===
Phase 2 saw the development of extensive training material for using the handbook.  The training program focuses "mainly on the day-to-day work of the individual humanitarian practitioner." The main method is to use workshops for humanitarian field staff to facilitate the practical application of the minimum standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odihpn.org/download.asp?id=2209&amp;ItemURL=documents/humanitarianexchange017.pdf Lowry, Sean; Sphere at the end of phase II.

==Phase 3 November 2000 to December 2004==

The handbook was completely revised and a second edition was launched in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/about/nl16.htm Sphere Project Newsletter No. 16 (February 2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423102817/http://www.sphereproject.org/about/nl16.htm |date=2007-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition an extensive external evaluation was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/98/67/lang,English/ |title=Sphere External Evaluation |access-date=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317221847/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/98/67/lang,English/ |archive-date=2007-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a project, Sphere came to an end in 2004.

==A new form==
Today, the Sphere Project has taken on a new form, with an expanded board of 14 members replacing the project's management committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/92/59/ Sphere Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318104646/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/92/59/ |date=2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its focus "has shifted towards facilitating the work of people already using and promoting Sphere at national and regional levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/dmdocuments/board/Sphere%20Project%20governance%20structure-%20version%20jan07.pdf The Sphere Project Governance Structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212530/http://www.sphereproject.org/dmdocuments/board/Sphere%20Project%20governance%20structure-%20version%20jan07.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
From the beginning, a decision was made that an important part of the funding would come from the sponsoring agencies themselves, with the remainder made up of funds from governmental agencies. A little over a quarter of the funds for phase 1 came from the SCHR and InterAction with the rest coming from 10 governments.  As the budget expanded in Phases 2 and 3, so did the number of government donors, shifting the balance, with governments contributing about 85% of the funds for the latter two phases.

==Issues==

===French agencies===
In 1998, there was public criticism of the Sphere Project from a number of French humanitarian NGOs. They felt that Sphere was too focused on the technical aspects of humanitarian response and could easily ignore non-quantifiable aspects such as solidarity and witnessing.  It also could devalue efforts of the affected population to solve their own problems.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/109783801066.htm Gidley, Ruth: "Critics find fault with Sphere standards for relief work" AlertNet, 15 October 2004] and [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118780308/PDFSTART  Charlotte Dufour, Véronique de Geoffroy, Hugues Maury, François Grunewald, In: Disasters, Volume 28 (2), June 2004, pp. 124-141.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSF===
Within the Sphere Project management committee, MSF was also critical of the project, fearing that it reduced humanitarian response "to a simple mechanical and material exercise, devoid of its humanitarian ethos." There was a risk that by focusing on standards it could reduce humanitarian action to business to be performed only according to technical standards. At the end of Phase 2, MSF decided that it would not participate in Phase 3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050108170748/http://www.msf.fr/documents/base/2003-03-25-VilaSanJuan.pdf MSF Position vis a vis the Sphere Project] For an extensive discussion of the MSF position see: [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118780311/PDFSTART Jacqui Tong: Questionable Accountability: MSF and Sphere in 2003 in Disastrs, Volume 28 (2), June 2004, 176-189]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8405">'''"They have pierced my hands and my feet"''' is a phrase that occurs in some English translations of {{bibleref2|Psalm|22:16}} (Psalm 21:17 in the Greek [[Septuagint]] and Latin [[Vulgate]]). The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is obscure at this point, and Jewish and some Christian commentators translate this line differently, although there is no evidence of a deliberate mistranslation.

==Text of Psalm 22:16 (21:17)==
This verse, which is Psalm 22:17 in the [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Hebrew verse numbering]], reads in the [[Masoretic Text]] as: כארי ידי ורגלי, which may be read literally as "like a lion my hands and my feet". The full verse of the Masoretic text reads: {{Script/Hebrew|כִּ֥י סְבָב֗וּנִי כְּלָ֫בִ֥ים עֲדַ֣ת מְ֭רֵעִים הִקִּיפ֑וּנִי כָּ֝אֲרִ֗י יָדַ֥י וְרַגְלָֽי}} (''Kî sĕḇāḇûnî kĕlāḇîm 'ăḏaṯ mĕrē'îm hiqqîpûnî kā'ărî yāḏay wĕraglāy'').

When translated into English, the syntactical form of this Hebrew phrase appears to be lacking a verb. In this context the phrase was commonly explained in [[targum|early Rabbinical paraphrases]] as "they bite like a lion my hands and my feet".

The [[Septuagint]], a Jewish translation of the Hebrew Bible into [[Koine Greek]] made before the [[Common Era]], has ωρυξαν χειράς μου και πόδας ("they have dug my hands and feet"), which Christian commentators argue could be understood in the general sense as "pierced". This reading was retained by Saint [[Jerome]] in his translation from the Greek [[Hexapla]] into the Latin of his Gallican Psalter (''Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos'') which was incorporated into both the Vulgate and the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]].

[[Aquila of Sinope]], a 2nd-century CE Greek convert to Christianity and later to [[Judaism]], undertook two translations of the Psalms from Hebrew to Greek. In the first, he renders the verse "they disfigured my hands and feet"; in the second he revised this to "they have bound my hands and feet".

The [[Jewish Publication Society]] translates the phrase a "Like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet".

==English translations==
Some English language translations, primarily those translated by or for Christian communities, render the text as: "They have pierced my hands and my feet" although English translations are not uniform in this rendering. Versions translated outside of Christian circles, such as the Jewish Publication Society and The Judaica Press, use different English renderings based on the Hebrew text rather than the Greek.

|}

The Vespasian Psalms use ''dulfun'', the preterite form of the Old English strong verb ''delfan'' (to dig). Wycliffe's Bible of 1395 uses ''delueden'', an alternate spelling of "delveden", the preterite form of the Middle English weak verb ''delven''. Modern English uses the late Middle English form, "delve". The archaic meaning of "delved" is to dig or excavate, a literal translation of the Latin Vulgate term ''foderunt'' (from Jerome's Hexaplar Psalms), from ''fodio'', I dig. Miles Coverdale in 1535, likely influenced by Luther's German translation as ''durchgraben'' (dig through, penetrate), chooses ''pearsed'' (pierced); and this has been retained in the majority of subsequent English versions.

==Explanations and interpretations==
[[Rashi]] follows the [[Masoretic Text]] and paraphrases the phrase as "like lions (they maul) my hands and my feet."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite journal |first=Brent A. |last=Strawn |title=Psalm 22:17b: More Guessing |journal=[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]] |volume=119 |year=2000 |issue=3 |pages=439–451 [p. 442] |jstor=3268408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashi bases his translation of Psalm 22:16/17 on the other uses of the phrase (כָּ אֲרִי) ''ka'ari'' throughout the biblical text. Rashi cites Isaiah 38:13, in which translators uniformly render כָּאֲרִי as “like/as a lion”.

The Masoretic Text [[niqqud|points]] כָּאֲרִי as a phrase: the prefix כָּ  denotes "like" or "as", and ארי "lion".  A variant form of the word for lion ( אריה ) ''arie'' occurs twice in Psalm 22, in verses 13/14 and 21/22.

To explain how divergent translations from the biblical text came about, Gregory Vall, a Christian professor of Religious Studies at [[Trinity Western University]], speculated that the Septuagint translators were faced with כארו; i.e. as in the Masoretic text, but ending with the longer letter ''vav'' ('''ו''') rather than the shorter ''yod'' ('''י'''), giving כארו ''ka'aru''. This is not a word in the Hebrew language, but without the [[aleph]] it becomes כרו, "dug", "mined", or "excavated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gregory |last=Vall |title=Psalm 22:17b: The Old Guess |journal=JBL |volume=116 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=45–56 [p. 45] |jstor=3266745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical and Hebrew scholars, such as Brent Strawn, support the Masoretic Text reading  of כארי ("like a lion"), based on textual analysis (i.e. derivatives of the word "lion" appear numerous times in the psalm and are a common metaphor in the Hebrew Bible), as well as its appearance in virtually every ancient Hebrew manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Strawn (2000), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this is a Psalms fragment from [[Discoveries in the Judaean Desert|Nahal Hever]], where the word in question is written as כארו, ''karu'', which becomes "dug" when omitting the aleph, as Vall had previously speculated. This finding is called into question by the Nahal Hever scribe's other numerous misspellings, such as one in the very same sentence, where  ידיה is written instead of the correct ידי, making the Hebrew word ידי ''yadai'' "my hands" into ידיה ''yadeha'', “her hands".&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth and others, in consultation with J VanderKam and M Brady. Miscellaneous Texts from the Judaean Desert. DJD XXXVIII. Oxford: Clarendon, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peter Craigie]]'s view, "MT’s כָּאֲרִי ('like a lion') presents numerous problems and can scarcely be correct." Reading the consonantal text כארו or כרו, he says that the Septuagint “they pierced my hands and feet” (ὤρυξαν) "may perhaps presuppose a verb כרה, 'to dig,' or כור, 'to pierce, bore'." Craigie notes alternative possibilities for the verb אָרָה (“to pluck, pick clean”), or כרה, “to be shrunken, shriveled”, but follows E. J. Kissane's proposal of an original text כלו, “consumed”, changed to כרו (noting the occasional interchange of ל and ר), with the nuance "my hands and my feet were exhausted".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Craigie]]. ''Word Biblical Commentary: Psalms 1–50.'' Word, Incorporated, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8499-0218-5}}. Pages 195–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation "they have pierced" is preferred by many Christian commentators for its [[christological]] implications. For example, [[Craig Blomberg]], commenting on the allusions to [[Psalm 22]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], includes "he is surrounded by wicked onlookers (22:16a) who pierce his hands and feet (22:16b)" among "an astonishing number of close parallels to the events of Jesus' crucifixion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beale &amp; Carson, eds.|title=[[Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament]]|page=99, on {{bibleverse||Matthew|27|NIV}}:46 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phrase is not quoted directly in the [[New Testament]], despite the Septuagint Greek reading "dug" that might be thought to prefigure the piercing of Jesus' hands and feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">[[File:Lockerbie disaster memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A memorial is often established to remember lives lost in a tragedy such as the [[Lockerbie air disaster]]]]
A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W.

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
