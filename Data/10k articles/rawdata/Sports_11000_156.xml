'''Barker's Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Leicester]], [[Leicestershire]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1825, when Leicester played [[Sheffield Cricket Club|Sheffield]].  The first [[first-class cricket|first-class match]] came in 1836, when the [[North of England cricket team|North]] played the [[South of England cricket team|South]]; the South won by 218 runs, largely due to [[Alfred Mynn]]'s two not out innings.&lt;ref&gt;Firth (1926)&lt;/ref&gt;   The North used the ground for 4 further first-class matches up to 1846, including the ground's final first-class match between the North and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].  [[Midland Counties cricket team|Midland Counties]] played a single first-class match at Barker's Ground against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/574_f.html First-Class Matches played on Barker's Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The final recorded match on the ground saw Leicestershire play an [[All-England Eleven]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/574_misc.html Other matches played on Barker's Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The owner of the ground was "Old Barker", the landlord of the Anchor Inn, Halford Street, who did very well from the gate money. The ground was sited on the east side of Wharf Street, near the Humberstone Road.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. (1926) ''Highways and Byways in Leicestershire''. London: Macmillan; p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the final recorded match held at Barker's Ground, it was sold for building.  Today, the ground would be located along Wharf Street, which is in the centre of Leicester.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11115">'''Baseball Think Factory''', abbreviated as '''BTF''' or '''BBTF''', is a [[sabermetrics|sabermetrically]]-oriented [[baseball]] web site that features daily news stories in baseball, with original content contributed by [[SABR]] members such as [[Dan Szymborski]]. The site was previously branded as ''Baseball Primer'', and was created in 2001 by the founders of [[Baseball-Reference]]. Contributors who have gone on to work for [[Major League Baseball]] front offices include [[Voros McCracken]],&lt;ref name="voros"&gt;{{cite news |first = Gordon|last = Edes |url = http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/07/18/figure_on_a_compromise/ |title =  Figure on a compromise |publisher = [[The Boston Globe]] |date = 2004-07-18| accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Gomez,&lt;ref name="CBW-DBacks"&gt;{{cite news |first = Nick|last = Piecoro |url = http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/NickPiecoro/10440 |title =  New scout more than just a wannabe |publisher = [[The Arizona Republic]]|date = 2007-11-09| accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Tango]]. [[Bill James]]' ''Baseball Abstract'' books published in the 1980s are widely considered to be the modern predecessor to websites using sabermetrics such as ''baseballthinkfactory'' and [[Baseball Prospectus|baseballprospectus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]], ''Moneyball'' p. 235, Norton Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The site was founded in 2001 by Jim Furtado and Sean Forman of [[Baseball-Reference]] under the name "Baseball Primer," with a matching URL of (http://www.baseballprimer.com/). The site's emphasis on sabermetric baseball analysis attracted members of the rec.sport.baseball [[Usenet]] groups, and later drew readers of [[Rob Neyer]]'s [[ESPN]] columns. The early site cultivated spirited discussions as a result of the Usenet veterans' familiarity with each other and the fact that registration was not required to post comments.  The site also featured a number of original research articles.

In 2004, the site was re-branded as "Baseball Think Factory" and was re-built on a different software platform in order to support the growing user population and accommodate user registration and [[content management]] features.

BTF mainly hosts baseball discussions. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine listed the site as an "essential baseball destination," characterizing it as offering "links to significant baseball articles, accompanied by freewheeling, usually informed discussion threads."&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel G. |last=Habib |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1108770/index.htm |title=Great Site Lines |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2004-09-27 |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012203721/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1108770/index.htm |archivedate=2008-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] also mentioned the site (as ''baseballprimer'') in his book [[Moneyball]].&lt;ref name="Moneyball"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Lewis | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Lewis  | title=Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game | date= | publisher=W.

== Site sections ==

The site features a number of sections with content for different audiences. These include:
* ''Baseball Newsstand'' –  a newsblog where baseball-related articles are linked.  Entries usually feature an excerpt of the article along with a discussion thread.  
* ''Hall of Merit'' (abbreviated as the HoM) – a sub-site conceived by Joe Dimino as an alternative to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. The purpose of the HoM is "to identify the best players in baseball history and thereby identify the omissions and errors that can be found in the other venerable institution."&lt;ref name="HoM-Intro"&gt;{{cite news |first = John|last = Murphy |url = http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/hall_of_merit/discussion/welcome_to_the_baseball_hall_of_merit/ |title =  Welcome to the Baseball Hall of Merit! |publisher = Baseball Think Factory |date = 2005-08-28| accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussions often appeal to sabermetric criteria, including in-depth understanding of the various historical eras of major league and negro league baseball as well as advanced statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/hall_of_merit/discussion/the_hall_of_merit_plaque_room HoM members elected thus far]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/hall_of_merit/discussion/our_constitution HoM Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Transaction Oracle'' – Szymborski posts analyses of major league transactions (player signings and trades), and articles on his ZiPS forecasting system, which is designed to forecast player statistics based on past performance and similarities to other major league players.
* ''Team Sites'' – sub-sections of the newsblog that link to articles of interest to specific teams.  There currently are four such team blogs:  Sox Therapy ([[Boston Red Sox]]), Gonfalon Cubs ([[Chicago Cubs]]), Count the Rings ([[New York Yankees]]), and It's Mets...Just Mets ([[New York Mets]])
* ''Game "Chatters"'' – specific threads on regular season and postseason major league baseball games (as well as for special events such as the Olympics or the World Baseball Championship). Site members contribute to the group liveblog during these events.
* ''Dialed In'' and ''Primate Studies'' – sub-sites with original baseball research and more in-depth discussion.

== Original research ==

BTF has featured numerous original research articles, primarily under the aforementioned sub-sites "Transaction Oracle," "Dialed In," and "Primate Studies."  Several analysts such as [[Mitchel Lichtman]] and [[Tom Tango]] regularly posted original research articles and participated on discussion and criticism of the work at BTF before going on to establish their own sites and to publish results in book form.&lt;ref name="theBook"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Tango | first=Tom M. |author2= Lichtman, Michel|author3= Dolphin, Andrew|author4= Palmer, Pete | title=The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball | date= 2007| publisher=Potomac Books | location= | isbn=978-1-59797-129-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that statistics characterizing major league offense (batting) are fairly well established, much of the research posted on BTF spotlight defense (fielding) in the form of statistics more accurate than traditional fielding statistics.  Examples include:

===Mitchel Litchman's articles on ultimate zone rating===

Litchman created fielding metrics that use play-by-play records that record the location of individual batted balls. Litchman combines this play-by-play data with his linear-weights system that assigns run values to the various baseball plays and their context within the game (inning, runners on base, score, etc.)  Some of his initial articles on the system were posted on BTF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/lichtman_2003-03-14_0/ Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR), Part 1], 2003/03/14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/lichtman_2003-03-21_0/ Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR), Part 2], 2003/03/21&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtman's [[Ultimate zone rating]]s (UZR) statistics can now be found on the baseball website [[Fangraphs]].

===ZiPS===

Szymborski posts updates from his forecasting system known as "ZiPS" under his sub-site ''Transaction Oracle''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/oracle/ Transaction Oracle]&lt;/ref&gt; ZiPS results are also used in his articles evaluating Major League Baseball transactions. These projections can also be found on [[Fangraphs]], updated for in-season projections.

===Chris Dial's ''Dialed In'' columns===

Dial is a [[SABR]] member who contributes articles to BTF, many focusing on statistics measuring defense. Dial has studied [[STATS, Inc.|STATS, Inc.'s]] "zone rating" for years and posts updated statistics based on this data and on [[Retrosheet]] data. Some of Dial's more notable articles include:
*Dial provides OPD – a statistic estimating a player's overall contribution on offense and defense. Offensive values were generated using [[Extrapolated Runs]] and defensive values are represented by Dial's DRS (defensive runs saved), which are based on ZR (zone rating) data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/dialed_in/discussion/final_2008_offense_plus_defense_opd_results/ Final 2008 Offense Plus Defense (OPD) Results], 2008/10/20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A reflection on generating statistics based on retrosheet play-by-play fielding data, the relative impact of including line drive (LD) data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/dialed_in/discussion/defensive_analysis_continuous_improvement/ Defensive Analysis – Continuous Improvement], 2007/12/30.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Article on how to create a metric to measure a player's performance on defense, based on zone rating (ZR) data. Comparison to Mitchel Lichtman's UZR, which was taken to be the state-of-the-art fielding metric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/dialed_in/discussion/dr_strangeglove_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_zone_rating1/ Dr. StrangeGlove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Zone Rating], 2005/11/10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carlos Gomez's ''Bullpen Mechanics''===

Gomez is a former college and professional pitcher&lt;ref name="CBW-stats"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/G/Carlos-Gomez.shtml |title=Carlos Gomez |publisher=The Baseball Cube |accessdate=2009-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609013122/http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/G/Carlos-Gomez.shtml |archivedate=2008-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who contributed articles featuring detailed, frame-by-frame analyses of pitcher mechanics.  Prior to their publication, the average fan had little access to detailed evaluations of pitchers' mechanics and had to rely on short descriptions gleaned by beat reporters from scouting reports.  The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] organization offered him a position as a scout in 2007.&lt;ref name="CBW-DBacks" /&gt;

It was used by the Nottinghamshire Gentlemen as well as by local clubs. In 1846, the Gentlemen of Southwell with Five men given and A Mynn, played  [[England national cricket team|England]] in what is the grounds only [[first-class cricket|first-class]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/753_f.html First-Class matches played on Brackenhurst Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground has held 6 [[Second XI Championship]] matches for the [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire Second XI]] between 1967 and 1995, the last of which saw the Nottinghamshire Second XI play the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex Second XI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/753_sec.html Second XI Championship Matches played on Brackenhurst Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground was bought by [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Cricket Grounds of Nottinghamshire  P.Wynne-Thomas ACS 1984 p.15&lt;/ref&gt; and is today surrounded by [[Nottingham Trent University]] [[Nottingham_Trent_University#Campuses|Brackenhurst Campus]].

The '''British Radio Car Association''' (or '''BRCA''') is an organisation that promotes the construction and racing of all types of [[Radio-controlled car|radio controlled car]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. Founded in 1971 by [[Ted Longshaw]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4b0YuvibZ0&lt;/ref&gt; and Keith Plested, who was also the founder of PB Racing, a manufacturer of RC cars;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kp-designs.co.uk/page12.html# |title=Keith Plested History |access-date=9 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828134714/http://www.kp-designs.co.uk/page12.html# |archive-date=28 August 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rc-radiocontrolled.com/pb_racing_rc_cars.html PB Racing RC Cars | Radio Control Cars | Remote Control Cars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131071431/http://rc-radiocontrolled.com/pb_racing_rc_cars.html |date=31 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifmar.org/pdf/History.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008035619/http://www.ifmar.org/pdf/History.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; they coordinate BRCA affiliated clubs in the UK, and offer [[insurance]] for any accidents that might occur. 

They also organise regional and national racing events for various classes. Each year the BRCA produces a rules booklet for every UK racing class, such as 1:10 Electric touring cars, 1:8 Nitro circuit cars and 1:16 Electric micro offroad cars with specific rules as regard to maximum and minimum dimensions, and homologated motors and cells. It is recommended (and at some clubs compulsory) to become a BRCA member due to its insurance and health and safety benefits.

The BRCA is a member of the [[European Federation of Radio Operated Model Automobiles]] (EFRA).

The BRCA is also affiliated with the [[Motor Sports Association]] who deal with motorsports in the UK, although deal primarily with full-size racing rather than scale model racing

==Objectives of The British Radio Car Association==

'''Erie Insurance Arena''' (originally known as '''Erie Civic Center''' and later, '''Louis J. Tullio Arena''') is a multi-purpose indoor [[arena]] in the [[Downtown Erie|downtown]] area of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. It is home to the [[Erie Otters]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] and the [[Erie BayHawks (2017&amp;ndash;)|Erie BayHawks]] of the [[NBA G League]]. It was built in 1983 as part of the [[Louis J. Tullio]] Plaza, which also includes the [[Warner Theatre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Warner Theatre]] and [[UPMC Park]] &amp;ndash; all of which are administered by the Erie County Convention Center Authority. The arena is named for the [[Erie Insurance Group]], which purchased the [[naming rights]] in May 2012.

==History==
Erie Insurance Arena was built for $9.3 million in 1983. It opened in June 1983 with a [[Beach Boys]] concert. Since then, it has hosted entertainers including [[Elton John]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Cher]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]], and  [[Alice Cooper]]. Erie Insurance Arena has also featured [[Disney on Ice]], [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], [[Impact Wrestling]], the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], and [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].&lt;ref name="renovation"/&gt;

In May 2012, the Erie County Convention Center Authority and the [[Erie Insurance Group]] announced a 10-year, $3 million naming agreement that would rename the former Louis J. Tullio Arena, "Erie Insurance Arena." This renaming coincided with the completion of the current $42 million renovation project that was completed in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tullio Arena to Become Erie Insurance Arena|first=Kevin|last=Flowers|url=http://www.goerie.com/article/20120510/NEWS02/305099873/Tullio-Arena-to-become-Erie-Insurance-Arena|newspaper=[[Erie Times-News]]|date=May 10, 2012|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation, designed by Friday/Sink Combs Dethlefs Joint Venture Architects, modernized the arena and added some new sections and a landscaped park entrance. Construction on the project was carried out by the [[Pittsburgh]]-based [[Turner Construction Company]]. Improvements included additional seating and concourses. To accommodate this, its footprint expanded from the original {{convert|152,000|sqft|sing=on}}  to {{convert|218,000|sqft|sing=on}}. This increased the venue's capacity to 6,833 for hockey, 6,754 for basketball and about 9,000 for concerts. Erie Insurance Arena now has enlarged lobbies, more box office windows, luxury suites, administrative offices, mechanical rooms, training areas, new locker rooms, and a club level sponsored by the ''[[Erie Times-News]]''. Funding for the renovations derived from $32 million pledged by former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, combined with $10 million paid by [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]].&lt;ref name="renovation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis J. Tullion Arena to Undergo $42 Million Renovation &amp; Expansion |url=http://www.erieevents.com/_pdf/Louis%20J%20Tullio%20Arena%20Renovation%20%20Expansion%20Press%20Release.pdf |publisher=Erie County Convention Center Authority |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221607/http://www.erieevents.com/_pdf/Louis%20J%20Tullio%20Arena%20Renovation%20%20Expansion%20Press%20Release.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena has hosted numerous high school and college basketball games. Two of the most notable basketball games were between [[Cathedral Preparatory School]] and McDowell and local colleges, Gannon University and Mercyhurst University. Both games featured rival schools. Both games generated the most attended high school and college basketball games in city history, both selling out at 5,500.

In September 2014, the Erie County Convention Center Authority completed a $1.4 million upgrade to the arena which had been dropped from the previous renovation due to a tightened budget. This upgrade included a closed-circuit video system, high-definition video panels on the east and west ends of the arena, and a high-definition "center ice" video scoreboard. The new scoreboard replaced the scoreboard added in 2006. The video boards replaced scoreboards from the original construction of the arena in 1983. The new scoreboard and video boards were manufactured by [[Daktronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Erie Insurance Arena to Get New, High-Definition, Video Scoreboard|first=Kevin|last=Flowers|url=http://goerie.com/erie-insurance-arena-to-get-new-high-definition-video-scoreboard|newspaper=[[Erie Times-News]]|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fish market''' is a [[marketplace]] for selling [[fish products]]. It can be dedicated to wholesale trade between [[Fisherman|fishermen]] and fish [[merchant]]s, or to the sale of [[seafood]] to individual consumers, or to both. Retail fish markets, a type of [[wet market]], often sell [[street food]] as well.

Fish markets range in size from small fish stalls, such as the one in the photo at the right, to the great [[Tsukiji fish market]] in Tokyo, turning over about 660,000 tonnes a year.&lt;ref name="Clover"&gt;Clover C (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMY-gEKMod8C&amp;pg=PA165 ''The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat''] Page 165. University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25505-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''fish market'' can also refer to the process of [[fish marketing]] in general, but this article is concerned with physical marketplaces.

==History and development==
[[File:Jan Brueghel the Elder-Great Fish market.jpg|thumb|The ''Great Fish Market'', painted by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]]]
Fish markets were known in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch JE and Casella A (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=b_QHqOhGlfcC&amp;pg=PA157 ''Networks and markets''] Page 157. Russell Sage Foundation, {{ISBN|978-0-87154-700-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They served as a [[public space]] where large numbers of people could gather and discuss current events and local [[politics]].

Because seafood is quick to [[Decomposition|spoil]], fish markets are historically most often found in seaside towns. Once [[ice]] or other simple cooling methods became available, some were also established in large inland cities that had good [[trade route]]s to the coast.

[[File:Selling fish in a Quebec Market.jpg|thumb|Selling fish in a Quebec Market, c. 1845.]]

Since [[refrigeration]] and rapid [[transport]] became available in the 19th and 20th century, fish markets can technically be established at any place. However, because modern trade [[logistics]] in general has shifted away from marketplaces and towards [[retail]] outlets, such as [[supermarkets]], most seafood worldwide is now sold to consumers through these venues, like most other [[foodstuff]]s.

Consequently, most major fish markets now mainly deal with wholesale trade, and the existing major fish retail markets continue to operate as much for traditional reasons as for commercial ones. Both types of fish markets are often [[tourist attraction]]s as well.

==Notable fish markets==

The '''Gienger''' is a [[gymnastics]] skill performed on the [[uneven bars]] for women and the [[high bar]] for men. It is named after [[Germany|German]] [[gymnast]] [[Eberhard Gienger]]. The release move looks like a half-turn layout "flyaway" above the bar to catch the same bar. Its [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|COP]] reference is 3.405 and it is a D element.

The skill typically begins from a handstand followed by a swing backward and release after 3/4 of a revolution around the bar. The skill begins as a backward salto with the gymnast completing a 1/2 twist (180°) before regrasp on the same bar that was released. The Gienger can be done with either a piked (traditional) or stretched body form. A variation on the Gienger is the Def (COP 3.605), which is a G-rated element and is identical to the Gienger except that instead of a 1/2 twist (180°), the gymnast performs 1 1/2 twists (540°) before regrasp on the bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fig-docs.com/Media/Codes%20of%20Points%202013%20-%202016/WAG/2013-2016%20WAG%20CoP.pdf |title=2013 Code Of Points Women’S Artistic Gymnastics |publisher=FIG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gienger saltos are technically similar to Deltchev saltos, with the latter initiating the 1/2 twist before initiating the Arabian (which is also usually straddled rather than piked or stretched).

Some of the female gymnasts that perform the Gienger are [[Nastia Liukin]], [[Eugenia Popa]], and [[Shawn Johnson]].

The '''Grand Hamad Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|استاد حمد الكبير}}), also known as the Al-Arabi Sports Club Stadium, is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].  It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches. The football team [[Al-Arabi SC (Qatar)|Al-Arabi SC]] play there. The stadium holds 13,000 people. The stadium was used extensively during the [[2006 Asian Games]], and was a venue for several different sports; these include [[Football at the 2006 Asian Games|football]], [[Table Tennis at the 2006 Asian Games|table tennis]], [[Rugby at the 2006 Asian Games|rugby sevens]] and [[Fencing at the 2006 Asian Games|fencing]]. [[Iraq national football team]] played their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)]] games at the ground. Now they use the Stadium as a home for [[Yemen national football team]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)]].

'''Haagsche Delftsche Mixed''' ('''HDM''') is a [[field hockey]] club from [[The Hague]]. The club was founded on February 8, 1908, when students from [[Delft]] wanted to play hockey with their girlfriends from [[The Hague]]. The first men's team won the Dutch national title in 1924, 1930, 1931, 1935, 1941, 1942 and &amp;ndash; for the last time &amp;ndash; in 1992. Currently the first men's plays in the second division, which is called "Promotieklasse", the first women's team plays in the top league, called "Hoofdklasse".

'''Lauryn Eagle''' (born 11 December 1987) is an Australian professional [[boxer]] and [[water skiing]] champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/gallery/gallery-e6freye9-1225868786845?page=1 |title=Lauryn Eagle |work=The Daily Telegraph|location=Australia |date=17 July 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was on [[The Celebrity Apprentice Australia (season 2)|The Celebrity Apprentice Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/lauryn-eagle-on-the-behaviour-and-ego-of-celebrity-apprentice-co-contestant-tania-zaetta/story-e6freq7o-1226344049273 |title=Lauryn Eagle on the behaviour and ego of Celebrity Apprentice co-contestant Tania Zaetta &amp;#124; Entertainment News Queensland |publisher=The Courier-Mail |date=2 May 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a former [[Miss Teen International]] 2004.

==Water skiing==
Coming from a [[water skiing]] family, her father Peter won the Australian title eleven times and sister Sarah placed second at the 2007 World Championships. She first learnt to ski at the age of four and started racing when she was nine years old. In 2003, she placed second in the Junior Division and at the next World Championships in 2005 she won the women's division title in the [[World water skiing champions#List of Ski Racing World Champions|F2 class]]. In 2006, she won the Australian Speed Championships (U/19) and the Australian Marathon Champs (U/19).  She then finished third at the 2007 World Championship in May in the Formula 1 Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwsf.com/history/displayMedals.php?year=all&amp;title=World+Championships&amp;division=Ski+Racing |title=International Water Ski Federation IWSF Titles and Medal List |website=Iwsf.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired shortly from racing after her father's death in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-news/eagle-wont-race-again/story-e6freuzi-1111115808204 |title=Eagle Won't Race Again |website=Dailytelegraph.com.au |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Lauryn returned to racing placing third at the 2009 World Championships, and 7th in the 2011 World Championships after suffering a big fall in the third race.

==Professional boxing career==
Turning professional in 2010, she went 2–0–1 with 1 knockout that year and in 2011 she would suffer two split decision losses.

On 13 July 2012, she defeated Kiangsak Sithsaithong (then 9–0–0 4KO) by a 5th-round TKO to win the [[World Boxing Foundation]] women's [[super featherweight]] title, improving her record to 3–2–1 2 knockouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/boxing-mma/lauryn-eagle-lands-a-womens-world-title/story-fndn16fm-1226425813716 "Lauryn Eagle lands a women's world title"]. ''Herald Sun''. 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The match was widely criticised within the boxing media. Commentators pointed out that Eagle had not fought more than 6 rounds in her career, and had not won a fight since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/05/15/boxings-absurd-celebrity-culture-continues-to-cause-damage/ |title=Lauryn Eagle to fight for world title as boxing's celebrity culture continues |publisher=The Roar |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted that Sithsaithong's record was almost entirely against debut fighters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/boxing-mma/title-fight-not-what-it-seems-for-boxing-stunner-lauryn-eagle/story-fndn16fm-1226423935674 |title=Title Fight Not What It Seems for Boxing Stunner Lauryn Eagle |website=Heraldsun.com.au |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Thai villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Auld |url=http://www.aus-boxing.com/2012/07/13/susie-ramadan-lauryn-eagle-win-titles-over-thai-opponents/ |title=Susie Ramadan &amp; Lauryn Eagle win titles over Thai opponents |publisher=Aus-Boxing |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, she did a promotional fight against [[Fox FM (Melbourne)|Fox FM]] radio joc [[Matt Tilley]] in a 'Champ vs Chump' promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/eagle-eyes-her-opponent/story-fnbk7kwa-1226427524545 |title=Eagle Eyes Her Opponent |website=Heraldsun.com.au |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle won the three round fight by a TKO in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com.au/shows/mattandjo/features/champ-vs-chump-2?selectedImage=23 |title=hit101.9 Fox FM &amp;#124; Melbourne's Number 1 Hit Music Station |website=Fox.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Eagle fought [[New Zealand]]'s Nicki Bigwood winning in a unanimous decision in a six-round bout on as an undercard to former [[rugby league]] player [[Solomon Haumono]]'s fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aus-boxing.com/2012/09/07/solomon-haumono-vs-franklin-egobi-live-results-blog/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117155855/http://www.aus-boxing.com/2012/09/07/solomon-haumono-vs-franklin-egobi-live-results-blog/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2013 she won the vacant [[List of Australian female boxing champions|Australia female lightweight title]] beating Nadine Brown on points at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]].

==Modeling and media==
Eagle also has a keen interest in modeling. In 2005, she competed in Miss Teen Australia in Darwin and won the title along with Miss Congeniality. She then went to Costa Rica in Central America and competed in [[Miss Teen International]] and made a clean sweep, winning Miss Teen International, along with Most Photogenic, Miss Congeniality and Best Silhouette.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2006, she won the [[FHM Australia|FHM]] Lara Croft Challenge involved physical challenges of shooting, running, ropes, ladders, 4-wheel driving and swimming.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

She starred in the second season of [[The Celebrity Apprentice Australia (season 2)|the Celebrity Apprentice Australia]] where she lasted until the final episode where she finished fourth.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the August edition of [[Maxim (Australia)|MAXIM magazine]], Eagle featured on the front cover and a photo shoot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triplem.com.au/adelaide/funny-stuff/bad-medicine/blog/photo-lauryn-eagles-lingerie-front-cover-for-maxim-magazine/20120718-gr8h.html "Lauryn Eagles lingerie front cover for maxim magazine"]. Triplem.com.au. 18 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In March 2008, Eagle's father Peter, a 10-time Australian water-skiing champion, died when his speedboat flipped and crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duff|first=Eamonn|title=Tragedy haunts family|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/03/08/1204780125755.html|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 March 2008|author2=Walker, Frank|author3=Gilmore, Heath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2013, Eagle was arrested at Northies [[Cronulla]] Hotel and charged with failing to leave premises when requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Partridge|first=Emma|title=Lauryn Eagle arrested after refusing to leave hotel: police|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/boxing/lauryn-eagle-arrested-after-refusing-to-leave-hotel-police-20130520-2jw8m.html|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had recently split with her boyfriend, rugby league player [[Todd Carney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reines|first=Ros|title=Todd Carney and Lauryn Eagle break-up|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/todd-carney-and-lauryn-eagle-break-up/story-fn907478-1226614412651|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=news.com.au|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 9 January 2014, she was ordered by the courts to leave her Mother alone after a dispute over a family dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2014/01/09/18/28/lauryn-eagle-ordered-to-stay-away-from-mother |title=Lauryn Eagle ordered to stay away from mother - 9news.com.au |website=News.ninemsn.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2018 she was convicted of drug driving, fined $600 and banned from driving for six months. The magistrate  rejected an application to record no conviction, noting her poor traffic record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/boxer-lauryn-eagle-convicted-of-drugdriving-20180130-h0qdp4.html |title=Boxer Lauryn Eagle convicted of drug-driving |website=www.smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monte Carlo Country Club (MCCC)''' is the home of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]'s [[Monte Carlo Masters]] tournament. It is also the base of the Monte Carlo Tennis Academy.

Despite the club's name, it is not located in [[Monte Carlo]] or even in [[Monaco]]; it is actually located in the commune of [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]] in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] department of France, just outside Monaco's northeastern border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montecarlo.masters-series.com/4/fr/event/GuideAccess.jpg |title=Itinéraires d'acèss au Masters Series Monte-Carlo |publisher=Monte Carlo Masters |format=[[JPEG]] |language=French |accessdate=2008-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229035342/http://montecarlo.masters-series.com/4/fr/event/GuideAccess.jpg |archivedate=2008-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Motordrome''', also known as the '''Olympic Park Speedway''', the '''Melbourne Speedway''' or the '''Victorian Speedway''', was a former [[Dirt track racing|speedway]] and [[Australian rules football]] ground located on the site of [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct#Olympic Park|Olympic Park]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. The ground was primarily a speedway track, but also hosted football matches.

==History==
Melbourne Carnivals Pty. Ltd, a company established in 1923 by Jack Campbell and Jim DuFrocq, developed and leased a large site known as the '''Amateur Sports Ground''' from the Crown with the help of local entrepreneur [[John Wren]].&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Terry|title=Fast Tracks - Australia's Motor Racing Circuits 1904-1995|date=1995|publisher=Turton &amp; Armstrong|location=Sydney|isbn=0908031556|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the site, the Motordrome was constructed. The stadium contained a grassed oval suitable for football, set inside a saucer-shaped concrete oval track suitable for motor racing;&lt;ref name="Argus23Sep" /&gt; the track was a third of a mile long and banked at a 46° angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Townsville Daily Bulletin (Supplement)|publication-place=Townsville, QLD|date=6 December 1924|page=5|title=New Speedway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Melbourne Carnivals originally had visions for the stadium to accommodate 100,000 spectators,&lt;ref name="Argus23Sep"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Football – the Tenth Club|page=10|date=23 September 1924|author=Old Boy}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was ultimately built to accommodate around 32,000. The Motordrome was opened on 29 November 1924, and 32,000 spectators attended the inaugural race meeting.&lt;ref name="opening"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Racing summary|date=6 December 1924|page=1341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, the ageing concrete surface of the motor racing track was no longer suitable for the higher powered vehicles which used it, so it was demolished and replaced with a [[Race track#Surfaces|dirt track]] which continued to be used for motor racing.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; In the same year, the Amateur Sports Ground was renamed '''Olympic Park''', and the name was generally used for both the former Motordrome stadium, and the wider park in which it was situated. The name change had no connection to the [[Olympic Games]] – Melbourne was not selected as the host of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] until 1949 – and rather was chosen because the former name 'Amateur Sports Ground' no longer reflected the class and type of sport which was now played on the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=6 April 1933|page=9|title=Motordrome obsolete}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=11 May 1933|page=13|title=Changes at Motordrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=24 June 1933|page=21|title=Amateur Sports Ground}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was sold after the Second World War and began to be converted into the [[Olympic Park Stadium]] used during the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;

===Motor racing===
During the time of the [[Great Depression]] the ground regularly drew in crowds of more than 30,000 to watch speedway, [[Motorcycle speedway|motorcycle]] and [[Sidecar speedway|sidecar]] racing. It is generally acknowledged that the first [[Midget car racing|Speedcar]] race in Australia took place at the speedway in 1934.

In 1936/37, the speedway also saw two [[Motorcycle speedway]] test matches between the [[Australia national speedway team|Australians]], including future ([[1938 Individual Speedway World Championship|1938]]) [[Speedway World Championship|Speedway World Champion]] [[Bluey Wilkinson]], taking on the visiting [[United States national speedway team|Americans]] who included the [[1937 Individual Speedway World Championship|1937]] World Champion [[Jack Milne]] and his younger brother [[Cordy Milne|Cordy]], as well as [[Wilbur Lamoreaux]] who would finish second behind Milne in the 1937 World Final at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] in [[London]] (Cordy Milne would finish third). Australia won the first test 31-23 on 19 December 1936, and won the third test 30-24 on 23 January 1937 (the second test, won 29-24 by Australia, was held at the [[Sydney Showground Speedway|Sydney Showground]] on 28 December).

===Football===
Although not much top-level football was played on the Motordrome, its presence as a high capacity centrally-located ground had a significant off-field impact on football during the 1920s and 1930s.

When the venue was first established in 1924, the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] was very keen for strategic reasons to control it. Melbourne Carnivals had offered to lease the ground to the new [[Public Service Football Club]] if it were admitted to the League in 1925. This offer became the trigger for off-field negotiations which ultimately saw {{AFL Foo}}, {{AFL Haw}} and {{AFL Nor}} [[1925 VFL season#Expansion of the VFL|admitted to the VFL]], but saw the VFL fail to secure the use of the Motordrome. There had been proposals for the [[Richmond Football Club]] to move to the venue, or for it to be used as a neutral venue to which each club moved one or two of its home matches each year; however, these proposals fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aamipark.com.au/ResourceImage.aspx?raid=853 | format=pdf | title=Football Control The Motordrome Bait / Proposal for the League | date=25 February 1925 | publisher=The Argus | accessdate=26 June 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] went on to play its finals matches at the venue in 1925, 1926 and 1927.

Prior to the 1931 season, the VFL and the Grounds Management Association (which represented the operators of most of the VFL grounds) entered a dispute over the use of the grounds for football matches, covering financial arrangements and the demarcation between the football and cricket seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article183012634 |title=Football on Motordrome V.F.L. Has Option Over Three Other Arenas. |newspaper=[[The Sporting Globe]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=31 January 1931 |accessdate=5 February 2016 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dispute, the VFL arranged for the Motordrome, as well as the [[Carlton Gardens|Exhibition Oval]], to host twelve games which were to be transferred away from the grounds involved in the dispute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=League arranges fixtures|author=W. S. Sharland|page=4|date=14 March 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the dispute was ultimately resolved through arbitration in March and the games were transferred back to their original grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Referee|publication-place=Sydney, NSW|title=Victorian grounds trouble settled|author=Southerner|page=11|date=25 March 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1932, the VFA signed a deal to use the Motordrome as a neutral central venue from 1933 until 1940. Under the agreement, the VFA would play one match at the ground each weekend during the season, with each club moving one or two of its home games to the ground each year, as well as playing the finals there. This caused a [[1934 VFA season#Central ground dispute|massive dispute]] with the local councils which owned the VFA's suburban grounds, and it culminated in seven of the VFA's twelve clubs being kicked out of their local grounds until the agreement was rescinded, almost ruining the 1934 VFA season and potentially forcing those clubs to disband or secede ''en masse'' from the VFA. The agreement was rescinded shortly before the season began.&lt;ref name="resolution"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=27 March 1934|page=8|title=Grounds dispute ended}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Argus27March"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=27 March 1934|page=8|title=Grounds management – secession suggestions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Richmond Football Club]] formally announced its intentions to move its home base from the [[Punt Road Oval]] to Olympic Park prior to the 1936 season, owing mostly to an ongoing dispute with the [[Monash Tigers|Richmond Cricket Club]]. Richmond's proposal to move was ultimately voted down by the VFL, but only by the [[casting vote]] of League president [[William C. McClelland|William McClelland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=24 February 1936|page=7|title=Richmond to remain - Football League decides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only VFL premiership football ever played at the venue occurred during the early part of [[1932 VFL season|1932]], when {{AFL Mel}} played three home matches there because the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] was being resurfaced.

In the 1935 pre-season, the venue staged a night match under electric floodlights between 1934 VFL Grand Finalists {{AFL Ric}} and {{AFL SM}}. The players had some visibility problems, mostly with depth perception, but the match attracted 25,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=1 April 1935|page=7|title=Under floodlights – football experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further exhibition night matches were played at the end of 1935 between VFA Grand Finalists [[Yarraville Football Club|Yarraville]] and [[Camberwell Football Club|Camberwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=27 September 1935|page=12|title=Night match – Innovation unpopular}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of 1936 between combined teams representing the VFL and VFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=25 September 1936|page=15|title=Night game – win for League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School and junior football was regularly played on the venue.

===Other===
On 11 December 1926, the venue hosted a shambolic [[Ostrich#racing|ostrich racing]] event. A full program of races was scheduled, but the event was cancelled after three farcical attempts at races – in which startled ostriches ridden by inanimate jockeys ran in opposite directions, and ostriches attached to [[sulky|sulkies]] failed to break out of a walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|title=Ostrich racing – a complete fiasco|page=19|date=13 December 1926|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nations Park''' is an open invitational baseball tournament complex located in the city of [[Newberry, Florida|Newberry]], Florida opening in the summer of 2012. The park was formed with partnerships between the City of Newberry, Nations Baseball Florida Inc., and the Alachua County Tourism Development Board.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Jordan (2011). 'Nations Park'. http://jordanmarlowe.com/issues/nations-park/.&lt;/ref&gt; The facility has 16 stadiums.

==History==
Lou Presutti, founder of Cooperstown Dreams Park came to the City of Newberry in 2009 to establish the park.  It completed construction in 2012, but the grand opening was delayed until March 2013.

'Nations Park'. http://jordanmarlowe.com/issues/nations-park/.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the construction of Nations Park came to a brief stop upon discovery of several endangered Gopher Tortoises. The construction remained on hold for several weeks while experts were brought on site to relocate the protected species to a tortoise sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Christopher (2011).

'''PainStation''' is a [[torture device]] created by the artists' group &lt;!-- Yes, it really is spelled this way --&gt;"/////////fur//// art entertainment interfaces". &lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,50875,00.html |title=No Pain, No Game |publisher=Wired News (link via archive.org) |date=March 7, 2002 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030207171752/http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,50875,00.html |archivedate=February 7, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Never Say Never Againdomination.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Bond playing Largo in the game "Domination" as Domino Petachi looks on.]] --&gt;The system was originally developed by Tilman Reiff and Volker Morawe, two students at the ''Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln'' ([[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]]) in 2001, as an interactive art object. The pair later enhanced the device and released it under the company name of the "//////////fur//// art entertainment interfaces".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.khm.de/~morawe/painstation/PainStation_ger.pdf Painstation-Neuzeitliches Duellierungs Artefakt (Painstation - Modern Duelling artifact)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103548/http://www.khm.de/~morawe/painstation/PainStation_ger.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designers were inspired by the children's game Folter-Mau-Mau&lt;ref&gt;On the Media, June 27, 2003, Transcript and interview as .mp3 at [http://www.onthemedia.org/yore/transcripts/transcripts_062703_painstation.html They Like Pain(Station)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622073302/http://www.onthemedia.org/yore/transcripts/transcripts_062703_painstation.html |date=June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of the modern computer game. 

A similar game concept was featured in the 1983 James Bond movie ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.

The original concept was followed up with other stages of development which were regularly exhibited worldwide in different cultural contexts.

Following talks with [[Sony]], the artists described the Painstation as "The artwork formerly known as Painstation".

==Structure==
While the underlying artistic concept remained consistent over the years, the group continues to improve on the system.

==Basic Concept==
The Painstation consists of a specially made case which gives two players the opportunity of playing a specially adapted and expanded variant of the classic video game, Pong, against each other. The electronic controls are connected by digital transducers to several components providing sensory feedback to players.

During the game, the players place their left hands on the PEU (Pain Execution Unit) which serves as a sensor and feedback instrument. Possible feedback effects are heat impulses, an electric shock and an integrated miniature wire whip. The feedback generated is dependent on the playing process and can increase in its intensity. The respective opponent can try to alter his or her playing style to purposely change the intensity of the feedback.

The following bonus items can be activated by hits in the current version of the software in 2006:

*Increase Ball Speed (3 levels)
*Double Pain Execution Time
*Quadruple Pain Execution Time
*Almost Unblockable Ricochet
*Cut Height of Bar By 50%
*Deadly Row
*Electric Boogaloo
*Burn In Bright
*Death Penalty
*Cheese!
*Ease the Pain!
*Cluster Bomb

No matter the score, the first player to remove his or her hand from the PEU device loses the game.&lt;ref&gt;Sample video (QuickTime) at [http://www.khm.de/%7Emorawe/painstation/ps_movie_hi.html Painstation - Do you feel the pain?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129185810/http://www.khm.de/%7Emorawe/painstation/ps_movie_hi.html |date=2006-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painstation==
The heart of the original system was the [[Apple Computer]] G3 Macintosh, as well as a specifically made control plate. The programming was done with Macromedia Director and [[C++]].The model was developed predominately out of available junk using a tube monitor. The first five high scores were originally computer generated absurdly high as a deterrent, but one entry was actually overwritten by a player at the [[Games Convention]] in 2006. Since then, "GOL" is on the list in second place with 300 points.

==Painstation 2.0==
Starting in 2002, the successor of the original Painstation was developed, the Painstation 2.0.

Apart from adjustable pain levels, it offers several replaceable whips and an additional source of light which players can use to produce glare on their opponent's side of the screen. The program was reprogrammed under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and the application was implemented in C++ and [[OpenGL]], because the hardware the previous version had been based on became obsolete. The PEUs were fabricated for the first time with [[laser]]s from stainless [[steel]]. The higher processor performance makes it possible for the system to control the speed of the whip engine and the strength of the electric current individually.

The system was also for the first time made coin-operated. It is equipped with a 15&amp;nbsp;inch [[LCD monitor]] and it was shown to the public on June 25, 2003 on the German Harald Schmidt television show.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Even more enhanced duelling artefact'', online at [http://www.fursr.com/details.php?id=51&amp;pid=51 PainStation 2.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011306/http://www.fursr.com/details.php?id=51&amp;pid=51 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.painstation.de/new/collection.html The Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227071156/http://www.painstation.de/new/collection.html |date=2007-12-27 }} (Description of all models with further hints)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painstation 2.5==
The new case, painted in three metallic colors, consists mostly of medium density wood fiber panels and has a modular design. This makes it easier to transport the system and to exchange defective components. Besides a 15&amp;nbsp;inch color screen, there is standard PC technology inside and a special control plate. The pain levels can be changed from 50% to 150%. The player must confirm that they are willing to participate in the game by pressing a "I agree" button before playing. Added benefits for the players include leather padded arm rests and the new [[ergonomic]] layout of the controls. Newly added fans in the PEUs cool the system down better between games to avoid electronic problems and can serve the players if they hit the right bonus item.{{citation needed|reason=Where did this information come from; there's no source cited|date=December 2015}}

==Exhibitions==

==History in Miami==
In the late 1960s, the natural grass surface at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami]] was commonly in poor condition,&lt;ref name=jcobonbch&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lJ4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yOkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2506%2C188655 |newspaper=Miami News |last=Crittenden |first=John |title=Orange Bowl's on the beach |date=October 16, 1968 |page=1D }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily due to heavy usage; 34 games were scheduled there during the 1968 football season.&lt;ref name=torturetst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HJ8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2237%2C408784 |newspaper=Miami News |last=Plaisted |first=Ed |title=Orange Bowl grass faces torture test |date=August 1, 1968 |page=3D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poly-Turf was installed at the city-owned stadium in [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|1970]],&lt;ref name=owdlptrf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y5JGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TS8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6034%2C5886811 |newspaper=Palm Beach Post-Times |last=Petrella |first=Tony |title=Owners dislike Poly-Turf |date=August 30, 1970 |page=D4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and utilized for six seasons. The stadium was used for both [[College football|college]] and [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] football, primarily by the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami Hurricanes]] and the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]]. It also hosted the eponymous New Year's Day college [[Orange Bowl|bowl game]], [[Super Bowl]] games, and [[high school football]].

The [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska Cornhuskers]] won the first three Orange Bowl games played on Poly-Turf, which included two national championships. The first Super Bowl played on artificial turf was played on Poly-Turf in the Orange Bowl in January 1971, when the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] defeated the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 16-13 in [[Super Bowl V]].

Over just six years, both installations deteriorated rapidly and some football players suffered an increasing number of leg and ankle injuries; some players claimed to trip over seams. Prior to the second installation in 1972, the city did not consult with the Dolphins about the replacement; head coach Dolphins' coach [[Don Shula]] preferred a different brand, either AstroTurf or Tartan Turf.&lt;ref name=obtamg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BEFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tlcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4952%2C2852896 |newspaper=Evening Independent |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |agency=Associated Press |title=OB Poly-Turf: A mean green |date=September 26, 1972 |page=1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The field discolored from green to blue due to the severe [[Ultraviolet|UV]] nature of the Miami sun.&lt;ref name=trbques/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://miamisouthpaw.blogspot.com/2009/08/ghosts-of-orange-bowl-poly-turf.html MiamiSouthpaw.blogspot.com] – "Ghosts of Orange Bowl Poly-Turf" – 2009-08&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as December 1975, the city had planned to retain the Poly-Turf for the 1976 season,&lt;ref name=obswptf/&gt; but that decision was changed a few weeks later, prior to the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=ibtgraob/&gt;&lt;ref name=obwistgr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i6EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oOoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=950%2C4246875 |newspaper=Miami News |last=Nobles |first=Charlie |title=Orange Bowl will install grass |date=February 10, 1976 |page=1C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ljwout&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6BIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2447%2C1750043 |newspaper=Lawrence Journal World |location=Kansas |title=Orange Bowl taking out Poly Turf |date=February 14, 1976 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Orange Bowl became the first major football venue to replace its artificial turf with natural grass, and it was the third NFL stadium to install Prescription Athletic Turf; Denver's [[Mile High Stadium]] and Washington's [[Robert F.

American Biltrite ceased production of Poly-Turf in 1973; 3M stopped the manufacture of its Tartan Turf in 1974, citing rising oil prices.&lt;ref name=tyofphfl/&gt; This left AstroTurf as the only major manufacturer of artificial turf until [[FieldTurf]] was started in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.pacosm.com/specialtopics/Living%20with%20Artificial%20Grass%20%20A%20Knowledge%20Update.%20Part%201.%20Basic%20Science.%20AJSM%201990,%20vol.%2018%20p.406.pdf "Living with Artificial Grass"] ''American Journal of Sports Medicine'' vol. 18, no. 4, 1990-07&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|sling (weapon)|catapult}}[[File:Slingshot (weapon).png|thumb|200px|Simple slingshot]]

A '''gallybander''' '''slingshot''' or '''catapult''' ([[wikt:catapult#en-N |UK]]), '''ging''' (primarily Australian and New Zealand), '''shanghai''' (Australian), '''kettie''' (South Africa), is normally a small hand-powered projectile [[weapon]]. The classic form consists of a Y-shaped frame held in the off hand ([[handedness |nondominant hand]]), with two [[natural rubber | natural-rubber]] strips attached to the uprights. The other ends of the strips lead back to a pocket that holds the [[projectile]]. The [[dominant hand]] grasps the pocket and draws it back to the desired extent to provide power for the projectile—up to a full span of the arm with sufficiently long bands.

==Use and history==
Slingshots depend on strong [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials, typically [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[natural rubber]] or the equivalent, and thus date no earlier than the invention of vulcanized rubber by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1839 (patented in 1844).  By 1860, this "new engine" had already established a reputation for juvenile use in vandalism. For much of their early history, slingshots were a "do-it-yourself" item, typically made from a forked branch to form the "Y" shaped handle, with rubber strips sliced from items  as [[Tire#Inner tube|inner tubes]] or other sources of good vulcanized rubber and firing suitably sized stones.

While early slingshots were most associated with young vandals, they were also capable hunting arms in the hands of a skilled user. Firing projectiles, such as [[lead]] [[musket]] balls, [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshot]], [[steel]] [[ball bearing]]s, [[Pellet (air gun)|air gun pellets]], or small [[Nail (fastener)|nails]], slingshot was capable of taking game such as quail, pheasant, rabbit, dove, and squirrel.  Placing multiple balls in the pouch produces a [[shotgun]] effect, such as firing a dozen [[BB gun|BBs]] at a time for hunting small birds.  With the addition of a suitable rest, the slingshot can also be used to shoot [[arrow]]s, allowing the hunting of medium-sized game at short ranges.&lt;ref name=whamo_book&gt;{{cite book |title=Wham-O Hunting Slingshot |url=http://www.melchiormenzel.de/booklets_whamo.html |publisher=Wham-O Manufacturing Co. |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Illustrated World |volume=37| issue =  1 |page=318 |date=March 1922 |publisher=R. T. Miller Jr. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufbNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA318|title=How to Make a Slingshot for an Arrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mmrubber&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melchiormenzel.de/making_rubber_materials.html |title=Rubber Bands |author="Mel" Melchior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While commercially made slingshots date from at least 1918, with the introduction of the Zip-Zip, a cast iron model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ZipZip |url=http://www.melchiormenzel.de/slingshots_old_zipzip.html |author="Mel" Melchior}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until the post [[World War II]] years saw a surge in the popularity, and legitimacy, of slingshots.  They were still primarily a home-built proposition; a 1946 [[Popular Science]] article details a slingshot builder and hunter using home-built slingshots made from forked [[Cornus (genus)|dogwood]] sticks to take small game at ranges of up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} with No. 0 lead buckshot ({{convert|0.32|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=sqbr|order=flip}} diameter).&lt;ref name=popsci&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Popular Science |title=Rubber-Band Sharpshooter |date=August 1946 |author=Tom Cushing |pages=154–155 |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2007/08/05/rubber-band-sharpshooter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wham-O]] company, founded in 1948, was named after their first product, the Wham-O slingshot.  It was made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] and used flat rubber bands.  The Wham-O was suitable for hunting with a draw weight of up to {{convert|45|lbf|N|abbr=off|lk=on|order=flip}}, and was available with an arrow rest.&lt;ref name=whamo_book /&gt;&lt;ref name=giantkiller&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Mechanix Illustrated |title=Return of the Giant Killer |date=April 1951 |author=Robert Hertzberg |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2007/01/12/return-of-the-giant-killer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1940s also saw the creation of the National Slingshot Association, headquartered in [[San Marino, California]], which organised slingshot clubs and competitions nationwide.  Despite the slingshot's reputation as a tool of juvenile delinquents, the NSA reported that 80% of slingshot sales were to men over 30 years old, many of them professionals.  John Milligan, a part-time manufacturer of the [[aluminium]]-framed John Milligan Special, a hunting slingshot, reported that about a third of his customers were physicians.&lt;ref name=giantkiller /&gt;

The middle 1950s saw two major innovations in slingshot manufacture, typified by the Wrist-Rocket Company of [[Columbus, Nebraska]], later renamed Trumark.  The Wrist-Rocket was made from bent aluminium alloy rods that formed not only the handle and fork, but also a brace that extended backwards over the wrist, and provided support on the forearm to counter the [[torque]] of the bands.  The Wrist-Rocket also used surgical rubber tubing rather than flat bands, attached to the backwards-facing fork ends by sliding the tubing ends over the tips of the forks, where it was held by friction or adhered with the addition of liquid rosin.&lt;ref name=trumark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slingshots.com/html/slingshot-catapult-history.html |title=History of Slingshots/Catapults |author=Trumark Manufacturing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slingshots are also occasionally used in [[angling]] to disperse bait into the water over a wide area, so that multiple fish are attracted near the angler's [[fishing rod]].

A home-made derivative of a slingshot also exists, consisting of a rubber [[balloon]] cut in half and tied to a tubular object such as the neck of a plastic bottle, or a small pipe. The projectile is inserted through the tube and into the cut balloon, and the user stretches the balloon to launch the projectile. These so-called "balloon guns" are sometimes made as a substitute to ordinary slingshot, and is often used to create the "shotgun" effect with multiple projectiles fired at once.

==Record power shot==
The world record for the most energetic shot with a handheld slingshot was 135 [[Joule]]s. It was shot with a forward extended slingshot, also known as a "starship", which achieves more power by increasing draw length.&lt;ref&gt;Monster Slingshot New World Record Shot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAwTfAMHCG0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
Slingshots have been used as military weapons, but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the primitive resources and technology required to construct one. Such guerrilla groups included the [[Irish Republican Army]]; prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], [[Saddam Hussein]] released a [[propaganda]] video demonstrating slingshots as a possible [[Insurgency weapons and tactics|insurgency weapon]] for use against invading forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Slingshots have also been used by the military to launch [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).  Two crew members form the fork, with an elastic cord stretched between them to provide power to launch the small aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/afweapons/a/sfuav.htm |title=Security Forces Unmanned Aerial Vehicles |publisher=Air Force News Service |author=Tech. Sgt. Paul Dean |date=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Battle of Marawi]], the soldiers of the Philippine Army's elite [[1st Scout Ranger Regiment|Scout Rangers]] were observed using slingshots with grenades as an improvised mortar to eliminate the [[Maute Group|Maute]] and [[Abu Sayyaf]] Terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.update.ph/2017/09/look-scout-rangers-use-improvised-giant-slingshot-in-marawi-angry-birds-style/20991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
[[File:Slingshot band failure.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tubular band slingshot showing a band failure at the fork.]]
[[File:CPSC recall Daisy Natural.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ball-in-band attachment method used by the recalled Daisy "Natural" line of slingshots.]]

One of the dangers inherent in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail.  Most bands are made from [[latex]], which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load.&lt;ref name=mmrubber /&gt;&lt;ref name=mmattach&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melchiormenzel.de/making_rubber_attach.html |author=Melchior Menzel |title=Attaching the bands to the frame}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user.  Failures at the fork end, however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries.&lt;ref name=recall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daisy.com/natural_recall.pdf |title=Slingshots Recalled by Daisy Manufacturing Due to Risk of Serious Eye Injury |author=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One method to minimize the chance of a fork end failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the fork end.&lt;ref name=mmpouch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melchiormenzel.de/making_rubber_pouch.html |title=Attaching the pouch to the bands |author=Melchior Menzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy "Natural" line of slingshots (see image).  The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth.  Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.&lt;ref name=recall /&gt; Another big danger is the fork breakage, some commercial slingshots made from cheap zinc alloy may break and severely injure shooters' eyes &amp; face. &lt;ref name=dankung&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dankung.com/article/no-dangerous-zinc-dankung-counterfeits_1302 |title=Danger of zinc alloy slingshots |author=DANKUNG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of arm braced slingshots. For example, [[New York (state)|New York]] law 265.01 defines it as a Class-4 misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/2-PenalLaw/265/art265hp.htm|title=Penal100|work=nycourts.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CNV00018.JPG|275px|thumb|Team walking during the event]]

'''Ten Tors''' is an annual weekend [[hiking|hike]] in early May, on [[Dartmoor]], southwest [[England]].   Organised by the [[British Army]], starting in 1960, it brings together teams of four to six young people each, with the 2,400 young participants hiking to checkpoints on ten specified [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]]. The majority of entrants are schools, colleges, [[The Scout Association|Scout groups]] and [[Combined Cadet Force|Cadet]] squadrons from [[South West England]], though groups from across the UK have regularly taken part, as have teams from Australia and New Zealand. However, from 2012 only teams from the South West of England are eligible to take part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Tors equipment and rules|url=https://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/kitlist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the large numbers of entrants. Teams will train for a few months before the event.

== Event format ==
Teams of six are required to visit ten specified [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]]; on the top of each tor is a checkpoint. Up to two members per team may fall out during the Challenge; teams falling below this number could merge in earlier years, while later rules required a badly reduced team to forfeit.

There are 26 different routes over three different distances, lettered from A to Z, using a total of 19 different manned tors: 12 Bronze (Junior) routes of {{convert|35|mi}} for those aged 14 to 15 years; 10 Silver ( Intermediate) routes of {{convert|45|mi}} for those aged 16 to 17 years; and 4 Gold ( Senior or Arduous) routes of {{convert|55|mi}} for those aged 18 to 19 years, or 17-year-olds who completed a Silver or Bronze route previously.

The organisers stress that the event is not a race &amp;ndash; although teams often compete to see who can finish first &amp;ndash; but a test of endurance, [[navigation]] and [[survival skills]], because of not just the distances and the challenging terrain, but potentially also the weather; conditions on Dartmoor can vary considerably and change suddenly. In 1996, for example, the event was struck by a heavy snow storm, leading to some teams still being out on the moor a day after the event was due to have finished; while in 1998 temperatures reached 26&amp;nbsp;°C (79&amp;nbsp;°F).

Participants arrive at [[Okehampton]] Camp on the Thursday or Friday before the hike, watch a safety briefing video and have their equipment checked, a thorough process known as scrutineering. Teams must carry all their food, clothing, tents, stoves, fuel, navigation equipment, maps, [[emergency rations]] and a [[first aid kit]]; they also collect drinking water from the moor and use water purification tablets. Each team has a nominated team leader, who is responsible for ensuring that the team's route card is stamped at each tor.

All the teams start at 0700 on the Saturday from an area of flat land next to Anthony Stile, close to Okehampton Camp on the northern edge of Dartmoor. They stand in a semicircle and set off when a cannon fires. They have 34&amp;nbsp;hours to visit each of the ten tors on their route in the correct order. Teams must not pass through a checkpoint between 2000 on Saturday and 0600 on Sunday morning; nor may they pass the ninth tor (eighth for the 35&amp;nbsp;mile routes) until the Sunday. Those trying for a Bronze medal must camp at one of the manned tors on their route, while Silver and Gold teams may camp anywhere on the moor. Teams must arrive back at Anthony Stile by 1700 on the Sunday, having visited all ten tors on their route in order, to qualify for a medal. (and a team certificate if the whole team make it )

==History of the event==
The first Ten Tors Expedition took place in September 1960, with around 200 young people taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dell|first=Simon|title=Ten Tors - the Dartmoor Challenge|year=2011|publisher=SPS Marketing Ltd|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, the numbers had grown to more than 2,600. To protect the environment, the numbers are now limited to 2,400 individuals: 400 teams of four to six teenagers. The Army uses the event as a large scale [[logistics]] training exercise.

Until 1967 the event was organised by the Junior Leaders Regiment, [[Royal Corps of Signals]]. This responsibility passed to Headquarters South West District, and in 1986 to [[43rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|43 (Wessex) Brigade]], the regional Headquarters of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in the South West.

Since 1977 an additional event, The Jubilee Challenge, has been held for young people with physical or learning disabilities.  This involves a selection of four routes of between {{convert|7.5|to|15|mi}}, both on road and cross-country.

Many military units and civilian groups provide support for this event and the Jubilee Challenge, including the [[Royal Wessex Yeomanry]], Exeter [[Officers Training Corps|UOTC]], 243 Field Hospital [[Royal Army Medical Corps|RAMC]], [[Rifle Volunteers|6th Battalion]] [[The Rifles]], two [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC4]] helicopters from [[848 Naval Air Squadron]], [[39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment]], two [[Aérospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopters from 7 Regiment [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] (Volunteers), Bristol UOTC and the Dartmoor Rescue Group.

===1981===
The first ever Junior Army Team from Junior Leaders Regiment Royal Armoured Corps JLR RAC finished the Gold Course with 24 minutes to spare, despite several of the six-strong team having severe foot injuries. They were cheered home by an honour guard of Royal Marines and Paratroopers who walked with the boys over the last mile.

===1993===
[[Tavistock Times Gazette|''Tavistock Times'']] reports "Hurricane Force" winds during the event.

===1996===
A cold northerly wind on the Saturday of the 1996 event turned to rain and snow overnight. This continued through Sunday, accompanied by fog and driving wind. Requests from Tor party commanders, two of whom had their tents destroyed, added to pressure to abandon the event, and there was a mass evacuation of the moor on the Sunday afternoon, the first time the event had been terminated early. Fifty-one teams completed their routes, but no record remains of their success. [http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/challenge.htm Ten Tors, A History]

===2001===
Ten Tors was cancelled in 2001 due to the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|foot and mouth epidemic]], but went ahead the next year.

===2003===
(69% finished Complete, + 21% with fall-outs)

For the second year in succession the Plymouth DofE Award 45 team{{clarify|date=February 2014}} took the honour of leading the teams over the finish line, at 08:49 ([http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2003/allteams.htm Ten Tors Teams, 2003]), improving on their time of 09:23 in 2002 ([http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2002/allteams.htm Ten Tors Teams, 2002])

===2004===
(75% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs)

In 2004 the Ten Tors record for earliest complete team home was broken by R1809, Dartmoor Plodders, with a time of 08:19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Ten Tors Route Card 2004
  | title = Route R
  | url = http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2004/router.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stood until 2009.

===2005===
(52% finished Complete, + 29% with fall-outs)

In 2005, one of the original teams from the 1960 Ten Tors took part in the event, which was held on 14–15 May in particularly adverse weather conditions: constant rain on the Saturday, combined with a bitter wind, leading to an unusually high number of retirements.

===2006===
(76% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs)

In 2006, the event was held over the weekend of 13–14 May, with high temperatures on the Sunday resulting in several cases of dehydration.

===2007===

On Sunday 4 March 2007, [[Death of Charlotte Shaw|Charlotte Shaw]] was swept away by the rain-swollen [[Walla Brook]] near [[Watern Tor]], while training for the event. The rest of her group raised the alarm using a [[mobile phone]], but despite her being evacuated by a [[Royal Naval Air Service|Royal Navy]] helicopter within 20 minutes, she died later that night in [[Derriford Hospital]], [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The event itself was abandoned at 21:30 on Saturday 12 May 2007, halfway through, due to severe weather conditions; the decision was influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15% on Saturday. Participants spent the night camped at a manned Tor, before being escorted off the moor by the military the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | publisher = [[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
(61% finished Complete, + 25% with fall-outs)

From 2008 the event was much changed, with different routes and use{{clarify|date=February 2014}} of the moor to help [[bird conservation]] in the [[nesting season]]. Steeperton Tor and Hare Tor were dropped from the Tor list, and the pass from Dinger to Kitty Tor known as "Death Valley" was zoned off limits. Each team was permitted only four training walks on the north moor. A review of these changes {{As of|2010|alt=is scheduled for 2011}}. The 2008 event was a total contrast to the previous years, with temperatures in the low 20s Celsius, and participants dropping out because of dehydration rather than hypothermia.

The first team across the line was the 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts, finishing at 09:10.

===2009===
(80% finished Complete, + 13% with fall-outs)

In 2009 the Ten Tors' record for the earliest complete team home since the rule change was broken with a time of 08:17 by 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Ten Tors Route Card 2009
  | title = Route M
  | url = http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2009/routem.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the first time an all-girls team, from Torquay Grammar School for Girls also broke the record for successfully completing the 35-, 45- and 55-mile events consecutively and with the same team members (Tamsin Owen, Joyce Nie, Francesca Hill, Amelia Skerritt, Rebecca Stanley and Hannah Short).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Ten Tors Route Card 2009
  | title = Route W
  | url = http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2009/routew.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were fewer dropouts than in other years in almost perfect weather conditions.

===2010===
(79% finished Complete, + 14% with fall-outs)

2010 saw the 50th anniversary of the Ten Tors event. To mark the occasion the Duke of Edinburgh visited the event on Sunday morning to speak to finishers and present some with the commemorative 50 years medals. It also marked the first year that teams carried a GPS tracker which enabled the organisers and team managers to track the participants' progress directly. The first finishers were [[20th Torbay Scouts Group|20th Torbay Explorer Scouts]] (Joshua Owen, Matthew Ryder, Luke Hayward, Jacob Shah, Paul Moroz and William Fordyce) and [[King Edward's School, Bath|King Edward's School Bath]] who walked over the line together at 7.37 to break the record for earliest finishers by 40 minutes, and also finishing four and a half hours ahead of any other team on their route. This also meant the scout group had crossed the line first for three consecutive years.  Notable other finishers were the 'Denbury Boys' who, made up of men who completed the first ever Ten Tors, successfully completed the 35 mile event.

===2011===
(81% finished Complete, + 14% with fall-outs)

The 2011 Challenge started under a clear blue sky, but cloud obscured the tops of *[[West Mill Tor|West Mill]] and *[[High Willhays]] even then. Cloud and a fresh breeze built up through the day, but by 17:50 a blue sky was breaking through. Sunday was very similar with the first finishers (M1306 - Downend Scouts, at 08:35 [http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2011/routem.htm Route M listing, 2011]) walking in under a blue sky, but again the cloud gathered through the day. [http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2011/diary-13.htm Notes from the Event].

The largely overcast and cool weekend was almost perfect walking weather - of the 390 teams which started 374 (95%) walked over the finish line, and of those finishing teams 316 (81%) walked in with all six team members. Over the last fifteen years of the event this is the highest percentage of both Finishing and Complete teams. Sixteen teams either retired (just 7, less than 2%) or were 'crashed out', but even here the statistics are impressive – in the previous 15 years teams are noted as stopping at their second Tor onwards. In 2011 the first teams to stop reached their fifth Tor before doing so.

It was also the 60th anniversary of Dartmoor as a National Park so everyone received a participant certificate.

===2012===
(75% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs)

The first team to reach the finish line was the [[Torquay Boys' Grammar School]] 45-mile team, who reached camp at 8:56am.

They were soon followed by both Torbay Explorer Scouts and Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School 45-mile team, who performed an excellent display of sportsmanship by finishing the last kilometre of the course side by side, despite a failure in the alarm of the QEH team, delaying the team by a full hour.

The first 35-mile team to cross the finish was Churcher's College, Hampshire, getting back to cap with a record breaking time of 09:21 on the Sunday morning. This was also the first all-boy team to cross the finish, and second overall.

The first all-girl team to reach the finish line, The Maynard 35-mile team, got back to camp at 10:20, setting a new time record for the school. The Maynard 45-mile team also completed the challenge in a respectable time, finishing at 13:59.

The 2012 event was notable for the selfless efforts of one team, X2414 Kingsbridge Community College (55), who were on schedule to complete their route shortly after 16:00 when they diverted to answer the distress whistles of another team which had two of its members trapped chest deep in [[Raybarrow Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kingsbridge &amp; Salcombe Gazette|title=Ten Tors heroes|url=http://www.kingsbridge-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=17871|publisher=Tindle Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After calling in the [[Dartmoor Rescue Group]] and helping the other team, X2414 walked in at 17:19, almost twenty minutes after the close of the event - this would normally debar a team from receiving their awards. The Director Ten Tors, Brigadier Piers Hankinson, met the team at the finish and presented Kingsbridge with their gold medals.

The event weather, following days of heavy rain, was cloudless, sunny and warm with 100% visibility. [http://events.exeter.ac.uk/tentors/2012/diary-11.htm Notes from the Event, 2012]

===2013===

(23% of participants did not finish)

The 2013 event went down in Ten Tors history as one of the most miserable. Organisers said that if the weather had come a day earlier then the event would have been cancelled. Swollen rivers from rain over the previous weeks meant that river crossings were hazardous; teams were offered advice on the best places to cross by Dartmoor Mountain Rescue. Some young people stayed at river crossings for a number of hours, selflessly helping others to cross whilst putting their own chances of finishing on hold.

Especially on Saturday, navigation became extremely difficult as fog and mist reduced visibility to as low as 10 metres: a few less experienced 35 mile teams did not even make their first tor. The weather lifted overnight and gave teams a break from the rain, but this brought near-freezing temperatures across the whole moor. Throughout Sunday the weather worsened again.

Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School 45 mile team S1915 were the first team to make it across the finish line on the Sunday morning at 9:20, over four hours ahead of any other team on their route.

Teams often choose odd dress code for crossing the finishing line. School uniform, kilts, miniskirts and Chinese dragons have all featured in the past. However, this year, the Launceston College 45 mile team decided to cross the line in brightly coloured [[morphsuit]]s. Whilst the rain was beginning to lash down and the traditional Dartmoor high winds persisted, the team sacrificed their finishing time (12:15) to show the spirit and good humour that makes Ten Tors.
 
The finishing gate was left open for an extra 45 minutes. By 11:00 on Sunday morning, over 300 people had dropped out, and by the end of the day the number of people who would not complete had increased to over 500.

===2014===

(81% finished complete) The  first  team to  finish was  the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher's College, Petersfield, Hants.  They  came  over  the  line  at 8.56am  and  was  a  mixed  team:  Olivia  Hart,  Francesca  Hussell, Jerome  Greig,  Ben  Kelson,  Edward  Rodge  and  Owen  Tutt, around 45 minutes ahead of all other teams. In the 55 mile event, Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School were the first to finish, followed a whole two minutes later by the slower King Edward's school.

===2015===
(73.7% complete 18.9% with fall-outs) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tentors.org.uk/archive/2016/entry/ten-tors-2015-stats.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Second time in a row the first team to  finish was  the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher's College, Petersfield, Hants.  They  crossed the finish line  at 9.10am on a foggy Sunday morning  consisting of 14- to 15-year-old boys:  Julian Greig, Dylan Joseph, Joe Keohane, Archie Moffat, Sam Mullender and Jack Stubbings. Second across was Kingswood School, Bath at 9.13.

This was the 55th anniversary of Ten Tors, and to celebrate this, two teams of veterans were given special permission to take part. They did one of the 55 mile routes on the 55th anniversary, all aged over 55 (some considerably so).  Most of them had completed Ten Tors as teenagers in the 1970s whilst at school in Exeter, but none had had the opportunity to do the 55 mile route. Apart from being too old, they followed all the rules, carrying all the same equipment as the young people. Both teams completed the challenge complete; fourteen veterans in all, albeit fairly late in the day on the Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ten Tors 2015: 1970s Exeter School pupils reunite to complete Dartmoor challenge|url = http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Tors-2015-1970s-Exeter-School-pupils-reunite/story-26495344-detail/story.html|website = Exeter Express and Echo|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===

2016 saw warmer weather, getting up to 20&amp;nbsp;°C across the moor. The first team to cross the finish line was Torbay Scouts who took part in the 35-mile (56&amp;nbsp;km) route at 8:51, followed by Monkton Combe CCF (8:59) The National Trust Dartmoor (9:03) (1 hr 50 ahead of anyone else on their route) KES Bath (9:08) and Exeter School's Blackdown Hikers A (9:10) (2 hrs 10 ahead of anyone else on their route). The first 55-mile team to cross the finish line was Colyton Grammar School. They crossed the finish line at 10:52, team consisting of: Matt Domhof, Frank Hartley, Charlie King, Zoe Kuyken, Ellie Marok and Jonny Surtees. At 13:25 a 45-mile team from Kingswood Explorer Scouts came across the line sporting very groovy Hawaiian outfits which was very fitting in the glorious sunshine.

The event also generated a light-hearted news story when the downdraught from a low-flying Royal Navy Merlin Mk3 helicopter blew away a row of portable toilets.  They were not occupied at the time and there were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1VCg5VdP0s&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults were awarded for long service to Ten Tors with 1 40+ Platinum award, 1 30+ Diamond award and 5 20+ gold awards, including Jack Barker, from the Erme and Yealm Hillwalking Club/Ivybridge Community College receiving the Platinum and Diamond; plus Paul Johnson &amp; Peter Challiss  from Tavistock &amp; District Youth Forum.

===2017===
The event had the perfect weather conditions, with it not being too cold or too hot, leading to 84.9% of teams reaching the finish line complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Ten Tors Statistics|url=https://www.tentors.org.uk/archive/2017/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
First to finish were 20th Torbay Scouts, arriving back at the base camp at 08:19 Sunday, followed by Torquay Boys' Grammar School B at 08:37, who finished almost an hour before anyone else on their route after walking for 2.5 hours. The first 55-mile team was that of Torquay Boys' Grammar School A, consisting of Joe Kingdon, Tom Snow, Matt Birdsall, Adam White, Harry Fox and Tom Gregory. They finished at 9:54, beating the previously held record for Route X, introduced in 2014, by 1hr35mins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Results|url=https://www.tentors.org.uk/archive/2017/info/results.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Tors Prayer==
Every year before the start of the event the following prayer is read.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;O God who has made the Earth of great beauty,
and who has given us the Spirit of Adventure,
we thank you for the beauty of the world,
for the courage and vigour of young people,
for the companionship and for the opportunity
to enjoy all these gifts.

We pray that you will keep them safe on this great venture
and grant that they may meet each challenge
and difficulty with unselfish courage and so find the
true spirit of comradeship as shown to us by
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/ten_tors.htm The Dartmoor Ten Tors Expedition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jubilee Challenge==
Since 1977 the '''Jubilee Challenge''' has been run as an additional event: it is a shorter version of the Ten Tors for competitors who are impaired in some way (by either severe learning difficulties or physical disability). The Jubilee Challenge takes place on the Saturday, over distances of 7.5, 8.5, 11, and 15 miles.

The longest distance ever ran three-legged in 24 hours is 109.8 km (68.23 miles) and was achieved by Mark Howlett (Ely, Cambs, England) and Rab Lee (Bo'ness, Scotland), at the Glenmore 24 Hour Trail Race, in the [[Cairngorms National Park]], Scotland, on 7–8 September 2013. This is also the longest distance ever ran three-legged. Mark Howlett and Rab Lee invented 'The Maverick' technique, where one person leans slightly in front of the other to enable faster running.

The world record for the most pairs in a three-legged race is 649, set in 2013 on the [[Isle of Man]]. An August 2014 attempt in [[Canberra]] organised by [[National Rugby League]] team [[Canberra Raiders]] failed; only 543 pairs competed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-12/three-legged-race-world-record-attempt-in-canberra/5665678|title=Three-legged race world record attempt fails in Canberra|last=|first=|date=2014-08-12|website=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veterans Memorial Stadium''' is a [[minor league baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. It is the home field of the [[Cedar Rapids Kernels]] of the [[Midwest League]]. It is often called '''New Veterans Memorial Stadium''' to distinguish it from the original Veterans Memorial Stadium, which existed from 1949 to 2001.

==Overview==
Veterans Memorial Stadium is located southwest of downtown Cedar Rapids on Rockford Road. The [[Cedar Rapids Ice Arena]] and Kingston Stadium, home to Kennedy, Jefferson, and Washington high school football, are both adjacent to Veterans Memorial Stadium.

Veterans Memorial Stadium has a total [[seating capacity]] of 5,300.&lt;ref name="mwlcap"/&gt; It has 12 luxury suites and several sections that are reserved for group outings, including a mezzanine terrace in the upper deck behind first base, a pavilion in left field, and a pre-game picnic area.

In addition to Kernels games, Veterans Memorial Stadium hosted the Midwest League All-Star Game in 2004, and again in 2016. On July 9, 2005, the stadium hosted its first concert, featuring [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. The [[American Legion]] World Series was held there in 2006. It is also occasionally used for high school and college baseball games, including the annual [[Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] baseball tournament. It hosted the annual "Corridor Classic" between the [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] and the [[Northern Iowa Panthers]] until the [[University of Northern Iowa]] discontinued its baseball program.

The city of Cedar Rapids owns Veterans Memorial Stadium, which was named to honor veterans of all wars, and the city's Veterans Memorial Commission operates and maintains the stadium. The [[Linn County, Iowa|Linn County]] All Veterans Memorial is located next to the stadium. In March 2004 the Kernels and the city agreed to a new 40-year lease agreement that reduced the ballclub's monthly payments from the original 20-year agreement that they had signed when the new stadium opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vets Commission OK's Stadium Lease Extension|first=Rick|last=Smith|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1013DBC9DB55E9D8&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;s_dlid=DL0112030600101104273&amp;s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&amp;s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM&amp;s_siteloc=&amp;s_referrer=&amp;s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docsbal=%20&amp;s_subexpires=12%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docstart=&amp;s_docsleft=&amp;s_docsread=&amp;s_username=freeuser&amp;s_accountid=AC0109010521115830983&amp;s_upgradeable=no|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]]|date=March 9, 2004|accessdate=September 16, 2011|page=2B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 the Kernels sold the [[naming rights]] of the playing field to the [[Dale and Thomas Popcorn]] Company. The playing field was known as Dale and Thomas Popcorn Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium for the 2008 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kernels Sell Naming Rights to Field|first=Jeff|last=Johnson|url=http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080313/SPORTS/327182215|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]]|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was renamed Perfect Game Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium when Perfect Game USA, a baseball scouting company based in Cedar Rapids, bought the naming rights to the field in March 2009 in a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kernels Ballpark Gets New Name|first=Justin|last=Foss|url=http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/41864497.html|work=[[KCRG-TV|KCRG]]|location=Cedar Rapids|date=March 25, 2009|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the stadium won a bid to host the [[NCAA Division III Baseball Tournament|NCAA Division III College World Series]] from 2019 to 2022, after long time host of the event the [[Fox Cities Stadium]] in [[Grand Chute, WI]] chose not to bid on the rights to host the event after 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Jason |title=The final College World Series at Fox Cities Stadium |url=https://www.wbay.com/content/news/The-final-College-World-Series-at-Fox-Cities-Stadium-483749131.html |accessdate=24 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cedar Rapids' Memorial Stadium to be the new home for the D-III World Series in 2019 |url=http://www.d3baseball.com/notables/2017/04/cedar-rapids-to-host-championship |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=D3baseball |date=18 April 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original Veterans Memorial Stadium was built in 1949 for the Cedar Rapids Rockets of the [[Central Association]]. It later became home to the Cedar Rapids Indians (1950–1952), the Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953–1957), and the Cedar Rapids Braves (1958–1961) of the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League]]. From 1962 until its demolition, Cedar Rapids' Midwest League teams—which went through several name changes before becoming the Kernels in 1993—played their home games there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike|last=Koolbeck|title=History of Cedar Rapids Professional Baseball|work=Cedar Rapids Kernels Souvenir Program|year=2001|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kernels.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Playing field at the new Veterans Memorial Stadium, during a June 22, 2008, game against the [[Quad Cities River Bandits]]]]During the 1990s, Veterans Memorial Stadium failed to meet many of [[Major League Baseball]]'s new standards for minor league parks as newer facilities were opening in other Midwest League cities. On August 15, 2000, Cedar Rapids voters approved a referendum that helped provide some of the money needed to build a new ballpark adjacent to the old one. (Other funds came from the state of [[Iowa]], the Kernels ballclub, and private donations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Effort Began 7 Years Ago|first=Rick|last=Smith|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0F2C73E851B9A83A&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;s_dlid=DL0112030600083828734&amp;s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&amp;s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM&amp;s_siteloc=&amp;s_referrer=&amp;s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docsbal=%20&amp;s_subexpires=12%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docstart=&amp;s_docsleft=&amp;s_docsread=&amp;s_username=freeuser&amp;s_accountid=AC0109010521115830983&amp;s_upgradeable=no|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]]|date=April 7, 2002|accessdate=September 16, 2011|page=6 (special section)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last game at the old Veterans Memorial Stadium was played on August 28, 2001, with the Kernels defeating the [[Wisconsin Timber Rattlers]], 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fond Farewell Veterans Memorial Stadium|first=Mike|last=Hlas|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EE38CF17A203B1B&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;s_dlid=DL0112030600113528409&amp;s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&amp;s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM&amp;s_siteloc=&amp;s_referrer=&amp;s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docsbal=%20&amp;s_subexpires=12%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docstart=&amp;s_docsleft=&amp;s_docsread=&amp;s_username=freeuser&amp;s_accountid=AC0109010521115830983&amp;s_upgradeable=no|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]]|date=August 29, 2001|accessdate=September 16, 2011|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was demolished shortly afterwards and the site now serves as a parking lot for the new stadium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15295">[[Image:Estonian Carry style.jpg|thumb|right|An Estonian pair competing at a World Championships in [[Sonkajärvi]] using the "Estonian carry" technique]]
'''Wife carrying''' ({{lang-fi|'''eukonkanto''' or '''akankanto'''}}, {{lang-et|'''naisekandmine'''}}, {{lang-sv|'''kärringkånk'''}}) is a contest in which male competitors race while each carrying a female teammate. The objective is for the male to carry the female through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The sport was first introduced at [[Sonkajärvi]], [[Finland]].

Several types of carry may be practised: piggyback, [[fireman's carry]] (over the shoulder), or [[Estonia]]n-style (the wife hangs upside-down with her legs around the husband's shoulders, holding onto his waist).

The Wife Carrying World Championships have been held annually in [[Sonkajärvi]], Finland, since 1992 (where the prize is the wife's weight in [[beer]]).

==History==
{{refimprove section |date=November 2012}}
Eukonkanto originated in Finland. Tales have been passed down of a man named Herkko Rosvo-Ronkainen (aka Ronkainen the Robber&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2154287/wife-carrying-thing-finland-man-and-woman-are-world-champions Wife-carrying is a thing in Finland], [[South China Morning Post|SCMP]], 8 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;). This man was considered a robber in the late 1800s, lived in a forest, and ran around with his gang of thieves causing harm to the villages. From what has been found, there are three ideas as to why/how this sport was invented. Firstly, that Rosvo-Ronkainen and his thieves were accused of stealing food and women from villages in the area he lived in, then carrying these women on their backs as they ran away (hence the "wife" or woman carrying). The second suggestion is that young men would go to neighbouring villages, steal other men’s wives to marry themselves. These wives were also carried on the backs of the young men; this was referred to as “the practice of wife stealing". Lastly, is the idea that Rosvo-Ronkainen trained his thieves to be "faster and stronger" by carrying big, heavy sacks on their backs, from which evolved this sport. Though the sport is often considered a joke, competitors take it very seriously, just like any other sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=English|first1=Nick|title=Wife Carrying Is the Latest Strength Sport for Couples|url=https://barbend.com/wife-carrying-strength-sport-couples/|website=BarBend|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wife carrying contests are now seen in Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Estonia, the UK and other parts of the world besides Finland, and the sport has a category in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.bettor.com/The-Strange-Sport-of-Wife-Carrying-a15233 The Strange Sport of Wife Carrying | bettor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219161852/http://blogs.bettor.com/The-Strange-Sport-of-Wife-Carrying-a15233 |date=2011-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guy-sports.com/months/jokes_wife_carrying.htm Wife Carrying World Championship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theskichannel.com/news/skinews/20101009/Maine-couple-wins-North-American-Wife-Carrying-Championship-at-Sunday-River-Ski-Resort Maine couple wins North American Wife Carrying Championship at Sunday River Ski Resort&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==

The original course was a rough, rocky terrain with fences and brooks, but it has been altered to suit modern conditions. There is now sand instead of full rocks, fences, and some kind of area filled with water (a pool). These are the following rules set by the International Wife Carrying Competition Rules Committee:
* The length of the official track is 253.5 metres.
* The track has two dry obstacles and a water obstacle about one metre deep.
* The wife to be carried may be your own, or the neighbour's, or you may have found her further afield; she must, however, be over 17 years of age.
* The minimum weight of the wife to be carried is 49 [[kilogram]]s. If she weighs less than 49&amp;nbsp;kg, she will be burdened with a rucksack containing additional weight to bring the total load to be carried up to 49&amp;nbsp;kg.
* All participants must enjoy themselves.
* The only equipment allowed is a belt worn by the carrier and a helmet worn by the carried.
* The contestants run the race two pairs at a time, so each heat is a contest in itself.
* Each contestant takes care of his/her safety and, if deemed necessary, insurance.
* The contestants have to pay attention to the instructions given by the organizers of the competition.
* There is only one category in the World Championships, and the winner is the couple who completes the course in the shortest time.
* Also, the most entertaining couple, the best costume, and the strongest carrier will be awarded a special prize.
While the International rules are the basis for all competitions, rules and prizes do vary for each competition.
