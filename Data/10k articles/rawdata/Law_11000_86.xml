      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">The '''American Indian Defense Association''' (AIDA) was an organization founded in 1923 by [[social worker]] [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], that fought to protect religious freedom and tribal property for [[Native Americans in the United States]].&lt;ref name="TMR"&gt;[http://si.unm.edu/bern_2003/lisam/lis_tl/tl.htm Article about The Merriam Report] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031026110457/http://si.unm.edu/bern_2003/lisam/lis_tl/tl.htm |date=2003-10-26 }} URL last accessed 2006-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the AIDA==
[[File:John Collier.png|250px|thumbnail|right|[[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] (May 4, 1884 - May 8, 1968), Commissioner for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], 1933-1945. Collier founded AIDI in 1923.]]

In the 1920s Antonio Luhan a member of the [[Taos Pueblo]] showed [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] the poor living conditions in American Indian communities. In response to what he saw, Collier founded the American Indian Defense Association. For the next decade Collier headed Indian reform efforts, and in 1933 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Collier as the new commissioner of Indian Affairs.&lt;ref name="HMCollier"&gt;[http://www.historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5058/ Historymatters.gmu.edu  John Collier Promises to Reform Indian Policy] URL last accessed 2006-11-18&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately Collier tried to change the government's direction by revitalizing American Indian life and culture.

AIDA was also set up in response to the [[Charles_H._Burke#Burke_and_Native_Americans|1921 and 1923 Leavitt Bill]], also known as the Dance Order.&lt;ref name="OCR"&gt;OCR History A : Civil Rights in the USA 1865-1992; David Paterson, Doug Willoughby, Susan Willoughby; First Published 2009: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; This bill threatened to remove the right of Pueblo Indians to perform some of their traditional dances in New Mexico. The [[Holm O. Bursum|Bursum]] Bill of 1922 also posed a threat as it would authorize the acquisition of Pueblo lands.&lt;ref name="OCR" /&gt;  However, AIDA was able to block both bills successfully.

==American Indian culture==

American Indians culture had been stripped away by measures like the [[Dawes Act]], which had ended tribal government and authorized the sale of tribal land to individuals.&lt;ref name="Dawes"&gt;[http://www.law.du.edu/russell/lh/alh/docs/dawesact.html The Dawes Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210073342/http://www.law.du.edu/russell/lh/alh/docs/dawesact.html |date=2006-12-10 }} URL last accessed 2006-11-18&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years 1887 (the year the Dawes Act came into effect) and 1934 (known as the "Allotment era") the government took over {{convert|90|e6acre|km2}} of tribal lands that were previously guaranteed to tribes by treaties and federal law.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; [[Henry L. Dawes|Henry Dawes]]  who authored the Dawes Act, was quoted as saying that to be civilized, one must "wear civilized clothes...cultivate the ground, live in houses, ride in [[Studebaker]] wagons, send children to school, drink whiskey and own property."&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/eight/dawes.htm pbs org  The Dawes Act] URL last accessed 2006-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio Luhan described how government policies and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] commissioners who enforced them overwhelmed American Indian culture,

{{quote|We have got a real friend in John Collier. He really likes Indians. In past time, we had Commissioners against us who tried to stop our ceremony dances and our dances-religious. They nearly destroy us; call our ways bad or moral or something, and put in the paper they are going to stop us. But John Collier fight for us with the Indian Defense Association and he save us. Now, he look far ahead and it is like he is putting a wall all around us to protect us - and this Wheeler-Howard Bill is this wall. And no white man or grafter can come inside and take away our land or our religion which are connected together. &lt;ref name="HMLuhan"&gt;[http://www.historymatters.gmu.edu/d/26/ historymatters.gmu.edu A Taos Pueblo Tries to Sell the Indian New Deal] URL last accessed 2006-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;|10px}}

==Indian Reorganization Act==

To put these reform ideas into law, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, which  reversed the Dawes Act policy,&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; and as described in section 3 of that act it was to "restore to tribal ownership the remaining surplus lands of any Indian reservation heretofore opened, or authorized to be opened, to sale, or any other form of disposal by Presidential proclamation, or by any of the public land laws of the United States".&lt;ref name="IRA"&gt;[http://www.infca.org/tribes/IRA.htm infca.org - The Indian Reorganization Act, June 18, 1934] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060923155305/http://www.infca.org/tribes/IRA.htm |date=2006-09-23 }} URL last accessed 2006-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act provided funds to start tribal business ventures and to pay for the college education of young American Indians. The allotment process was halted and further losses of Indian land were halted. Tribes were encouraged to create strong tribal governments. Tribes were given the right to form constitutions, have [[self-government]], and to form tribal corporations. A program to provide federal loan money for college and/or vocational school expenses was begun.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics of the American Indian Defense Association complained that Collier had not obtained enough input from the tribes themselves in formulating policies, and that the programs decreased the power of women in some tribes. Still, two-thirds of the nation's American Indians tribes voted to participate in the new programs.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''"Appeal as from an abuse"''' (French ''appel comme d'abus'') is a legal term applied in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], meaning originally a legal appeal as recourse to the civil forum (court) against the usurpation by the ecclesiastical forum of the rights of [[law|civil jurisdiction]]. It could mean (''vice versa'') a recourse to the ecclesiastical forum against the usurpation by the civil forum of the rights of [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]]. 

Thus defined, the "appeal as from an abuse" had as its object was to safeguard equally the rights both of the State and of the Church. An abuse would be an act on either hand, without due authority, beyond the limits of their respective ordinary and natural jurisdictions. In practice the use of such appeals was important, historically, as a way to undermine the power of church courts.

==Canon law==

The canons&lt;ref&gt;can. "Dilecto", in bk. VI of Decretals, "De sent. excom.", in ch. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; did not exclude a recourse to the civil authority when the acts of an ecclesiastical judge invaded the domain of the civil authority, especially as reciprocity gave the ecclesiastical authority the right to repel with the same weapons any usurpation by the lay judge to the damage of the rights of the Church. Thus also a recourse to the supreme civil ruler was not deemed amiss when an ecclesiastical court undertook a cause belonging to the competency of a higher ecclesiastical court, and the ruler was asked&lt;ref&gt;can. "Placuit" in Decree of Gratian, Pt. II, Q. I, ch. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; merely to forward it to the proper tribunal without, however, claiming to delegate to it any jurisdiction. Perhaps the first formal manifestation of this appeal in the legitimate sense occurred in the fourteenth century.

==History==

Ecclesiastical judges acquired a reputation for learning and equity, and by the good will of the State, not merely ecclesiastical, but many civil cases of the laity were adjudicated by them. in 1329 complaint was brought to King [[Philip VI of France|Philip de Valois]] by the advocate general, Peter de Cugnières, that the civil tribunals were fast lapsing into contempt, and were being abandoned. The purport of the complaint was to restrict the competency of the ecclesiastical tribunals to their own legitimate fields. Bickerings between the two forums were henceforth frequent. Even the Catholic states, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, advanced far in the way of frequent ruptures with the Church.

When the Protestant states had acquired control and supervision over the newly reformed bodies even in their spiritual relations, the Catholic states, particularly France, strove to limit the jurisdiction of the Church as far as they could without casting aside the profession of the Catholic Faith. The [[Pragmatic Sanction]] was a serious aggression by France upon the acknowledged rights of the Church and of the Holy See. It is in France that we find the most flagrant series of encroachments upon Church jurisdiction, through pretence of appeals as from an abuse, gradually tending to the elimination of the ecclesiastical forum. 

During the seventeenth century the French clergy presented frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these "appeals as from an abuse", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of faith, the proper administration of the sacraments, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging ecclesiastics to rebel against their lawful ecclesiastical superiors. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate whether the ministers of the sacraments had a right to refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the right to Christian burial of Catholics dying impenitent or under Church censures; whether interdicts or suspensions were valid; whether monastic professions should be annulled; whether the bishop's permission was necessary for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the justice of canonical privations of benefices. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the Church were brought before lay tribunals, and unappealable decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of theological knowledge, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the Church to the dictates of transient politics. 

Interference was mostly owing to courtier-canonists who flattered the secular rulers by dwelling upon the right of protection over the Church conceded in early days to the Christian Roman Emperors. The Church was recognized as autonomous in all things of the divine law and in matters of ecclesiastical discipline. When rulers like [[Charlemagne]] seemed to take upon themselves undue authority, insisting upon certain canons, the bishops claimed their sole right to govern the Church. Even in mixed assemblies of bishops and nobles and princes, the bishops insisted that the civil power should not encroach upon the rights of the Church, e. g. in the [[Concile of Narbonne (788)|Council of Narbonne]] (788). 

Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;Dissertaz. 28&lt;/ref&gt; recognized, however, that in his day (the eighteenth century), as well as in former ages, the Catholic rulers of Catholic States, in their quality of protectors of the Church, might receive a recourse from ecclesiastics in ecclesiastical matters, in order that justice might be done them by their ordinary ecclesiastical judges, not as deputies of the civil rulers, but as ordinary judges in their own forum. In her [[concordat]]s with Catholic states the Catholic Church granted to several that the civil cases of clerics, and such as concern the property and temporal rights of churches, as well as benefices and other ecclesiastical foundations, may be brought before the civil courts.

==Modern relationship==

All ecclesiastical causes, and those that concern the Faith, sacraments, morals, sacred functions, and rights connected with the sacred ministry, belong to the ecclesiastical forum, both in regard of persons and of matter.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Concordat with Ecuador in 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, as decreed by the [[Council of Baltimore]] (1837), the church law is that if any ecclesiastical person or member of a religious body, male or female, should cite an ecclesiastic or a religious before a civil court on a question of a purely ecclesiastical nature, he should know that he falls under the censures decreed by canon law. 

The [[Congregation of Propaganda]] in its comment explained that, in mixed cases, where the persons may be ecclesiastical, but the things about which there is question may be temporal or of one's household, this rule cannot be enforced, especially in countries in which the civil government is not in the hands of Catholics, and where, unless recourse is had to the civil courts, there is not the means or the power of enforcing an ecclesiastical decision for the protection or recovery of one's own. A special proviso was made by Propaganda for the United States,&lt;ref&gt;17 August 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; that if a priest should bring a cleric before a civil tribunal on an ecclesiastical or other question without permission from the bishop he could be forced to withdraw the case by the infliction of penalties and censures, yet the bishop must not refuse the permission if the parties have ineffectually attempted a settlement before him. If the bishop is to be cited, the permission of the Holy See is required. 

By a special declaration of Propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;6 September 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric's transfer of a claim to a layman for the purpose of evading the censures is checked by the requirement of the consent of the bishop to such transfer, if made for the purpose of the suit. Justice Redfield&lt;ref&gt;in vol. XV, Am. Law Reg., p. 277, quoted with approval in vol. XCVIII of Penn. Rep., p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; says in reference to the United States generally: "The decision of ecclesiastical courts or officers having, by the rules or laws of the bodies to which they belong, jurisdiction of such questions, or the right to decide them, will be held conclusive in all courts of the civil administration, and no question involved in such decisions will be revised or reviewed in the civil courts, except those pertaining to the jurisdiction of such courts or officers to determine such questions according to the laws or the usage of the bodies they represent." Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;In his lecture on the "Relations of Civil Law to Church Policy" (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of the Church as "an interior organization within a religious society", and adds,&lt;ref&gt;p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it may be safely asserted as a general principle that whenever questions of discipline, of faith, of Church rule, of membership, or of office, have been decided by the Church, in its own modes of decision, civil law tribunals accept these decisions as final and apply them as made."

[[File:Veny, Girardet - Niquet - Assemblée des notables 1787.jpg|thumb|Engraving showing the Assembly of Notables of 1787 in Versailles]]
An '''Assembly of Notables''' (French: ''Assemblée des notables'') was a group of high-ranking [[French nobility|nobles]], [[Roman Catholicism in France|ecclesiastics]], and state functionaries convened by the [[King of France]] on extraordinary occasions to consult on matters of state.

Assemblies of Notables had met in 1583, 1596–97, 1617, 1626, 1787, and 1788. Like the [[French Estates-General|Estates-General]], they served a consultative purpose only. But unlike the Estates-General, whose members were elected by the subjects of the realm, the assemblymen were selected by the king for their "zeal", "devotion", and their "trustworthiness" toward the sovereign.&lt;ref name="Mousnier, 229"&gt;Mousnier, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblymen were prominent men, usually of the aristocracy, and included royal princes, peers, archbishops, high-ranking judges, and, in some cases, major town officials. The king would issue one or more reforming edicts after hearing their advice.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, '''''assembly of notables''''' can refer to an expanded version of the [[King's Council#France|King's Council]] (''Curia regis''). Several times a year, whenever the king needed to cast a wider net to gather information for making important decisions or preparing edicts and ordinances, he would enlarge his Council with prominent men chosen for their social and professional standing or their skills to give counsel on the matters at hand. The role of the assembly was to advise the king on how to remedy governance issues brought up by the Estates-General.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

==1583 assembly==
In November 1583, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] convened an assembly of notables at [[Saint Germain-en-Laye]] to address religious demonstrations that threatened the collapse of the State. In the assembly, [[Cardinal de Bourbon|Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon]] called for a religious monopoly in France; he said that if this was offered, the clergy would sell their shirts to support the king.&lt;ref name="Sutherland, 54"&gt;Sutherland, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Henry, however, angrily interrupted him, knowing the origin of that hostile demand; any attempt to impose one religion was unthinkable while [[Anjou]] remained attached to the [[Netherlands]]. Henry replied that he had already risked his life and estate to establish a single religion, but since he had been forced to sue for peace, he would not breach it.&lt;ref name="Sutherland, 54"/&gt;

== 1596 assembly ==
Following the regicide of Henry III, his successor was [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] who learned from the experience of Henry III. He himself had called on the assembly's assistance in 1596–97 at [[Rouen]]. The assemblymen were summoned to assist in developing and authorizing new taxation plans for the country to tackle the debt. There were 95 notables present, and they recommended that the king levy a special sales tax of 5% on all sales—with the exception of wheat, to avoid bread riots. It was estimated that this ''pancarte'' would raise 5 million French pounds (''livres''), but in its best year it raised only 1.56 million pounds. Although the tax raised less than predicted, it did restore the royal budget to solvency. King Henry and the [[duc de Sully|Duke of Sully]] had come up with many other possible ways to raise money, but the key to rescuing the monarchy from bankruptcy was simply to ensure that the system of taxation worked efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1626 assembly ==
In 1626 [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] called together an assembly consisting of the government's ruling elite—13 grandees, 13 bishops, and 29 judges. Many historians have regarded this assembly, and its predecessors, as unsuccessful because they failed to enact specific reforms, but this view fails to consider the assemblies' role. The assemblies had no legislative or administrative powers; instead, they served to provide considered advice on government reform proposals and to make appropriate counter-proposals. In the case of every successful assembly, the king himself would issue a major ordinance or enact significant reforms, most notably the Edict of Blois 1579, in response to the Estates-General of 1576, and the great Code Michau 1629, in response to the Assembly of Notables of 1626–27.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The king and the notables agreed on four basic changes in French government. First, they agreed that [[Protestantism|Protestant]] power had to be broken. There was no specific discussion of a march on [[La Rochelle]], but the notables firmly supported the king's desire to destroy the network of independent [[Huguenot]] fortresses. Second, the notables, like those of 1596 and 1617, strongly criticized the grandees, particularly provincial governors. In 1626–27, the notables insisted in particular that the king should regain full control of the military. Third, everyone agreed that the basic administration of the kingdom lay in disarray, so that a strong statement from the central government was needed to reestablish order. In most cases, this reaffirmation of government control required only the restatement of pre-existing ordinances. Fourth, everyone agreed that the fiscal situation was catastrophic. The overwhelming majority of the assembly's deliberations focused on this last issue.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1787 assembly ==
The final appearance of the Assembly of Notables began in February 1787 during [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s reign, during which France’s finances were in a desperate situation and the finance ministers of the day ([[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], [[Jacques Necker|Necker]], [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]]) all believed that tax reform was necessary if France was going to pay off its debt and bring government expenditure back into line with government income. However, before any new tax laws could be passed, they first had to be registered with the French [[Parlement|''parlements'']] (which were high courts, not legislatures, but that possessed a limited veto power on new laws).

Repeated attempts to implement tax reform failed due to lack of ''[[parlement]]'' support, as ''parlement'' judges felt that any increase in tax would have a direct negative effect on their own income. In response to this opposition, the finance minister at the time, Calonne, suggested that Louis XVI call an Assembly of Notables. While the Assembly of Notables had no legislative power in its own right, Calonne hoped that if the Assembly of Notables could be made to support the proposed reforms then this would apply pressure on parlement to register them. 

Calonne proposed four major reforms:&lt;ref name="citizens"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]|date=1989|publisher=[[Random House]]|pages=287–92, 310|last1=Schama|first1=Simon|authorlink1=Simon Schama}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a single [[Land value tax|land-value tax]]
# the conversion of the ''[[corvée]]'' into a money tax
# the abolition of internal [[Tariff|tariffs]]
# the creation of elected provincial assemblies

In the traditional view, the plan failed because the 144 assemblymen, who included [[Prince du Sang|princes of the blood]], archbishops, noblemen and other people from the traditional elite, did not wish to bear the burden of increased taxation. 

However, Simon Schama has argued that the notables in fact were quite open to radical political changes; for example, some proposed the elimination of ''all'' the tax exemptions conferred by [[French nobility|noble status]]; others proposed ''lowering'' the income qualifications for voting for members of the proposed provincial assemblies.&lt;ref name="citizens"/&gt; Schama wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet what was truly astonishing about the debates of the Assembly is that they were marked by a conspicuous acceptance of principles like fiscal equality that even a few years before would have been unthinkable....Where disagreement occurred, it was not because Calonne had shocked the Notables with his announcement of a new fiscal and political world; it was either because he had not gone far enough or because they disliked the operational methods built into the program.&lt;ref name="citizens"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the Assembly insisted that the proposed reforms should actually be presented to a representative body such as the [[French Estates-General|Estates-General]].

Opposition in the Assembly combined with intrigues from rival ministers led to Calonne's disgrace and he was subsequently dismissed by Louis XVI on 8 April 1787. In addition to tax reform, the Assembly also discussed other issues. The result was that the Assembly assisted the Parliament in creating provincial assemblies, reestablished free trade in grain, converted the ''corvée'' (a feudal duty in the form of forced labour) into a cash payment, and generated short-term loans.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Calonne's successor, [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne|Loménie de Brienne]], dissolved the body on 25 May.&lt;ref name="citizens" /&gt;

'''Attorney misconduct''' is unethical or illegal conduct by an attorney.  Attorney Misconduct may include: [[conflict of interest]], over billing, refusing to represent a client for political or professional motives, false or misleading statements, hiding evidence, abandoning a client, failing to disclose all relevant facts, arguing a position while neglecting to disclose prior law which might counter the argument, and'' in some instances'' having sex with a client.

The advent of electronic record keeping and "e-discovery" has also resulted in a record number of attorney sanctions for a range of abuses from failure to produce to the leaking of sealed documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.findlaw.com/strategist/2011/01/attorney-e-discovery-sanctions-at-all-time-high.html Attorney E-Discovery Sanctions At All-Time High], FindLaw blog, January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a case highlighting such abuses, in 2007 plaintiff's in a pharmaceutical lawsuit were found to conspire with attorneys and journalists to publicize protected discovery documents defying a judge's [[protective order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlf.org/upload/042707womeldorf.pdf When conspirators defy protective orders], Washington Legal Foundation, April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Durham County, North Carolina prosecutor, [[Mike Nifong]], gained national infamy for a pattern of '''attorney misconduct''' related to the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal]].

[[Legal malpractice]] is a separate concept such as when an attorney fails to adequately, professionally, competently, or zealously represent a client.  While malpractice and misconduct may often be found in the same matter, they are separate concepts and need not both exist.

==Codification of rules and enforcement==

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has established model rules of professional conduct expected of attorneys, which most states in the U.S. have incorporated as part of their state laws.  Each state issues its own set of rules governing the ethical rules and the related enforcement of those rules, generally through their state [[bar association]]s.  As the state bar organizations and their enforcement mechanisms are composed of lawyers who set the rules, the regulation of attorney ethics is [[Industry self-regulation|self regulated and self policed]].  The self-regulation of any industry by its economic participants poses an inherent [[conflict of interest]] between the professional objectives of the members of the profession and those for whom the regulation would protect.  Some academic researchers and industry pundits have asserted that attorney discipline in the U.S. is ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie C. Levin, The Emperor's Clothes and Other Tales About the Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline Sanctions, 48 American University Law Review 1 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula A. Monopoli, Legal Ethics and Practical Politics: Musings on the Public Perception of Lawyer Discipline, 10 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 423, 425 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and favors lawyers and law firms.&lt;ref&gt;William T. Gallagher, "Ideologies of Professionalism and the Politics of Self-Regulation in the California State Bar," 22 Pepp. L. Rev. 485, 490-491.(1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual lawyers or their firms may be cited for misconduct by a judge in the originating proceedings or by a corresponding state bar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11664">When a person makes a claim for personal injury damages that have resulted from the presence of a defective automobile or component of an automobile, that person asserts a [[product liability]] claim. That claim may be against the automobile's manufacturer, the manufacturer of a component part or system, or both, as well as potentially being raised against companies that distributed, sold or installed the part or system that is alleged to be defective.

==United States==

=== History ===
A major foundation for modern awareness of the defects found in automobiles was laid when [[Ralph Nader]] published his book ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' about the [[Chevrolet Corvair]] and defects found in other vehicles. A focus of this book was the car manufacturers' intentional choice of saving a few dollars for each car instead of providing safe design and manufacture of their products, as well as avoiding the adding of devices which would protect car occupants from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nader|first1=Ralph|title=Unsafe At Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile|date=1965|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ford Pinto]] gas tank cases present another instance of saving money at the cost of serious injury to consumers. In ''Grimshaw v Ford'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 119 Cal. App. 3d 757, 174 Cal. Rptr. 348 (1981)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18233262370572877988|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[California Court of Appeal]] upheld a jury verdict of $2.5 million in compensatory damages and $125 million in punitive damages (reduced to $3.5 million by the trial court as a condition of denying a motion for new trial). The jury found that [[Ford Motor Company]] had known about the unsafe design of the gas tank used in the Pinto, and that this design was an intentional choice by Ford which decided to use a cheaper design which knowingly greatly increased the risk of fire in a rear-impact accident, rather than a more expensive design which would have prevented the death of an occupant.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of these cases, see {{cite book|last1=Palmitar|first1=Alan P.|title=Law &amp; Valuation: Cases and Materials|date=1999|publisher=Wake Forest University Professional Center|url=https://users.wfu.edu/palmitar/Law&amp;Valuation/Papers/1999/Leggett-pinto.html|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety regulations===

The National Transportation Safety has recognized the danger of rollovers, and the prevalence of rollovers as a result of the defect created by the design of many SUVs.  NHTSA has actively campaigned against this design defect&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=Planning Document for Rollover Prevention and Injury Mitigation, Docket 91-68 No. 1|url=http://mvhap.org/mvhappdfs/ro.nhtsa.plans.9.92.pdf|website=Motor Vehicle Hazards|publisher=Office of Vehicle Standards|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Crashes Involving 15-Passenger Vans, DOT HS 809 735|url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/809735|website=National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has adopted and promoted its rollover safety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rollover|url=https://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle-Shoppers/Rollover|website=Safercar.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicle safety ratings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety Ratings|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings|website=NHTSA|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has actively promoted the adoption of electronic stability control systems.

Roof pillars may appear strong to the average consumer, but many of them are constructed only of sheet metal that is hollow on the inside at the cross sections. Designs exist to reinforce these pillars at little additional cost. Vehicle design is supposed to depend on a structural support system that creates a "survival space" that protects car occupants in a crash from injury due to roof crush. A weak roof makes a vehicle defective, and roof crushes can cause serious injuries. In 1973, the government passed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 216, creating a standard roof strength test to measure the integrity of roof structure in motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roof strength is focus of new rating system; 4 of 12 small SUVs evaluated earn top marks|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/roof-strength-is-focus-of-new-rating-system-4-of-12-small-suvs-evaluated-earn-top-marks|website=IIHS News|publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Highway Loss Data Institut|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite federal standards, some vehicle roofs may crush by a foot or more during a rollover accident.

== Common defect claims ==

Among the problems with design or manufacture that may give rise to an automobile product liability claim are the following:

*'''Inadequate passenger restraints''': An occupant of a vehicle is at increased risk of injury if the restraint system, including active restraints such as [[seat belt]]s and passive restraints such as [[airbag]]s, fail to keep the occupant in his or her seat, or fail to prevent the passenger from being ejected from the vehicle. Such a failure may cause or contribute to serious injury and death in what might otherwise have been an accident with minor injuries or without injury. Beside seat belts, the most important injury prevention devices in the car are '''front and side impact airbags'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Bags|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/air-bags|website=NHTSA|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Vehicle Instability''':  An unstable vehicle may be subject to rollover accidents. During the 1990s and early 2000s, there were a large number of accidents that involved vehicle's rolling over. This type of issue led to a product liability claims against a number of SUV models, which had a higher-than-normal center of gravity. Because they are taller and narrower, SUVs, or sports utility vehicles, are three times more likely to roll over in an accident than are other passenger cars.&lt;ref name="crvi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Car rollover 101|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/02/rollover-101/index.htm|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Roof crush''': When a vehicle rolls over and ends up on its roof, the weight of the vehicle may cause the roof of the vehicle to collapse, potentially crushing the occupants of the vehicle. Roof crush injury risks are higher in vehicles with a greater propensity to roll over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roof Crush Resistance|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/fmvss/roof-crush-resistance|website=NHTSA|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roof Strength Testing and Real-World Roof Intrusion in Rollovers, DOT HS 811 365|url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811365|website=National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA)|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof crush kills or inures  thousands of people every year.&lt;ref name="crvi"/&gt;

*'''Tires''': Problems with a vehicle's tires may result in the unexpected loss of control of a vehicle, due to such problems as reduced traction or a sudden loss of tire pressure during operation of the vehicle. Defects in the design or manufacture of a tire may result in tire tread separation of sidewall failure, even during normal use. Incorrect maintenance information provided by a manufacturer may cause a vehicle owner to overinflate or underinflate tires, reducing safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tire Safety: Everything Rides On It|url=https://one.nhtsa.gov/Vehicle-Safety/Tires/Tire-Safety:-Everything-Rides-On-It|website=NHTSA|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tires|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/tires|website=NHTSA|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Unintended acceleration]]''': A defect with the vehicle's accelerator or the layout of the pedals results in unwanted or accidental acceleration of the vehicle. Pedal layout issues led to product liability claims against the [[Audi 100|Audi 5000]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huber|first1=Peter W.|title=Manufacturing the Audi Scare|url=https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/manufacturing-audi-scare-5665.html|publisher=Manhattan Institute|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=18 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in a massive [[2010 Toyota Vehicle Recall]] and suspension of production and sales of many of the most popular Toyota models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Angus|title=The Toyota Recall Crisis|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-recall-crisis/|accessdate=10 August 2017|publisher=Motor Trend|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Dangerous modification''': A vehicle may be altered by a dealership or third party service center for reasons relating to appearance and performance. Some vehicle alterations, such as raising or lowering a vehicle, or the use of third party after-market parts and accessories that may not be approved for use on passenger vehicles, may affect the safety and stability of the vehicle. Other alterations may distract or confuse other drivers, potentially increasing the chance of an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Potentially Dangerous Auto Accessories and Modifications|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer/auto_accessories.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cenziper|first1=Debbie|title=Some after-market motorcycle parts don’t meet safety or environmental standards, experts say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/some-after-market-motorcycle-parts-dont-meet-safety-or-environmental-standards-experts-say/2012/05/26/gJQAgQezsU_story.html|accessdate=10 August 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Government Regulation of Specialty Auto Parts|url=https://www.sema.org/federal-regulation-aftermarket-parts|website=SEMA|publisher=Specialty Equipment Market Association|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ballot access''' rules, called [[nomination rules]] outside the United States, regulate the conditions under which a candidate or [[political party]] is entitled either to stand for election or to appear on voters' [[ballots]]. The criteria to stand as a candidate depend on the individual legal system, however they may include the [[age of candidacy|age of a candidate]], citizenship, endorsement by a political party and profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/pc/pcc/pcc02/pcc02b] ACE Encyclopaedia: Criteria to stand as a candidate. Retrieved 15 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of ballot access==
Each [[U.S. State]] has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots. According to the [[Elections Clause]] in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], Section 4, of the [[United States Constitution]], the authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections is up to each State, unless Congress legislates otherwise.

The primary argument put forward by States for restricting ballot access has been the presumption that setting ballot access criteria too low would result in numerous candidates on the ballot, splitting the votes of similar minded voters. Example: With [[plurality voting]], also known as [[First past the post]], the candidate with the most votes wins, even if the candidate does not have a majority of the votes. Suppose 55% Belief A and 45% Belief B vote in a district. If two candidates appeal to A, but only one appeals to B, the votes of A could split between the two A candidates, say 25% vote for one and 30% for the other, giving the B candidate the office although 55% preferred to see an A candidate in the office.  However, proponents of ballot access reform say that reasonably easy access to the ballot does not lead to a glut of candidates, even where many candidates do appear on the ballot. The 1880s reform movement that led to officially designed secret ballots, such as the [[Australian ballot]], had some salutary effects,{{says who?|date=October 2018}} but it also gave the government control over who could be on the ballot.{{cn|date=October 2018}} As historian Peter Argersinger has pointed out, the reform that empowered officials to regulate access onto the ballot, also carried the danger that this power would be abused by officialdom and that legislatures controlled by established political parties, would enact restrictive ballot access laws to ensure re-election of their party's candidates.

Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the 1880s ballot reform movement, [[Dean Wigmore]], suggested that "ten signatures" might be an appropriate requirement for nomination to the official ballot for a legislative office. In the 20th century, ballot access laws imposing signature requirements far more restrictive than Wigmore had envisioned were enacted by many state legislatures; in many cases, the two major parties wrote the laws such that the burdens created by these new ballot access requirements (usually in the form of difficult signature-gathering [[nominating petition]] drives) fell on alternative candidates, but not on major party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Winger, {{cite web|url=http://www.ballot-access.org/winger/iba.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130060402/http://ballot-access.org/winger/iba.html |archivedate=January 30, 2013 }} "The Importance of Ballot Access", ''Long Term View'' (Andover, MA: Massachusetts School of Law, Spring 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of more open ballot access argue that restricting ballot access has the effect of unjustly restricting the choices available to voters, and typically disadvantages [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates and other candidates who are not affiliated with the established parties.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the [[Copenhagen Document]] of the [[Helsinki Accords]] that states in part:

{{cquote|(7.5) – respect the right of citizens to seek political or public office, individually or as representatives of political parties or organizations, without discrimination;

(7.6) – respect the right of individuals and groups to establish, in full freedom, their own political parties or other political organizations and provide such political parties and organizations with the necessary legal guarantees to enable them to compete with each other on a basis of equal treatment before the law and by the authorities;...}}

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) has criticized the United States for its ballot access laws. In 1996, United States delegates responded to the criticism by saying that unfair ballot access "could be remedied through existing appeal and regulatory structures and did not represent a breach of the Copenhagen commitments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballot-access.org/1997/0505.html#01] "U.S. Supreme Court Rules Against Fusion", ''Ballot Access News'', 5 May 1997. Retrieved 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The OSCE published a report on the 2004 United States election, which among other things, noted restrictive ballot access laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/03/13658_en.pdf] "OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission Final Report on the 2 November 2004 elections in the United States", ''OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights'', 31 March 2005.

==Ballot access laws by state==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
Ballot access laws in the United States vary widely from state to state:
* '''Alabama''': Major party candidates are nominated by the state primary process. Independent candidates are granted ballot access through a petition process and minor political party candidates are nominated by convention along with a petition process; one must collect 3% of the total votes cast in the last election for the specific race or 3% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election for statewide ballot access. The figure for 2016 and 2018 statewide ballot access is 35,412 valid signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpalabama.org/get-involved/ballot-access/ballot-access-2018/|title=Constitution Party|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alabamavotes.gov/downloads/election/2016/ic-info-2016.pdf|title=Alabama Votes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be aware that the validity of signatures generally means that 20–30% more signatures will need to be collected to ensure that the goal is achieved. To retain ballot access in the following election, a party has to poll 20% in a statewide race.
[[File:Arizona Greens ballot status signature collectors 20080209.jpg|thumb|right|Activists of the [[Arizona Green Party]] collecting signatures for ballot status]]
* '''Arizona''': To gain ballot access, a new political party must gather signatures on a county–by–county basis, achieving over 20,000 valid signatures (i.e. from registered voters). Once this has been achieved the party must run a candidate for Governor or President who garners at least 5% of the vote to maintain ballot access for an additional two years, maintain at least 1% of registered voters registered with their party, or gather approximately the same number of signatures again every two years. The Democratic, Libertarian, and Republican parties have ballot access by voter registrations. In 2008, the [[Arizona Green Party]] gathered enough signatures to gain ballot access.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Pitzl, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5amSbCrie?url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/04/20/20080420greens0420.html] "Green Party wins ballot status", ''The Arizona Republic'', 20 April 2008. Retrieved 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''California''': Per section 5100 of the California Election Code, ballot access requires one of two conditions to be met:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_t.htm|title=California Secretary of State - Political Party Qualification|publisher=Sos.ca.gov|date=7 November 2006|accessdate=9 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506021427/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_t.htm|archivedate=6 May 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** If on or before the 135th day before any primary election, it appears to the Secretary of State, as a result of examining and totaling the statement of voters and their political affiliations transmitted to him or her by the county elections officials, that voters equal in number to at least 1 percent of the entire vote of the state at the last preceding gubernatorial election have declared their intention to affiliate with that party.
* '''Colorado''' has relatively lax ballot access requirements, but requirements differ for major and minor parties. For major party primary candidates (Democratic, Republican, and American Constitution parties are major parties for 2012 because of the votes drawn by ACP candidate Tom Tancredo in 2010), C.R.S. 1-4-801 requires statewide candidates (including US Senate) obtain 1,500 valid signatures per congressional district. US House and State legislature candidates need 1000 signatures. Candidates may also be named to ballots by a caucus, county assembly, and state or district assembly process; a candidate who draws less than 10% of an assembly is ineligible to petition on the same primary ballot. For minor party candidate, the petition requirements are eased under C.R.S 1-4-802. For US Senate, 1,000 signatures are required; for US House, 800 signatures; for State Senate, 600 signatures; and for State House, 400. Sometimes these requirements are relaxed even further based on the voting statistics of the district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.colorado.gov/WWW/default/Candidates/Signature%20Requirements%20-%20MINOR.pdf] 16 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Georgia''' In 2016 Georgia required a 3rd party presidential candidate to produce 7,500 signatures of registered voters to gain ballot access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/third-parties-challenge-state-ballot-rules/article_890e92b8-699e-11e6-9256-8786c63db86b.html] 2016-08-26&lt;/ref&gt;  The 7,500 number was imposed by Federal District Court Judge Richard Story in a 2016-03-17 ruling against the state that their requirement of signatures equaling at least 1% of the total number of registered and eligible voters in the most recent presidential election was an unconstitutionally high barrier.  The number would have been about 50,334.  On 2016-04-13, the Georgia secretary of state appealed the decision without seeking a stay until the state legislature acts to change the requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/04/14/georgia-to-fight-ruling-that-lowers-bar-for-third-party-presidential-candidates/] 2016-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kentucky''' uses a three-tier system for ballot access, using the results of the previous presidential election as the gauge. If a party's presidential candidate achieves less than 2% of the popular vote within the state, that organization is a "political group". If the candidate receives 2% or more, but less than 20% of the popular vote in Kentucky, that organization is a "political organization". Parties whose candidate for president achieves at least 20% of the popular vote are considered "political parties". Taxpayer-funded primaries are achieved as a "political party". Automatic ballot access is obtained as a "political organization" or "political party", and these levels require only 2 signatures for a candidate to run for any partisan office. There is no mechanism for placing an entire party on the ballot in Kentucky, other than achieving "political organization" or "political party" status. Candidates of "political groups" and independent candidates must collect a minimum of between 25 and 5000 signatures to run for any particular partisan office. Filing fees apply equitably to all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/118-00/CHAPTER.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the state only tracked voter registration affiliation as Democratic (D), Republican (R), or Other (O). Beginning 1 January 2006, Kentucky law provides for County Clerks to track the voter registration of Constitution (C), Green (G), Libertarian (L), Reform (F), and Socialist Workers (S), as well as independent (I);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/031/004/150.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; though a number of County Clerks have not been complying with this regulation.
*'''Louisiana''' is one of the easiest states to get on the ballot. Anyone may obtain a spot on the ballot by either paying a qualifying fee, or submitting petition signatures. For independent candidates for President (or non-recognized parties) the fee is $500 or 5000 signatures, with at least 500 from each Congressional district. Recognized Parties simply file their slate of Electors - their access is automatic, no fee or signatures required. For statewide office, the signature requirement is the same as that for President, but the fees are $750 for Governor and $600 for all other statewide offices.  District and local office fees range from $40 or 50 signatures for a small town office, to $600 or 1000 signatures for US House. All signatures for district offices must come from within that district. If the office is for a political party committee, the signatures must be from people affiliated with that party. For Presidential Preference Primaries, the fee is $750 or 1000 signatures affiliated with that party from each Congressional district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.la.gov/Portals/0/elections/pdf/FEES2010120209.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404142340/http://www.sos.la.gov/Portals/0/elections/pdf/FEES2010120209.pdf |archivedate=April 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(pdf) Present Louisiana law only allows for Presidential Primaries if a party has more than 40,000 registered voters statewide. Currently, this only applies to the Democratic and Republican Parties. Louisiana law changed in 2004 under efforts from the Libertarian Party of Louisiana to relax rules in place at that time for recognizing political parties in the state. There are now two methods to gain official recognition. Method A allows a party to be recognized if it pays a $1000 fee AND has 1000 or more voters registered under its label. To retain recognition, it must field a candidate at least once in any four-year period in a statewide election – with no requirement on performance in the election. Statewide election slots include Presidential Elector, Governor, Senator, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, Comm. of Insurance, and Commissioner of Agriculture.  To date, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have used this method to attain and retain official party recognition. Method B allows a party to be recognized if one of its candidates in a statewide race or for Presidential Elector achieves 5% of the vote. To retain recognition, it must repeat the 5% tally for statewide office or Presidential Elector at least once in any four-year period. To date, the Reform Party has used this method to gain and retain official party recognition. Due to their size, parties recognized by these methods are exempt from certain laws governing public elections of political committee offices and from certain financial reporting requirements until their membership reaches 5% of registered voters statewide. Recognized political parties in Louisiana are allowed to have their party name appear alongside their candidates on the ballot, and for their party to be offered as a specific choice on voter registration cards. Non-recognized parties appear as OTHER, and the party name must be written in on the registration card.  Non-affiliated voters are listed as N for No Party. In the 2008 and 2010 Congressional elections, Louisiana experimented with closed primaries for House and Senate. Under this system, recognized parties participated in semi-closed primaries before the general election. Only one candidate from each party was allowed on the General Election ballot; there was no limit for OTHER or NONE. An attempt to pass a law differentiating "minor" parties similar to the rule for Presidential Primaries was defeated but made irrelevant by Louisiana reverting to its "Jungle Primary" system where all candidates, regardless of number from any party, all compete together on the same ballot. If no one achieves a majority, a general election is held as a run-off between the top two, also regardless of party affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=81575]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.la.gov/Portals/0/elections/pdf/Lapoliticalparties122809.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404142344/http://www.sos.la.gov/Portals/0/elections/pdf/Lapoliticalparties122809.pdf |archivedate=April 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Maryland''': Party certifications are done for each gubernatorial cycle (e.g. 2006–2010). If the number of registered voters to a political party is less than 1%, then 10,000 petition signatures must be gathered for that party to be considered certified. A party must be certified before voters can register under that party. A party can also be certified for a two-year term if their "top of the ticket" candidate receives more than 1% of the vote.
* '''Michigan''':  Major party candidates for Congress, governor, state legislature, countywide offices, and township offices are chosen through a primary system. A candidate can appear on the ballot by filing petition signatures; candidates for certain offices may file a $100 filing fee in lieu of filing petition signatures. All minor-party candidates, as well as major-party candidates for certain statewide offices, are chosen by a convention. Candidates running for nonpartisan offices (including judgeships, school boards, and most city offices) can appear on the ballot via petitions, as can candidates running for partisan offices without party affiliation.
* '''Minnesota''': Major party candidates are nominated by the state primary process. Independent and minor political party candidates are nominated by a petition process; 2,000 signatures for a statewide election, or 500 for a state legislative election. Candidates have a two-week period to collect nominating petition signatures. Independent candidates may select a brief political party designation in lieu of independent.
* '''Missouri''' exempts parties from needing to gather signatures if they attain 2% of the vote in a statewide election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c100-199/1150000317.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126074214/http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C100-199/1150000317.HTM |archivedate=January 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''New York''' ''{{main article|Qualified New York political parties}}'': To be recognized, a political party must gain 50,000 votes in the most recent gubernatorial election. (There are, as of 2019, eight such parties. Three of these have primarily resorted to [[electoral fusion]] and usually only nominate candidates already on either the Democratic or Republican lines.) This allows for primary elections and allows statewide candidates to be exempted from having to petition. Any other candidate must file petitions. For statewide candidates, 15,000 signatures are required, and there must be at least 100 signatures from each of at least 1/2 of the congressional districts in the state (27 as of 2014). All state legislature and congressional candidates must file petitions regardless of party nominations, except in special elections.

An independent presidential candidate, or the presidential candidate of an unqualified party, may get on the ballot with a petition of 3% of the last presidential vote. Oklahoma is the only state in the nation in which an independent presidential candidate, or the presidential candidate of a new or previously unqualified party, needs support from more than 2% of the last vote cast to get on the ballot.

A political party with a voter enrollment equal to less than 15% of the state's total partisan enrollment is classified as a "minor political party," which has automatic ballot access in [[by-election|special elections]] but must otherwise collect the same number of signatures as political bodies.

===Constitutional dimensions of ballot access laws===
State ballot access restrictions can affect fundamental constitutional rights,{{says who?|date=October 2018}} including:
* the right to [[equal protection]] of the laws under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (when the restrictions involve a discriminatory classification of voters, candidates, or political parties);
* rights of political association under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (especially when the restrictions burden the rights of political parties and other political associations, but also when they infringe on the rights of a candidate or a voter not to associate with a political party);
* rights of free expression under the first amendment;
* rights of voters (which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has said are "inextricably intertwined" with the rights of candidates);
* property interests and liberty interests in candidacy;
* other rights to "[[due process of law]]".

It has also been argued{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that ballot access restrictions infringe the following constitutional rights:
* the [[right to petition the government]] (this argument is sometimes raised to allege that signature-gathering requirements, or the rules implementing them, are unfairly restrictive);
* [[freedom of the press]] (which historically included the right to print ballots containing the name of the candidate of one's choosing);
* the right to a "[[republican form of government]]," which is guaranteed to each state (although this clause has been held not to be enforceable in court by individual citizens).

The US Supreme Court precedent on ballot access laws cases has been conflicting.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In ''[[Williams v. Rhodes]]'' (1969) the court struck down Ohio's ballot access laws on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.  During the 1970s the Supreme Court upheld strict ballot access laws, with a 'compelling State interest' being the "preservation of the integrity of the electoral process and regulating the number of candidates on the ballot to avoid voter confusion."&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Right To Candidacy.  Nicole A. Gordon  Political Science Quarterly Volume 91, Number 3, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court did strike down provisions in a ballot access law in [[Anderson v. Celebrezze]],' 460 U.S. 780 (1983), but most of the subsequent court rulings in the 1980s–2000s continued to uphold ballot access laws in both primary and general elections. Among the most notable of these cases from the 1970s–1990s:
* ''[[Bullock v. Carter]],'' 405 U.S. 134 (1972)
* ''[[Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party]],'' 440 U.S. 173 (1979)
* ''[[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton]],'' 514 U.S. 779 (1995)
* ''[[Lubin v. Panish]],'' 415 U.S. 709 (1974)
* ''[[Norman v. Reed]],'' 502 U.S. 279 (1992).

The Supreme Court has not expressly ruled on the maximum level of restrictions that can be imposed on an otherwise qualified candidate or political party seeking ballot access. As a result, lower courts have often reached difficult conclusions about whether a particular ballot access rule is unconstitutional.

Requiring an otherwise eligible candidate or political party to obtain signatures greater than 5% of the eligible voters in the previous election may be unconstitutional. This is based on ''Jenness v. Fortson,'' 403 U.S. 431 (1971); the court upheld a restrictive ballot access law with this 5% signature requirement, whereas the ''[[Williams v. Rhodes]]'' (1969) had involved a 15% signature requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/431/case.html] "Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431 (1971)", ''US Supreme Court Center''. Retrieved 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most State ballot access requirements, even the more restrictive ones, are less than 5%, and the Supreme Court has generally refused to hear ballot access cases that involved an Independent or minor party candidate challenging a ballot access law that requires less than 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballot-access.org/2007/060107.html#1] "Oklahoma Supreme Court Won't Hear Ballot Case – Libertarian Ballot Access Case Had Been Filed in 2004", ''Ballot Access News'', 1 June 2007. Retrieved 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===International human rights law and ballot access===
International agreements that have the status of treaties of the US are part of the supreme law of the land, under Article VI of the United States Constitution:
* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 25
* Copenhagen Document, ¶¶6-8, Annex I to 1990 Charter of Paris

Another source of international human rights law derives from universally accepted norms that have found expression in resolutions of the U.N. General Assembly. Although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not binding under US law the way a treaty is, this type of norm is recognized as a source of international law in such treaties as the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to which the US is a party:
* Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art. 21

(NB: to be completed)

==Write-in status versus ballot access==
Depending on the office and the state, it may be possible for a voter to cast a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]] vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot. It is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office. In some cases, write-in votes are simply not counted{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Having one's name printed on the ballot confers an enormous advantage over candidates who are not on the ballot. The US Supreme Court has noted that write-in status is absolutely no substitute for being on the ballot{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

The two most notable cases of write-in candidates actually winning are the elections of [[Lisa Murkowski]] in 2010 and [[Strom Thurmond]] in 1954, both to the [[United States Senate]]. Other cases include the election of [[Charlotte Burks]] to the [[Tennessee State Senate]] seat of  her late husband, [[Tommy Burks]], murdered by his [[Byron Looper|only opponent on the ballot]]; and the write-in primary victories in the re-election campaign of Mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] of the [[District of Columbia]]. All of these cases involved unique political circumstances, a popular and well–known candidate, and a highly organized and well–funded write-in education campaign.

==Other obstacles facing third parties==
The growth of any third political party in the United States faces extremely challenging obstacles, among them restrictive ballot access. Other obstacles often cited{{By whom|date=February 2010}} as barriers to third-party growth include:
* Campaign funding reimbursement for any political party that gets at least 5% of the vote—implemented in many states "to help smaller parties"—typically helps the two biggest parties;
* Laws intended to fight corporate donations, with loopholes that require teams of lawyers to navigate the laws;
* The role of corporate money in propping up the two established parties;
* The allegedly related general reluctance of news organizations to cover minor political party campaigns;
* Moderate voters being divided between the major parties, or registered independent, so that both major primaries are hostile to moderate or independent candidates;
* Politically motivated gerrymandering of election districts by those in power, to reduce or eliminate political competition (two-party proponents would argue that the minority party in that district should just nominate a more centrist candidate relative to that district);
* [[First Past the Post electoral system|Plurality voting]] scaring voters from credibly considering more than two major parties, as opponents of one would have to unite behind the other to have the most effective chance of winning (see [[Duverger's law]]);
* The extended history and reputations of the two established parties, with both existing for over 150 years and being entrenched in the minds of the public;
* The absence of [[proportional representation]];
* The 15% poll requirement by the non-government entity [[Commission on Presidential Debates]];
* The public view that third parties have no chance of beating the worse of evils, and are therefore a wasted vote;
* Campaign costs of convincing interested voters that the party nominee has a chance of winning, and regaining that trust after an election where the third party got the third-most votes or, worse, [[vote splitting|split the vote]] between two similar candidates so that the most disliked candidate won (i.e. "[[spoiler effect|spoiling]]" the election; this is less of a problem with [[condorcet voting]] and [[range voting]]).

==Justification of strict ballot access laws by two party supporters==
Strict ballot access laws are not required for a two–party system, as can be seen by the experience of the United Kingdom. However, the following arguments are put forth about the need for strict ballot access laws in the United States:
* With [[plurality voting]], allowing third candidates on the ballot could split the vote of a majority and throw the race to a candidate not favored by the majority. Allowing only two candidates on the ballot ensures that at least the worst one is never elected.
* If a third party could get enough votes to win an election, then voters who would support the nominee could infiltrate one of the two parties by registering as members, and force a win in that party's primary. However, pulling this off would take considerable coordination on the part of the supporting voters, especially if half of them preferred to infiltrate the other major party or remain independent. It would also depend on the rules of the major party for how people may become candidates in their primary, and on which registered members may vote in the primary.
* There is a ''one person one vote mandate''. If voters could vote in a primary for one candidate, and then sign a petition for another candidate, this would violate that mandate. Some voters might sign a petition for the candidate they want, and then vote in the primary for the candidate who would be easier to beat. Since primary votes are anonymous, and a party therefore cannot remove that voter's vote after it is cast, the only remedy is to strike the voter's signature on the petition. As for signatures not counting if a voter later votes in a primary, that could be reformed since the political party would know in advance about the signatures if they are filed in time.
* ''Sore loser laws'', where a candidate who loses in a primary may not then run as an independent candidate in that same election, stem from contract laws. Similar–minded candidates run in the same primary with the contract that the losers will drop out of the race and support the winner so that they do not split the votes of similar–minded voters and cause the other party's nominee to win with 40% of the vote. The need for primaries is primarily because of [[plurality voting]], whose rules state that the candidate receiving the most votes wins, even if not a majority.
* Strict ballot access laws make it difficult for extremists to get on the ballot, since few people would want to sign their petition.

== Legislation history ==
On 3 August 2011, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, [[Avi Dichter]], together with 39 other Knesset members, filed the Basic Law proposal: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People which seeks to determine the nature of the state of Israel as the Jewish people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill would secure country’s status as Jewish state |url=https://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Bill-would-secure-countrys-status-as-Jewish-state |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such it interprets the term "Jewish and democratic state" which appears in the Israeli basic laws [[Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation|Freedom of Occupation]] and [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty|Human Dignity and Liberty]].

On 12 July 2017, The House Committee of the Knesset approved the makeup of a special Joint committee, headed by MK [[Amir Ohana]] (from [[Likud]] party) to discuss and shape the Nation-State Bill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13520|title=Press Releases from the Knesset|website=knesset.gov.il|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After 10 in-depth discussions regarding its articles, the committee approved the law for first reading on 13 March 2018. Chairman Ohana stated: "This is the law of all laws. It is the most important law in the history of the State of Israel, which says that everyone has human rights, but national rights in Israel belong only to the Jewish people. That is the founding principle on which the state was established". Minister [[Yariv Levin]], a strong backer of the proposal, called it “Zionism’s flagship bill... It will bring order, clarify what is taken for granted and put Israel back on the right path. A country that is different from all others in one way, that it is the nation-state of the Jewish people"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Gutted-Jewish-nation-state-bill-heads-to-first-reading-in-Knesset-544957|title=Gutted Jewish nation-state bill heads to first reading in Knesset|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On 1 May 2018, the Knesset passed the Nation-State Bill with a majority of 64 voting in favor of the bill and 50 against in its first reading&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Nation-state-bill-passed-in-first-reading-553191|title=Nation-state bill passes in first reading|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Additional changes have been made during the committee's work, mostly regarding articles such as the "Hebrew Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-likud-mk-warns-nation-state-law-could-harm-lgbt-rights-1.5630414|title=Likud Lawmaker Warns Israel's Nation-state Law Could Harm LGBT Rights|last=Lis|first=Jonathan|date=2018|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Ingathering of the Exiles" and "Jewish Settlement"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-compromise-reached-on-jews-only-communities-clause-1.6271813|title=New Version of Nation-state Bill: Israel Will Encourage Establishment of Jewish-only Communities|last=Lis|first=Jonathan|date=2018-07-15|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5310391,00.html|title=Shouting at Knesset committee over nationality bill|date=2018-07-15|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On 19 July 2018, after a stormy debate which lasted for hours, the Knesset approved the Nation-State Bill in second and third readings by a vote of 62 in favor, 55 against and two abstentions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-passes-controversial-nation-state-bill-1.6291048|title=Israel Passes Controversial Jewish Nation-state Bill After Stormy Debate|last=Lis|first=Jonathan|date=2018-07-19|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-10-23|last2=Landau|first2=Noa|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following the vote, members of the Joint List tore up a printed text of the law while calling out “Apartheid”. MKs from the coalition, on the other hand, applauded the passing of the legislation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13979|title=Press Releases from the Knesset|website=knesset.gov.il|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] described the passage of the new law as “a pivotal moment in the annals of Zionism and the State of Israel. We enshrined in law the basic principle of our existence. Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, that respects the individual rights of all its citizens,” he said following the vote. “This is our state — the Jewish state. In recent years there have been some who have attempted to put this in doubt, to undercut the core of our being. Today we made it law: This is our nation, language and flag.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13979|title=Press Releases from the Knesset|website=knesset.gov.il|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MK Dichter, which sponsored the law said: "121 years ago the visionary of the state presented in Basel the proposal which is being raised today in the Knesset – a national home, the Jewish nation state. Two words that the visionary of the state could not say at the time were ‘Basic Law’, because there was no state back then... Ever since I began promoting the law, I was told that it was obvious, but the remarks of the Joint List could not be missed: ‘We will win – we were here before you, and we will be here after you.’ This law is the clearest answer to those who think this way. No minority will be able to change the state’s symbols. This Basic Law does not harm the Arabic language or any minority – that’s fake news. Israel is not a bilingual country; it never was. Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people and guarantees the majority without hurting the minority.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13979|title=Press Releases from the Knesset|website=knesset.gov.il|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister of Tourism Yariv Levin said: “This is a historic and defining moment in Israel’s history – a historic and significant law. I do not have any complaints to the Joint List, but I cannot accept the terrible [spiritual weakening] of parties which believe in the Zionist ethos. There are some parties which have historic rights in the establishment of the state yet do not support this law. The Zionist Union sits under the flag of the movement of the country’s founders, headed by [deceased] Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Members of the Labor Party, tell us here, honestly: “Do you disagree with the realization of the Jewish people’s right to the Land of Israel? Is it not our nation state? Is our flag unacceptable to you? The Labor movement has never turned its back in such a way to the basic values of the Zionist movement. This is a law which strengthens the Jewish identity of the state – the Aliyah and all the values thanks to which the State of Israel was established magnificently.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13979|title=Press Releases from the Knesset|website=knesset.gov.il|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MK Amir Ohana, chairman of the joint committee that legislated the bill said: “This moment will be remembered in the history of the Jewish nation. We are laying down one of the cornerstones of our existence… After 2,000 years of exile, we have a home.” Addressing members of the Arab factions, MK Ohana said, “Every minority prefers to be the majority, but you are asking to become the 22nd Arab state. We are one country that is surrounded by 21 nation states of the Arab people, which have the same language, the same nationality, the same religion and the same culture – and we have just one small country. Those who believe this law is racist are like those who think Zionism is racism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13979|title=Press Releases from the Knesset|website=knesset.gov.il|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the proposal, Israel would be defined as the [[nation state]] of the [[Jewish people]], and the right to [[self-determination]] in Israel would be unique to the Jewish people. The proposal also stated that the state of Israel should establish ethnic communities where every resident can preserve their culture and heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawmakers Seek to Drop Arabic as One of Israel's Official Languages |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5040010 |work=Haaretz |date=4 August 2011 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Hebrew language]] would be considered the official language of the state of Israel (while granting [[Arabic language|the Arabic language]] a special status), that the [[Hebrew calendar]] would become the official calendar of the state of Israel, and that the [[Mishpat Ivri|Hebrew law]] would serve as an inspiration to Israeli legislators.

Subsequent versions of the bill were written and submitted by MKs [[Ayelet Shaked]], [[Yariv Levin]], and [[Robert Ilatov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.il/StateIdentity/ProprsedBasicLaws/Pages/NationalState.aspx Basic Law: Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people] Ministry of Justice, www.justice.gov.il&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of the Basic Law ==
The Basic Law comprises eleven clauses, as follows: 

'''1 — Basic Principles'''

A. The [[land of Israel]] is the historical homeland of the [[Jewish people]], in which the [[State of Israel]] was established.

B. The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious and historical right to self-determination.

C. The right to exercise [[national self-determination]] in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.

'''2 — Symbols of the State'''

A. The [[Israel#Etymology|name of the state]] is “Israel.”

== Controversy ==
&lt;!-- This section discussing the internal debate on the law proposal between 2011–2018, for the the debate after the law was passed see the "Reaction" section below --&gt;
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}
Controversy has surrounded the law since it was first proposed in 2011. A [[Haaretz]] editorial asserted that the measure would cause severe harm to Israel's democracy and the rights of its  minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Repair Is Needed |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5204747 |work=Haaretz |date=30 October 2011 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of prominent Israeli political and academic figures, especially from the left of the political spectrum, such as Professor [[Amnon Rubinstein]], were also critical.

The proposal has been criticized even by people affiliated with the Israeli Right, such as the Minister and Likud Party MK [[Benny Begin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=חוק מדינת הלאום של העם היהודי - הצעה ומסוכנת |url=http://www.iba.org.il/bet/?entity=800123&amp;type=1 |work=Reshet B |date=14 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094401/http://www.iba.org.il/bet/?entity=800123&amp;type=1 |archivedate=5 March 2014 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that the proposed law raises difficult questions concerning the definition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, and it may upset the delicate balance between the state's Jewish character and state's democratic character.

On 20 November 2011, a special discussion was held on the matter at the [[George P. Shultz|George Shultz]] Roundtable Forum which was sponsored by the [[Israeli Democracy Institute]], and was attended by Avi Dichter and various Israeli public figures and prominent academic figures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQR_5X-PcvM Basic Law proposal: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People], YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roundtable on the Basic Law: Israel – The Nation State of the Jewish People |url=https://en.idi.org.il/events/7136 |website=The Israel Democracy Institute |language=en |date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Israeli researchers Dovi Hellman and Adi Arbel from the [[Institute for Zionist Strategies]] research institution re-published a position paper from July 2009 in which they expressed their support in the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dubi Helman and Adi Arbel |title=Jewish National Home |url=http://izs.org.il/2015/12/jewish-national-home/ |website=The Institute for Zionist Strategies |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Abraham Diskin also expressed a similar opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-65930-00.html כן - ישראל מדינת הלאום של העם היהודי]. ''News1''. 13 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, ardently defended his draft of the Nation-State bill on 26 November 2014. Netanyahu declared Israel to be “The nation-state of the Jewish people and the Jewish people alone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Netanyahu adamantly defends Nation-State Law bill |url=http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/politics-and-military/politics/netanyahu-defends-nation-state-law-bill-9736 |publisher=Jerusalem Online |date=26 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://waybackmachine.org/web/20160827132546/http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/politics-and-military/politics/netanyahu-defends-nation-state-law-bill-9736 |archivedate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also clarified “I want a state of one nation: the Jewish nation-state, which includes non-Jews with equal rights.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Netanyahu Tells Knesset: I'm Determined to Pass Jewish Nation-state Bill |url=https://www.haaretz.com/pm-determined-to-pass-nation-state-bill-1.5336054 |work=Haaretz |date=26 November 2014 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the land of the Jewish people, the PM is of the opinion that Israel is thus entitled to principles that combine the nation and the state of the Jewish people and grant “equal rights for all its citizens, without discrimination against religion, race or sex.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scolding critics, PM says ‘Jewish state’ law will fix imbalance |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/answering-critics-pm-says-jewish-state-law-needed-to-correct-imbalance/ |work=The Times of Israel |date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Aviad Bakshi, who was also a member in the IZS constitution team, published an article in which he stated that in practice Arabic is not the official language in Israel nowadays, and therefore the argument that the proposal would harm the status of the Arabic language is not valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Aviad Bakshi |title=The Status of Arabic in the State of Israel |url=http://izs.org.il/2015/12/the-status-of-arabic-in-the-state-of-israel/ |website=The Institute for Zionist Strategies |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli MK Dr. Einat Wilf from the [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]] party published an article supporting the proposal which argued the advantages as a "correct and balanced" proposal because the state of Israel was established for one purpose only and that is - to be the national home of the Jewish people. This is the essence and [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]].

Senior Fellow at Kohelet Policy Forum, Professor Eugene Kontorovich, published an article on the legitimacy of Israel’s nation-state bill' in which he compares the bill proposition to that of other EU states, and declares Israel’s bill to have “nothing racist, or even unusual, about having national or religious character reflected in constitutional commitments.” Professor Kontorovich proves that “Seven EU states have constitutional ‘nationhood’ provisions, which typically speak of the state as being the national home and locus of self-determination for the country’s majority ethnic group.” To that end, he muses, “it is hard to understand why what works for them should be so widely denounced when it comes to Israel.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The legitimacy of Israel’s nation-state bill (I): comparative constitutionalism |url=https://en.kohelet.org.il/publication/the-legitimacy-of-israels-nation-state-bill-i-comparative-constitutionalism |work=Kohelet Forum |date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the criticism, Dichter stated that "the law proposal was created and designed for a year and a half, and that from the start the Jewish and democratic character of the state were balanced appropriately, and for this reason the proposal has gained the support from the entire political spectrum in Israel. 40 MKs have so far expressed their support in the bill proposal. Taking into account that 40 other MKs are ministers and deputy ministers can not express at this point their support of the bill proposal, this means that half of the Knesset members support the proposal. Moreover, after the bill proposal was submitted to the Knesset yesterday, additional lawmakers sought to express their support of the bill proposal".

In the response raised by MK [[Benjamin Ben-Eliezer]] and various other political regarding the declaration of the Hebrew language as the sole official language of the state, Dichter stated that the law enshrines the existing situation. Israel's official languages were defined by the British in 1922 - back then the official languages were [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], in that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Robert L. |title=Language Planning and Social Change |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521336413 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=-cOBzspgFNcC&amp;pg=PA100 |accessdate=24 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Court rulings deal constantly with the permanent status of the language: the Hebrew language is defined as a language with a higher status than the Arabic language, and as the state's official language. Arabic on the other hand suffers from constant blurring of its status and lack of clarity about its accessibility to the native speakers of the language. According to the bill proposal the Arabic language would receive a special status which would require the state to enable accessibility to all native speakers of the language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/9/1847549 בנימין בן אליעזר משך חתימתו מהצעת חוק "מדינת הלאום היהודי" - וואלה! חדשות]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter, [[Reuven Rivlin]], Israel’s president raised his concern saying the legislation “could harm the Jewish people worldwide and in Israel and could even be used as a weapon by our enemies”.&lt;ref name="Israel passes Jewish nation law branded 'racist' by critics"&gt;{{cite web |title=Israel passes Jewish nation law branded 'racist' by critics |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/israel-jewish-nation-state-law-passed-arabs-segregation-protests-benjamin-netanyahu-a8454196.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knesset]] member [[Avi Dichter]], the law's sponsor, stated, "We are enshrining this important bill into a law today to prevent even the slightest thought, let alone attempt, to transform Israel to a country of all its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13979|title=Knesset passes Jewish nation-state bill into law|date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Why has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/netanyahu-israel-jewish-nation-state-bill-law-palestine-election-a8454776.html |work=The Independent |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to [[Joint List|Arab legislators]] who objected to the proposed basic law, he said that "The most you can do is to live among us as a national minority that enjoys equal individual rights, but not equality as a national minority."&lt;ref name="ReutersAzulay"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel passes nationality bill into law |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5312792,00.html |work=Ynetnews |date=19 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Haaretz, Tourism Minister [[Yariv Levin]], who supervised the passage of the law, said that "Through the law, we can prevent family reunification [of Israeli citizens and Palestinians] not only out of security motives, but also motivated to maintain the character of the country as the national homeland of the Jewish people." He also insisted to reject the inclusion of equality in the legislation to avoid undermining the [[Law of Return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli Minister Explains Why He Led the Effort to Pass the Nation-state Law |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-minister-explains-why-he-fought-to-pass-nation-state-law-1.6358737 |work=Haaretz |date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
The secretary-general of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[Saeb Erekat]], described it as a “dangerous and [[racist]] law” which “officially legalizes [[apartheid]] and legally defines Israel as an apartheid system”.&lt;ref name="Israel passes Jewish nation law branded 'racist' by critics"/&gt;

[[File:Israeli Druze rally against Nation-State Law.jpg|thumb|Druze flags alongside Israeli flags during a rally against the law in Tel Aviv on 4 August 2018]]
Heads of  Israel's [[Druze]] community petitioned the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in protest against the law and 100 Druze reservists complained that though having fought in Israel's wars for generations, the bill relegated them to second-class status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Druze IDF officers protest against Nationality Law |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5316576,00.html |work=Ynetnews |date=25 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli centrists and leftists denounce the law as [[anti-democratic]] and racist in that it does not give all citizens the same right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html |website=NY Times |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition MPs likened the contentious law to apartheid. Mass protests have been held in [[Tel Aviv]] following the law, which critics labelled as racist towards the country’s Arabs. In particular, many Arabs were angered by the law's downgrading of Arabic from an official language to one with an ambiguous "special status".&lt;ref name="Israel passes Jewish nation law branded 'racist' by critics"/&gt;

[[Benny Begin]], son of the co-founder of the ruling party Likud [[Menachem Begin]], expressed his concern about the direction of his party; in his opinion, it is moving a little further away from human rights.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Knesset: Israel verabschiedet Gesetz zu "jüdischem Nationalstaat" |url=https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2018-07/knesset-israel-benjamin-netanjahu-hebraeisch-gesetz-siedlungen |work=ZEIT ONLINE |date=19 July 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel]] said that the law "contains key elements of apartheid", which is not only immoral, but absolutely prohibited under international law".&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"/&gt; Adalah Director Hassan Jabareen said that the law would make Israel an exclusively Jewish country, which "made discrimination a constitutional value and made its attachment to favouring Jewish supremacy the reason for its institutions".&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"/&gt;

[[Shimon Stein]] and [[Moshe Zimmermann]] commented that the new law calls into question the equality of Arabs living in Israel concerning the loss of Arabic's status as an official language, adding that only the country's Jewish settlements and [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] are considered fundamental values. They noted that the first clause, which states "The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established," opens up a loophole for [[annexation]] of the [[West Bank]] and a goodbye to the [[two-state solution]] and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Die israelische Demokratie wird verdrängt |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/israel-die-israelische-demokratie-wird-verdraengt/22831220.html |work=Der Tagesspiegel Online |date=22 July 2018 |language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayman Odeh]], head of the [[Joint List]] party, condemned the law, seeing it as "the death of democracy".&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"/&gt;

Backlash abroad has shown disapproval of the law by Jewish groups with the [[American Jewish Committee]] stating the law “put at risk the commitment of Israel’s founders to build a country that is both Jewish and democratic”.&lt;ref name="Israel passes Jewish nation law branded 'racist' by critics"/&gt; Additionally, [[Jonathan Greenblatt]], CEO of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), said, “While there are provisions that we agree with — notably with regard to state symbols like the anthem, flag and capital Jerusalem; as well as in reaffirming that the State of Israel is open to Jewish immigration — we are troubled by the fact that the law, which celebrates the fundamental Jewish nature of the state, raises significant questions about the government’s long-term commitment to its pluralistic identity and democratic nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israeli Knesset’s Approval of ‘Nation-State’ Law Draws Mixed Reactions From Jewish Groups Around World |url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2018/07/19/israeli-knessets-approval-of-nation-state-law-draws-mixed-reactions-from-jewish-groups-around-world/ |website=Algemeiner.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] expressed concern over the passing of the law, which, according to ''[[Reuters]]'', declares that only Jews have the right of national self-determination in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EU expresses concern over Israel's Jewish nation-state law |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-law-eu/eu-expresses-concern-over-israels-jewish-nation-state-law-idUSKBN1K91K7 |work=Reuters |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu responded that the civil rights of every Israeli citizen is guaranteed in a series of Knesset laws, including [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty]], but the national rights of the Jewish people in Israel had not been enshrined by law until now. He also noted that "For dozens of years the opposition has preached to us that we need to withdraw to the 1967 lines to ensure that Israel will be the national home of the Jewish people where there will be a Jewish majority in the country. So now suddenly, when we legislate a law that does just that, they scream on the left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PM Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting |url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2018/Pages/PM-Netanyahu-s-remarks-at-the-start-of-the-weekly-Cabinet-meeting-29-July-2018.aspx |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=29 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding complaints by Druze citizens, Netanyahu said "In contrast to the outrageous comments from the left attacking the Jewish state, I was touched by the sentiments of our brothers and sisters in the Druze community," while assuring them that "there is nothing in this law that violates your rights as equal citizens of the State of Israel." Netanyahu added that he will continue meeting with Druze leaders to find solutions to their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Netanyahu: Left Criticism of Nation-state Law 'absurd' |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-Left-criticism-of-Nation-State-Law-absurd-Druze-concerns-563683 |work=Jerusalem Post |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial meetings with Druze leaders fell apart, however, when Netanyahu walked out, after one Druze leader refused Netanyahu's demand that he take back his use of the term "apartheid" to refer to the law on social media.

A [[Opinion poll|poll]] conducted by Panel Politics found that 58% of Israeli Jews support the law, 34% are against and 8% have no opinion (among 532 responses).

Prior to this case standing for public-interest litigants was governed by the "[[Minister of Justice v. Borowski|''Borowski'']] test," which was given broad application. During the hearings for ''Thorson'' and ''Borowski'' Justice Martland and Chief Justice Laskin were fiercely at odds over the issue on interpreting the standard. Laskin felt that the ''Borowski'' test allowed in people who merely wanted to challenge law for political reasons and not because they were truly affected, while Martland felt the test followed the original principles in ''[[Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite web |url=http://www.kramer.me.uk/adam/documents/AMK-%20Standing%20under%20the%20Canadian%20Charter.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317121123/http://www.kramer.me.uk/adam/documents/AMK-%20Standing%20under%20the%20Canadian%20Charter.doc |archivedate=2007-03-17 |df= }} and [http://www.yorku.ca/journal2/archive/articles/33_1_ross.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Churches]] is an incorporated interest group that represents the interests of a number of churches. The group's focus had been the current government policy on refugee protection and resettlement. In particular, they had been critical of the changes in the determination process of evaluating whether a refugee came within the definition of [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Convention Refugee]] as part of recent amendments to the [[Immigration Act, 1976]].

The Council sought a judicial declaration that the amendments were unconstitutional, and therefore of no force or effect. The Attorney General of Canada moved to strike out the claim on the basis that the Council did not have standing to bring the action. At first instance, it was held that the Council had standing, but this was overturned on appeal. The issue before the Supreme Court of Canada was whether the Council has standing to challenge the validity of the amendments. The Court found that the Council did not have standing, and dismissed the appeal.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court acknowledged the need for public-interest standing in principle, to ensure that government is not immunized from constitutional challenges to legislation. However, the Court also stressed the need to strike a balance between ensuring access to the courts and preserving judicial resources, citing the concern of an "unnecessary proliferation of marginal or redundant suits brought by well-meaning organizations pursuing their own particular cases certain in the knowledge that their cause is all important."

The current test for standing, as summarized in this decision, considers three factors:
# is there a serious issue raised as to the invalidity of legislation in question? 
# has it been established that the plaintiff is directly affected by the legislation or, if not, does the plaintiff have a genuine interest in its validity? 
# is there another reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the Court?

On the facts of the case the Court found that the claim did raise some serious questions. Moreover, the claimant had a "genuine interest" in its validity. However, the claim must fail on the third and most onerous factor. Since a refugee would have standing to challenge the law, there would clearly be a reasonable and effective way to bring the issue to the Court. The Court dismissed the argument that refugees did not have effective access to the courts to bring a claim. Evidence showed that many are capable of making claims, which, in all, were better ways to challenge a law as there are concrete facts behind it. The Court further dismissed the claim that the potential imposition of a removal order would bar them from challenging it, as the Federal Court could grant an injunction to prevent deportation.

[[Image:Chlorodyne advert.png|thumb|1891 advertisement for J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne]]
[[Image:Chlorodyne advert2.png|thumb|1891 advertisement for a rival brand of Chlorodyne]]

'''Chlorodyne''' was one of the best known [[patent medicine]]s sold in the British Isles. It was invented in the 19th century by a Dr. [[John Collis Browne]], a doctor in the [[British Indian Army]]; its original purpose was in the treatment of cholera. Browne sold his formula to the pharmacist [[John Thistlewood Davenport]], who advertised it widely, as a treatment for [[cholera]], [[diarrhea]], [[insomnia]], [[neuralgia]], [[migraine]]s, etc. As its principal ingredients were a mixture of [[laudanum]] (an alcoholic solution of opium), tincture of [[cannabis]], and [[chloroform]], it readily lived up to its claims of relieving pain, as a sedative, and for the treatment of diarrhea.

==Imitations==
Chlorodyne  sold extremely well for many years; as its active ingredients were well known, local chemists' shops would also make up cheaper generic versions for sale to their customers. Here is an example of such a generic formulation, from ''Materia Medica'' by William Hale-White &amp; A.H. Douthwaite, 21st edition (1932):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"'''Tinctura Chloroformi et Morphinæ Composita''' intended to be an imitation of the proprietary medicine called chlorodyne.  Mix chloroform 75, tincture of [[capsicum]] 25, tincture of Indian hemp 100, [[Essential oil|oil]] of [[peppermint]] 2 and glycerin 250 with alcohol (20 per cent) 450. Dissolve morphine hydrochloride 10 in the mixture. Add to it diluted [[hydrogen cyanide|hydrocyanic acid]] 50 and enough alcohol (90 per cent) to make 1000.  Strength. 1 millilitre contains chloroform 7.5 centimils; morphine hydrochloride 1 centigram; acidum hydrocyanicum dilutum 5 centimils.

Dose 5 to 15 minims - 0.2 to 1ml
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the generics, a number of rival sellers marketed their own branded versions of the formula, brands such as "Freeman's", "Teasdale's", and "Towle's".  It can be seen from the illustrations that the authenticity of these rival brands was hotly contested.

==Decline==
Though the drug was effective in many ways, its high [[opiate]] content also made it very addictive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1633222 | pmid=4816855 | volume=1 | issue=5905 | title=Chlorodyne dependence |date=March 1974 | journal=Br Med J | pages=427–9 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5905.427}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deaths from overdoses, either accidental or deliberate, became a frequent occurrence. A common feature of the coroner's report in such cases would be the description of the deceased's body being found in a flat or [[bedsit]] littered with empty Chlorodyne bottles. Over the decades of the twentieth century, the cannabis was removed from the formulation, and the amount of opiates in the medicine were progressively reduced.  The name of Collis Browne lives on in Britain in a mixture sold under the trade name "J Collis Browne's Mixture" for the relief of coughs and diarrhea.  This modern formulation contains morphine and peppermint oil.

'''''Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace''''' is a 1999 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]] on the structure and nature of regulation of the Internet.

==Summary==
[[File:Pathetic dot theory.png|thumb|right|The pathetic dot theory]]
The primary idea of the book, as expressed in the title, is the notion that [[computer code]] (or "West Coast Code", referring to [[Silicon Valley]]) regulates conduct in much the same way that [[legal code]] (or "East Coast Code", referring to [[Washington, D.C.]]) does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Commerce; Settlement talks in the Microsoft case hinge on a question: Are the laws of government or software supreme?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/business/technology-digital-commerce-settlement-talks-microsoft-case-hinge-question-are.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Lessig argues that there are actually four major regulators (Law, Norms, Market, Architecture) each of which has a profound impact on society and whose implications must be considered (sometimes called the "[[pathetic dot theory]]", after the "dot" that is constrained by these regulators.)

The book includes a discussion of the implications for [[copyright law]], arguing that [[cyberspace]] changes not only the technology of copying but also the power of law to protect against illegal copying. It goes so far as to argue that code displaces the balance in copyright law and doctrines such as fair use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Charles C.|title=The Unacknowledged Legislators of the Digital World|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/digicult/dc991215.htm|publisher=The Atlantic|work=Digital Culture|accessdate=December 15, 2011|authorlink=Charles C. Mann|date=December 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it becomes possible to license every aspect of use (by means of trusted systems created by code), no aspect of use would have the protection of [[fair use]]. The importance of this side of the story is generally underestimated and, as the examples in the book show, very often, code is even (only) considered as an extra ''tool'' to fight against "unlimited copying."

==Other books==
''[[The Future of Ideas]]'' is a continuation of ''Code's'' analysis of copyright, where Lessig argues that too much long term copyright protection hampers the creation of new ideas based on existing works, and advocates the importance of existing works entering the [[public domain]] quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jesdanun|first=Anick|title=Net legal scholar warns of threats|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4JJdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mVwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6572,899851&amp;dq=code-and-other-laws-of-cyberspace+lessig&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald|date=January 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revision ==
In March 2005, Lessig launched the [http://codev2.cc/ Code V.2 Wiki] to update the book with current information, which he then adapted into a second edition of the book, ''[[Code: Version 2.0]]'', in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Code v2 Launches Today - Creative Commons|url = https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7149|website = Creative Commons|accessdate = 2015-07-16|date = 2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
The book has been widely cited, helping Lessig repeatedly achieve top places on lists of most-cited law school faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ten most cited law faculty in the U.S. 2009 through 2013|url = http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2014/06/ten-most-cited-law-faculty-in-the-us-from-2009-through-2013.html|website = Brian Leiter's Law School Reports|accessdate = 2015-07-16|date = 2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Cite Stuff: Inventing a Better Law Faculty Relevance Measure|ssrn = 2140944|date = 2012-09-03|location = Rochester, NY|first = James Cleith|last = Phillips|first2 = John|last2 = Yoo}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "the most influential book to date about law and cyberspace",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond Lessig's Code for Internet Privacy: Cyberspace Filters, Privacy Control and Fair Information Practices|ssrn = 254849|date = 2001-01-15|location = Rochester, NY|first = Paul M.|last = Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; "seminal",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Standardization and Digital Enclosure: The Privatization of Standards, Knowledge, and Policy in the Age of Global Information Technology: The Privatization of Standards, Knowledge, and Policy in the Age of Global Information Technology|url = https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=09r-Kmb44kMC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2009-04-30|isbn = 9781605663357|first = Schoechle|last = Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in a critical essay on the book's 10th anniversary, author [[Declan McCullagh]] (subject of the chapter "What Declan Doesn't Get") said it was "difficult to overstate the influence" of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Larry Didn&amp;#8217;t Get|url = http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/05/04/declan-mccullagh/what-larry-didnt-get|website = Cato Unbound|accessdate = 2015-07-16|first = Declan|last = McCullagh|date = 2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">A '''collective title''' is an expression by which two or more pieces of legislation may, under the law of the [[United Kingdom]], be [[Legal citation|cited]] together.  A famous example is the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]].

==Construction of references to citation with a group of Acts that have a collective title==
Section 2(2) of the [[Short Titles Act 1896]] reads:

{{Blockquote|If it is provided that any [[Act of Parliament|Act]] passed after this Act may, as to the whole or any part thereof, be cited with any of the groups of Acts mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act, or with any group of Acts to which a collective title has been given by any Act passed before this Act, that group shall be construed as including that Act or part, and, if the collective title of the group states the first and last years of the group, the year in which that Act is passed shall be substituted for the last year of the group, and so on as often as a subsequent Act or part is added to the group.}}

This provision is derived from section 1(3) of the [[Short Titles Act 1892]].

==Effect of repeal==
Section 19(2) of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]] does not authorise the continued use of a collective title previously authorised by a [[repeal]]ed [[enactment (British legal term)|enactment]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]].

A '''common stock dividend''' is the [[dividend]] paid to [[common stock]] owners from the profits of the company.  Like other dividends, the payout is in the form of either cash or stock.  The law may regulate the size of the common stock dividend particularly when the payout is a cash distribution tantamount to a [[liquidation]].  Such cash dividends may serve the intent of defrauding [[creditor]]s.

==Cash dividend==
A cash dividend is the distribution of profits to the common stock shareholders, the owners of the corporation.  Such distributions are in equal amounts to the shareholders depending on the portion of the company they own.

==Stock dividend==
A stock dividend to common stock dividend owners distributes additional stock in the company to the common stock shareholders. Such dividends are evenly distributed to the shareholders depending on their portion of ownership in the corporation. Such distributions maintain their proportional ownership in the corporation.

In ancient British customs, '''Conservators of the Peace''' ([[Latin]]: ''Custodes pacis''), or '''Wardens of the Peace''', were individuals who had a special charge, by virtue of their office, to see that the [[Anglo-Saxon law|King's peace]] was kept.

Until the creation of the [[Justices of the Peace]] by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], there were several people, who by common law were interested in keeping the same&amp;mdash;some having that charge as incident to other offices; others simply, or of itself, called ''custodes'', or ''Conservators of the Peace''.

More recently, the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of [[Chester]] was a Conservator in the county of Cheshire; and petty constables are, by the common law, conservators in the first sense.

The Conservator of the Peace title is still used in the USA. For example, in Virginia, Special Conservators of the Peace upon a showing by the applicant of a necessity for the security of property or the peace and presentation of evidence that the person or persons to be appointed as a special conservator of the peace possess a valid registration issued by the Department of Criminal Justice Services. The order of appointment shall provide that a special conservator of the peace may perform only the duties for which he is qualified by training as established by the Criminal Justice Services Board. The order of appointment shall provide that such duties shall be exercised only within geographical limitations specified by the court, which shall be within the confines of the county, city or town that makes application or on the real property where the corporate applicant is located, or any real property contiguous to such real property. The order may provide that the special conservator of the peace shall have the authority to make an arrest outside of such geographical limitations if the arrest results from a close pursuit that was initiated when the special conservator of the peace was within the confines of the area wherein he has been authorized to have the powers and authority of a special conservator of the peace; the order shall further delineate a geographical limitation or distance beyond which the special conservator of the peace may not effectuate such an arrest that follows from a close pursuit. The order may also provide that a special conservator of the peace who has completed the minimum training standards established by the Criminal Justice Services Board, has the authority to affect arrests, using up to the same amount of force as would be allowed to a law-enforcement officer employed by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions when making a lawful arrest. No special conservator of the peace shall display or use the word "police" on any uniform, badge, credential, or vehicle in the performance of his duties as a special conservator of the peace. Other than special conservators of the peace employed by a state agency, no special conservator of the peace shall use the seal of the Commonwealth on any uniform, badge, credential, or vehicle in the performance of his duties.

'''Doctors' Commons''', also called the '''College of Civilians''', was a society of lawyers practising [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in [[London]]. Like the [[Inns of Court]] of the [[common law]]yers, the society had buildings with rooms where its members lived and worked, and a large library. Court proceedings of the civil law courts were also held in Doctors' Commons. The society also used [[St Benet's, Paul's Wharf]] as its church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=1588|title=St Benet Paul's Wharf|publisher=Britain Express|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "civil law" in England==
While the [[English Common Law]], unlike the legal systems on the European continent, developed mostly independently from [[Roman Law]], some specialised English courts applied the Roman-based civil law. This is true of the [[ecclesiastical courts]], whose practice even after the [[English Reformation]] continued to be based on the [[canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but also of the [[admiralty courts]]. The advocates practising in these courts were trained in Canon law (before the Reformation) and Roman law (after the Reformation) at the universities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]. The civilian legal profession was split like its common law counterpart. The advocates had a role similar to that of [[barrister]]s in the common law courts.

According to some accounts, the society of Doctors' Commons was formed in 1511 by [[Richard Blodwell]], [[Dean of Arches|Dean of the Arches]].  According to others, it existed already in the 15th century. The society's buildings, which were acquired in 1567, were originally situated near [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] at [[Paternoster Row]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and later nearby in [[Knightrider Street]] where it remained until the buildings were sold in 1865. (Baker (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;59, n.8)

In 1768 it was incorporated under the official name of ''College of Doctors of Law exercent in the Ecclesiastical and Admiralty Courts''. The college consisted of a president (the [[Dean of Arches]] for the time being) and of those doctors of law who, having regularly taken that degree in either of the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, and having been admitted advocates in pursuance of the rescript of the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], were elected "fellows" in the manner prescribed by the charter. There were also attached to the college thirty-four "proctors", whose duties were analogous to those of [[solicitor]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Doctors' Commons|volume=8|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disestablishment==
[[Image:Doctors Commons Plaque.jpg|thumb|This plaque is located on the [[Faraday building]] on the north side of Queen Victoria Street and marks the site of the now demolished Doctors' Commons.]] 
In the nineteenth century, the institution of Doctors' Commons and its members were looked upon as old-fashioned and slightly ridiculous. A satirical description of Doctors' Commons can be found in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'' and also in his novel ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (in which Dickens called it a "cosey, dosey, old-fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family party." (ch. 23))

As anticipation of an impending abolition grew, there was a reluctance among the society to admit new fellows as this would dilute the proceeds of any winding up of the property. Dr [[Thomas Hutchinson Tristram]] was the last to be admitted.&lt;ref name="squibb"/&gt;

The [[Court of Probate Act 1857]] abolished the [[will (law)|testamentary]] jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts and gave common lawyers the right to practise in areas which before had been the exclusive domain of civilians, while offering the token compensation that the civilians could practise in the common law courts.&lt;ref name="squibb"&gt;Squibb (1977) ''pp''104-105&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, the Act also made it lawful for the Doctors' Commons, by a vote of the majority of its fellows, to dissolve itself and surrender its [[Royal Charter]], the proceeds of dissolution to be shared among the members.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Probate Act 1857, s.117&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] created a new [[divorce]] court in which both [[barrister]]s and advocates could appear. Then the [[High Court of Admiralty Act 1859]] liberalised [[rights of audience]] in the [[Admiralty Court]], leaving only the jurisdiction of the [[Court of Arches]].&lt;ref name="squibb"/&gt;

A motion to dissolve the society was entered on 13 January 1858 and the last meeting took place on 10 July 1865. The fellows did not formally surrender their offices, nor in the end their charter, but the society perished with the death of its last fellow Dr. T.H. Tristram in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1990) ''p.''194&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of Doctors' Commons were sold in 1865 and demolished soon after. The site is now largely occupied by the [[Faraday building]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The Court of Arches itself finally admitted barristers, accepting that they could exercise all the offices of an advocate, in 1867.&lt;ref name="squibb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mouncey v. Robinson'' (1867) 37 L. J. Ecc. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In ''[[The Moonstone]]'', the [[solicitor]] of [[Gray's Inn Square]] Mathew Bruff notes, "I shall perhaps do well if I explain in this place, for the benefit of the few people who don't know it already, that the law allows all [[will and testament|wills]] to be examined at Doctor's Commons by anybody who applies, on payment of a [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]] fee."&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Wilkie|title=The Moonstone|date=1868|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780140434088|pages=274–275, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Engel v. Vitale''''', 370 U.S. 421 (1962), was a [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official [[school prayer]] and encourage its recitation in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

==Background==
The state of New York approved a piece of legislation which encouraged students to start their school days with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer with the text:
{{quote|Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country. Amen.&lt;ref name=uscourts&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v. Vitale |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|370|421|1962|name=Engel v. Vitale|pin=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The case was brought by a group of families of public school students in [[New Hyde Park, New York|New Hyde Park]] from the [[Herricks Union Free School District]] who sued the school board president William J. Vitale, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Engel-v-Vitale|title=Engel v. Vitale {{!}} law case|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1961/468|title=Engel v. Vitale|last=|first=|date=|website=Oyez|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families argued that the voluntary prayer written by the state board of regents to "Almighty God" contradicted their religious beliefs. Led by Steven I. Engel, a [[Jewish]] man,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/plaintiff-in-1962-landmark-school-prayer-case-reflects-on-his-role |title=Plaintiff in 1962 landmark school-prayer case reflects on his role |author=David L. Hudson Jr., First Amendment scholar |date=August 26, 2005 |website=www.firstamendmentcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plaintiffs sought to challenge the constitutionality of the state's prayer in school policy.  They were supported by groups opposed to the school prayer including rabbinical organizations, [[Ethical Culture]], and Jewish organizations. The acting parties were not members of one particular religion; despite being listed in the court papers as an atheist, plaintiff Lawrence Roth later denied that and described himself as religious but disagreed with prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Susan Dudley|last1=Gold|title=Engel V. Vitale: Prayer in the Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc5Ove6xYf8C&amp;pg=PA16|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|date=2006 |isbn=9780761419402|via=Google Books|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Of the five plaintiffs, three were Jews and two referred to themselves as "spiritual" people who did not belong to any one organized religion. The cited book flatly contradicts this, so commenting out for now; I'll get back to refactoring later.--&gt;

The plaintiffs argued that opening the school day with such a prayer violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] ([[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|as applied to the states]] through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]), which states, in part, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. Amend. I.&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of twenty-two states submitted an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief to the Supreme Court urging affirmance of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] decision that upheld the constitutionality of the prayer.&lt;ref&gt;The ''amicus curiae'' brief was submitted by the attorneys general of Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia. {{ussc|370|421|1962|name=Engel v. Vitale}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Jewish Committee]], the [[Synagogue Council of America]], and the [[American Ethical Union]] each submitted briefs urging the Court to instead reverse and rule that the prayer was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
In a 6–1 decision, the Supreme Court held that reciting government-written prayers in public schools was unconstitutional, violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ussc|370|421|1962|name=Engel v. Vitale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion for the Court, [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] explained the importance of separation between church and state by giving a lengthy history of the issue, beginning with the 16th century in England. He noted that prayer is a religious activity by the very nature of  being a prayer, and that prescribing such a religious activity for school children violates the [[Establishment Clause]].

The Court rejected the defendant's arguments that students were not asked to observe any specific established religion, that the traditional heritage of the nation was religious, and that the prayer was voluntary. The Court held that the mere promotion of a religion is sufficient to establish a violation, even if that promotion is not coercive. The Court further held that the fact that the prayer is vaguely-enough worded not to promote any particular religion is not a sufficient defense, as it still promotes a family of religions (those that recognize "Almighty God"), which still violates the Establishment Clause.

==Subsequent developments==
Since its decision, ''Engel'' has been the subject of intense debate. It has become considered one of the Court's "liberal" decisions alongside decisions such as its sequel, ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'',  ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' and its sequel, ''[[in re Gault]]'', ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'',  ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Miller v. California]]'' and ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith|first1= Christopher |last2= Hensley|first2= Thomas |date= Fall 1994|title= Unfulfilled Aspirations: The Court-Packing Efforts of Presidents Reagan and Bush|url= |journal= Albany Law Review|volume= 57|issue= |pages= 1111, 1130|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been criticized for its broadness in holding that a showing of coercion is not required to demonstrate an Establishment Clause violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=McConnell, Michael|last1=W.|title=Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmlr/vol27/iss5/7/|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|date= 1986 |issn=0043-5589|volume=27|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graham |first1=Kristin |title=The Supreme Court Comes Full Circle: Coercion as the Touchstone of an Establishment Clause Violation |journal=Buffalo Law Review |date=Winter 1994 |volume=42 |pages=147,158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Engel'' has been the basis for several subsequent decisions limiting government-directed prayer in school. In ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' (1985), the Supreme Court ruled Alabama's law permitting one minute for prayer or meditation was unconstitutional. In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992), the court prohibited clergy-led prayer at middle school graduation ceremonies. ''Lee v. Weisman'', in turn, was a basis for ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe|Santa Fe ISD v. Doe]]'' (2000), in which the Court extended the ban to school-organized ''student''-led prayer at high school football games.

The '''Evidence Act 2006''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] that codifies the [[evidence (law)|laws of evidence]]. When enacted, the Act drew together the common law and statutory provisions relating to evidence into one comprehensive scheme, replacing most of the previous evidence law on the [[admissible evidence|admissibility]] and use of evidence in court proceedings.&lt;ref name="bill"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL6694_1/evidence-bill |title= Evidence Bill |publisher= New Zealand Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of the Act started in August 1989, when the [[New Zealand Law Commission|Law Commission]] started work on reviewing the nation's piecemeal evidence laws. A decade of work culminated in August 1999 with the Commission producing a draft Evidence Code on which the Evidence Act is based.&lt;ref name="NZLC R55" /&gt; The Evidence Bill was introduced in May 2006 and passed its third and final reading on 23 November 2006. The majority of the Act came into force on 1 August 2007.&lt;ref name="bill" /&gt;

Section 3 provides the Act binds the Crown. Section 4 defines terms used in the Act. 

Section 5 deals with the application of the Act. If there is an inconsistency between the Act and any other enactment, the other enactment prevails. However, if there is an inconsistency between the Act and the High Court Rules or the District Court Rules, the Act prevails.

Section 6 sets out the purpose of the Act.

Section 7 of the Bill deals with the principle of [[relevance (law)|relevance]]. The general rule is that, unless otherwise provided, relevant evidence is admissible in proceedings. Evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible. Evidence is relevant if it has a tendency to prove or disprove anything that is of consequence to the determination of the proceeding.

Section 8 sets out a general rule that in any proceeding the Judge must exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the risk that the evidence will have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the outcome of the proceeding, or needlessly prolong the proceeding.

Section 9 deals with the admission of evidence by consent. It allows the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence with the consent of all parties and the admission of evidence in any way or form agreed by all parties. It also allows the prosecution and the defendant to admit any fact and so dispense with the need for proof of that fact in any criminal proceedings.

Section 10 sets out 3 special rules regarding the interpretation of the Act. The Act must be interpreted in a
way that promotes its purpose and its principles. The Act is also not subject to any rule that statutes in derogation of the common law should be strictly construed. However, the Act may be interpreted having regard to the common law, but only to the extent that the common law is consistent with its provisions, the promotion of its purpose and its principles, and the application of the rule in section 12.

Section 11 provides that the powers inherent in a court to regulate and prevent abuse of its procedure are not affected by the Bill, except to the extent provided in the Bill.

Section 12 provides that if there are no provisions in the Act or any other enactment regulating the admission of particular items of evidence, or the relevant provisions deal with that question only in part, decisions must be made having regard to the purpose and the principles set out in sections 6 to 8, and the common law, to the extent that it is consistent with the promotion of that purpose and those principles and is relevant to the decisions to be taken.

Section 13 sets out rules to be applied in establishing the relevance of any document.

Section 14 provides for the admission of evidence on a provisional basis.

Section 15 sets out rules governing the admissibility of evidence given for the purposes of establishing whether any particular evidence is admissible in the substantive proceeding.

===Admissibility rules, privilege and confidentiality===
====Hearsay evidence====
Section 16 clarifies the meaning of the terms circumstances and unavailable as a witness. These terms are relevant to the exception to the hearsay rule which is stated in section 18.

Section 17 states the rule against the admissibility of hearsay statements. The scope of the existing rule has been limited by the definition of hearsay statement in section 4, which limits hearsay statements to statements made by non-witnesses. Thus, under the Bill, it is not hearsay for a witness to recount in evidence what another witness said. Nor is it hearsay if a witness recounts his or her own out-of-court statements (but such evidence may be inadmissible on other grounds, for example under the previous consistent statements rule stated in section 35). Under section 17 a hearsay statement is not admissible except as provided by section 18 or by a provision in another Act, or if a provision of the Act makes the rule against hearsay inapplicable and the statement is relevant and otherwise admissible.

Section 18 provides that a hearsay statement is admissible if, first, there is a reasonable assurance that it is reliable because of the circumstances that relate to it, and, secondly, if the maker of the statement is unavailable as a witness. The second condition may be waived if the Judge considers that undue expense and delay would be caused by requiring the maker of the statement to testify.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt; This section codifies the common law exception created in the 1989 case ''[[R v Baker]]''.

Section 19 allow a hearsay statement contained in a business record to be admitted without having to separately satisfy the reliability test.&lt;ref name="Select Committee"&gt;{{cite web |title= Justice and Electoral Committee report on the Evidence Bill |url= https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/48DBSCH_SCR3568_1/e6316f259e834df41952d17a31fc4da47a983d05 |date= 24 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 22 provides no hearsay statement may be offered in a criminal proceeding unless the other parties have been given notice of the proposed hearsay statement or if every other party has waived the notice requirements or if the Judge dispenses with those requirements. The section also sets out the notice requirements for hearsay statements proposed to be offered in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Statements of opinion and expert evidence====
Section 23 states the opinion rule, which is that statements of opinion are inadmissible except as provided by section 24 or 25.

Section 24 enables any witness (whether an expert or not) to state an opinion in evidence if that is necessary for the evidence to be communicated or understood. For example, the speed at which a vehicle was observed to be travelling may be stated in evidence, even though that statement contains an opinion component.

Section 25 makes opinions expressed by experts as part of expert evidence admissible if the Judge or jury is likely to obtain substantial help from them. It also clarifies that certain common law rules against the admission of expert evidence cease to apply. These are the rules that bar an expert from giving evidence on the ultimate issue to be decided by the Judge or jury, and from giving evidence on matters of common knowledge. The section also provides that, where experts base their opinions on facts outside their expertise, the opinions may be relied on only if the facts are proved or judicially noticed.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Defendants’ statements, improperly obtained evidence, silence of parties in proceedings, and admissions in civil proceedings====
Section 27 relates to criminal proceedings. The prosecution may offer evidence of statements made by the defendant if those statements are not excluded by the Judge because there is a question as to their reliability (section 28) or because there is a question as to whether they were influenced by oppressive conduct (section 29), or because they were improperly obtained (section 30).

Section 28 deals with the case where the defence raises, on the basis of an evidential foundation, an issue about the reliability of a defendant's statement that the prosecution offers or intends to offer in the proceeding, or where the issue is raised by the Judge. In such a case, the Judge must exclude the statement unless satisfied that the circumstances in which the statement was made were not likely to have adversely affected its reliability. The standard to which the Judge must be satisfied is the balance of probabilities. Subsection (4) sets out a list of matters that a Judge must (if relevant) take into account for the purpose of applying the reliability test. The list does not preclude a Judge from taking other matters into account. The matters in the list, which must be taken into account, include any physical, mental, or psychological condition of the defendant at the time the statement was made, any pertinent characteristics of the defendant (for example, intellectual disability), the nature of any questions put to the defendant, and the nature of any threat, promise, or representation made to the defendant or any other person.

Section 29 deals with the case where the defence raises, on the basis of an evidential foundation, the issue of whether a defendant's statement that the prosecution offers or intends to offer was obtained by oppressive, violent, inhuman, or degrading conduct or treatment or a threat of such conduct or treatment, or where the Judge raises the issue. In such a case, the Judge must exclude the statement unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was not influenced by such conduct, treatment, or threats. For the purpose of determining whether the statement must be excluded, it is irrelevant whether or not the statement is true. Subsection (4) sets out a list of matters that a Judge must (if relevant) take into account for the purpose of applying the reliability test. The list is the same as that set out in section 28(4).

Section 30 deals with the case where the defence raises, on the basis of an evidential foundation, the issue of whether evidence that the prosecution offers or intends to offer was improperly obtained, or where the Judge raises the issue. The section applies not only to statements, but also to documents and things that may have been improperly obtained. Improperly obtained means obtained as a result of a breach of any enactment or rule of law by a person bound by the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]; obtained as a result of a statement that the prosecution is precluded from offering against the
defendant: or obtained unfairly. If the Judge finds that the evidence has been improperly obtained, the Judge may determine if the exclusion of the evidence is proportionate to the impropriety by means of a balancing process that gives appropriate weight to the impropriety but also takes proper account of the need for an effective and credible system of justice. In undertaking that balancing exercise, the Judge may, among other matters, have regard to the importance of any right breached by the impropriety, the nature of the impropriety, in particular, whether it was deliberate or reckless or done in bad faith, and the seriousness of the offence with which the defendant is charged.

Section 31 prevents the prosecution from relying on a defendant's statement that another party puts in evidence if the prosecution is precluded from using the statement because of sections 28, 29 or 30.

Section 32 prohibits any invitation to the Judge or jury in a criminal trial to [[adverse inference|draw an inference that the defendant is guilty]] from the defendant's silence in the course of official questioning before the trial or from the defendant's failure to disclose a defence before trial. The Judge must direct the jury not to draw an inference of guilt from failures of that kind.

Section 33 bars all persons other than the Judge or the defence from commenting on the fact that the defendant did not give evidence at his or her trial. 

Section 34 provides for the admissibility of admissions in civil proceedings. However, hearsay admissions may not be used against a third party unless the circumstances relating to the making of the admission provide reasonable assurance that the admission is reliable or the third party consents.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Previous consistent statements made by witness====
Section 35 makes a statement that a witness previously made out of court inadmissible if the statement confirms the evidence the witness gives in court. This rule is subject to 2 exceptions. First, a statement of that kind is admissible to rebut a challenge to the witness's veracity or accuracy. Secondly, a statement of that kind is admissible if the witness is unable to recall the matter to which the evidence relates or whose recall of the matter is imperfect if the circumstances relating to the statement provide a reasonable assurance that it is reliable.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Veracity and propensity====
Section 36 concerns the application of this subpart. The section clarifies that the restrictions on giving evidence about a person's veracity do not apply if the alleged lack of veracity on the part of a defendant is an ingredient of the prosecution (as in a prosecution for perjury) or civil action (as in an action for malicious falsehood).

Section 37 precludes evidence about a person's veracity from being given in criminal or civil proceedings unless the Judge decides that the evidence is substantially helpful. The section sets out several factors that the Judge may, among others, consider in making that assessment. These include, for example, whether the proposed evidence tends to show a lack of veracity because of relevant offending or previous inconsistent statements or because of the person's reputation as an untruthful person. The section also prevents a party from challenging the veracity of the party's own witness unless the witness is declared hostile by the Judge.

Section 38 relates to criminal proceedings. Subject to the test of substantial helpfulness set out in section 37, the defendant may offer evidence about his or her veracity. If the defendant does so, the Judge may permit the prosecution to offer veracity evidence about that defendant. 

Section 39 relates to criminal proceedings against multiple defendants. A defendant may give evidence about his or her co-defendant's veracity only if that evidence is relevant to a defence to be raised by the defendant and if prior notice of the proposed evidence has been given to all co-defendants. The notice requirement may be waived by the Judge or the co-defendants.

Section 40 sets out the general rule that propensity evidence (that is evidence that a person tends to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind) may be given in a civil or criminal proceeding. That rule is subject to the exceptions set out in sections 41 to 44.

Section 41 relates to criminal proceedings. A defendant may offer propensity evidence about himself or herself. If the defendant does so, the Judge may permit the prosecution to offer propensity evidence about that defendant and, in that case, the prosecution is not subject to the restrictions imposed by section 43 on propensity evidence led by the prosecution.

Section 42 relates to criminal proceedings against multiple defendants. A defendant may give propensity evidence about a co-defendant only if that evidence is relevant to a defence to be raised by the defendant and if prior notice of the proposed evidence has been given to all co-defendants. The notice requirement may be waived by the co-defendants or by the Judge.

Section 43 sets out the restrictions that apply to propensity evidence offered by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding. Such evidence is admissible only if it has a probative value which outweighs any unfairly prejudicial effect on the defendant. The section specifies several matters that the Judge may consider among others. The specified matters include the frequency of the alleged conduct, the timing of the conduct, the similarity between the conduct and the offence charged, the number of persons making allegations against the defendant and the risk of collusion or suggestibility, and the extent to which the conduct and the offence charged are unusual. When assessing the prejudicial effect of propensity evidence on the defendant, the Judge must consider, among many other matters, whether the evidence is likely to unfairly predispose the jury against the defendant, and whether the jury will tend to give disproportionate weight in reaching its verdict to evidence about the defendant's previous conduct.

Section 44 [[Rape shield law|protects complainants in prosecutions for sexual offences]] from certain questions and evidence about their sexual experience and reputation. The starting point is to exclude evidence or questions that relate to the complainant's reputation in sexual matters or to the complainant's sexual experience with a person other than the defendant. However, the Judge may permit any evidence or a question about that experience if satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it because of its direct relevance to the facts in issue or to the question of the appropriate sentence.

Section 44A provides no evidence of a complainant's sexual experience may be offered in a criminal proceeding unless the other parties have been given notice of the proposed statement or if every other party has waived the notice requirements or if the Judge dispenses with those requirements. The section also sets out the notice requirements for evidence proposed to be offered in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Identification evidence====
Section 45 relates to criminal proceedings in which evidence about previous visual identifications of an alleged offender obtained by officers of an enforcement agency is proposed to be given. Such evidence is admissible if a formal procedure was followed or there was good reason for not following it unless the defendant proves on the balance of probabilities that the evidence is unreliable. If, without good reason, a formal procedure was not followed, the evidence
is inadmissible unless the prosecution proves on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances of the identification were likely to have produced a reliable identification.

Section 46 relates to criminal proceedings in which voice identification evidence is proposed to be offered by the prosecution. Such evidence is inadmissible unless the prosecution proves on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances of the identification were likely to have produced a reliable identification.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Evidence of convictions and civil judgments====

Section 47 provides that in a civil proceeding proof of a person's conviction for an offence is conclusive proof that the person committed the offence unless, in exceptional circumstances, the Judge permits a party to offer contrary evidence.

Section 48 provides that if a proceeding for defamation is based on a statement that a person has committed an offence, proof of the person's conviction for the offence provides conclusive proof that the person committed the offence.

Section 49 makes evidence of a person's conviction generally admissible in criminal proceedings and proof of the person's conviction for an offence is conclusive proof that the person committed the offence unless, in exceptional circumstances, the Judge permits a party to offer contrary evidence. A party who wishes to offer evidence of a person's conviction must first tell the Judge why the evidence is to be offered.

Section 50 provides that a judgment in a civil proceeding is not admissible in another proceeding to prove the existence of a fact established by that judgment.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Privilege and confidentiality====
Section 51 defines the term legal adviser for the purposes of this subpart. The term includes a registered patent attorney, but the services of a registered patent attorney that give rise to legal professional privilege are restricted by section 54(2). It is also made clear that, for the purposes of the subpart, a reference to a communication or to information includes a reference to a communication or information contained in a document. Subsection (3) sets out a special meaning of the term information for the purposes of section 60 to 63. The effect of the definition is to exclude from those clauses (which relate to the privilege against self-incrimination, the discretion as to incrimination under foreign law, and the replacement of the privilege against self-incrimination in the case of Anton Piller orders) documents created before the person concerned is required to provide information. The section also provides that privileged communications may be made and received by authorised representatives. However, this does not apply to the privilege for communications with ministers of religion, the privilege for information obtained by medical practitioners and clinical psychologists, or the privilege for informers.

Section 52 provides procedural mechanisms for the protection of privileged information.

Section 53 describes the effects of various privileges. If the privilege is in respect of a communication (such as the privilege for communications with legal advisers) the privilege holder has the right to refuse to disclose the communication in a proceeding as well as any information contained in the communication and any opinion formed by a person that is based on the communication or information.
If the privilege is in respect of information or a document, the privilege holder has the right to refuse to disclose in a proceeding the information or document and any opinion formed by a person that is based on the information or document. In the case of a privilege in respect of a communication, information, opinion, or document (other than the privilege against self-incrimination) the privilege holder may require that the communication, information, opinion, or document not be disclosed in a proceeding by the recipient of the communication or the information, or by the person who gave the opinion or prepared the information or document or by any other person who has received the privileged material with the authority of the privilege holder, in confidence and in relation to the circumstances that have given rise to the privilege. But the class of person barred from disclosing privileged material may be extended by the Court.

Section 54 provides a privilege for clients of legal advisers in confidential communications made for the purpose of obtaining or providing professional legal services. By virtue of section 54, the right not to have such communications disclosed is limited to proceedings. The corresponding legal professional privilege recognised by the common law also protects such communications from disclosure in other situations.

Section 55 excludes accounting records relating to solicitors' trust accounts or nominee companies from the ambit of the privilege conferred by section 54.

Section 56 gives a person who is, or on reasonable grounds contemplates becoming, a party to a proceeding, a privilege in respect of communications or information made, received, compiled, or prepared for the dominant purpose of preparing for the proceeding. The privilege may be displaced in the case of a proceeding under Part 2 of the [[Oranga Tamariki Act 1989]] or under the Care of Children Act 2004 (other than a criminal proceeding), if a Judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child.

Section 57 provides a privilege for parties to a civil dispute in respect of communications and documents made or prepared in confidence and in connection with an attempt to settle the dispute.

Section 58 provides a privilege for a person who confides in a minister of religion in respect of communications made for the purpose of receiving religious or spiritual advice, benefit, or comfort.

Section 59 provides a privilege in criminal proceedings for a person who sees a medical practitioner or clinical psychologist for the purpose of treating a drug addiction or other condition or behaviour that may manifest itself in criminal conduct. The person has a privilege in respect of communications to the medical practitioner or clinical psychologist made for that purpose, in respect of information obtained by the medical practitioner or clinical psychologist for that purpose, and in prescriptions issued by the medical practitioner or clinical psychologist for that purpose.

Section 60 provides a privilege to a person required to provide specific information if providing the information is reasonably likely to lead to the person's prosecution and punishment for any offence under New Zealand law (i.e. [[self-incrimination]]). Unless removed or limited by an enactment, whether expressly or by necessary implication, the person cannot be required to produce the information or be penalised for not doing so (whether or not the privilege is claimed). Because of section 51(3), the privilege does not apply to documents in existence when the information is required. The privilege cannot be claimed by corporations.

Section 61 confers a discretion on a Judge to excuse a person from providing information likely to incriminate the person of an offence punishable under foreign law (other than an offence punishable merely by a fine).

Section 62 requires a Judge to ensure that a party or witness is aware of the privilege against self-incrimination, if it appears to the Judge that the party or witness may be entitled to claim the privilege. The section also requires a claimant of the privilege to offer sufficient evidence to enable the claim to be assessed.

Section 63 prevents parties to [[Anton Piller order]]s from claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. Anton Piller orders are made by a Judge in a civil proceeding and direct the defendant to let the plaintiff enter his or her premises in order to establish the presence of certain items, and if warranted, to remove them for safekeeping. The scope of the order has widened and can now include a direction that the party disclose information and documents that would not necessarily be found by the search alone. Under the Bill, there is no privilege for pre-existing documents. However, the privilege could be claimed if the party is required to answer potentially self-incriminating questions. If satisfied that self-incrimination is reasonably likely if a party provides the information sought by the order, the Judge must make an order that the information provided not be used in any criminal proceeding against the person providing the information.

Section 64 provides that a person who informs an enforcement agency of possible offences in the reasonable expectation that his or her identity will not be disclosed and who is not called as a witness has a privilege in respect of information that would disclose the person's identity.

Section 65 relates to waiver of privilege. The section provides that a privilege may be waived either expressly or implicitly; that, generally, a privilege is waived if the privilege holder discloses the privileged information in circumstances that are inconsistent with a claim of confidentiality; and that a specific instance of waiver occurs when the privilege holder acts so as to put the privileged information in issue in a proceeding.

Section 66 relates to privilege jointly held by several holders and to privilege acquired by successors. A joint privilege holder may assert the privilege against third parties, may have access to the privileged material, may require the other holders not to disclose the privileged material, and may be ordered by a Judge not to disclose the privileged material. Personal representatives of deceased privilege holders and persons who acquire property related to a privilege have similar rights except that the right of access is limited to the extent that a Judge considers it justified.

Section 67 requires a Judge to disallow a claim of privilege if satisfied there is a prima facie case that the privileged material was communicated or prepared for a dishonest purpose or to enable the commission of an offence. The section authorises a Judge to disallow a privilege if the Judge thinks that evidence of the privileged material is necessary to enable the defendant in a criminal proceeding to present an effective defence. But information disclosed in accordance with such disallowance cannot be used against the holder of the privilege in a proceeding. The section does not apply to the privilege against self-incrimination.

Section 68 protects the identity of the sources of journalists in cases where journalists promise not to disclose their identity. The starting point is that the journalist cannot be compelled to reveal the identity of the source. However, a Judge of the High Court may order that the identity be revealed if satisfied that the public interest in doing this outweighs any likely adverse effect on the source or others as well as the public interest in the ability of the news media to communicate facts and opinions to the public.

Section 69 confers a general discretion on the Judge to protect confidential communications or information from disclosure in a proceeding. To do this, the Judge must be of the view that the public interest in disclosing the information is outweighed by the public interest in preventing harm to persons affected by, or involved in obtaining, communicating, or receiving, the confidential information, or by the public interest in preventing harm to relationships of confidentiality, or by the public interest in maintaining the free flow of information. The section sets out a number of factors to which the Judge must have regard in balancing the interest of disclosure in proceedings against the interests in confidentiality.

Section 70 confers a discretion on a Judge to direct that matters of State not be disclosed if justified in the public interest. The section clarifies that matters of State include information that may need protection for reasons recognised by the [[Official Information Act 1982]].&lt;ref name="Explanatory"&gt;Evidence Bill 2005, Explanatory Notes. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial process===
====Eligibility and compellability====
Section 71 sets out the general rule governing the eligibility and compellability of witnesses to give evidence. In general, any person
is eligible to give evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding and can be compelled to give that evidence. Section 72 to 75 set out a number of exceptions to the general rule. 

Section 72 provides that a person acting as a Judge in a proceeding is not eligible to give evidence in that proceeding. It also provides that except with the permission of the Judge a person who is acting as a juror or counsel in a proceeding is not eligible to give evidence in that proceeding.

Section 73 provides that a defendant in a criminal proceeding is not a compellable witness for the prosecution or the defence in that proceeding. An associated defendant is not compellable to give evidence for or against a defendant in a criminal proceeding unless the associated defendant is being tried separately from the defendant or the proceeding against the associated defendant has been determined.

Section 74 provides that the [[Queen of New Zealand|Sovereign]], the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], a Sovereign or Head of State of a foreign country, and a Judge (in respect of the Judge's conduct as a Judge) are not compellable to give evidence.

Section 75 provides that bank officers cannot be compelled to produce banking records.&lt;ref name="Select Committee" /&gt;

Section 76 prohibits the giving of evidence about the deliberation of a jury, except in very limited circumstances. The section requires the Judge to be satisfied, in addition to the requirement that the evidence tends to establish that a juror has acted in breach of the juror's duty, that in the circumstances of the particular case the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the jury deliberations is outweighed by the public interest in avoiding or remedying any miscarriage of justice.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Oaths and affirmations====
Section 77 requires a witness aged 12 years or over to take an [[oath]] or make an [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] before giving evidence. A witness in a proceeding who is under 12 years must make a promise to tell the truth before giving evidence. Section 77(3) enables the Judge in a proceeding to permit evidence to be given without the witness taking an oath, making an affirmation, or making a promise to tell the truth.

Section 78 requires a person acting as an interpreter to take an oath or make an affirmation before acting as an interpreter. An interpreter includes a person who provides communication assistance.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Support, communication assistance, and views====
Section 79 makes provision for support persons for complainants, child witnesses and other witnesses in criminal proceedings, and regulates their conduct.

Sections 80 and 81 describe when communication assistance is to be provided to a defendant in criminal proceedings, and regulate the provision of that assistance. Section 80(5) proves that wilfully giving false or misleading statements by a person providing communication assistance amounts to [[perjury]].

Section 82 empowers a Judge to hold a view or, if there is a jury, order a view, if the Judge considers that the view is in the interests of justice. A view is defined as an inspection by the Judge or, if there is a jury, by the Judge and jury, of a place or thing that is not in the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Questioning of witnesses====

Section 83 provides that the ordinary way for a witness to give evidence is orally in a courtroom or, in certain circumstances, by giving evidence in the form of an affidavit or by reading a written statement in a courtroom.

Section 84 sets out the order in which a witness gives evidence. A witness first gives [[direct examination|evidence in chief]] and may then be [[cross-examination|cross-examined]], and finally may be [[redirect examination|re-examined]].

Section 85 allows the Judge in any proceeding to disallow or permit a witness to refuse to answer any question that the Judge considers intimidating, improper, unfair, misleading, needlessly repetitive, or expressed in language that is too complicated for the witness to
understand.

Section 86 provides that a person commits [[contempt of court]] who prints or publishes material relating to a question that has been
disallowed or in breach of any order of the Judge made in relation to a question that a witness is not obliged to answer.

Section 87 and 88 restrict questioning, the giving of evidence, or the making of statements or remarks about the precise address of any
witness and the occupation of a complainant in a sexual case, respectively. In general, such questioning and evidence and the making of any such statements or remarks, is prohibited unless the Judge considers that exclusion would be contrary to the interests of justice.

Section 89 restricts the use of [[leading question]]s in examination in chief or re-examination of a witness.

Section 90 regulates the use of written statements in questioning witnesses.

Section 91 enables the editing of statements by parties to exclude evidence ruled by the Judge to be inadmissible.

Section 92 sets out the cross-examination duties of the parties. A party must cross-examine a witness on substantial matters that contradict the evidence of the witness if the witness is, or might be, in a position to give admissible evidence on those matters. The section also deals with the effect of a failure by a party to comply with his or her cross-examination duties and the orders which may be made by the Judge.

Section 93 enables a Judge to limit cross-examination in any proceeding of a witness who has the same, or substantially the same, interest in the proceedings as the cross-examining party.

Section 94 enables a party to cross-examine a witness called by that party if the Judge determines that the witness is [[hostile witness|hostile]] and gives permission for the cross-examination.

Section 95 prohibits a defendant in a criminal proceeding that is a sexual case or is a proceeding concerning domestic violence from personally cross-examining a complainant or a child who is a witness. The section also enables the Judge to make an order in any civil or criminal proceeding preventing a party to the proceeding from personally cross-examining a particular witness.

Section 96 regulates the cross-examination of a witness on a previous statement made by that witness.

Section 97 regulates the matters that may be subject to re-examination of any witness.

Section 98 prohibits a party from offering further evidence after closing that party's case, except with the permission of the Judge.

Section 99 empowers a Judge to recall a witness who has given evidence in a proceeding if the Judge considers it in the interests of justice to do so.

Section 100 empowers a Judge to ask a witness any questions that, in the opinion of the Judge, justice requires, and provides for further cross-examination and re-examination on any matter raised by the Judge's questions.

Section 101 regulates the manner in which juries may put a question to a witness.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Alternative ways of giving evidence====
Section 102 deals with the application of the subpart. It provides that the general rules dealing with alternative ways of giving evidence are subject to a number of provisions dealing with specific situations.

Section 103 empowers a Judge to give directions in any proceeding that a witness is to give evidence in chief and be cross-examined in the ordinary way or in an alternative way as provided in section 105.

Section 104 requires a chambers hearing, at which each party has an opportunity to be heard, if an application is made for directions under Section 103.

Section 105 sets out alternative ways in which a witness may give evidence. This includes behind a screen, via CCTV or video conference call, or by video record.

Section 106 regulates the use of video record evidence (which is one of the alternative ways of giving evidence) authorised by section 105.

Section 107 provides a child witness in criminal proceedings the automatic right to give evidence in an alternative way. Sections 107A and 107B allows parties to request the child witness to give evidence in the ordinary way, or in a mixture of the ordinary way and an alternative way respectively, if it is in the interests of justice to do so.

Sections 108 and 109 repeat the special provisions relating to the giving of evidence by undercover police officers. Those provisions are designed to ensure that the identity and place of residence of an undercover police officer is kept secret, except in very limited circumstances.

Sections 110 to 118 set out the special provisions relating to the giving of evidence by anonymous witnesses and witnesses in the police witness protection programme.

Section 120 allows an undercover police officer or an anonymous
witness to sign statements under an assumed name.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Corroboration, judicial directions, and judicial warnings====
Section 121 deals with the topic of corroboration. It provides that it is not necessary in a criminal proceeding for the evidence on which the prosecution relies to be corroborated, except with respect to the offences of perjury, false oaths, false statements or declarations, and treason. The section also deals with the question of when a warning or direction relating to the absence of corroboration should be given.

Section 122 requires the Judge, if he or she considers that any evidence given in a criminal proceeding tried with a jury may be unreliable, to warn the jury of the need for caution in deciding whether to accept the evidence or the weight to be given to it.

Section 123 provides for the giving of a direction to a jury, in a case where evidence is given in an alternative way or in accordance with a witness anonymity order, or in a case where the defendant is not permitted to personally cross-examine the defendant. The direction must, amongst other matters, indicate that the jury must not draw any adverse inference against the defendant because of that manner of giving evidence or questioning.

Section 124 deals with the question of when, in a criminal proceeding tried before a jury where there is evidence that a defendant has lied either before or during the proceeding, a judicial warning should be given about lies and the form of any direction.

Section 126 requires the Judge, in a criminal proceeding tried with a jury in which the case against the defendant depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of 1 or more visual or voice identifications of the defendant or of any other person, to warn the jury of the special need for caution before finding the defendant guilty in reliance on the correctness of any such identification.

Section 127 relates to the directions that may be given to a jury if issues arise in a sexual case tried before a jury about a delay in making, or failure to make, a complaint in respect of the offence.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Notice of uncontroverted facts and reference to reliable public documents====
Section 128 provides that [[judicial notice]] may be taken of certain facts.

Section 129 allows a Judge to admit, in matters of public history, literature, science, or art, certain published documents without compliance with the rules relating to hearsay evidence and opinion evidence.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

====Documentary evidence and evidence produced by machine, device, or technical process====
Section 130 sets out a procedure which enables a party, on giving notice to the other parties, to offer a document in evidence without calling a witness to produce the document.

Section 133 enables evidence of a voluminous document or compilation of documents to be given, after giving notice to the other parties and with the permission of the Judge, by means of a summary or chart.

Section 135 deals with the admission of translations of documents
and transcripts of information or other matters.

Section 136 relates to the proof of signatures on attested documents.

Section 137 relates to the status of any evidence provided by
machine, device, or technical process.

Section 138 provides that documents purporting to be public documents or copies of or extracts from such documents are, if sealed or certified in a certain manner, presumed to be authentic, in the absence of proof to the contrary.

Section 202 provides for a periodic review of the operation of the Act by the [[New Zealand Law Commission|Law Commission]].&lt;ref name="Select Committee" /&gt;

Sections 203 to 214 set out transitional provisions.

Section 215 provides that the enactments specified in Schedule 1 are repealed. This included the Evidence Act 1908 in its entirety, as well as some sections of the [[Crimes Act 1961]], Juries Act 1981, and Summary Proceedings Act 1957.

Clause 216 provides that the enactments specified in Schedule 2 are consequentially amended.

==History==
Prior to the Act, evidence law in New Zealand was largely Judge-made, comprising decisions that were made in response to the circumstances of particular cases. The statutory provisions dealing with evidence were contained in a number of statutes, and have been reformed on a piecemeal basis, responding to issues as they arise. The resulting complexity and inconsistency of the law of evidence results in undue legal argument, expense, and delays in proceedings to accommodate arguments over issues of admissibility.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;

In August 1989, the Law Commission was instructed by Minister of Justice [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]] to make the law of evidence as clear, simple, and accessible as practicable, and to facilitate the fair, just, and speedy judicial resolution of disputes. With this purpose in mind the Law Commission was asked to examine the statutory and common law governing evidence in proceedings before courts and tribunals and to make recommendations for its reform with a view to codification.&lt;ref name="Explanatory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NZLC R55"&gt;{{cite web |title= Evidence – Reform of the Law |url= http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20R55%20v1.pdf |publisher= New Zealand Law Commission |date= 24 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1991, the Law Commission published the first of a series of discussion papers on aspects of evidence law. This paper dealt with the principles on reform, codification, and [[hearsay]]. Between then and 1997, the Law Commission published a number of further discussion papers on major aspects of evidence law: expert evidence and opinion evidence, privilege, documentary evidence, character and credibility, the evidence of children and other vulnerable witnesses. Alongside the review, the Commission published discussion papers on the privilege against self-incrimination and police questioning in relation to a review on criminal procedure.&lt;ref name="NZLC R55" /&gt;

The work of the Law Commission culminated on 24 August 1999, when the Commission published its final report entitled ''Evidence – Reform of the Law''. Included was a draft Evidence Code, to which the Act is based on.&lt;ref name="NZLC R55" /&gt;

The Evidence Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 3 May 2005. The bill passed its first reading a week later on 10 May. The Justice and Electoral Select Committee scrutinised the bill, reporting back on 24 October 2006 that the bill should be passed with amendments. The Bill passed its second reading on 15 November 2006 and its third and final reading on 23 November 2006. The Bill passed all three readings unanimously.&lt;ref name="bill" /&gt;

The Bill received the Royal Assent on 4 December 2006, becoming the Evidence Act 2006.&lt;ref name="bill" /&gt; Some transitional provisions came into force on 18 July 2007, with the rest of the Act coming into force on 1 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence Act 2006, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and amendments==
Section 202 of the Act requires the Minister of Justice to instruct the Law Commission to review the Act every 5 years. The minimum terms of reference include examining the operation of the Act's provision since the last review, and whether the provision should be retained, amended or repealed.&lt;ref&gt;Section 202, Evidence Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The first review was initiated in February 2012, with the Law Commission reporting back in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20R127.pdf |title= The 2013 Review of the Evidence Act 2006 |publisher= New Zealand Law Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting recommendations were incorporated into the Evidence Amendment Act 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL63043_1/evidence-amendment-bill |title= Evidence Amendment Bill |publisher= New Zealand Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second review was initiated in February 2017, with the Law Commission required to report back by February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Second Review of the Evidence Act 2006 |url= http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/our-projects/second-review-evidence-act-2006 |publisher= New Zealand Law Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Federal Election Commission v. Akins''''', 524 U.S. 11 (1998),{{ref|citation}} was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case deciding that an individual could sue for a violation of a federal law pursuant to a [[statute]] enacted by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] which created a general right to access certain [[information]].

==Facts==
The [[plaintiff]]s were [[registered voters]] who had asked the [[defendant]] [[Federal Elections Commission]] ("FEC") to determine that an [[organization]] called the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] ("AIPAC") was a "[[political committee]]" subject to certain [[regulations]] and reporting requirements under the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]], because AIPAC had crossed certain spending thresholds. The FEC determined that AIPAC had indeed crossed those thresholds, but still did not require it to make the required reports because the organization was issue-oriented, not campaign-related. The plaintiffs sought review in the District Court, which granted summary judgment for the FEC; this ruling was affirmed by a panel of the Court of Appeals, but the Court of Appeals ''en banc'' reversed. The government sought certiorari, and challenged the plaintiff's standing on the grounds that the plaintiffs had suffered no 'injury in fact'; that if the plaintiffs had any injury it was not fairly traceable to the FEC decision; and that a decision in favor of the plaintiffs would not redress their injury.

==Issue==
Did the plaintiffs suffer an injury in fact sufficient to establish standing?

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court, in an opinion by [[Justice Breyer]], held that Congress has, by statute, allowed "any party aggrieved by an order of the Commission" to file a suit, which is a broad grant; not getting the requested information is an "injury in fact" just like the denial of any other information which is statutorily required to be provided to citizens by the government. The grievance is a "generalized grievance," but the harm is concrete enough to overcome this, and the harm is fairly traceable to the FEC – even though the FEC may find other grounds not to make AIPAC provide the info. ("[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found 'injury in fact.'" ''Federal Election Commission v. Akins'' 524 U.S. 11, 24 (1998))

The Court distinguished this case from [[lawsuit]]s where an individual seeks relief based on mere [[taxpayer standing]] - an insufficient ground for standing to sue. It instead employed a "zone of interests test," asking whether the injury asserted fell into the zone of interests protected by the statute.

The case was remanded to the FEC to review its definition of 'members.' The Court noted that the FEC was producing new guidelines regarding this issue, which would address it and not require a new legal precedent. The plaintiffs were bitterly disappointed by the decision not to intervene, as the effort to have AIPAC legally declared a political action committee was a higher priority than the (successful) effort to show standing to have filed this lawsuit in the first place. While they repeatedly attempted filings to have the case re-opened, these were entirely rejected, and in 2010 a Federal court in D.C. ruled that the lawsuit had no merit as electoral law and it was officially and finally dismissed.

==Dissent==
[[Justice Scalia]] wrote a dissenting opinion asserting that the fact the statute differentiated between 'any person' (in defining the class of persons who could file a complaint with the FEC over a violation) and 'any party aggrieved' (in defining the class of persons who could bring suit in federal court over the FEC's decision on the complaint) demonstrated the limiting force of the latter provision&amp;mdash;anyone could file a complaint with the FEC if they believed a violation had occurred, but only parties who had actually been aggrieved (suffered a particularized injury) as a result of the FEC's decision on the complaint could sue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13754">The '''"Faces of Freedom"''' photo exhibition is a collection of photographs captured by [[photo-journalist]], [[filmmaker]] and [[human rights]] [[educator]] [[Robin Romano|U. Roberto (Robin) Romano]], during his travels to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]]. Romano explores the exploitation of [[child labor]] in the production of handmade rugs in coordination with multiple international organizations, such as the [[World Bank]], [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] and others to reduce the number of child laborers in that industry.  The exhibit has been shown in many United States cities since its first exhibit in 2009.  Faces of Freedom has been included in [[CNN]] Freedom Projects of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]].

==Child labor==
To combat exploitation of [[Child labour|child labor]], [[The World Bank]] with [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and Understanding Children's Work Initiative to bring awareness of the scope of the problem.  The World Bank estimates that there are 218 million children who are victim to unfair child labor practices.  The children's ages range from five to seventeen years of age.  The handmade rug industry is one of industries involved in exploitation of child labor.  The World Bank works with country-based and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in an effort to "combat child labor."&lt;ref name=TWB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://go.worldbank.org/CLQNYOJEE0 |title=Faces of Freedom - Visions of Hope for Child Laborers |author= |date=2009-12-16 |work=Topics, Children and Youth |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=2011-05-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and the [[International Labour Organization]] consider child labor exploitative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worst Forms of Child Labor Recommendation, 1999 |work=International Labour Organization |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?R190 |accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN stipulating, in article 32 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''  Although globally there is an estimated 250 million children working.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the census in 1990 nearly 18% of all the children in America are working in different organizations. The Supreme Court banned child labor in 1916 but the law became visible in 1941. The labor department is also not paying attention to the child labor in USA therefore children are still employed in the organizations. The age of the children who are employed is between 15 years to 17 years. They are nearly 3.7 million children who work in different factories. There is an interesting fact that more than 600 children died in work related accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/child-labor-in-usa|title=Child Labor in USA|publisher=What is USA News|date=15 April 2013 | accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit==
U. Roberto Romano, a photographer, filmmaker and humans right activist, traveled to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]] to record the plight of child laborers in the handmade rug industry.  He also gathered photographs and stories of children who have been rescued by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] organization, previously known as Rugmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?p=55 |title=Rugmark |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?page_id=1027 |title=Faces of Freedom |year=2011 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faces of Freedom exhibit is a collection of photos by U. Roberto Romano that provides insight into the lives, poor living conditions and faces of child rug-weavers of South Asia. Messages of hope are portrayed in the photographs and stories of children that were assisted by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] program to attain school education. A selection of handmade rugs made without child labor is also exhibited.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=STC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southtexascollege.edu/milagros/virtual_library.html |title=Photographic Documentaries, U.

It was filmed in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?p=217 |title=Children in the Fields |year=2011 |work= |publisher=media voices for children  |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stolen Childhoods'''
:A feature documentary on global [[child labour|child labor]] exploitation affecting nearly 250 million children.  The film,  narrated by actress [[Meryl Streep]], covers factors affecting the children: working conditions, slavery, and bonded labor. Children's stories from eight countries, including the United States, tell of children exposed to pesticides, chained to their work areas, and even kidnapped and forced into slavery or prostitution.  In addition to providing background for why this occurs and implications to the global community, it also offers hope through stories of children's lives have been saved and what actions can be taken to combat child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stolenchildhoods.org/mt/archives/2005/03/full_synopsis.php |title=Stolen Childhoods |author=Chris Mara |date=May 3, 2005 |work=Full Synopsis |publisher=Stolen Childhoods |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd''''' [1942] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1942/4.html UKHL 4] also known as the '''Fibrosa case''', is a leading English decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] on [[contract law]] and the doctrines of [[Frustration in English law|frustration]].&lt;ref&gt; ... and the related concept of [[frustration of purpose]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Fibrosa was a textile company based in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (today [[Vilnius]], capital of [[Lithuania]]). In July 1939, it entered into a contract with [[Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd|Fairbairn]], a British firm, to buy industrial machinery for its plant in [[Gdynia]] for £4,800. The contract was signed on 12 July 1939 and, the following week, Fibrosa paid an advanced payment of £1,000. The machines were expected to arrive within three to four months.

On 1 September 1939, [[German invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by Nazi Germany. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September, entering [[World War II]]. The following week, Fibrosa's agents contacted Fairbairn to request that the initial £1,000 payment be refunded as the contract's execution had become [[Impossibility|impossible]]. Fairbairn refused, citing the current law. On 1 May 1940, Fibrosa's agents initiated legal proceedings.

The lower courts held, taking as their authority ''[[Chandler v Webster]]'' (1904) that where a contract has been frustrated by a supervening event, "the loss lies where it falls", with the result that sums paid or rights accrued before that event are not to be surrendered, but that all obligations falling due for performance after that event are discharged. Consequently, the lower courts rejected Fibrosa's claim to recover the £1,000.

==Judgment==
The House of Lords found in favour of Fibrosa. Viscount Simon was critical of the ''Chandler'' case and found that it would apply only where there has been no failure of the consideration. However, in the circumstances, there was a failure of the consideration as Fibrosa had received none of the machinery ordered. This frustrated contract would not be subject the rule in the Chandler decision, and so Fibrosa would succeed.

[[Robert Wright, Baron Wright|Lord Wright]] said the claim was based on [[unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref&gt;[1943] AC 32, 61-65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|My Lords, the claim in the action was to recover a prepayment of 1000l. made on account of the price under a contract which had been frustrated. The claim was for money paid for a consideration which had failed. It is clear that any civilized system of law is bound to provide remedies for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit, that is to prevent a man from retaining the money of or some benefit derived from another which it is against conscience that he should keep. Such remedies in English law are generically different from remedies in contract or in tort, and are now recognized to fall within a third category of the common law which has been called quasi-contract or restitution. The root idea was stated by three Lords of Appeal, Lord Shaw, Lord Sumner and Lord Carson, in ''[[R. E. Jones, Ld. v. Waring &amp; Gillow, Ld]]'', which dealt with a particular species of the category, namely, money paid under a mistake of fact. Lord Sumner referring to ''[[Kelly v Solari]]'', where money had been paid by an insurance company under the mistaken impression that it was due to an executrix under a policy which had in fact been cancelled, said: "There was no real intention on the company's part to enrich her." Payment under a mistake of fact is only one head of this category of the law. Another class is where, as in this case, there is prepayment on account of money to be paid as consideration for the performance of a contract which in the event becomes abortive and is not performed, so that the money never becomes due. There was in such circumstances no intention to enrich the payee. This is the class of claims for the recovery of money paid for a consideration which has failed. Such causes of action have long been familiar and were assumed to be common-place by Holt CJ in ''[[Holmes v Hall]]'' in 1704. Holt C.J. was there concerned only about the proper form of action and took the cause of the action as beyond question. He said: "If A give money to B to pay to C upon C's giving writings, etc., and C will not do it, indebit will lie for A against B for so much money received to his use. And many such actions have been maintained for earnests in bargains, when the bargainor would not perform, and for premiums for insurance, when the ship, etc., did not go the voyage." The Chief Justice is there using earnest as meaning a prepayment on account of the price, not in the modern sense of an irrevocable payment to bind the bargain, and he is recognizing that the indebitatus assumpsit had by that time been accepted as the appropriate form of action in place of the procedure which had been used in earlier times to enforce these claims such as debt, account or case.

By 1760 actions for money had and received had increased in number and variety. Lord Mansfield C.J., in a familiar passage in ''[[Moses v Macferlan]]'', sought to rationalize the action for money had and received, and illustrated it by some typical instances. "It lies," he said, "for money paid by mistake; or upon a consideration which happens to fail; or for money got through imposition (express, or implied;) or extortion; or oppression; or an undue advantage taken of the plaintiff's situation, contrary to laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances. In one word, the gist of this kind of action is, that the defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, is obliged by the ties of natural justice and equity to refund the money." Lord Mansfield prefaced this pronouncement by observations 136 which are to be noted. "If the defendant be under an obligation from the ties of natural justice, to refund; the law implies a debt and gives this action [sc. indebitatus assumpsit] founded in the equity of the plaintiff's case, as it were, upon a contract ('quasi ex contractu' as the Roman law expresses it)." Lord Mansfield does not say that the law implies a promise. The law implies a debt or obligation which is a different thing. In fact, he denies that there is a contract; the obligation is as efficacious as if it were upon a contract. The obligation is a creation of the law, just as much as an obligation in tort. The obligation belongs to a third class, distinct from either contract or tort, though it resembles contract rather than tort. This statement of Lord Mansfield has been the basis of the modern law of quasi-contract, notwithstanding the criticisms which have been launched against it. Like all large generalizations, it has needed and received qualifications in practice. There is, for *63 instance, the qualification that an action for money had and received does not lie for money paid under an erroneous judgment or for moneys paid under an illegal or excessive distress. The law has provided other remedies as being more convenient. The standard of what is against conscience in this context has become more or less canalized or defined, but in substance the juristic concept remains as Lord Mansfield left it.

The gist of the action is a debt or obligation implied, or, more accurately, imposed, by law in much the same way as the law enforces as a debt the obligation to pay a statutory or customary impost. This is important because some confusion seems to have arisen though perhaps only in recent times when the true nature of the forms of action have become obscured by want of user. If I may borrow from another context the elegant phrase of Viscount Simon L.C. in ''[[United Australia Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd]]'', there has sometimes been, as it seems to me, "a misreading of technical rules, now happily swept away." The writ of indebitatus assumpsit involved at least two averments, the debt or obligation and the assumpsit. The former was the basis of the claim and was the real cause of action. The latter was merely fictitious and could not be traversed, but was necessary to enable the convenient and liberal form of action to be used in such cases. This fictitious assumpsit or promise was wiped out by the [[Common Law Procedure Act 1852]]. As Bullen and Leake (Precedents of Pleading, 3rd ed., p. 36) points out, this Act, by s. 3, provided that the plaintiff was no longer required to specify the particular form of action in which he sued, and by s. 49 that (inter alia) the statement of promises in indebitatus counts which there was no need to prove were to be omitted; "the action of indebitatus assumpsit," the authors add, "is [that is by 1868] virtually become obsolete." Lord Atkin in the United Australia case 138 , after instancing the case of the blackmailer, says: "The man has my money which I have not delivered to him with any real intention of passing to him the property. I sue him because he has the actual property taken." He adds: "These fantastic resemblances of contracts invented in order to meet requirements of the law as to forms of action which have now disappeared should not in these days be allowed to affect actual rights." Yet the ghosts of the forms of action have been allowed at times to intrude in the ways of the living and impede vital functions of the law. Thus in ''[[Sinclair v Brougham]]'', Lord Sumner stated that "all these causes of action [sc. for money had and received] are common species of the genus assumpsit. All now rest, and long have rested, upon a notional or imputed promise to repay." This observation, which was not necessary for the decision of the case, obviously does not mean that there is an actual promise of the party. The phrase "notional or implied promise" is only a way of describing a debt or obligation arising by construction of law. The claim for money had and received always rested on a debt or obligation which the law implied or more accurately imposed, whether the procedure actually in vogue at any time was debt or account or case or ''indebitatus assumpsit''. Even the fictitious assumpsit disappeared after the Act of 1852. I prefer Lord Sumner's explanation of the cause of action in ''Jones's'' case. This agrees with the words of Lord Atkin which I have just quoted, yet serious legal writers have seemed to say that these words of the great judge in ''[[Sinclair v Brougham]]'' closed the door to any theory of unjust enrichment in English law. I do not understand why or how. It would indeed be a ''reductio ad absurdum'' of the doctrine of precedents. In fact, the common law still employs the action for money had and received as a practical and useful, if not complete or ideally perfect, instrument to prevent unjust enrichment, aided by the various methods of technical equity which are also available, as they were found to be in ''[[Sinclair v Brougham]]''.

Must, then, the court stay its hand in what would otherwise appear to be an ordinary case for the repayment of money paid in advance on account of the purchase price under a contract for the sale of goods merely because the contract has become impossible of performance and the consideration has failed for that reason? The defendant has the plaintiff's money. There was no intention to enrich him in the events which happened. No doubt, when money is paid under a contract it can only be claimed back as for failure of consideration where the contract is terminated as to the future. Characteristic instances are where it is dissolved by frustration or impossibility or by the contract becoming abortive for any reason not involving fault on the part of the plaintiff where the consideration, if entire, has entirely failed, or where, if it is severable, it has entirely failed as to the severable residue, as in ''[[Rugg v Minett]]''. The claim for repayment is not based on the contract which is dissolved on the frustration but on the fact that the defendant has received the money and has on the events which have supervened no right to keep it.}}

==Commentary==
In essence, having decided that the contract was frustrated (as to continue would have been treasonable), the court held that the entire deposit was recoverable by Fibrosa, given the total absence of consideration from the English supplier.  However, this decision raised more questions: "What if some machinery had been delivered? What if Fairbain had invested heavily in plant and materials prior to the contract?". The [[UK Parliament]] recognised that this war against the Nazis would give rise to numerous similar claims so, with admirable speed,&lt;ref&gt;Parliament's efficiency here was aided by the [[Law Revision Committee]]'s Seventh Interim Report on this topic: (Cmd. 6009 of 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; they enacted the [[Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943]], which provided that:
* Monies paid out before frustration are recoverable afterwards.
* Monies due before frustration are no longer due afterwards.
* A party who has obtained a valuable benefit under the contract may have to pay for it if the court considers it just.
* A party who has incurred expenses in respect of the contract before the frustrating event may recover such expenses from the other party if the court considers it just.

'''''Frank Reddaway Ltd. v. George Banham''''', [1896] A.C. 199 is a famous decision of the [[House of Lords]] on the [[tort]] of [[passing off]]. The Court held that  purely descriptive product names such as "camel hair belting" can acquire [[secondary meaning]], and consequently, is protected from passing off.

Frank Reddaway made [[machine belting]] which he sold under the name "Camel Hair Belting" for many years. George Banham was a former employee of Reddaway who left to start his own business manufacturing machine belting which he also called "Camel Hair Belting". 
[[File:Frank_Reddaway.jpg|thumb|left|Frank Reddaway]]
Reddaway sued Banham for passing off. He argued that there was a large portion of the public who recognized the name "Camel Hair Belting" as his product. He was also able to demonstrate that there were people who were getting the products confused.

The Court of Appeal held that the name was merely descriptive and so could not be protected. 

The House of Lords overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal. Lord Herschell held that the words had acquired a secondary meaning through its broad notoriety, and that the public clearly associated the name "Camel Hair Belting" with the exact product produced by Reddaway.

Lord Herschell stated: 
:''I cannot help saying that, if the defendants are entitled to lead purchasers to believe that they are getting the plaintiffs' manufacture when they are not, and thus to cheat the plaintiffs of some of their legitimate trade, I should regret to find that the law was powerless to enforce the most elementary principles of commercial morality.'''

'''Global Access Point, LLC''' is a multi-site data center and network operator that designs, builds, and manages data centers, network infrastructure and fiber assets for mid-sized to large enterprises as well as global telecommunication and cloud providers. Their Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) wholesale data center model offers flexible data center and network design, highly reliable power and cooling, and robust connectivity.

Besides their flagship operation in [[South Bend, Indiana]] (known as "Union Station Technology Center" or just "[[Union Station (South Bend, Indiana)|Union Station]]"), Global Access Point operates satellite deployments in Chicago, Indianapolis, and St. Louis, and has announced plans to expand its South Bend operation into the next-door Studebaker manufacturing plant redevelopment in South Bend's Renaissance District.

== History ==
What is now Global Access Point's flagship facility, Union Station, was built in 1929 in South Bend, Indiana. The building operated as a train station until 1972, and remained vacant until 1979 when Global Access Point's founder Kevin Smith purchased and renovated the building. For several years, parts of the building operated as event and manufacturing space. Because of Union Station's close proximity to Chicago, as well as one of the nation's largest fiber corridors on the adjacent railroad line, Mr. Smith began leasing space to telecommunications carriers to operate regeneration equipment in the late 1980s. Operations expanded in the early 2000s as Union Station became a colocation facility and later expanded into modular data suites and network operations. Today, Union Station is home to multiple national and international companies, primarily in the cloud, finance, insurance, life science, and research sectors, as well as 17+ telecommunications carriers (as of June, 2016.)

{{Chinese Legalism}}
'''Guan Zhong''' ({{zh|c=管仲|w='''Kuan Chung'''}}; c. 720–645 BC) was a [[Grand chancellor (China)|chancellor]] and reformer of the [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of Chinese history.&lt;ref name="EWP"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ebrey|first1=Patricia|last2=Walthall|first2=Ann|last3=Palais|first3=James|title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-547-00534-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[given name]] was '''Yiwu''' ({{zh|c=夷吾|p=Yíwú|links=no}}). ''Zhong'' was his [[courtesy name]]. He is mainly remembered for his reforms as chancellor under [[Duke Huan of Qi]], as well as his friendship with his colleague [[Bao Shuya]], though his reputation remained controversial among the [[Confucius|Confucians]] of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Yag-yong Chŏng 2016. p.218. The Analects of Dasan. https://books.google.com/books?id=zFGsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218&lt;/ref&gt;{{What?|date=June 2018}}

Through Guan Zhong's reforms and skilful diplomacy Qi became the most powerful of the feudal states and Duke Huan became the first of the [[Five Hegemons]]. Though knowledge of his reforms is limited, in particular he instituted a famous fiscal policy known as "balancing the light and the heavy", associated with salt and iron monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;Ricket, Guanzi (1985) p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Though otherwise a diverse work, the [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] compilation making use of his name makes similar such recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Ricket, Guanzi (1985) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Youth and friendship with Bao Shuya===

Guan Zhong was born in Yingshang, and became acquainted with Bao Shuya at an early age, when they became business partners. The [[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]] records that, as partner, Guan Zhong often took more than his share of the profits, in effect cheating Bao Shuya. Bao, however, recognised his impoverished background and was not offended.

===Tutors of different princes===

Subsequently, Guan Zhong was appointed tutor to Prince Jiu, the younger brother of the ruling [[Duke Xiang of Qi]]. Bao Shuya, meanwhile, became tutor to Jiu's younger brother, Prince Xiaobai.

In 686 BC, Duke Xiang was murdered in a palace coup by two of his ministers, who then installed [[Gongsun Wuzhi]], a scion of the ducal house, as the new Duke. Recognising that they were in mortal danger, both Prince Jiu and Prince Xiaobai fled with their respective tutors. Prince Jiu fled to the [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]], while Prince Xiaobai went to the [[Ju (state)|State of Ju]].

===Becoming chancellor===

In 685 BC, Gongsun Wuzhi himself was killed in another palace coup, and the ministers of Qi sent envoys to Ju, hoping to receive Prince Xiaobai back and succeed to the duchy. On hearing of this, Lu also sent Prince Jiu towards Qi, while Guan Zhong intercepted Prince Xiaobai to prevent his return. In the resulting conflict, Guan Zhong shot an arrow at Xiaobai which hit his belt buckle. Xiaobai pretended to cough blood and collapse, tricking Guan Zhong into thinking he was mortally wounded.

Eventually, Xiaobai won the race back to Qi, and was installed as Duke. The State of Lu attempted to enforce Prince Jiu's claim, but was defeated in battle, after which Qi forced Lu to execute Prince Jiu and send Guan Zhong back as a prisoner. Xiaobai originally wanted to execute Guan Zhong as well, but Bao Shuya strongly recommended sparing him and elevating him to chancellor, even though that meant he would outrank Bao himself. Xiaobai was eventually convinced.

==Philosophy and appraisal==
Guan Zhong was disparagingly identified with the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] school as a result of his administrative reforms.&lt;ref name="sas.upenn.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/ealc/system/files/bio/%5Buser-raw%5D/papers/Persistent%20Misconceptions%20about%20Chinese%20Legalism.pdf|title=Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism|author=Paul R. Goldin|publisher=sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=10 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916013118/https://www.sas.upenn.edu/ealc/system/files/bio/%5Buser-raw%5D/papers/Persistent%20Misconceptions%20about%20Chinese%20Legalism.pdf|archivedate=16 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though actually legalistic philosophy did not develop until hundreds of years later, R. Eno of Indiana University does consider that "If one were to trace the origins of Legalism as far back as possible, it might be appropriate to date its beginnings to the prime ministership of Guan Zhong, chief aide to the first of the hegemonic lords of the Spring Autumn period, Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685–643)."&lt;ref name="indiana.edu"&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Legalism.pdf R Eno, Indiana University&lt;/ref&gt;

He is said to have indulged in a luxurious lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Griet Vankeerberghen 2001 p.10, The Huainanzi and Liu An's Claim to Moral Authority https://books.google.com/books?id=zt-vBqHQzpQC&amp;pg=PA10&lt;/ref&gt; Guan Zhong was also a pragmatist who did not equate a ruler's moral purity with his ability to govern. Duke Huan, who loved hunting and women, asked Guan if these indulgences would harm his hegemony, to which Guan replied that the ruler's love for luxury would not harm his hegemony. It would only be harmed through inappropriate staffing and misuse of talent.&lt;ref&gt;Baogang Guo 2008 p.38. China in Search of a Harmonious Society. https://books.google.com/books?id=UkoStC-S-AMC&amp;pg=PA38&lt;/ref&gt; One passage "recounts" Confucius as considering him "mediocre" for his lack of frugality and knowledge of ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Xinzhong Yao 2017. p.321. Reconceptualizing Confucian Philosophy in the 21st Century. https://books.google.com/books?id=3b3QDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA321&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all this, he might be considered, "at least in most respects" an "ideal Confucian minister".&lt;ref&gt;Ricket, Guanzi (1985) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Guan Zhong is reported to have advised Duke Huan: 'Summon the wavering with courtesy and cherish the remote with virtuous conduct. So long as your virtuous conduct and courtesy never falter, there will be no one who does not cherish you.'" When Duke Huan was approached to dethrone the ruling clans of his state, Guan Zhong advised him that he had won their adherence through politeness (''li'') and trustworthiness (''xin'').

When Confucius's students criticized Guan Zhong as lacking propriety, crediting his ambition and achievement Confucius said of him that "It was due to Guan Zhong that Duke Huan was able to assemble the feudal lords on numerous occasions without resorting to the use of his war chariots. Such was his goodness! … Through having Guan Zhong as his minister Duke Huan became protector over the feudal lords. He brought unity and order to the entire realm so that even today people enjoy his gifts to them … I am afraid that without Guan Zhong we would be folding our lapels right-over-left ([[Hanfu|traditional Chinese clothing]] customarily is folded left-over-right)."&lt;ref&gt;Ricket, Guanzi (1985) p.11 * Xinzhong Yao 2017. p.321. Reconceptualizing Confucian Philosophy in the 21st Century. https://books.google.com/books?id=3b3QDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Guan Zhong started multiple reforms in the [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]]. Politically, he centralized power and divided the state into different villages, each carrying out a specific trade. Instead of relying on the traditional aristocracy for manpower, he applied [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] to the village units directly. He also developed a better method for choosing talent to be governors. Under Guan Zhong, Qi shifted administrative responsibility from hereditary aristocrats to professional bureaucrats. He is also credited for creating the first official government sponsored [[brothel]] known as "女市" which funded the government treasury.

During his term of office, the State of Qi became much stronger. The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' records that in 660 BC, Guan Zhong urged [[Duke Huan of Qi]] to attack the small neighboring [[Xing (state)|State of Xing]] which was under attack from [[Quanrong|Quan Rong]] nomads, a non-Chinese Rong tribes&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia, Anne Walthall, and James Palais. ''Pre-Modern East Asia To 1800. A Cultural, Social and Political History, Second Edition.'' Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;. Later, in 652 BC he advised the duke not to ally with a vassal ruler's son who wished to depose his father. Duke Huan often listened to Guan Zhong's sound advice such that his status amongst other Zhou vassal states rose. As a result, the duke came to be recognized as the first [[Five Hegemons|Hegemon]] or leader of the vassal alliance.&lt;ref name="EWP" /&gt;

In recognition of Guan Zhong's service, Duke Huan gave him the honorary title of "Godfather" (仲父). Same title was later given to [[Lü Buwei]] by Prince Zheng, the future [[Qin Shi Huang]].

===State Monopoly on Salt and Iron===
{{Main|Discourses on Salt and Iron|zh:盐业专卖}}
Under Guan's guidance several important economic reforms were introduced. He created a uniform tax code and also used state power to encourage the production of salt and iron.

He believed that monopolizing the nature resources was helpful on improving the government income, with fewer complaints from the public than raising taxes. The strategy was described by himself to the Duke of Huan as “managing the mountain and the sea（官山海）”, which mainly refers to iron mine from the mountain and salt from the sea. Under his policy, private business who produce salt by boiling seawater and iron by mining must sell all outputs to the government, and the government resell refined salt and iron products, with huge price gap, to all household in State of Qi.

Historians usually credit Guan Zhong for introducing state monopolies controlling salt and iron.

===Qi-Hengshan War===
{{Main|zh:衡山之谋}}
In the record of [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] Chapter 84, Duke of Huan wanted to restrain the threat from State of Hengshan（衡山国）and asked Guan for solution. State of Hengshan was famous for its weapon production. Guan then ordered officials to buy arms from State of Hengshan in large quantities. After ten months, worrying that the price will continuously grow up, State of Yan, State of Dai and later State of Qin followed up the buying. The price then jumped sharply and, as a result, almost all household in State of Hengshan switched to make weapons instead of farming. One year later, Guan ordered officials to buy rice from State of Zhao, at a price more than three times higher than normal. By seeing the potential huge profit, State of Hengshan sold its rice inventory to officials from State of Qi. Afterwards, Guan suddenly ordered State of Qi's army to invade State of Hengshan. With selling out of weapon and rice, State of Hengshan soon surrendered.

Some historians marked Qi-Hengshan War the early form of [[Economic Warfare]]&lt;ref&gt;Chu L.''Guan Zhong's Economics War'', Military Economics Research (China), 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Publications===
He is listed as the author of the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' encyclopedia, actually a much later (of the late [[Warring States period]]) compilation of works from the scholars of the [[Jixia Academy]].

==In popular culture==
Guan Zhong is one of 32 historical personages featured in the [[Koei]] game ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI]]'', where he is referred to as Guan Yiwu.

'''Halsbury’s Law Exchange''' is a legal [[think tank]] based in the [[United Kingdom]].

== Aims and Objectives ==
The thinktank states that it aims to contribute to the development of [[law]] and the [[practice of law|legal sector]]; to communicate ideas on reform and legal direction to decision makers and the legal sector; and to promote [[debate]] through papers, reports, events, and [[mass media|media]] pieces. The outfit aims to examine [[the rule of law]], the structure of the [[legal system]], and the development of the legal sector; to contribute to the development of an efficient [[statute|statutory]] framework; to comment on current legal issues that impact on society; and to put forward proposals to ensure the law is just.

== Research and Publications ==

=== Recent White Papers ===
'''Environment''': International environmental problems are in a legal lacuna; is an [[international court]] for the environment now an imperative?

'''Corporate''': Missed opportunities: did the UK miss a significant opportunity to implement important improving reforms in the recent re-write of its companies’ [[legislation]]? Should it now be making further advances, thus parting with old traditions in favour of supporting modern corporate practices?

=== Recent Research ===
'''Employment''': A proposal for a simpler [[employee]] vetting system.

'''Family''': Does media access to [[family court]]s herald a new and potentially damaging era of openness in family proceedings?

'''Assisted dying''': Proposals to change UK law and advance some suitable conclusions for adoption in this jurisdiction.

'''Sovereign immunity''': A [[white paper]] questioning whether the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] is still appropriate.

The Sultan writes: "I have been informed. Those structures mentioned in this summary are to be rebuilt expeditiously for [[Jum'ah]] and [[Bayram (Turkey)#Religious festivals of Turkey|Bayram]] prayers.]]
'''Hatt-i humayun''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''' خط همايون''', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''hatt-ı hümayun'' or ''hatt-ı hümâyûn''), also known as '''hatt-i sharif''' (''hatt-ı şerîf''), is the [[diplomatics]] term for a document or handwritten note of an official nature composed by an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]]. The terms come from ''hatt'' ([[Arabic]]: handwriting, command), ''hümayun'' (imperial) and ''[[sharif|şerif]]'' (lofty, noble). These notes were commonly written by the [[Sultan]] personally, although they could also be transcribed by a palace scribe. They were written usually in response to, and directly on, a document submitted to the sultan by the [[grand vizier]] or another officer of the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman government]]. Thus, they could be approvals or denials of a letter of [[petition]], acknowledgements of a report, grants of permission for a request, an annotation to a [[decree]], or other government documents. ''Hatt-ı hümayun''s could be composed from scratch, rather than as a response to an existing document. After the [[Tanzimat]] reform (1856), aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire, ''hatt-ı hümayun''s of the routine kind were supplanted by the practice of ''irâde-i seniyye'', in which the Sultan's spoken response was recorded on the document by his [[scribe]].

There are nearly 100,000 ''hatt-ı hümayun''s in the Ottoman archives in [[Istanbul]]. Among the more famous are the [[Edict of Gülhane|Edict (''hatt-ı şerîf'') of Gülhane]] of 1839 and the [[Imperial Reform Edict]] (''hatt-ı hümayun'') of 1856. For this last one, the Turkish term ''Tanzimat Fermanı'' is more accurate. This decree, which started the so-called [[Tanzimat|Tanzimat reforms]], is so called because it carries a handwritten order by the sultan to the grand vizier to execute his command.

The term ''"hatt-ı hümayun"'' can sometimes also be used in a literal sense, meaning a document handwritten by an [[Ottoman Sultan]].

==Types of ''hatt-ı hümayun''==
The ''hatt-ı hümayun'' would usually be written to the [[grand vizier]] (''Sadrazam''), or in his absence, to his replacement (the [[Kaymakam|ka'immakâm]]), or to another senior official such as the grand admiral ([[Kapudan-i Derya]]) or the governor-general ([[Beylerbey]]) of [[Rumeli]]. There were three types of ''hatt-ı hümayuns'':&lt;ref name="sizinti"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Hüseyin Özdemir  | title= Hatt-ı Humayın  | journal=Sızıntı | year= 2009 | volume=31 | issue=365 | page= 230 |url=http://www.sizinti.com.tr/konular/ayrinti/hatt-i-humayin.html |  accessdate = 29 November 2010 | archive= | language= Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*those "on the white" 
:* those on a document

=== ''Hatt-ı hümayun'' to a government post ===
[[File:Iv-muradin-hatti.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Note by Sultan [[Murad IV]] (in thick script on top) on the appointment document of Vizier Suleiman Pasha to the post of [[Beylerbey]] of [[Rumeli]]: "Be it done as required."&lt;ref name="tarihvemedeniyet"/&gt; ]]
Routine decrees (''[[ferman]]'') or titles of privilege (''berat'') were written by a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal ([[tughra]]). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt; The note would emphasize a particular part of his [[edict]], urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called ''Hatt-ı Hümayunla Müveşşeh Ferman'' (ferman decorated with a ''hatt-ı hümayun'') or ''Unvanına Hatt-ı Hümayun'' (''hatt-ı hümayun'' to the title).&lt;ref name="koc"/&gt; The note might use a clichéd phrase like "to be done as required" (''mûcebince amel oluna'') or, "my command is to carried out as required and no one is to interfere with its execution" (''emrim mûcebince amel oluna, kimseye müdahale etmeyeler''). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, in order to encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as "if you want to keep your head, carry out this order as required" (''Başın gerek ise mûcebiyle amel oluna'').&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

=== ''Hatt-ı hümayun'' on the white ===
[[File:Ii-Murad-hatt.jpg|thumb|left|''Hatt-ı hümayun'' on the white of [[Mahmud II]] to his grand vizier to look into the maintenance of dams in [[Istanbul]] to relieve the misery of his subjects during a drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osmanlıca Tercüme|url=http://www.osmanlicatercume.net/?Urun=212859&amp;DosNo=1 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Hatt-ı hümayun on the white" (''beyaz üzerine hatt-ı hümâyun'') were documents originating with the sultan (''[[ex officio]]'') rather than a notation on an existing document. They were so called because the edict was written on a blank (i.e. white) page. They could be documents such as a command, an [[edict]], an appointment letter or a letter to a foreign ruler.

There also exist ''hatt-ı hümayun''s expressing the sultan's opinions or even his feelings on certain matters. For example, after the successful defense of [[Mosul]] against the forces of [[Nadir Shah]], in 1743, Sultan [[Mahmud I]] sent a ''hatt-ı hümayun'' to the governor Haj Husayn Pasha, which praised in verse the heroic exploits of the governor and the warriors of Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Uralic And Altaic Series, Volumes 1-150 | author=Denis Sinor | page = 177| publisher= Psychology Press | year = 1996 | url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=UWYdLuA34OQC&amp;pg=PA177 | isbn= 978-0-7007-0380-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Hatt-ı hümayun'' on a document ===
[[File:Iii-selimin-hatti.png|thumb|right|200px|A ''hatt-ı hümâyûn'' of [[Selim III]] (in thick handwriting above) on a ''telhis'' (summary) written by the grand vizier regarding his efforts to ensure a sufficient supply of meat to Istanbul for the coming [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name="ozkaya"/&gt; The Sultan writes his appreciation: "It has become my imperial knowledge. Do even more in the future. Let me see you."]]
In normal bureaucratic procedure, a document would be submitted by the [[grand vizier]], or his deputy the [[kaymakam]] (''Kâ'immakâm Paşa''), who would summarize a situation for the Sultan, and request the Sultan's will on the matter. Such documents were called ''telhis'' (summary) until the 19th century and  ''takrir'' (suggestion) later on.&lt;ref name="koksal"/&gt; The Sultan's handwritten response (his command or decision) were called ''hatt-ı hümâyûn on telhis'' or ''hatt-ı hümâyûn on takrir''. Other types of documents submitted to the Sultan were petitions (''arzuhâl''), sworn transcriptions of oral petitions (''mahzar''), reports from a higher to a lower office (''şukka''), religious reports by [[Qadi]]s to higher offices (''ilâm'') and record books (''tahrirat''). These would be called ''hatt-ı hümâyûn on arz'', ''hatt-ı hümâyûn on mahzar'', etc. depending on the type of the document.&lt;ref name="koksal"&gt;{{cite web | author= Osman Köksal |title= Osmanlı Hukukunda Bir Ceza Olarak Sürgün ve İki Osmanlı Sultanının Sürgünle İlgili Hattı-ı Hümayunları| url= http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/26/199.pdf | accessdate= 1 December 2010 | language= Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan responded not only to documents submitted to him by his viziers but also to petitions (''arzuhâl'') submitted to him by his subjects following the Friday prayer.&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt; Thus, ''hatt-ı hümayun''s on documents were analogous to [[Papal rescripts]] and [[rescript]]s used in other imperial regimes.

When the sultan contacted the public for Friday prayer or other occasions, people would hand in petitions addressed to him. These were later discussed and decided upon by the council of viziers. They would prepare a summary of all petitions and the action decided upon for each one. The sultan would write on the same sheet "I have been informed" (''manzurum olmuştur'') multiple times, followed by the item number to which he is referring. When palace bureaucracy was reorganized after the [[Tanzimat|Tanzimat reforms]], the Sultan's decision came to be written directly by the Chief Scribe at the bottom of the summary document, and this one writing applied to all decisions.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

== Practices ==
When a petition or memo requiring the Sultan's decision was to be submitted to him, the grand vizier usually prepared an [[executive summary]] (''telhis'') as an attachment. In some cases, rather than prepare a separate summary document, the grand vizier or his deputy would write his summary and views diagonally, on the top or bottom margins of documents coming from lower functionaries (see an example in the first figure above). Such annotations on a written document were called ''derkenar''.&lt;ref name="koksal"/&gt; Sometimes the grand vizier would append a separate cover page on top of a proposal coming from a lower-level functionary like the Treasurer (''[[Defterdar]]'') or the Minister of Defence (''[[Serasker]]''), introducing it as, for example, "this is the proposal of the ''Defterdar''". In such cases, the Sultan would write his ''hatt-ı hümayun'' on the cover page. In other cases, the grand vizier would summarize the matter directly in the margin of the document submitted by the lower functionary and the Sultan would write on the same page as well. Sometimes the Sultan would write his decision on a fresh piece of paper attached to the submitted document.&lt;ref name="koksal"/&gt;

In most cases ''hatt-ı humayun''s were written by the Sultan himself although there exist some that were penned by the chief scribe or another functionary. Important ''hatt-ı humayun''s on the white were sometimes drafted by the head of diplomatic correspondence (''Reis-ül Kuttab'') or the Secretary of Navy (''Kapudan Paşa''). In some cases, there were notations as to who prepared the draft of the document that was then re-written by the Sultan.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

''Hatt-ı hümayun''s usually were not dated, although some, concerning withdrawal of money from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period ''hatt-ı hümayun''s and ''irade''s had dates. [[Abdulhamid I]] was especially inclined to date his ''hatt-ı hümayun''s. His grand vizier [[Koca Yusuf Pasha]], later suggested this practice of dating ''hatt-ı hümayun''s to Abdulhamid's successor [[Selim III]] so that he could follow up whether his orders were carried out. However, this suggestion was not adopted.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt; [[Abdulhamid II]] used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

== Language ==
[[File:I-suleymanin-hatti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Upon note that the [[Minbar]] to be sent to [[Medina]] requires 134 [[kantar]]s of copper, [[Süleyman I]] responds on the top, in his own handwriting, "Be it given."&lt;ref name="tarihvemedeniyet"/&gt;]]
The language of ''hatt-ı hümayun''s on documents generally was a form of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] understandable (orally) even today and has changed little over the centuries.&lt;ref name="koc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ozkaya"&gt;{{cite web | title= III. Selim'in İmparatorluk Hakkındaki Bazı Hatt-ı Hümayunları| author= Yücel Özkaya| url= http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/1150/13507.pdf | accessdate= 1 December 2010 | language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many documents or annotations were short comments such as "I gave" (''verdim''), "be it given" (''verilsin''), "will not happen" (''olmaz''), "be it written" (''yazılsın''), "is clear/is clear to me" (''malûm oldu / malûmum olmuştur''), "provide it" (''tedârük edesin''), "it has come to my sight" (''manzûrum oldu / manzûrum olmuştur''), "be it answered" (''cevap verile''), "record it" (''mukayyet olasın''), "be it supplied"  (''tedârik görülsün''), "be they without need" ("berhûrdâr olsunlar").&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

Some Sultans would write longer comments, starting with "It has become my knowledge" (''Malûmum oldu''), and continue with an introduction on the topic, then give their opinion such as "this report's/petition's/record's/''etc.'' appearance and meaning has become my imperial knowledge"(''"...&amp;nbsp;işbu takrîrin/telhîsin/şukkanın/kaimenin manzûr ve me'azi ma'lûm-ı hümayûnum olmuşdur"''). Some common phrases in hatt-ı hümayuns are "according to this report..." (''işbu telhisin mûcebince''), "the matter is clear" (''cümlesi malumdur''), "I permit" (''izin verdim''), "I give, according to the provided facts" (''vech-i meşruh üzere verdim'').&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt;

''Hatt-ı hümayun''s to the position often had clichéd expressions such as "To be done as required" (''Mûcebince amel oluna'') or "To be done as required, not to be contravened" (''Mûcebince amel ve hilâfından hazer oluna'').&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

''Hatt-ı hümayun''s on the white were more elaborate and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by the Sultan. They often started by addressing the recipient. The Sultan would refer to his grand vizier as "My Vizier", or if his grand vizier was away at war, would refer to his deputy as "[[Kaymakam|Ka'immakâm]] Paşa". Those written to other officials would often start with an expression like "You who are my Vizier of Rumeli, Mehmed Pasha" (''"Sen ki Rumili vezîrim Mehmed Paşa'sın"''). The head of religious affairs ([[Sheikh ul-Islam|Şeyhülislam]]) or the Sultan's personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully. In cases where the ''hatt-ı hümayun'' was to be delivered ceremoniously, with an imperial sword and a cloak, as in an appointment to a high rank, there would be a flowery salutation such as "after I have honored you with my glorious greeting you should know that..." (''seni selâm-ı şâhanemle teşrif eylediğimden sonra malumun ola ki...''). Correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt; A note without an address was meant for the grand vizier or his deputy.&lt;ref name="koksal"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hat5 islambol.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Response (ca. 1788) of [[Selim III]] on a memorandum regarding printing "İslâmbol" instead of "[[Names of Istanbul#Kostantiniyye|Kostantiniye]]" on new coins: "My Deputy Grand Vizier! My imperial decree has been that, if not contrary to current law, the word of Konstantiniye is not to be printed."&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt;]]
The earliest known ''hatt-ı hümayun'' is the one sent by Sultan [[Murad I]] to [[Gazi Evrenos|Evrenos Bey]] in 1386,&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt; commending the commander for his conquests and giving him advice on how to administer people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Murad-ı Hüdavendigâr'dan Gazi Evrenos Bey'e mektup... "Sakın ola kibirlenmeyesin!" | author= Mehmet İnbaşı | work= Tarih ve Düşünce| url=http://tarihvedusunce.esmartweb.com/evrenos.html | accessdate= 10 December 2010 | language= Turkish | date= June 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710201607/http://tarihvedusunce.esmartweb.com/evrenos.html | archivedate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the reign of [[Murad III]], Viziers used to present matters orally to the Sultans, who would then give their consent or denial, also orally. While ''hatt-ı hümayun''s were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as [[Abdülhamid I]], [[Selim III]] and [[Mahmud II]], who wanted to increase their control and be informed of everything.&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt;

The content of ''hatt-ı hümayun''s tends to reflect the power struggle that existed between the Sultan and his council of viziers (the [[Divan]]). The process of using the ''hatt-ı hümayun'' to authorize the actions of the grand vizier came into existence in the reign of Murad III. This led to a loss of authority and independence in the grand vizier while other palace people such as the Master of the [[Harem]] ([[Imperial Harem#Role of the eunuchs|''Harem Ağası'']]) or [[Imperial Harem#Role of the concubines|concubines]] (''cariye'') who had greater access to the Sultan gained in influence. By giving detailed instructions or advice, the Sultans reduced the role of the grand viziers to be just a supervisor to the execution of his commands.&lt;ref name="koc"/&gt; This situation appears to have created some backlash, as during most of the 17th century there were attempts to return to grand viziers' prestige and the power of "supreme proxy" (''vekil-i mutlak'') and over time ''hatt-ı hümayun''s returned to their former simplicity. However, in the eighteenth century, Selim III became concerned by the over-centralization of the bureaucracy and its general inefficacy. He created consulting bodies (''meclis-i meşveret'') to share some of the authority with him and the grand vizier. He would give detailed answers on ''hatt-ı hümayun''s to questions asked of him and would make inquiries as to whether his decisions were followed. The ''hatt-ı hümayun'' became Selim III's tool to ensure rapid and precise execution of his decisions.&lt;ref name="koc"/&gt;

During the reign of Mahmud II, in the early 1830s, the practice of writing on the memoranda of the grand vizier was replaced by the Chief Scribe of the Imperial Office (''Mâbeyn-i Hümâyun Başkatibi'') recording the Sultan's decision.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt; After the [[Tanzimat]], the government bureaucracy was streamlined. For most routine communications, the imperial scribe (''Serkâtib-i şehriyârî'') began to record the spoken will (''irâde'') of the Sultan and thus the ''irâde'' (also called ''irâde-i seniyye'', i.e., "supreme will", or ''irâde-i şâhâne'', i.e., "glorious will") replaced the ''hatt-ı hümayun''. The use of ''hatt-ı hümayun''s on the white between the Sultan and the grand vizier continued on for matters of great importance such as high level appointments or promotions. Infrequently, the grand vizier and the Sultan wrote to each other directly as well.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"&gt;{{cite web |title= Hatt-ı Hümâyun | work=İslam Ansiklopedisi | publisher= Türkiye Diyanet Vakfı |year =1988  | language= Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large number of documents that required the Sultan's decision through either a ''hatt-ı hümayun'' or an ''irade-i senniye'' is considered to be an indication of how centralized the Ottoman government was.&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt; [[Abdülhamid I]] has written himself in one of his ''hatt-ı hümayun''s "I have no time that my pen leaves my hand, with God's resolve it does not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Hüseyin Özdemir  | title= Hatt-ı Humayın  | journal=Sızıntı | year= 2009 | volume=31 | issue=365 | page= 230 |url=http://www.sizinti.com.tr/konular/ayrinti/hatt-i-humayin.html |  accessdate = 29 November 2010 | quote= Benim bir vaktim yokdur ki kalem elimden düşmez. Vallâhü'l-azîm elimden düşmez.| language= Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early ''hatt-ı hümayun''s were written in the [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic styles]] of [[Nastaʿlīq script|tâlik]], ''tâlik kırması'' (a variant of tâlik), [[Naskh (script)|nesih]] and [[Ruq`ah script|riq’a]]. After [[Mahmud II]], they were only written in riq’a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Imperial Fermans | url= http://www.ottomansouvenir.com/General/Ferman.htm | author= Sertaç Kayserilioğlu | accessdate= 23 March 2010 | language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmed III]] and [[Mahmud II]] were skilled penmen and their ''hatt-ı hümayun''s are notable for their long and elaborate annotations on official documents.&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt; In contrast, Sultans who accessed the throne at an early age, such as [[Murad V]] and [[Mehmed IV]] display poor spelling and calligraphy.&lt;ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/&gt;

== Archival ==
''Hatt-ı hümayun''s sent to the grand vizier were handled and recorded at the Âmedi Kalemi, the secretariat of the grand vizier. The Âmedi Kalemi organized and recorded all correspondence between the grand vizier and the Sultan, as well as any correspondence with foreign rulers and with Ottoman ambassadors. Other ''hatt-ı hümayun''s, not addressed to the grand vizier, were stored in other document stores (called ''fon'' in the terminology of current Turkish archivists).&lt;ref name="koc"/&gt;

=== Cut-out ''hatt-ı hümayun''s ===
During the creation of the State Archives in the nineteenth century, documents were organized according to their importance. ''Hatt-ı hümayun''s on the white were considered the most important, along with those on international relations, border transactions and internal regulations. Documents of secondary importance were routinely placed in trunks and stored in cellars in need of repair. Presumably as a sign of respect toward the Sultan,&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt; ''hatt-ı hümayun''s on documents (petitions, reports, ''etc.'') were cut out and stored together with the ''hatt-ı hümayun''s on the white, while the rest of the documents were stored elsewhere.&lt;ref name="hazineievrak"&gt;{{cite web | author= Seyfullah Aslan|  title= Hazine-i Evrakın Kurulması | url= http://muverrih.net/2009/03/13/hazine-i-evrakin-kurulmasi/ | accessdate= 1 December 2010| language= Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cut-out ''hatt-ı hümayun''s were not cross-referenced with the documents to which they referred and were only annotated by the palace office using general terms and an approximate date. Because Sultans were not in the habit of dating their ''hatt-ı hümayun''s until the late period of the empire, in most cases the documents associated with them are not known. Conversely, the decisions on many a memorandum, petition, or request submitted to the Sultan are unknown. The separation of ''hatt-ı hümayun''s from their documents is considered a great loss of information for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=İshak Keskin |title=Osmanlı Arşivciliğinin Teorik Dayanakları Hakkında | journal= Türk Kütüphaneciliği | year= 2007 | volume= 21 | pages = 271–303| url=http://tk.kutuphaneci.org.tr/index.php/tk/article/viewFile/2015/4008| language= Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fatih Rukancı|title=Osmanlı Devleti’nde Arşivcilik Çalışmaları | journal= Türk Kütüphaneciliği | year= 2008 | volume= 22 | pages = 414–434| url= http://tk.kutuphaneci.org.tr/index.php/tk/article/viewFile/2051/4078 | language= Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Archives]] in Istanbul has a special section of "cut-out ''hatt-ı hümayun''s".&lt;ref name="sizinti"/&gt;

===Catalogs===
Today all known ''hatt-ı hümayun''s have been recorded in a computerized database in the [[Ottoman Archives]] of the Turkish Prime Minister (''Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivleri'', or BOA in short) in Istanbul, and they number 95,134.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Yunus Sarinay| title =  Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi Rehberi | work= T.C.

The BOA contains 58,000 ''hatt-ı hümayun''s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Başbakanlık archives | url= http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Basbakanlik_archives | accessdate= 30 November 2010 | language= Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ''hatt-ı hümayun''s were originally not organized systematically, historians in the nineteenth and early twentieth century created several catalogs of ''hatt-ı hümayun''s based on different organizing principles. These historic catalogs are still in use by historians at the BOA:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work= 19.Yüzyıl Türkiye Yönetim Tarihi | title=19.

'''''Hatt-ı Hümâyûn Tasnifi''''' is the catalog of the ''hatt-ı hümayun''s belonging to the Âmedi Kalemi. It consists of 31 volumes listing 62,312 documents, with their short summaries. This catalog lists documents from 1730 to 1839 but covers primarily those from the reigns of Selim III and Mahmud II within this period.

'''''Ali Emiri Tasnifi''''' is a chronological catalog of 181,239 documents organized according to the periods of sovereignty of Sultans, from the foundation of the Ottoman state to the Abdülmecid period. Along with ''hatt-ı hümayun''s, this catalog includes documents on foreign relations.

'''''İbnülemin Tasnifi''''' is a catalog created by a committee led by historian İbnülemin Mahmud Kemal. It covers the period of 1290-1873. Along with 329 ''hatt-ı hümayun''s, it lists documents of various other types relating to palace correspondence, private correspondence, appointments, land grants ([[timar]] and [[zeamet]]), and charitable endowments ([[vakıf]]).

'''''Muallim Cevdet Tasnifi''''' catalogs 216,572 documents in 34 volumes, organized by topics that include local governments, provincial administration, vakıf and internal security.

== The ''Hatt-ı Hümâyun'' of 1856 ==
{{main|Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856}}
Although there exist thousands of ''hatt-ı hümayun''s, [[Hatt-ı Hümayun of 1856|the Imperial Reform Edict]] (or ''Islâhat Fermânı'') of 1856 is well enough known that most history texts refer to it simply as "Hatt-i Hümayun". This decree from Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all, regardless of creed. In ''Düstur'', the Ottoman [[code of law]]s, the text of this [[ferman]] is introduced as "a copy of the supreme ferman written to the grand vizier, perfected by decoration above with a ''hatt-ı hümayun''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Islahata dair taraf-ı Vekâlet-i mutlakaya hitaben balası hatt-ı hümayun ile müveşşeh şerefsadır olan ferman-ı âlinin suretidir | journal= Düstur (Istanbul: Matbaa-i Âmire)| volume= 1 | year=1856 | language= Turkish}} See footnote 4 in: {{cite web|  title= Ottoman Financial Integration with Europe: Foreign Loans, the Ottoman Bank and the Ottoman Public Debt | author= Edhem Eldem | url= http://www.econ.uoa.gr/UA/files/964411180..pdf | accessdate= 5 December 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503174847/http://www.econ.uoa.gr/UA/files/964411180..pdf | archivedate=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, technically this edict was a ''hatt-ı hümayun'' to the rank.

The Reform Decree of 1856 is sometimes referred to by another name,  "The Rescript of Reform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Boğaziçi University, Atatürk Institute of Modern Turkish History | title= Rescript of Reform – Islahat Fermanı (18 February 1856) | url= http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/reform.htm | accessdate= 5 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Shaw, Stanford J. and Gökhan Çetinsaya. | chapter= Ottoman Empire |title=In The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Oxford Islamic Studies Online | url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0611  | accessdate= 5 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the word 'rescript' is used to sense of "edict, decree", not "reply to a query or other document."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Rescript, n |url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/163412?redirectedFrom=rescript# | accessdate= | work=Oxford English Dictionary| date= April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hatt-ı Hümayun'' of 1856 was an extension of another important edict of reform, the [[Hatt-i Sharif|Hatt-i Sharif of Gülhane]] of 1839, and part of the [[Tanzimat]] reforms. That document is also generally referred to as "The Hatt-i Sharif", although there are many other hatt-i sharifs, a term that is synonymous with ''hatt-ı hümayun''.

== The Sultan's script ==
[[File:Iii-ahmedin-hatti.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A non-official ''hatt-ı hümayun'' between [[Ahmed III]] and his grand vizier. "My Vizier. Today where do you intend to go? How is my girl, the piece of my life? Make me happy with news of the health of your holy disposition. My body is in good health, thank be God. Those of my imperial family are in good health as well. Let me know when you know."&lt;ref name="tarihvemedeniyet"/&gt; ]]
The term ''hatt-ı hümayun'' is occasionally used in the literal sense of the handwriting of the Sultan.&lt;ref name="koc"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Hatt-ı Hümâyunların Diplomatik Özellikleri ve Padişahı bilgilendirme Sürecindeki Yerleri | author = Bekir Koç | url= http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/1267/14576.pdf | language= Turkish | journal= OTAM, Ankara Üniversitesi Osmanlı Tarihi Araştırma ve Uygulama Merkezi |pages= 305–313| year=2000 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the imperial poet [[Nef'i]] has written a [[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]] of 22 couplets describing the [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] of Sultan [[Murad IV]], called ''Der-Vasf-ı Hatt-ı Humayun-ı Sultan Murad Han''. The whole poem is a compliment to the writings of the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Klasik Türk Şiirinde Tuğra Ve Bir Edebî Tür Olarak Tuğra | author= Ahmet Topal| journal = Turkish Studies | volume= 4 | issue=2 | pages=1008–1024| year=2009 | url=http://www.turkishstudies.net/sayilar/sayi15/41topalahmet.pdf | accessdate=6 March 2011 | language= Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'''  (1516/1517 – 19 January 1547), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], ([[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]]), an English nobleman, was one of the founders of English [[Renaissance]] poetry. He was a first cousin of both Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] and Queen [[Catherine Howard]], second and fifth wives of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].

==Origins==
He was born in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire,&lt;ref name=tpf&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/henry-howard "Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey", Poetry Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] by his second wife [[Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk|Elizabeth Stafford]], a daughter of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]]. He was thus descended from King Edward I on his father's side and from King Edward III on his mother's side.

==Career==
He was brought-up at [[Windsor Castle]] with [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset]], the illegitimate son of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  He became a close friend, and later a brother-in-law, of Fitzroy following the marriage of his sister to him.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 661&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father and grandfather, he was a brave and able soldier, serving in Henry VIII's French wars as Lieutenant General of the King on Sea and Land.

He was repeatedly imprisoned for rash behaviour, on one occasion for striking a courtier, on another for wandering through the streets of London breaking the windows of houses whose occupants were asleep.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt; He assumed the [[courtesy title]]  [[Earl of Surrey]] in 1524 when his grandfather died and his father became [[Duke of Norfolk]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1532 he accompanied  [[Anne Boleyn]] (his first cousin), King Henry VIII, and the Duke of Richmond to France, staying there for more than a year as a member of the entourage of King [[Francis I of France]]. 1536 was a notable year for Surrey:  his first son was born, namely  [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]] (later 4th Duke of Norfolk), Anne Boleyn was executed on charges of [[adultery]] and treason, and the Duke of Richmond died at the age of 17 and was buried at [[Thetford Abbey]], one of the Howard seats. In 1536 Surrey also served with his father in the suppression of the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], a rebellion against the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Marriage and progeny==
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Frances, Countess of Surrey RL 12214.jpg|thumb|Frances de Vere, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c.&amp;nbsp;1535]]
He married [[Frances de Vere, Countess of Surrey|Frances de Vere]], a daughter of [[John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford]],&lt;ref name=tpf/&gt; (by his wife [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Oxford|Elizabeth Trussell]]) by whom he had two sons and three daughters:
* [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]] (10 March 1536 – 2 June 1572), who married thrice: (1) Mary FitzAlan (2) [[Margaret Audley, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret Audley]] (3) Elizabeth Leyburne.
* [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]], who died unmarried.
* [[Jane Howard, Countess of Westmorland|Jane Howard]], who married [[Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland]].
* Margaret Howard, who married [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton]].
* Katherine Howard, who married [[Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley]].

==Downfall==
[[File:Howard, Earle of Surrey, for which he was attainted.svg|left|thumb|The arms for which Surrey was attainted (Edward the Confessor's arms are in the fifth quarter with a label of three points plain Argent).&lt;ref&gt;Jessie Childs, ''Henry VIII's Last Victim: The Life and Times of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2007), plate 35.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Howards had little regard for the "new men" who had risen to power at court, such as [[Thomas Cromwell]] and the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Seymours]]. Surrey was less circumspect than his father in concealing his disdain. The Howards had many enemies at court.&lt;ref&gt;Jessie Childs, ''Henry VIII's Last Victim: The Life and Times of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'' (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], consumed by [[paranoia]] and increasing illness, became convinced that Surrey had planned to usurp the crown from his son the future King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. The matter came to a head when Surrey [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] the [[attributed arms]] of King [[Edward the Confessor]]. [[John Barlow (priest)|John Barlow]] had once called Surrey "the most foolish proud boy that is in England" and, although the arms of Surrey's ancestor [[Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk]] show that he was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor's arms, doing so was an act of pride. In consequence, the King ordered Surrey's imprisonment and that of his father, sentencing them to death on 13 January 1547. Surrey was [[Beheading|beheaded]] on 19 January 1547 on a charge of treasonably quartering the royal arms. His father survived execution as the king died the day before that appointed for the beheading, but he remained imprisoned. Surrey's son [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]] became heir to the Dukedom of Norfolk in place of his father, which title he inherited on the 3rd Duke's death in 1554.

==Death and burial==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey.jpg|thumb|right|Surrey's [[chest tomb]] in [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham|Framlingham Church]], Suffolk, displaying the arms of Howard and de Vere]]
He was buried in [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham|Framlingham Church]] in Suffolk, where survives his spectacular painted alabaster tomb.

==Literary activity and legacy==
He and his friend [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]] were the first English poets to write in the [[sonnet]] form that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] later used, and Surrey was the first English poet to publish [[blank verse]] (unrhymed [[iambic pentameter]]) in his translation of the second and fourth books of [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]]. 
Together, Wyatt and Surrey, due to their excellent translations of [[Petrarch]]'s sonnets, are known as "Fathers of the English Sonnet". While Wyatt introduced the sonnet into English, it was Surrey who gave them the rhyming meter and the division into quatrains that now characterises the sonnets variously named English, Elizabethan or [[Sonnet#English (Shakespearean) sonnet|Shakespearean sonnets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare-navigators.com/romeo/Sonnet.html The Shakespearean Sonnet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonnets.org/early.htm Sonnets]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28412">In 1994 [[Guatemala]]'s Commission for Historical Clarification - '''La Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico (CEH)''' - was created as a response to the thousands of atrocities and human rights violations committed during the decades long civil war that began in 1962 and ended in the late 1990s with [[United Nations]]-facilitated peace accords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mersky|first1=Marcie|title=Human Rights In Negotiating Peace Agreements: Guatemala.|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=The International Council on Human Rights Policy|location=Belfast|page=3|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission operated under a two year mandate, from 1997 to 1999, and employed three commissioners: one Guatemalan man, one male non-national, and one [[Mayan people|Mayan]] woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Institute of Peace|title=Truth Commission: Guatemala|url=http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-guatemala|website=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate of the commission was not to judge but to clarify the past with "objectivity, equity and impartiality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other things, the commission revealed that over 200,000 people were killed or [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] during the conflict and attributed 93% of the violations to state forces and related paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission noted that during the conflict the distinction between combatant and non-combatant was not respected and as a result many children, priests, indigenous leaders, and innocent women and men were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=11–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEH aimed to instill national harmony, promote peace, foster a culture of mutual respect regarding human rights, and preserve the memory of the conflict's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of the Conflict ==
Guatemala is a multiethnic, [[Pluriculturalism|pluricultural]] and multilingual nation and has been plagued by violence and exclusion directed at the poorest and most vulnerable, specifically the indigenous [[Mayan people|(Mayan)]] communities. A colonial legacy left power in the hands of an elite minority, much like many other Latin American countries. Repression was omnipresent — specifically with regards to insurgent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Guatemala's democratically elected [[Jacobo Árbenz|President Jacobo Árbenz]] was overthrown by a U.S.backed right-wing military dictator, [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], in a military [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|coup d'etat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gleijeses|first1=Piero|title=Shattered Hope: The Guatemalan Revolution and the United States, 1944–1954|date=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press.|location=Princeton|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Ticchi|first2=Davide|last3=Vindigni|first3=Andrea|title=A theory of military dictatorships.

There is a plethora of root causes of Guatemala's 36 year civil war. Guatemala's economy, heavily based on coffee and sugar exports, relied on the exploitation of indigenous labour and land. A democratic regime and Marxist insurgencies posed a direct threat to the political and economic elite as well as their main trading partner — the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keen|first1=David|title=Demobilising Guatemala|date=2003|publisher=Crisis States Research Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science|location=London, UK|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the state magnified the military threat posed by the insurgency and launched attacks that lead to civilian massacres and violations of human rights of any suspected "supporters" of the guerrilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, under a [[Cold War]] context, anti-communist sentiment permeated the U.S. - Guatemalan discourse and thus counterinsurgency against the Marxist insurgency groups was more severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keen|first1=David|title=Demobilising Guatemala|date=2003|publisher=Crisis States Research Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science|location=London, UK|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The CEH ==

=== Creation ===
In June 1994 the Guatemalan government and the URNG, under advisory by the UN Secretary General and the [[MINUGUA|United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala]] (MINUGUA), signed the "Agreement on the establishment of the Commission to clarify past human rights violations and acts of violence that have caused the Guatemalan population to suffer," which led to the creation of the CEH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED NATIONS VERIFICATION MISSION IN GUATEMALA MINUGUA|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/minugua.htm|website=United Nations Peacekeeping Operations|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from pressure from the UN Secretary General to work towards truth and reconciliation, the road to the CEH was influenced by the Catholic Church — specifically when it created the Human Rights Office of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Guatemala|Archdiocese of Guatemala]] (ODHA) in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mersky|first1=Marcie|title=Human Rights In Negotiating Peace Agreements: Guatemala.|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=The International Council on Human Rights Policy|location=Belfast|page=3|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandate ===
With a belief that uncovering the truth would make national reconciliation a possibility and authentic democracy a reality, the CEH aimed not to judge but to clarify the past with "objectivity, equity and impartiality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission aimed to ask and answer questions such as: 
* Why were civilians — particularly Mayans — targeted? 
* Why did defenceless children suffer? 
* Why were basic rules of humanitarian law ignored or not respected?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instillation of national harmony, promotion of peace, the creation of a culture of mutual respect regarding human rights and the preservation of the memory of the victims was of paramount importance to the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemalans and external actors in favour of the commission's work wanted to record Guatemala's bloody past. There is awareness with regards to the systematic violation of human rights during the civil war, but the acts committed and their consequences have yet to become entrenched in the national consciousness and historical memory of Guatemalans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commission Logistics ===
The commission's duration lasted two years, from February 1997 to February 1999. Its three commissioners were:
* German law professor [[Christian Tomuschat]], of Berlin's Humboldt University, named by the UN Secretary-General to chair the CEH
* [[Otilia Lux|Otilia Lux de Coti]], a Mayan scholar nominated by Tomuschat with the agreement of the parties
* Edgar Alfredo Balsells Tojo, a lawyer also nominated by Tomuschat with the agreement of the parties
The process of the commission was complex and was by no means solely a national effort. Throughout the two year mandate of the commission, multiple countries — including Austria, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom — provided monetary, political and moral support. The U.S. provided declassified documents crucial to the commission, and the UN Secretary General promoted the project and facilitated the contribution of monetary resources and expert knowledge through various UN bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission, as outlined in its charter, was to be composed of the current moderator of the peace negotiations (appointed by the UN Secretary General), one Guatemalan citizen (appointed by the aforementioned moderator and agreed upon by both parties), and one academic (selected by the monitor from a list comprised by Guatemalan university presidents and approved by both parties).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naciones Unidas|title=Acuerdo sobre el establecimiento de la Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico de las violaciones a los derechos humanos y los hechos de violencia que han causado sufrimientos a la población guatemalteca.|date=1994|publisher=Naciones Unidas|location=Nueva York}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the investigations, the commission had a staff of 269 and 14 field offices. The staff consisted of both national, and international commissioners — who accounted for just under half of employees. By the end of the CEH's duration, 2000 communities had been visited and testimonies were received from approximately 20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=CEH|title=Informe Final: Mandato y Procedimientos|date=1999|publisher=CEH|location=Guatemala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restrictions ===
The restrictions of the Commission were as follows: responsibility could not be attributed to any individual — naming names was not allowed; the findings and conclusions of the CEH could not have judicial repercussions; and the commission would have a six-month mandate — extendable to 18 months. The final restriction was not upheld as the commission duration lasted two years. In addition, the CEH had no subpoena powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mersky|first1=Marcie|title=Human Rights In Negotiating Peace Agreements: Guatemala.|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=The International Council on Human Rights Policy|location=Belfast|page=3|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presentation ===
The CEH's report, Memory of Silence (Memoria del Silencio) was presented in February 1999 in a 12 volume report to representatives of the URNG and the Guatemalan government as well as [[Kofi Annan]], the UN Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Institute of Peace|title=Truth Commission: Guatemala|url=http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-guatemala|website=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=CEH|title=Informe Final: Mandato y Procedimientos|date=1999|publisher=CEH|location=Guatemala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is available online for public access in both English and Spanish.

== Report Findings ==
For the CEH it was clear that in order to understand the past and move forward on a trajectory for peace, an in-depth analysis of the causes of the civil war was required. They concluded that the four main causes of the conflict were as follows: Structural injustice, closing of free, public spaces, anti-democracy trajectory, Cold War context and international influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEH also investigated Guatemala's systemic problems. They concluded that the structure and nature of economic, cultural and social relations in Guatemala are marked by profound exclusion, antagonism and conflict — a reflection of its colonial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they found the absence of effective state social policy to have accentuated the historical dynamic of exclusion. In fact, they state, most recent state policy has produced inequality and endemic institutional weakness perpetuates the discrepancies among demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the conflict, civil and political rights were suppressed and public venues were closed to prevent the spread of anti-government sentiment and other revolutionary thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the armed conflict, the incapacity of the state to deal with political instability led to the creation of an intricate system of repression including an underground, illegal punitive system. Military intelligence was the conflict's driving force. Impunity permeated Guatemala's political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Rights Violations: Statistics ===
The principal focus on the CEH was with regards to human rights violations during the civil war. They registered a total of 42,275 casualties by human rights violations and acts of violence, of that 23,671 were victims of arbitrary execution and 6,159 by forced disappearance. Estimates of those killed or disappeared during the conflict reach as high as 200,000. In terms of demographics, the CEH found that 83% of "fully identified" victims were Mayan and 17% [[Ladino people|Ladino]]. 93% of the violations were attributed to state forces and related paramilitary groups and 3% to insurgency groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the victims of arbitrary execution, forced disappearance, torture, rape and other violations of fundamental rights were children, priests, indigenous leaders as well as non-combatant women and men with no ties to insurgency groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recommendations  ==
The CEH highlighted seven main recommendations for Guatemala's government as it embarked upon a path of peace and reconciliation. These recommendations were created in accordance with the UN draft "Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations for Victims of Violation of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law" (E/CN.4/Sub2/1996/17).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Primer acerdo sobre las PAC abre expectativas|journal=Inforpress Centroamericana|issue=995|pages=7–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Take measures to preserve the memory of the victims
# Those responsible for the crimes should assume responsibility 
# Restoration of material possessions and economic compensation 
# Conduct investigations into all known forced disappearances 
# Creation of an immediate exhumation policy of all victims' remains 
#  Foster mutual respect and observance of human rights 
# Strengthen the democratic process (judicial and military reform)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=48–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the recommendations the CEH highlights the need for indigenous political participation.

== Aftermath  ==
=== Implementation of Recommendations ===

The Guatemalan army was opposed to many human rights aspects of the 1996 Peace Accords including the creation and work of the CEH. They argued that these tools were to be used by the insurgency groups to garner political support and military strength. However, support for human rights focused accords and commissions were strongly supported by the URNG, the Catholic Church, and various civil society and human rights based groups. Problems the commission faced were primarily based on political and ideological disagreements. In fact, although the CEH finally came to fruition, its progress was stalled when the army stated its clear opposition to the commission and the URNG affirmed its inclusion as non-negotiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mersky|first1=Marcie|title=Human Rights In Negotiating Peace Agreements: Guatemala.|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=The International Council on Human Rights Policy|location=Belfast|page=3|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the report was released in 1999, progress has been made with regards to compliance of the aforementioned recommendations. In 2000 Guatemala ratified the [[Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons|Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearances]], the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights regarding social economic and cultural rights, and the Optional Protocol of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In 2002 it ratified the Optional Protocol of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], regarding the participation of children in armed conflicts and the recognition of the competence of the [[United Nations Convention against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] to receive individual complaints in 2003. Although these accords have been signed and ratified, their content has yet to be integrated into current and future domestic plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mersky|first1=Marcie|title=Human Rights In Negotiating Peace Agreements: Guatemala.|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=The International Council on Human Rights Policy|location=Belfast|page=3|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 2003, 20 years after the majority of human rights violations occurred, a National Reparations Program was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mersky|first1=Marcie|title=Human Rights In Negotiating Peace Agreements: Guatemala.|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=The International Council on Human Rights Policy|location=Belfast|page=3|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the CEH's statement that the state was obligated to investigate crimes committed during the conflict, [[Efraín Ríos Montt|José Efraín Ríos Montt]]— former military dictator — was tried and convicted for genocide and crimes against humanity. However, for multiple reasons his trial was suspended until January 2015, then further suspended until January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kearns|first1=Rick|title=Closed genocide trial for former Guatemalean President in 2015|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/15/genocide-trial-guatemalan-president-2016-behind-closed-doors-161749|website=Indian Country Today|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guatemala Background: Justice Delayed|url=https://www.ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/guatemala|website=International Center for Transitional Justice|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Menchu|first1=Sofia|last2=McCool|first2=Grant|title=Genocide trial for Guatemala ex-dictator Rios Montt suspended|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-trial-idUSKCN0UP21F20160111|newspaper=Reuters|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed-door trial began in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Guatemala-Rios-Montt-Judgement-Scheduled-for-Wednesday--20160315-0042.html|title=Guatemala: Rios Montt Judgement Scheduled for Wednesday|last=|first=|date=15 March 2016|work=Telesur|access-date=9 April 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rios Montt died while the trial was still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/obituaries/efrain-rios-montt-guatemala-dead.html|title=Efraín Ríos Montt, Guatemalan Dictator Convicted of Genocide, Dies at 91|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womensmediacenter.com/women-under-siege/an-alternative-obituary-for-efrain-rios-montt|title=An alternative obituary for Efraín Ríos Montt  - Women’s Media Center|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques and Controversy ===
One of the most controversial revelations of the commission was its statement that at no time during the conflict did guerrilla groups have the military potential to pose an immediate threat to the state or its army. The state was well aware that the insurgency did not represent a real threat to Guatemalan political order. It has been argued that they deliberately magnified the military threat of the insurgency to justify the crimes they committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the several years following the release of the CEH's report, scholars have analysed its effectiveness in preventing conflict and creating national harmony as highlighted in the commission's mandate. Jeff Corntassel and Cindy Holder argue that state-facilitated truth mechanisms are fundamentally flawed if they do not address historic and ongoing injustices against indigenous groups — this is particularly relevant in Guatemala considering 83% of the victims in the conflict were indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Clarification Commission (CEH)|title=Guatemala: Memory of silence|date=1999|publisher=Historical Clarification Commission|location=Guatemala City|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corntassel|first1=Jeff|last2=Holder|first2=Cindy|title=Who's sorry now? Government apologies, truth commissions, and Indigenous self-determination in Australia, Canada, Guatemala, and Peru|journal=Human Rights Review|date=2008|volume=9|issue=4|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Rachel Sieder has investigated judicial reform and violence in postwar Guatemala and states that homicide rates in fact were higher in 2011 than during the height of the armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sieder|first1=Rachel|title=Contested sovereignties: Indigenous law, violence and state effects in postwar Guatemala|journal=Critique of Anthropology|date=2011|volume=31|issue=3|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the CEH is highly contested, however it has seen successes — particularly with the opening of spaces like 'La casa de la memoria' which exist to preserve the memory of the conflict's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sebastián|first1=Sandra|title=Casa de la Memoria|url=https://www.plazapublica.com.gt/content/casa-de-la-memoria|website=Plaza Pública}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The bill==

To amend the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to exclude industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and House of Representatives of the United States of America in [[United States Congress|Congress]] assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the `Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2009'.
SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP FROM DEFINITION OF MARIJUANA.

Paragraph (16) of section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(16)) is amended--
(1) by striking `(16)' at the beginning and inserting `(16)(A)'; and
(2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
`(B) The term `marihuana' does not include industrial hemp. As used in the preceding sentence, the term `[[industrial hemp]]' means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration that does not exceed 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.'.
SEC. 3. INDUSTRIAL HEMP DETERMINATION TO BE MADE BY STATES.

Section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
`(i) Industrial Hemp Determination To Be Made by States- In any criminal action, civil action, or administrative proceeding, a State regulating the growing and processing of industrial hemp under State law shall have exclusive authority to determine whether any such plant meets the concentration limitation set forth in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (16) of section 102 and such determination shall be conclusive and binding.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2009|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1866:|work=Bill Text 111th Congress (2009-2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] is the beginning of constriction for the growth of marijuana in the United States. An extremely high tax was placed on marijuana; making it nearly impossible to grow industrial hemp. However, congress expected the production of industrial hemp to continue, but the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] lumped industrial hemp with marijuana and its successor, the [[US Drug Enforcement Administration]], continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hemp Facts|url=http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/hemp_facts.html|work=NAIHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{NPOV section|date=December 2014}}
The United States is the only developed country which still bans the growth of industrial hemp. 16 states have passed pro-hemp [[legislation]].{{cn|date=June 2015}}

The inability of US farmers to legally cultivate hemp, makes them unable to compete in the [[global market]], contribute to the reduction of the [[trade deficit]] and benefit the local market by providing jobs in various industries such as food, auto parts, clothing, and other various industries.

United States companies and industries which sell products made with hemp include  Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, most of the bird seed sold in the U.S., and even the automobile companies [[Ford]] and [[BMW]], historically and currently, experimented with hemp materials in their vehicles. Hemp food manufacturers such as French Meadow Bakery, Hempzels, Living Harvest, Nature's Path and Nutiva now make their products from Canadian hemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votehemp.com/PR/02-13-07_federal_bill.html |title=News: Press Releases: 2-13-07 |publisher=Vote Hemp |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These industries would no longer have to import hemp from other countries to produce these products.

National Drug Control Policies oppose this legislation as it is believed that hemp plants could provide cover during cultivation for marijuana plants.&lt;ref name="guardian2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Luscombe in Miami |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/29/usa.richardluscombe |title=Californians to defy US hemp ban on 'environment friendly' cash crop &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2006-08-29|accessdate=2011-04-15 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2006"/&gt;

==Ruling of proposed bill==

This legislation, the [[Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2005]] and the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2007, were introduced, referred to committee, and no additional legislative action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2009|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1866|work=govtrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Currently, the word "marijuana" is the accepted spelling. However, "marihuana" was the correct spelling and most commonly used form in early [[Federal Government of the United States]] documents. That is why, as stated in the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], marijuana is spelled "marihuana;" to maintain consistency across government documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luscombe|first=Richard|title=Californians to defy US hemp ban on 'environment friendly' cash crop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/29/usa.richardluscombe|work=Guardian.co.uk|location=London|date=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3437">The '''Israeli Institute of Commercial Arbitration''' (IICA; {{lang-he|המוסד לבוררות עסקית}}) was founded in 1991 by the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce.  The IICA is generally considered the leading [[arbitration]]  institution in [[Israel]].

== History ==

The late Prof. Smadar Ottolenghi was one of the founders of the IICA, and she served as its first President for nearly thirteen years.  The current President of the IICA is the Honorable Judge (Retired)  Ayala Procaccia.  The prior President (through 2012) was [[Amnon Straschnov]].  

In addition to providing arbitration services, the IICA also provides [[mediation]] services.

The IICA’s list of arbitrators and mediators includes those from different backgrounds and disciplines:  retired Israeli judges, lawyers, accountants, engineers, appraisers, and economists. 

From 1991 until 2007, the IICA maintained only one set of arbitration rules, in Hebrew (the General Rules).  In 2007, the IIICA adopted a special set of rules, in English, for international disputes (the International Rules).&lt;ref&gt;Sherby, Eric (2008). "Israel's New International Arbitration Rules" ''NYSBA International Law Practicum''21(1) (hereinafter, "Sherby Article"), 39. &lt;/ref&gt;  

The chairman of the IICA Rules Committee (which drafted the General Rules) is Advocate David Golan.  The principal draftsman of the IICA's International Rules was Advocate Eric Sherby.

== Unique Features of General (Domestic) Rules ==

Throughout the world, the lack of appealability is generally considered one of the drawbacks of arbitration.  One of the unique aspects of the IICA's General Rules is that it addresses the concern as to appealability.  In 2004, the IICA amended the General Rules to allow the parties to an arbitration to agree on an appellate level to review the award of the arbitrator(s). The appellate procedure does not have any effect on the parties' rights under Israeli law to file a motion to confirm an arbitral award (or a motion to cancel/vacate an arbitral award) under Israeli law. 

The IICA is believed to be one of very few arbitral institutions globally that has adopted an institutional procedure for appealing arbitral awards.  

== Unique Features of International Rules ==

The IICA's International Rules are not like the UNCITRAL Rules.  The IICA's International Rules provide that, whenever an arbitration agreement is in English, absent the parties' agreement otherwise, the language of the arbitration will be English.  In such respect, the IICA is believed to be the only national arbitral institution (in a country where English is not an official language) to provide for English as the "default" language of arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Sherby Article, at 39. &lt;/ref&gt;   

The International Rules generally respect the parties' pre-dispute agreement to use multiple arbitrators, subject to the party's prompt notification of the desire for a multiple arbitrator adjudication. &lt;ref&gt;Sherby Article, at 39. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The IICA's International Rules also provide that certain rulings concerning a claim of privilege that relies upon substantive law other than Israeli law may be appealed to the President of the IICA.

'''Jury''' or '''juror research''' is an umbrella term for the use of research methods in an attempt to gain some understanding of the juror experience in the courtroom and how jurors individually and collectively come to a determination about the 'guilt' or otherwise of the accused.

==Brief history==
Historically, juries have played a significant role in the determination of issues that could not be managed via 'general social interactions' or ones which required punitive measures, retribution and/or compensation. The role of jurors and juries however, has changed over the centuries and have generally been moulded by social and cultural forces embedded in the wider communities in which they have evolved.&lt;ref name= "Richardson"&gt;[Richardson, C.R. (2007). [https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/187be0fc-0a99-5e1c-ecb0-07f556d1777a/1/02Whole.pdf Symbolism in the Courtroom: An examination of the influence of non-verbal cues in a District Court Setting on juror ability to focus on the evidence]. VDM: Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; "Although the role of juries and jurors has a somewhat chequered history, 'the jury, in one form or the other, became the formal method of proof of the guilt or [otherwise] of a person on trial{{'"}},&lt;ref name= "Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Qld Law Reform Commission"&gt;[http://www.qlrc.qld.gov.au/reports/r35.pdf], (1985), Brisbane, Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and juries remain one of the 'cornerstones' of the criminal justice system in many countries.&lt;ref name="Findlay"&gt;[Findlay, M. (1988) The role of the jury in a fair trial. In M. Findlay &amp; P. Duff (Eds.). The jury under attack (pp. 140-160). North Ryde. Butterworths]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however, many debates about the efficacy of the jury system and the ability of jurors to adequately determine the guilt or otherwise of the accused.  Some argue that lay individuals are incapable of digesting the often complex forensic evidence presented during a trial, others argue that any misunderstanding of the evidence is a flaw in legal cross examination and summing up. Many observe that the juror and the accused seldom can be considered 'peers' which is historically considered a fundamental precept of jury makeup. Others consider the jury system to be inherently flawed as a result of the humanity of jurors. They cite incidents in which the Judiciary have become aware of Juror assumptions made in the absence of supporting evidence, the unidentified effect on Jurors of stereotyping, culture, gender, age, education etc., which can and have influenced their ability to make a decision from an objective stance. These arguments and debates are founded in legal and psychological practice and made by social scientists and legal practitioners,&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Findlay &amp; Duff"&gt;[Findlay, M. &amp; Duff, P. (Eds.). (1988) The jury under attack. North Ryde. Butterworths]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;[Kerr, JF. (1987). A presumption of wisdom: An exposé of the jury system of injustice. North Ryde. Angus &amp; Robinson]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moran &amp; Comfort"&gt;[Moran, G. Comfort, JC. (1982). Scientific juror selection:Sex as a moderator of demographic and personality predictors of empanelled felony juror behaviour. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 43(5), pp.1052-1063&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reifman, Gusick &amp; Ellsworth"&gt;[ Reifman, A., Guick, S.M. &amp; Ellsworth, P.C. (1992) Real jurors' understanding of the law in real cases. Journal of Law &amp; Human Behaviour. 16 (5), pp539-554]&lt;/ref&gt;

The juror however has a very personal and different perspective.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;  The role played by the juror is an extraordinary one which is distinctive with minimal resemblance to  their 'normal daily experiences/activities'. In effect the juror is plucked from their life, sometimes for considerable periods of time, they are deposited into an environment about which they generally have little knowledge or ability to negotiate, the language and behaviours of which are foreign and they are expected to make sense of their internal and external environments.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt; As a result of their jury experience many in Australia and New Zealand have reported feeling stressed, anxious, frustrated, overwhelmed and a variety of other emotions, cognitions and behaviours which to varying degrees surprised them.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deborah Wilson Consulting Services"&gt;[ (2000) Regional reports survey of Queensland Jurors, Brisbane, Author]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young, Cameron &amp; Tinsley"&gt;[ Young, W., Cameron, N. &amp; Tinsley, Y. (1999a) Juries in criminal trials: A discussion paper. Preliminary paper 37, Volume 1. Wellington N.Z. Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young et al"&gt;[ Young, W., Cameron, N. &amp; Tinsley, Y. (1999b) Juries in criminal trials: A summary of research findings Preliminary paper 37, Volume 2. Wellington N.Z. Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The above factors are but a few of the many and varied variables that can impose on the juror when in the Courtroom and/or the Juryroom. Such a complex and unique experience is the jury deliberation process the outcome of which is profound and potentially lethal. Quite rightfully therefore,  the focus on jury research by legal professionals and social scientists has become, in the last 50 years or so a burgeoning area of investigation.

==Research methods==

As can be seen from the above, there are a number of reasons juries and jurors have become the target of investigation by legal practitioners and social scientists. Often overlooked is that correlation between the focus of investigation role played in the criminal justice system of the investigator or instructing organisation/individual(s) funding the research. The terms of reference, for example, for jury research performed on behalf of a trial lawyer seeking a beneficial outcome for his or her client,&lt;ref name="Courson &amp; Ausburn"&gt;[http://www.lookingglassjuries.com/images/corson-ausburn-taylor-english-article.pdf], Courson, G. &amp; Ausgurn, D., (2011), Taking the guesswork out of case assessment.&lt;/ref&gt; will most probably differ to those of a psychologist investigating the influence of say gender, demographic and personality variables on trial outcomes,&lt;ref name="Moran &amp; Comfort" /&gt; which again will most probably differ from an examination by concerned members of the Judiciary about the ability of jurors to understand the legal argument, complex forensic evidence and instructions by the legal representatives in the courtroom,.&lt;ref name="Kerr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reifman et al"&gt;[Reifman, A., Guick, S.M. &amp; Ellsworth, P.C. (1992) Real jurors' understanding of the law in real cases. Journal of Law &amp; Human Behaviour. 16 (5), pp539-554]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly methodology will differ depending on terms of reference, level of peer review, experience and ability of researchers and attitudes of funding organisations. Today, there are many companies and individuals providing services as jury consultants or trial strategists [See for example [http://juryresearchinstitute.com/services/], [http://www.magnals.com/jury_consulting.shtml] &amp; [http://www.lookingglassjuries.com/] for links to three randomly selected organisations that provide such services]. Jury consultants use market research techniques in an attempt to bolster the client's chances of a positive outcome by 'gaining an understanding of the current and environment/location specific trends that might impact the attitudes of jurors. Their job is to shape trial team strategy so as to moderate or take advantage of jurors' preexisting beliefs and experiences by way of how the evidence is presented.  Regular market research techniques are used in such instances (e.g., phone surveys, focus groups, feedback sessions etc.). Surrogate or mock jurors are selected carefully so that they are statistically representative of the 'general population in the particular  region'  and they are presented relevant information, visual exhibits, witness statements, legal cases, timelines etc. in an attempt to elicit a variety of responses, thus allowing the lawyers to prepare adequately for any possibility before it causes difficulty to their case. Jury consultants also use pre-trial techniques such as focus groups when preparing for settlement negotiations. Post-trial juror interviews sometimes allow for better understanding of mistakes or good arguments made in a trial, and that knowledge could be used for future trials or for an appeal. A recent innovation in this type of research is using electronic resources where lawyers 'pitch their submissions to online jurors'. More information about this resource can be found by following this link [http://www.lookingglassjuries.com/]. Also on these pages are papers which outline some of the perceived benefits of this type of research along with the issues which are still topics of debate.

Jury consultancy is a growing industry{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and one which uses current technologies in innovative ways{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. However, this type of investigation makes up a relatively small proportion of Jury Research, the balance of which is generally conducted by psychologists, criminologists and other interested social scientists. As indicated above [[#Brief history|in discussions about the personal perspective of jurors]], the interaction between the juror and other jurors, the Courtroom environment, etc. is extraordinarily complex and unusual in that the behaviours and expectations of jurors performing jury duty are different from everyday experiences. The tools of the social scientist have evolved over recent decades thus allowing more variables to be considered when investigating phenomena. This is augmented by the continuous development of computer programs that can perform complex multivariate and multilevel analyses of data and models. Nonetheless, flaws inherent in social research must be considered, identified and moderated, and this is particularly relevant in Jury research.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Jury research can be done with 'real jurors' or 'mock jurors'. Each of these methods have their downfalls and each provides a different slant on the juror experience.

Access to 'real jurors' is difficult to attain, and observation of jurors whilst performing their duty is prohibited for a variety of reasons, the most prominent of which is a reluctance to allow any imposition on the jurors whilst performing their duty, which might affect the trial's result. As such access to jurors, if allowed, is generally after they have been dismissed which raises difficulties with issues such as memory distortion, overload from stress or other factors which were more pertinent to the juror while on the jury; inability to recognise the influence of demographic factors on their deliberations, etc. These are all factors or variables which are difficult to tease out of the data, but the influence of which can be adjusted in the analysis of the data if the model is theoretically  sound.

Research on mock jurors does not provide an avenue for the investigation of the 'Gestalt' of the juror experience. Mock Jurors are not 'in the midst of the experience', they are not imposed upon by the reality that the future of the person sitting before them will in some respects be influenced by them, their ability to concentrate, their attention to detail, their ability to negotiate with other jurors, and other factors which do impose on 'real jurors'.  Although mock juror research may be sufficient for examinations of the general attitudes and beliefs of a community by jury consultants{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, when investigating the nuances of the internal processes involved in deliberating an outcome of a Court matter, mock jury research techniques fall short in terms of validity. However, again, Mock jury research has provided a significant pool of investigative pursuits and "since the 1970s as a result of considerable debate surround the issues associated with simulated research, the design and methodological parameters of simulated jury research have been made more robust.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;

'''''Kelly v Solari''''' (1841) 9 M&amp;W 54, 152 ER 24 is an early common law case, where the principle of [[unjust enrichment]] underpinned the decision of the court.

==Facts==
Mr Solari died. His widow claimed under his life insurance policy as executrix. The insurers later found they were not in fact liable to pay because he had not paid a premium instalment. The policy had been marked lapsed, but the office had not checked.

==Judgment==
The [[Exchequer of Pleas|Court of Exchequer]] held that the widow was bound to repay. Her lack of fault was irrelevant or that the insurers were careless.

[[James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale|Parke B]], said if the money, 

{{Cquote|is paid under the impression of the truth or a fact which is untrue, it may, generally speaking, be recovered back, however careless the party paying may have been, in omitting to use due diligence to inquire into the fact. In such a case the receiver was not entitled to it, nor intended to have it.}}

[[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Rolfe B]] said to the fact that Mrs Solari was innocent ‘it cannot be otherwise than unconscientious to retain it.’ (i.e. the money).

'''Lange v Atkinson''' [1997] 2 NZLR 22 (HC), [1998] 3 NZLR 424 (CA), [2000] 1 NZLR 257 (PC), [2000] 3 NZLR 385 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding [[defamation]] claims in [[tort]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Joe Atkinson, a political columnist, wrote an article critical of Former Prime Minister [[David Lange]] and the 4th Labour Government which was published in North and South magazine.

Lange found the article defamatory, and sued Atkinson, and the magazines publisher ACP for defamation, upon which they filed a defence of qualified privilege.

Lange spent the next 4 years trying to get their defence struck out.

The Court of Appeal's final hearing in Lange v Atkinson (No. 2) remains the leading case on the law of qualified privilege in New Zealand and affirmed that qualified privilege extends to publications concerning the conduct of publicly elected officeholders and those seeking such office.

Footnote: Besides featuring in NZ case law for defamation, David Lange also featured in Australian defamation case law in [[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (1997) 189 CLR 520; 145 ALR 96 (HCA)

Beginning on 2 March 1947, [[martial law]] was enforced by the British military for 15 days in Jewish sectors of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. The crackdown was known as Operation Hippo in the greater Tel-Aviv region and as Operation Elephant in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=192}}

The implementation of statutory martial law came the day after eight terrorist attacks had been carried out by the [[Zionist]] militant organizations the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (militant group)|Lehi]] against British vehicles, installations, and personnel. The attacks were conceived as part of a response to strict security measures implemented by Britain and the country's referral of the Mandate to the [[United Nations]]. The deadliest incident, on 1 March, occurred at the British Officers' Club in [[Jerusalem]] which was bombed and subsequently became the site of a gunfight. Twenty British soldiers were killed.

The British High Commissioner implemented martial law the following day in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of Jerusalem and [[Tel-Aviv]], as well as other cities; the declaration affected civil services and governing. British soldiers arrested suspects throughout Palestine before martial law was lifted on 17 March. Throughout its duration, clashes between British personnel and Zionist militants continued. During the period of martial law, British troops in Jerusalem killed two Jewish civilians, including a 4-year-old child.

== Background ==
The [[Bevin Plan]] proposed by Great Britain which foresaw a binational state with cantonal arrangements that would permit strong regional autonomy had been rejected by both sides in early 1947, with the Jewish representatives claiming all of the land with the exception of the hills of the West Bank, and asking for an influx of 100,000 Jews for the first two years, to establish a Jewish majority. Likewise the Arab delegation rejected the plan, asking only that the British leave Palestine. When warned this would lead to a bloodbath, with [[Ernest Bevin|Bevin]] noting that the Jews were in a stronger military position than the Arabs, they trusted that the [[League of Arab States]] would balance the equation.{{efn|"Le lendemain, la délégation sioniste exprime oralement ces revendications: la totalité du pays à l'exception des collines cisjordaniennes... Dans les jours qui suivent, une ultime négotiation a lieu. Les sionistes se montrent prêts à une continuation du mandate pour une période de dix ans avec les 100 000 immigrants pour les deux premières années, puis la capacité économique d'absorption.. Les délégations arabes rejettent les propositions britanniques. Bevin leur demande cer qu'ils attendent de la puissance mandataire. Il lui est répondu: son depart de la Palestine. Bevin les adjure de prendre en compte le rapport des forces, qui est en faveur des Juifs. Il y aura un bain de sang. Les Arabs palestiniens se montrent confiants, il sauront affronter la situation avec éventuellement l'aide de la Ligue des États arabes."{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=574}}}} Given the impasse, Bevin left a decision in the hands of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], in the belief that the numbers there would hinder any partition plan, and lead the parties back to the only reasonable solution, in Great Britain's view, namely that outlined in the Bevin Plan.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|pp=575–576}} The Zionists believed the British were stalling for time, and the [[Jewish Agency]] made efforts in the meantime to round up international assent to the establishment of a Jewish state, while multiplying facts on the ground by creating new settlements, increasing [[Aliyah Bet]] operations and leaving the dissident Jewish organisations to increase attacks against British forces.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=576}}

By February 1947–in response to political unrest and the kidnappings of British officials–the British government evacuated women, children, and non-essential male civilians from [[Mandatory Palestine]]; later in the month, Britain announced its intent to terminate the Mandate, referring the matter of the future of Palestine to the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Golani|2013|pp=186–188}} All British soldiers and policemen still stationed in the Mandate were subsequently concentrated into security zones in major cities.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=82}} In a secret order on 10 February, which represented a change in tactics, the Zionist militant organization [[Irgun]] considered everyone British an enemy, no matter what position they held.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=82}} The security measures led to Arab unrest in the Mandate and an increase in purchases of black market goods–an "indication of preparations for trouble".{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=83}}

===Attacks that triggered the imposition of martial law===
On 1 March, the Irgun and [[Lehi (militant group)|Lehi]] coordinated a wave of terrorist attacks{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=576}} targeting British personnel throughout the Mandate.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=83}} The organizations claimed that the attacks were in response to Britain's heightened security and their referral of the Mandate to the United Nation.{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=192}} Eight incidents took place on the day; the militants made use of land mines, mortars, and explosives to destroy military vehicles, installations, and personnel.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=83}}

The deadliest incident –perpetrated by the Irgun– targeted the Goldsmith British Officers' Club in Jerusalem.  The building had living quarters in the upper floors.{{sfn|''The Sunday Telegraph''|1947}} It was the first terrorist attack on a Saturday, the Jewish [[Sabbath]].{{sfn|''The Morning Bulletin''|1947}} A Jewish girl who was the receptionist{{sfn|''The Northern Miner''|1947}} and twelve British officers were killed when militants, some wearing police uniforms,{{sfn|''The Sidney Morning Herald''|1947}}{{sfn|''Jornal do Brasil''|1947}} under the cover of machine gun fire raided the building, planted and detonated explosives, and subsequently engaged in a gunfight. Twenty British personnel were killed and 30 wounded on that date.{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=192}}{{sfn|Cohen|1982|p=238|ps='''{{red| ?}}'''}}

== Martial law ==
The British High Commissioner's response was swift. By 2 March, martial law was declared in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, most of Tel-Aviv, [[Givatayim]], at in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Ramat Gan]] and [[Petah Tikva]], with the objective of pressuring the [[Jewish Agency]] which had not been cooperating in the British campaign against terrorism.{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=192}} This entailed a curfew for all but three hours a day.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=576}} Maj. Gen. [[Richard Gale (British Army officer)|Richard Gale]], the military governor of Tel-Aviv, reflected on the order: "Martial law shall be declared. It is not to be viewed as a punishment, although there will be no avoiding suffering caused to residents through the fault of irresponsible individuals".{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=192}}

On 3 March, an Irgun depot was raided in Tel Aviv, where detonators, bombs, and British military uniforms were found.{{sfn|''ABC''|1947}} Later that week, British troops shot and killed two Jews in Jerusalem, including a four-year-old girl who was standing on the porch of her home in [[Mea Shearim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=1700 Military condition in Israel], daat (?)Jewish encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|''Haaretz''|2012|p=5}} British soldiers arrested militants throughout the Mandate.{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=196}} In Jerusalem, where a massive manhunt was underway for the suspects in the British Officers' Club bombing.{{sfn|JTA|1947a}} With cooperation from Jewish civilians, sixty suspects were arrested during martial law.{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=196}} Despite security measures, terrorist activity continued, resulting in the deaths of 14 British personnel and 15 civilians between 1 and 13 March.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=84}}

===Effects on the populace===
Indeed, the order had serious implications for the Jewish populace of the affected areas. [[Civil service]]s were suspended and the power of civil leadership, including the courts system, was transferred to military govenors; British soldiers were granted policing authority and movement in and out of areas under martial law required permits.{{sfn|Golani|2013|pp=193–194}} Arabs were affected too by the price of goods and the dismissal of thousands of daily wage workers.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=84}} Ben-Gurion complained that the curfew was having a serious negative impact on the economy and public services, arguing that the effect risked creating sympathy for the cause of terrorism among the general population.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=576}} [[Miles Dempsey|General Sir Miles Denmpsey]] commented on 4 March apropos the military situation stating that there were as many murders in England as in Palestine, with only one difference: "in England the murderer is caught because the people of the country are on the side of law and order and assist the police. In Palestine the people do not assist the police and the murderers are not caught."{{sfn|Grob-Fitzgibbon|2011|p=81}}

Tel Aviv unexpectedly became a major centre of employment and adjacent communities–otherwise cut off from the city–requested they be incorporated into the boundaries of martial law.{{sfn|Golani|2013|pp=193–194}} Pressure on the Jewish Agency led to it taking serious steps to distance itself from the dissident militant groups.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=576}}

== Aftermath ==
The High Commissioner revoked martial law on 17 March, concluding its objectives were met and that the order was inadvertently affecting Arabs as well. The [[Colonial Office]] assessed that the operation while resulting in some Jewish collaboration with British authorities, did not result in the hoped-for level of cooperation.{{sfn|Levenberg|1993|p=84}}{{sfn|Golani|2013|p=196}} An estimated $10,000,000 in economic losses were reported for the Jewish community in the 15 days under martial law.{{sfn|JTA|1947b}} The military estimate was that martial law was ineffective, -in failing to make a dint into terrorism, that they lacked the means to maintain the curfew much longer, and soldiers were being tied down in administrative duties which hampered operational readiness.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=576}}{{sfn|Ekwe-Ekwe|2016|p=110}} Ben-Gurion characterized the dissidents' approach as terrorism, and warned that it risked plunging the Yishuv into a fratricidal struggle. On May 15, the [[Haganah]] was directed to move against the militant factions, not to hand them over to the British, but to impede their execution of further attacks, and their intervention proved effective in stopping projects of assassination and destruction of British military property.{{sfn|Laurens|2002|p=577}} Some of those captured were put and trial and received the death penalty. In reprisal for the execution of several of their members, the Irgun [[The Sergeants affair|captured and hanged two British sergeants, leaving their bodies booby-trapped]].{{sfn|Cohen|2012|p=230}}

The '''master-at-arms''' ('''MA''') [[Naval rating|rating]] is responsible for [[law enforcement]] and [[force protection]] in the [[United States Navy]]—equivalent to the [[United States Army Military Police]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] Military Police, the [[United States Air Force Security Forces]], and the [[United States Coast Guard]]'s [[Maritime Law Enforcement Specialist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement Specialist|url=http://www.gocoastguard.com/active-duty-careers/enlisted-opportunities/view-job-descriptions/me|publisher=United States Coast Guard|access-date=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the oldest ratings in the United States Navy, having been recognized since the inception of the U.S. Navy. 

It has had two rating badges during its history. Its original MA rating mark was an inverted star until disestablished (1797–1921).  On 20 May 1958 the inverted star reemerged as a nod to the Historical MA Rating whose duty was to provide good order and discipline aboard ships over the enlisted crews. Public Law 85-422, the Military Pay Act of 1958, established two new enlisted pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, the new E-8 pay grade was titled Senior Chief Petty Officer and the new E-9 pay grade as Master Chief Petty Officer. As a result it was designated a single (E-8) or double (E-9) inverted star above the anchor for all collar devices and rating badges this point forward. 

The MCPON Rating (1971) specialty mark was established using the former MA inverted star and later expanded to the Command Rates of Fleet / Command Master Chief (1995) or Senior Chief (2015) Ratings. The current MA rating mark following its reestablishment has been a police badge with internal star (1973–present), emblematic of its police or sheriff duties as a modern law enforcement specialist.

== History ==
The [[master-at-arms]] rating is not a modern innovation. Naval records show that these "sheriffs of the sea" were keeping order as early as the reign of Charles I of England. At that time they were charged with keeping the swords, pistols, carbines and muskets in good working order as well as ensuring that the bandoliers were filled with fresh powder before combat. Besides being chiefs of police at sea, the sea corporals, as they were called in the British Navy, they had to be qualified in close order fighting under arms and able to train seamen in hand-to-hand combat. In the days of sail, the master-at-arms were truly "masters at arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of Navy Terminology|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/origin.htm#mas|publisher=Naval Education and Training Program Development Center ROTC|access-date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years ===
The navy of the united colonies of the 1775 era offered only a few different jobs above the ordinary seaman level. These included boatswain's mate, quartermaster, gunner's mate, master-at-arms, cook, armorer, sailmaker's mate, cooper, coxswain, carpenter's yeoman, and yeoman of the gun room. These were titles of the jobs that individuals were actually performing and thus became the basis for petty officers and ratings. Also, there were ordinary seaman, loblolly boy, and boy, but these are more related to our apprentices of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malin |first=Charles |title=Ratings and the Evolution of Jobs in the Navy |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202031256/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-1.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 February 1999 |publisher=Naval Historical and Heritage Command |access-date=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The master-at-arms rating officially started after the [[American Revolutionary War]] on board the ships of the United States' early navy. Taking on many customs and traditions of the Royal Navy, the existence of the rating did not take effect until the Naval Act of July 1, 1797, was enacted, which called for every ship to have, among other job positions a master-at-arms.&lt;ref&gt;An ACT to provide a Naval Armament of March 27, 1794 http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/rbpe:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbpe2200050c)), Retrieved from the Library of Congress on April 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this Congressional act, the master-at-arms rating is recognized as one of the "oldest" ratings still existing in today's modern U.S. Navy, which includes [[boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|boatswain's mate]], [[gunner's mate]], [[quartermaster]], and [[yeoman (United States Navy)|yeoman]].

From 1885 to 1893, a master-at-arms was a petty officer 1st class, who wore a rating badge consisting of three stripes forming an arc over the three chevrons, and a star specialty mark with an eagle perched on the arc. A ship's corporal wore a standard rating badge for a petty officer 2nd class with the star as the specialty mark.&lt;ref name="uscg.mil"&gt;https://www.uscg.mil/history/docs/uniforms/1985_USN-Ratings-Insignia_StaceyJA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The master-at-arms rating is formally disestablished in accordance with BNCL 9-21 of March 24, 1921, and made effective July 1, 1921.&lt;ref name="uscg.mil"/&gt;

=== 1940s–1980s ===
Established in 1942, the specialists (s) shore patrol and security, worked shore patrol teams and ensured basic ship and shore station security. Its name was changed in 1948 to shore patrolman, and it took on some of the official functions of the current master-at-arms rating, only to be disestablished on January 23, 1953 by the Secretary of the Navy as a result of the RSRB recommendations of June 1952. This was officially implemented by BUPERS Notice 1200 of March 5, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malin |first=Charles |title=Compilation of Enlisted Ratings and Apprenticeships of the U.S. Navy, 1775 to 1969 |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-3.htm#anchors |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |access-date=23 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916052524/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-3.htm |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Master-at-Arms rating|url=http://www.navycs.com/navy-jobs/master-at-arms.html|publisher=Navy Cyberspace|access-date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Master-at-arms circa 1970s[[File:Master-at-Arms (U.S. Navy) Rating Creation Notice.pdf|thumb|Official notification from the Chief of Naval Personnel authorizing the creation of the U.S. Navy master-at-arms rating.]]
According to the [[Naval History and Heritage Command]], the Master-at-arms rating was officially established in 1797, disestablished in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;Enlisted rating in the U.S. Navy 1775–1969 [http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-3.htm#anchorm Retrieved from the Naval History and Heritage Command on April 22, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916052524/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-3.htm |date=16 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be re-established by the [[Chief of Naval Personnel]] on August 1, 1973 in BUPERSNOTE 1440 Change 1, thereby making that date "August 1st" as the official birthday of the modern U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms.&lt;ref&gt;BUPERSNOTE 1440 CH-1 Dated August 17, 1973 [http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/security/Pages/default.aspx Retrieved from the Bureau of Naval Personnel webpage on April 22, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This formal creation of the master-at-arms rating was unfortunately the result of a recommendation made by the Special Subcommittee of Congress on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy, because of riots that occurred on the {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} and the {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}} in 1972 because of racial tensions.  According to the archived reports, the findings of the committee concluded that there was no formal training for the master-at-arms force on the ships, the U.S. Marine Detachment was not effectively utilized by the chief master-at-arms of the ships, and that a separate rating be established to perform law enforcement duties similar to the other military services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/report-by-special-subcommittee-disciplinary-problems-us-navy.html|title=Report by the Special Subcommittee on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy|author=|date=|website=www.History.Navy.mil|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being re-established on August 1, 1973, the rating would only receive sailors who wanted to "cross-rate" (a rating conversion in the U.S. Navy) and submitted a conversion package to BUPERS after concurrence from NCIS. This conversion package was unique in that it required a letter of endorsement from rated master-at-arms in the community who observed the sailor first-hand in the performance of their assigned NSF duties. Along with the pre-requisites required at the time, these sailors must have been frocked as a second class petty officer or above. The conversion process used the procedures and requirements listed in Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN) 1440-010. 

In 1982, the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], then known as the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), assumed responsibility for managing the Navy's Law Enforcement and Physical Security Program and the Navy's Information and Personnel Security Program. This effectively made NCIS the program manager for the master-at-arms community, responsible for program management, manning, training, and equipping.

=== Post 9/11 and the expeditionary era (2000–2011) ===
The period between the 1980s and the 2000s saw very few changes in the rating after its formation, in terms of tactics, techniques and procedures. Masters-at-arms were performing law enforcement and ATFP duties.  Concurrently, for those naval shore installation with a nuclear weapons mission and a collocated nuclear weapons storage areas (primarily naval submarine bases and select [[naval air station]]s, the Marine Corps Security Force assigned to that installation's Marine Barracks, held responsibility for access gates/gate guards, perimeter security, and security of stored nuclear weapons.  A similar function was held by the Marine Detachment, essentially a reinforced infantry company, aboard major warships that had both nuclear weapons storage facilities and functioned as flagships (e.g., aircraft carriers and battleships).  But the majority of Navy MAAs, especially those assigned to ships, still performed archaic duties such as berthing inspections, restricted barracks supervision, linen issue, and seabag locker management. However, the increased terrorist threat changed the way the Navy thought and operated.

In the mid and late 1980s, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, in agreement with the Chief of Naval Operations, began removing Marine Corps enlisted personnel from gate guard duties at the naval installations they were assigned to in order to place greater emphasis on the nuclear weapons security role, with Navy enlisted personnel assuming gate guard and perimeter security duties.  However, most of the junior enlisted personnel assigned to these functions were not part of the MAA rating and had little formal training in security duties.  With the end of the [[Cold War]], Marine Detachments were also removed from aircraft carriers in the early 1990s, the four [[Iowa-class battleship]]s having been concurrently decommissioned at the same time.

However, with the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] in 2000, followed by the events of [[9/11]], the U.S. Navy began to realize its personnel, equipment and infrastructure were grossly under protected because of a lack of specially-trained personnel, especially the master-at-arms. As terrorism became a real threat, the Navy's leadership was forced to change how the master-at-arms was viewed, used, and task organized, leading to serious changes in force protection tactics, techniques and procedures. This led to the establishment of the Antiterrorism/Force Protection Warfare Development Center (ATFPWDC), the precursor to the current Center for Security Forces and an increase in Master-at-arms manning, which in the year 2000 was barely 1,800 to over 11,000 by the year 2007. In addition, in 2003 the [[Navy Recruiting Command]] increased recruiting efforts tremendously help fill the billet requirements being demanded by the various type commanders (TYCOM) to combat the terrorist threats within their area of responsibility. This demand increased sharply when the CNO authorized the formation of the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]] (NECC), which serves as the single functional command for the Navy's expeditionary forces and as central management for the readiness, resources, manning, training and equipping of those forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC)|url=http://www.necc.navy.mil/|publisher=U.S. Navy|access-date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest change to the rating came after 9/11 in the form of master-at-arms sailors being assigned to other military units as an [[Individual Augmentee]] in support of combat support and non-combat support roles in the various area of operations of the "Global War on Terrorism". Aside from the authorized billets in unconventional operational units, master-at-arms saw Individual Augmentee duties as early 2003 such as in the Iraq AOR with [[Combined Joint Task Force 7]] (the precursor unit of [[Multi-National Force – Iraq]]), headquartered at Camp Victory.

In 2006, NECC acquired the program management role from NCIS. The increased need for specialized units such as [[Maritime Expeditionary Security Force]] (MESF) and [[United States Navy Riverine Squadron]] (RIVRON) units and the manning of several forward deployed locations such as Bahrain saw the need to increase the number of masters-at-arms. It was also during this period, for the first and only time, that master-at-arms were considered a source rating for [[U.S. Navy SEAL]] and were allowed to attend Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training.

Then again in 2011, this changed with U.S. Fleet Forces Command assuming responsibility as the master-at-arms community sponsor. This shift is indicative of the "drawdown" the entire U.S. military was seeing from its departure from combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This move marks the change from combat and combat support roles that masters-at-arms participated in the various expeditionary and SOF units, and back to more traditional law enforcement roles with U.S. Fleet Forces Command as the community's functional commander. This move still exasperates the existing issue that has plagued the community from its beginning. The issue of the Naval Security Force not having a single [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], or type commander, similar to how the U.S. Army, and U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Corps, or U.S. Air Force Security Forces are task organized. In each of the other services, the entire Military Police Corps are under the direction and control of their respective Military Police [[Provost Marshal General]].

=== Current (2011–present) ===
A proposal from within the community has been recommended, suggesting changes to how the master-at-arms rating and Naval Security Force personnel are organized, trained and utilized.  Additionally, with the decline in the requirements placed on the rating since the start of the Global War on Terrorism in support of the various operations, this has freed up many personnel and units for a Navy-wide restructuring of the master-at-arms rating. In a 2014 article in ''Navy Times'', the then-Commander of Naval Air Forces, Vice Admiral Dave Buss, stated that all aircraft carriers' Security Force Departments would be manned by rated master-at-arms. This is a tremendous shift in current manning directives since the departure of the U.S. Marine Detachments in the 1990s. Currently, the Security Departments of these ships rely on other departments to fill almost 75 percent of the required security force billets. These sailors, who receive minimal training in force-protection tactics, techniques and procedures, temporarily fill these billets for a duration of six months to a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/careers/2014/12/27/ma-navy-ranks-carriers-security-detachments/20768589/|title=ma-navy-ranks-carriers-security-detachments|first=Navy|last=Times|date=|website=Navy Times|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duties and functions ==

=== Authority ===
The authority of a master-at-arms is derived from many sources. Under Title 10 U.S.C., they enforce the provision of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) (10 U.S.C. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-II/chapter-47 § 47]).  Under the [[Assimilative Crimes Act]] (18 U.S.C.[http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00667.htm § 13]) it provides that local and state criminal codes may be assimilated for enforcement and criminal investigation purposes on military installations. Other sources of authority for Master-at-Arms include the [[Manual for Courts-Martial]], [[United States Navy Regulations]], internal directives from the Office of the [[Secretary of Defense]] (SECDEF), Office of the [[Secretary of the Navy]] (SECNAV), the Office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), and local directives issued by the commanding officer.

=== Creed ===
I am a Master-at-Arms.
I hold allegiance to my country, devotion to duty, and personal integrity above all.
I wear my shield of authority with dignity and restraint, and promote by example high standards of conduct, appearance, courtesy and performance.
I seek no favor because of my position.
I perform my duties in a firm, courteous, and impartial manner.
I strive to merit the respect of my shipmates and all with whom I come in contact.

=== Mission and duties ===

According to the United States Navy Enlisted Occupational Standards, NAVPERS 18068F, it states that '''Master-at-Arms provide waterborne and land security, aircraft and flight line security, strategic weapons and cargo security, maritime security and platform protection; conduct customs operations, corrections operations, detainee operations, and protective service operations; perform force protection, physical security and law enforcement; organize and train personnel in force protection, physical security, law enforcement, and weapons proficiency; develop plans for physical security and force protection enhancement of Navy bases, installations, property, and personnel; and assist commands in conducting terrorist threat analysis and implementing defensive measures.'''

Master-at-arms perform criminal investigations, with some exceptions. In the [[Department of the Navy]], felony criminal investigations for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps are conducted by federal civilian law enforcement agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], which also performs investigations in [[national security]], [[counter-intelligence]], and [[counter-terrorism]]. During drug interdiction operations on naval vessels, U.S. Navy personnel are augmented by the U.S. Coast Guard's Law Enforcement Detachment under [[Title 10, United States Code]] (U.S.C.) [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/379 § 379] to perform those law enforcement duties, because of the DOD Regulations and Executive Orders which prevents Navy personnel from being used to enforce state laws. This also limits the ability of enlisted MA personnel from assisting civilian police.

The duties of a master-at-arms vary from command to command. Most will primarily perform law enforcement and force protection duties, however, other types of duties are open to the rating depending on the command that they are assigned to. This can be in areas such as expeditionary warfare, special operations support, independent duty, GWOT individual augmentee, protective service detail assigned to a high-ranking official, or corrections. Master-at-arms may also serve outside of the rating, when approved by the community manager, such as in recruiting, recruit training, U.S. Embassy duty, assignment to NCIS or Afloat Training Group (ATG) as a trainer and evaluator, or to a flag or general officer's Staff.

As the primary law enforcement organization on a naval installation, master-at-arms may perform their duties operating a patrol vehicle or RHIB; standing watch (or post) at a gate, pier or flight line as a fixed or roving sentry; conducting traffic enforcement; conducting interviews or interrogations; collecting evidence or securing a crime scene. Like any other law enforcement agency, there are also administrative duties performed by master-at-arms such as personnel management, training, inspections, records keeping, etc.

Personnel in the master-at-arms rating can also expect to see duties on board a variety of naval warships such as an aircraft carriers' security force department; on a cruiser, destroyer, or aviation squadron as an independent duty master-at-arms; on board a naval shore or aviation installation in the United States or in overseas locations such as Bahrain and Diego Garcia, assigned to the security force or police departments; forward deployed to [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] or [[Africa]] on a GWOT IA assignment; or assigned to an expeditionary or naval special warfare unit. When assigned to these different types of units, master-at-arms are expected to achieve the same qualifications and watch stations, as the rest of the sailors assigned to that unit. This may include damage control, maintenance and material management, officer of the deck or petty officer of the watch or small boat coxswain. Overall, these specific qualifications are required of all sailors to complete their unit specific warfare qualifications, for example, enlisted surface warfare specialist or enlisted expeditionary warfare specialist.

[[File:NSF Badge - Patch.jpg|400px|right|thumb|U.S. Navy's current law enforcement patch for the NWU]]
According to early records, the U.S. Navy took its time about identifying ratings by the symbols so familiar on today's naval uniforms. The master-at-arms, or police officer of the ship, wore the white five-pointed star of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ratings and the Evolution of Jobs in the Navy http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/organization-and-administration/ranks/enlisted-personnel/ratings-and-the-evolution-of-jobs-in-the-navy.html retrieved from the Naval History and Heritage Command on April 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, they were only distinguished from other sailors wearing the dungaree uniform, by wearing a brassard on their arm with the letters "MAA". Eventually, commands locally purchased and issued metal badges to masters-at-arms, similar to civilian law enforcement agencies. This, however, caused for badge inconsistencies throughout the Navy in terms of the size, color and description, when compared to the uniformity of the other services' military police force. 

Between the 1980s and 2010 saw the use of the woodland and desert camouflage utility uniform by master-at-arms throughout the Navy, with metal or cloth badges worn on the left breast pocket of the uniform, centered in the middle of the left pocket for men and 1/4 inch above the U.S. Navy tape (or warfare device) for women. The camouflage utility uniform for the Navy was exactly the same uniform worn by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army known as the battle dress uniform.

Today master-at-arms wear the same uniform worn throughout the fleet, the navy working uniform type I, with a "universal" metal or cloth badge affixed to right side of the uniform, 1/4 inch above the name tape of the sailor, with no difference in position for gender.  Masters-at-arms serving in a specific operational units may also be authorized to wear the navy working uniform type II (digital desert pattern) or the navy working uniform type III (digital woodland pattern).  In these situations, the TYCOM, combatant commander, or unit commander for those units may issue specific orders to deviate from U.S. Navy Uniform Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy Working Uniform (NWU) Uniform Regulations Update|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2011/NAV11259.txt|publisher=Bureau of Naval Personnel|access-date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rating badge ===
Between 1885 and 1893, the master-at-arms was established as a first-class petty officer and wore a distinctive badge consisting of three stripes forming an arc over the three chevrons and specialty mark with an eagle perched on the arc. This would subsequently be used for the newly created rank of chief petty officer. The ship's corporal was then authorized to wear a standard rating badge for petty officer 2nd class with the star as the specialty mark.  The current rating badge, as authorized by BuPers Notice 1440 (May 4, 1973, effective August 1, 1973) and approved by the Secretary of the Navy on March 8, 1974 has been the current rating badge for the master-at-arms.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, J. A. (2008). ''United States Navy rating badges, and marks, 1833-2008: A history of our sailor's rate and rating insignia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and education ==
[[File:CENSECFOR Patch.png|300px|thumb|The Center for Security Forces Command logo.]]
In October 2001, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) designated the commander in chief, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] (CINCLANTFLT) as concurrent commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command. This action was prompted by the recent terrorists’ attacks against the U.S. and the increased awareness among military official that the Navy’s force protection posture was in need of revision. Known today as U.S. Fleet Forces Command, its mission is to serve as the executive agent regarding all aspects of force protection for the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Naval Security Force "Our History"|url=http://www.netc.navy.mil/centers/csf/Who.aspx?ID=0|publisher=Commander, Naval Education and Training Command|access-date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, U.S. Fleet Forces Command established the Antiterrorism/Force Protection Warfare Development Center (ATFPWDC) in response to the rapid increase of fleet training needs in the realm of force protection. Known today as Center for Security Forces, its mission is to serve as the training authority for all aspects of force protection for the Navy.

Today, the Center for Security Forces provides specific training, sustainment and serves as the Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the area of Navy law enforcement, force protection, physical security, small arms weapons training, expeditionary warfare, code of conduct, and the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) in those respective areas. Its mission is to develop and deliver force protection and NSF training to achieve war fighting superiority.

=== Master-at-Arms "A" school ===
Master-at-Arms "A" school is located at [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]], [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. MAs receive formal and specialized training managed by the staff and personnel assigned to the Center for Security Forces (CENSECFOR). Sailors graduating from "A" School will have the basic knowledge in performing law enforcement duties and will be qualified to operate the M9 pistol, M4/M16 rifle, M500 shotgun, expandable baton, Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) pepper spray, various restraining devices, and operating a patrol vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wwwa.nko.navy.mil/portal/securityforces/home?paf_default_view=true|title=Center for Naval Security Forces webpage on Navy Knowledge Online (NKO)|author=|date=|website=Navy.mil|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAs graduating from "A" School will also possess basic knowledge in interview and interrogation techniques, report writing, use of force and rules of engagement doctrine, and military law.

=== Master-at-Arms "C" schools ===

Master-at-Arms perform a variety of duties that require specialize training, or "C" Schools, that are completed immediately after "A" School and throughout their career. Upon completion of the applicable "C" School(s), a Master-at-Arms receives a Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) Code which is entered into their Electronic Training Jacket (ETJ). NECs are sometimes used in the detailing process for an enlisted Sailor when selecting orders to a new command.

== Standard issued weapons ==
Because of the multi-faceted duties of a master-at-arms, it is not uncommon for a master-at-arms to qualify in various small-arms and large caliber weapons throughout their career. Additionally, master-at-arms may be required to train and qualify in various non-lethal weapons.  Typically, a rated master-at-arms will at a minimum maintain qualifications in the following weapons to perform their basic law enforcement duties:
* [[Beretta M9]] pistol
* SIG Sauer [[P228]] M11 pistol
* [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun
* [[Colt M16]] rifle
* [[M4 rifle]]
* [[M240]] machine gun
* [[M249]] light machine gun
* Various non-lethal weapons (NLW) and devices

== Organizational structure ==
In a naval unit task organized with a naval security force (NSF) department or detachment, masters-at-arms report to the commanding officer of the command, and are led by a security officer, in maintaining good order and discipline, enforcing rules and regulations, and protecting life and property.&lt;ref&gt;MILPERSMAN 1440-010 (para. 9 and 15), Change in Rating Authorization, http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/milpersman/1000/1400Promotions/Pages/default.aspx Retrieved from the Bureau of Naval Personnel webpage on April 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Security officers are commissioned naval officers in the [[limited duty officer]] or [[chief warrant officer]] community with the security occupational designators 649X and 749X. They may also be led by a [[Department of Defense police|Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employee]] who possess the necessary skills, training and/or experience to perform those duties.&lt;ref&gt;NTTP 3-07-2.3, Law Enforcement and Physical Security for Naval Installations&lt;/ref&gt;

Security Force enablers may also include personnel in the Emergency Management and Antiterrorism offices who support NSF functions, but report through a different chain of command.

Collectively, all personnel responsible for law enforcement and force protection for the U.S. Navy are designated as naval security force. This includes sailors in the master-at-arms rating, commissioned officers in the LDO and CWO field, [[Department of Defense police|DoD police officers]], contracted guards, and sailors who have completed the required security force training. These "non-rated" sailors are trained by masters-at-arms with the antiterrorism training supervisor skill set (NEC 9501) or by sailors assigned as instructors to the center for security forces learning sites. Some of the course curriculums required to be completed in order to perform NSF duties include Security Reaction Force – Basic (SRF-B) and Security Reaction Force – Advance (SRF-A). Non-rated sailors assigned to perform these duties will be designated as auxiliary security force (ASF) for shore installations, or in-port security force (ISF) for naval vessels.

It was originally memorized by [[lawspeaker]]s, but after the end of the [[Viking Age]] they were committed to writing, mostly by [[Monks#Western Christianity|Christian monks]] after the Christianization of Scandinavia. Initially they were geographically limited to minor jurisdictions (''lögsögur''), and the [[Bjarkey laws]] concerned various merchant towns, but later there were laws that applied to entire Scandinavian kingdoms. Each jurisdiction was governed by an assembly of free men, called a [[þing]].

The court assembly, the ''[[thing (assembly)|thing]]'', used the law and heard witnesses to rule whether the accused was guilty or not. There were usually two types of punishment: [[outlaw]]ing and [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s. The most common means of justice were, however, fines; the amount varied, depending on the severity of the offense. This system was extremely intricate and the fines themselves, singularly a "mulct",&lt;ref&gt;http://sealvikings.wikispaces.com/Viking+Crime+and+Punishments&lt;/ref&gt; were also varied according to the social status of the accused and/or the victim. Disputes of innocence were often solved by trial. These trials consisted of different tests for men and women. However, as long as the courts were not made aware of the crime, it could go unpunished or was settled outside of legal bounds by payment. There was no written code of law until after the [[Viking Age]], but the code of fines, duels, and disavowing criminals was the standard across the Scandinavian world.

==Iceland==
The best sources for information about the Viking legal system are found in [[Iceland]], where it was the most highly documented. The [[Eyrbyggja Saga]], for example, portrays accounts of the compromises made at the [[Althing]]. In Chapter 46 of the [[saga]], the arbitrator and his jury facilitate the following settlement:

"It was agreed that the wound Thord Bling received at Alfta Fjord should cancel the one given to Thorodd Snorrason. Mar Hallvardsson's wound and the blow Steinthor gave Snorri the Priest were said to equal the deaths of the three men killed at Alfta Fjord. The killings by Styr, one on either side, cancelled each other out, as did the killings of Bergthor, and the wounds of the Thorbrandssons in the fight on Vigra Fjord. The killing of Freystein Bofi was set against the killing of one of Steinthor's men at Alfta Fjord. Thorleif Kimbi got compensation for the leg he had lost. The killing of one of Snorri's men at Alfta Fjord was matched against the unlawful assault Thorleif Kimbi had committed by starting the fight. All other injuries were evened out, all outstanding differences paid for, and so they parted on friendly terms. Everyone honoured this settlement as long as Steinthor and Snorri were both alive."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Pálsson, and Paul Edwards. Eyrbyggja Saga. London, England: Penguin, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1117, the [[Althing]] decided that all the laws should be written down and this was accomplished at [[Hafliði Másson]]'s farm over that winter and published the following year. The resulting codex is known as the ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]'' (Icelandic: ''Grágás'') and they were a collection of laws from the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] period consisting of Icelandic civil laws and the laws governing the Christian church in Iceland.

==Norway==
[[Image:Md apr2004 4.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from ''Magnus Lagabøts landslov'' in a copy from c. 1590, held in the [[National Archives of Norway|Norwegian Riksarkivet]].]]
As with the other Scandinavian countries in the [[Medieval Age]], Norway was governed by a system of [[þing]]s at which the numerous kings would convene to settle legal disputes. Medieval Norway developed four ancient regional assemblies: [[Frostating]], [[Gulating]], [[Eidsivating]] and [[Borgarting]]. There were also smaller ''þing''s, such as [[Haugating]], which did not develop into major legislative meetings. A jury typically consisted of twelve members, twenty-four members, or thirty-six members according to the importance of the matter in question.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/laws.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common practices in early medieval Norway of determining the outcome of a case was a [[holmgang]],&lt;ref&gt;http://viking.no/e/life/elaws.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which was a duel between the accuser and the accused. The winner was considered to be in the favor of the gods and thus the innocent party. Although not as common, outlawing men was practiced as well. Bjorn, son of Ketil Flat-Nose, was declared an outlaw by a thing assembled by King Harald in the very beginning of the [[Eyrbyggja Saga]].

As royal power in the Norwegian kingdom was consolidated, from about the eleventh century onwards, laws were increasingly put into writing, and later issued by royal decree. Thus trade in towns came to be regulated by the [[Bjarkey laws]]; the laws of the four ''þing''s were codified during the thirteenth century, producing texts such as the ''[[Frostathing Law]]''. [[Magnus I of Norway]] ("the good") took a key role in this. Then, during the reign of [[Magnus VI of Norway]] ("the lawmender"), the first state law for the whole of Norway was issued, between 1274 and 1276. This is known as ''[[Magnus Lagabøtes landslov]]''; it was supplemented with further law-codes for the country's cities from 1276, known as ''[[Magnus Lagabøtes bylov]]''.

''[[Magnus Lagabøtes landslov]]'' stood more or less unchanged as a key section of Norwegian law until the [[Norwegian Code]] of issued by [[Christian V of Denmark]] in 1688. However, a number of features of the current [[Law of Norway]] are still thought to descend lineally from [[Ancient Norwegian property laws]]. [[Udal law]], for example, is thought to have ancient origins of this kind.

The [[Treaty of Perth]] transferred the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Man to Scots law while Norse law and rule still applied for Shetland and Orkney.

==Denmark==
[[Image:B74detail.jpg|thumb|200px|Leaf F91r of ''SKB B74'' discussing crimes of passion.]]
Medieval Denmark was divided into three jurisdictions each ruled by its own provincial law; the [[Scanian Law]] used in the [[Scanian lands]], the [[Zealandic Law]] used in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Lolland]], and the [[Jyske Lov|Jutlandic Law]] used in [[Jutland]] (both [[Northern Jutland|North]] and [[Southern Jutland|South]]) and [[Funen]]. The Scanian lands were Danish until the middle of the 17th century, and the Scanian Law predates Sweden's similar provincial laws. It was written down around 1200 and exists in several law manuscripts. The earliest extant manuscript, ''SKB B74'' was created between 1225-1275 and is now housed at the [[Swedish Royal Library]]. Another copy, the [[Codex Runicus]], was written entirely in [[runic]] lettering around 1300 and is now held at the Arnamagnæan Institute at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. These manuscripts are however copies of older lawtexts and the Scanian Law is thus counted as one of the oldest provincial laws in the [[Nordic countries]].

All three provinsial laws were given by king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar the Victorious]]. The youngest of the three, the Jutlandic Law, was given in 1241.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/manus/41/]&lt;/ref&gt; Zealand was later given two additional laws: King Eric's Zealandic Law and the Zealandic ecclesiastical law. It is remains unclear which king Eric the former law refers to.

The three laws were replaced in 1683 by King [[Danish Code|Christian V's Danish Law]] but as this law was never introduced in [[Schleswig]], the Jutlandic Law remained in force for this jurisdiction. The oldest known copy of the Jutlandic Law, ''Codex Holmiensis 37'' is currently owned by the Swedish Royal Library. Recent research has rejected earlier claims that described this copy as Swedish war booty from 1657-60 wars, as the book appears to have been in Danish ownership during the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://runeberg.org/nfbo/0539.html article ''Landskapslagar''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
The earliest written law from what is now Sweden seems to be the ''Forsaringen'', an iron ring from the door for the church of [[Forsa, Hälsingland|Forsa]] in [[Hälsingland]], which carries a runic inscription, long thought to be from the high Middle Ages but more recently dated to the ninth or tenth century. The inscription's precise meaning is uncertain, but seems to list fines, with the fine doubling for each new offence.&lt;ref&gt;Inger Larsson, 'The Role of the Swedish Lawman in the Spread of Lay Literacy', in ''Along the Oral-Written Continuum: Types of Texts, Relations and the Implications'', ed. by Slavica Ranković, Leidulf Melve, and Else Mundal, Utrecht Studies in Medieval Literacy, 20 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 411-27 (pp. 416-18).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest substantial Swedish law-texts are the provincial laws (in Swedish ''landskapslag''), which were the means of law holding in [[Sweden]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[provinces of Sweden]], or ''landskap'' were practically separate countries and had individual laws. Provincial laws are known to have existed in the provinces of [[Västergötland]], [[Östergötland]], [[Dalarna]], [[Hälsingland]], [[Södermanland]], [[Uppland]], [[Västmanland]], [[Värmland]] and [[Närke]]. A provincial law, [[Gutalagen]], also existed for [[Gotland]]. In [[Finland]], the local common laws were not codified, but in parts of Finland the applied law was based on the Hälsingland law.

In older times the laws were memorized by a lawspeaker (''lagman''). Around 1200 the laws began to be transferred to written form. This was probably due to [[cleric]]al influences. The oldest of the Swedish provincial laws is the [[Westrogothic law]] or ''Västgötalagen'', which was used in the province of [[Västergötland]], in west Sweden. Like Gutalagen, it was written in its oldest version around 1220. Some regulations are likely to have their origins in the [[Viking Age]]. A stipulation that "no man may inherit while he sits in Greece", for instance, would have been useful during the Viking Age when many Swedes served in the [[Varangian Guard]] but less so when the laws were codified, at a time when such service had all but stopped.

Of the fine, one third was to be paid to the wronged; one third to the [[Hundred (division)|hundred]]; and one third to the King.

Around 1350, the Swedish provincial laws were replaced by a country law, the [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] country law. Gutalagen was in use until 1595 and the Scanian Law was in use until 1683.

==Christianity and Norse law==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Christianity is thought to have come to the Scandinavian peoples initially in the reign of [[Charlemagne]], but did not take hold until the 11th or 12th centuries, when it was made the official religion of Norway by [[Olaf Tryggvason]]. He is also credited with expanding the religion to the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]], and [[Greenland]], among other areas in Scandinavia.

With the Christians came new laws and ideas, such as the Járnburdr, which was a "test by fire". It consisted of picking an iron out of boiling water and carrying it 9 paces. A week later, if the carrier's wounds had not become infected they were declared innocent. Later, the Christians also abolished this law. It also abolished slavery in Scandinavia and the gathering of "cults". Perhaps the largest contribution of Christianity to Viking culture, however, was the power that it presented. As the Viking Age moved into a more monarchical era, it came to a fast close. Kings such as the [[Olaf Tryggvason]], [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], and Sweyn's son [[Cnut the Great]] were extremely powerful and were Christian.

The yearly [[þing]] ritual continued after the Christianization of Scandinavia, especially in Iceland where it was a social gathering, not merely a court.

'''Negativland''' is an American [[experimental music]] band which originated in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the late 1970s. They took their name from a [[Neu!]] track,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/negativland-mt0012506492|title=Negativland - Neu! - Listen, Appearances, Song Review - AllMusic|author=Stewart Mason|work=AllMusic|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while their record label ([[Seeland Records]]) is named after another Neu! track.  The core of the band consists of [[Mark Hosler]], [[David Wills (musician)|David Wills (aka "The Weatherman")]], [[Peter Conheim]] and [[Wobbly (musician)|Jon Leidecker (aka "Wobbly")]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littlevillagemag.com/the-pioneers-of-disruption-negativland-members-open-up-about-deceased-member-don-joyce-future-projects/ |title= The Pioneers of Disruption: Negativland members open up about deceased member Don Joyce, future projects |publisher=LittleVillageMag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Negativland has released a number of albums ranging from pure sound collage to more musical expositions. These have mostly been released on their own label, [[Seeland Records]].  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they produced several recordings for [[SST Records]], most notably ''[[Escape from Noise]]'', ''[[Helter Stupid]]'' and ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]''.  Negativland were sued by the band [[U2]]'s record label, [[Island Records]], and by [[SST Records]], which brought them widespread publicity and notoriety.

==History==

===1980s===
Negativland started in [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[California]], in 1979 around the core founding members of Lyons and Hosler (who were in high school at the time), and released an eponymous debut in 1980.

A number of releases followed in the early 1980s, but it wasn't until after the release of their breakthrough sample and cut-up sonic barrage ''[[Escape from Noise]]'' in 1987 that Negativland gained wider attention. Vinyl copies of the album came with "CAR BOMB" bumper stickers, in reference to the album's song "Car Bomb."

Following the somewhat unexpected success of this album, Negativland faced the prospect of going on a money-losing tour in 1988. To prevent this, they created a [[press release]] which said Negativland were prevented from touring by "Federal Authority Dick Jordan" because of claims that Negativland's song "[[Christianity Is Stupid]]" had inspired 16-year-old mass murderer [[David Brom]] to kill his family. The press release went on to vigorously deny the purported connection between Negativland and the murders. While Brom had in fact argued with his father about music shortly before Brom killed his family, no one had ever claimed that Brom was spurred to murder by Negativland's music. The claim that Brom's crimes were inspired by Negativland was disseminated and discussed in the [[mass media]], seemingly with little to no fact-checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/coryfrye/2009/12/20/negativlands_helter_stupid_20_years_later |title=Negativland's "Helter Stupid" 20 Years Later - Cory Frye - Open Salon |publisher=Open.salon.com |accessdate=13 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127031224/http://open.salon.com/blog/coryfrye/2009/12/20/negativlands_helter_stupid_20_years_later |archivedate=November 27, 2013}}, page found at archive.org 2015-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the world was informed of the "Killer Song" that caused a kid to murder his parents with an ax.

The incident became the foundation for Negativland's next release, ''[[Helter Stupid]]'', which featured a cover photo of TV news anchorman [[Dave McElhatton]] intoning the Brom murder story, with the news station's caption "Killer Song" above his head, and a photo of the ax murderer.

=== ''U2'' record incident ===
Negativland's next project  was the ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]'' EP, with samples from ''[[American Top 40]]'' host [[Casey Kasem]]. In 1991, Negativland released a single with the title "U2" displayed in very large type on the front of the packaging, and "Negativland" in a smaller typeface. An image of the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane was also on the single cover.

The songs within were parodies of the group U2's well-known 1987 song "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]", including [[kazoo]]s and extensive sampling of the original song.  The song "The Letter U And The Numeral 2" features a musical backing to an extended profane rant from well-known [[disc jockey]] [[Casey Kasem]], lapsing out of his more polished and professional tone during a frustrating rehearsal which had gone out to many stations as raw feed and was taped by several engineers, who had been passing it around for a number of years. One of Kasem's milder comments was "These guys are from [[England]] and who gives a shit?" (U2 was actually formed in Ireland. Moments earlier he had read from his script, "the Irish band from Dublin".)

U2's label [[Island Records]] quickly sued Negativland, stating that placing the word "U2" on the cover violated trademark law, as did the song itself. Island Records also contended that the single was an attempt to deliberately confuse U2 fans, awaiting the impending release of ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', into purchasing what they believed was a new U2 album called ''Negativland''.

In June 1992, [[R. U. Sirius]], publisher of the magazine ''[[Mondo 2000]]'', came up with an idea. Publicists from U2 had contacted him regarding the possibility of interviewing [[The Edge|Dave "The Edge" Evans]], hoping to promote U2's impending multimillion-dollar [[Zoo TV Tour]], which featured found sounds and live sampling from mass media outlets (things for which Negativland had been known for some time). Sirius, unbeknownst to Edge, decided to have his friends Joyce and Hosler of Negativland conduct the interview. Joyce and Hosler, fresh from Island's lawsuit, peppered the Edge with questions regarding his ideas about the use of sampling in their new tour, and the legality of using copyrighted material without permission. Midway through the interview, Joyce and Hosler revealed their identities as members of Negativland. An embarrassed Edge reported that U2 were bothered by the sledgehammer legal approach Island Records took in their lawsuit, and furthermore that much of the legal wrangling took place without U2's knowledge: "by the time we [U2] realized what was going on it was kinda too late, and we actually did approach the record company on your [Negativland's] behalf and said, 'Look, c'mon, this is just, this is very heavy...'" Island Records reported to Negativland that U2 never authorized samples of their material; Evans' response was, "that's complete bollocks, there's like, there's at least six records out there that are direct samples from our stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?page_id=19 |title=Negativland Interviews U2's The Edge |publisher=Negativland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Joyce provided an audio cassette copy of the ''Mondo 2000'' interview with Evans to the U2 fan website U2Interview.com. The interview is freely available from this website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negativland And The Edge|url=http://www.u2interview.com/negativland-mondo-2000-interview/|publisher=U2Interview.com|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "U2" single (along with other related material) was re-released in 2001 on a "bootleg" album entitled ''[[These Guys Are from England and Who Gives a Shit]]'', released on "Seelard Records" (a parody of Negativland's record label Seeland Records). Negativland may have themselves been responsible for the re-release; although the Negativland website refers to this release as a bootleg, it is available from major retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Tower Records, as well as Negativland's own mail-order business.

Negativland are interested in [[intellectual property]] rights, and argue that their use of U2's and others' material falls under the [[fair use]] clause. In 1995, they released a book, with accompanying CD, called ''[[Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2]]'', about the whole U2 incident (from Island Records first suing Negativland for the release to Negativland gaining back control of their work four years later). The book ends with a large appendix of essays about fair use and copyright by Negativland and others, telling the story with newspaper clippings, court papers, faxes, press releases and other documents arranged in chronological order.  An unfortunate side effect of the Negativland-Island lawsuit was another one brought on between Negativland and SST, which served to sever all remaining ties the two had.  To get back at Negativland (while wryly circumventing their name), SST founder [[Greg Ginn]] later released the ''[[Negativ(e)land: Live on Tour]]'' album on SST.

Negativland were the main subjects of [[Craig Baldwin]]'s documentary ''[[Sonic Outlaws]]'', detailing the use of [[culture jamming]] to subvert the messages of more traditional media outlets. They also made an appearance in Brett Gaylor's 2009 copyright issue documentary, ''[[RiP: A Remix Manifesto]]''.

===ABCs and Teletubbies===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Neg02a.jpg|thumb|left|120px|]]   --&gt;
In 1999 Negativland collaborated with [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[anarchist]] band [[Chumbawamba]] to produce the EP ''[[The ABCs of Anarchism]]'', which is largely based around the writings of [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Cut-up technique|cut-up]] versions of Chumbawamba's hit song "Tubthumping", the theme tune to the children's program [[Teletubbies]] and the [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[Anarchy in the UK]]".

===2000s===
In 2003, members of Negativland contributed their efforts to [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to legally build upon and share by providing alternative copyright licenses. In September 2002, Negativland spoofed [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]] radio stations in an audio track broadcast by pirate radio broadcasters jamming a Seattle Clear Channel station while the National Association of Broadcasters met in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |title=News Archive: August 2003 |publisher=Diymedia.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703001229/http://diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |archivedate=2010-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negativland.com/archives/003kjr/ KJR Prank]. "Negativland pranks clear channel, forces radio format change. For immediate release 8/25/2003".&lt;/ref&gt;

Former member Don Joyce long hosted a weekly radio show called [[Over the Edge (radio)|Over the Edge]] most Thursdays at midnight on [[KPFA]].  Recordings of some noteworthy episodes of the show have been released by Seeland in its ''Over the Edge'' series.

In September 2005, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, Negativland curated an art exhibit in Manhattan's [[Gigantic Artspace]] gallery. The exhibit, ''Negativlandland'', included a number of pieces of artwork from and inspired by Negativland recordings, video projection of music videos created by the band and others, and some artwork created specifically for the show, such as an animatronic Abraham Lincoln figure (inspired by the band's Lincoln cut-up piece ''God Bull'') and a hands-on exhibit featuring the ''Booper'', the audio-processing unit that band member David Wills (a.k.a. ''The Weatherman'') assembled out of old radio parts. The show appeared in [[Minneapolis]] on May 12, 2006, at Creative Electric Studios.

===2010s===

Former band member Ian Allen died on January 17, 2015, due to complications from heart valve surgery. He was 56 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2015.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club - January to June 2015|publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 2015 Don Joyce, group member and host of Over The Edge, died of heart failure at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?p=696|title=Don Joyce (9 February 1944 – 22 July 2015)|work=Negativworldwidewebland|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2016, Richard Lyons died from complications of nodular melanoma following his 57th birthday party in a nursing facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/richard-lyons-negativland-founder-dead-at-57-20160421 "Richard Lyons, Negativland Founder, Dead at 57", by Kory Grow, ''Rolling Stone'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/1Ui0zCM | title=Richard Lyons, 57, a Founder of the Subversive Band Negativland, Dies | publisher=New York Times | date=27 April 2016 | accessdate=11 July 2016 | author=Ratliff, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's latest album, ''Over the Edge Vol. 9: The Chopping Channel'', was released on October 21, 2016. Select copies of the album include a bag containing two grams of Don Joyce's cremated remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilton|first1=Robin|title=New Negativland Album Comes With A Bag Of A Band Member's Remains|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/10/18/498411077/new-negativland-album-comes-with-a-bag-of-a-band-members-remains|website=NPR.org|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15818">The '''Personal Rule''' (also known as the '''Eleven Years' Tyranny''') was the period from 1629 to 1640, when King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] ruled without recourse to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. The King claimed that he was entitled to do this under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]]. 

Charles had already dissolved three Parliaments by the third year of his reign in 1628. After the murder of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham]], who was deemed to have a negative influence on Charles' foreign policy, Parliament began to criticize the king more harshly than before. Charles then realized that, as long as he could avoid war, he could rule without Parliament.

== Names ==
[[British Whig Party|Whig]] historians such as [[S.R. Gardiner]] called this period the "Eleven Years' Tyranny", because they interpret Charles's actions as authoritarian and a contributing factor to the instability that led to the [[English Civil War]]. More recent historians such as Kevin Sharp called the period "Personal Rule", because they consider it to be a neutral term, and some such as Sharpe have emphasised the positive aspects of the period.{{sfn|Seel|Smith|2005|p=67}}

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
In the [[Medieval]] period, government in England was very much centred on the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom#English monarchy|King]]. He ruled personally, usually assisted by his Council, the [[Curia Regis]]. The council members were chosen by the King, and its membership varied greatly, but members often included powerful [[nobility]] and churchmen, senior [[civil servant]]s, and sometimes certain members of the King's friends and family.

Early parliaments began to emerge under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], who wished to implement [[taxation]] changes and wide-ranging law reforms, and sought to gain the consent of the nation. Nevertheless, calling a parliament was an expensive and time-consuming process, requiring many personal invitations (for the [[House of Lords]]) and elections in the [[shire]]s and chartered [[city|cities]] and [[borough]]s. So parliaments would only be summoned on particularly important occasions. Once a parliament had finished its business, the King would dissolve it, and perhaps not summon another for an extended period; in the meantime, the Curia Regis – that is, the King with his chosen advisers – would make laws ("ordinances"), spend money, and carry on the business of government.

From the 14th to the 16th centuries, the acknowledged powers of Parliament grew. In particular, it was established that Parliament was the only body that could authorise nationwide taxation and excise. There were practical underpinnings to these powers, for those who elected representatives to Parliament at this time were the same people the monarch had to rely on to collect and remit taxes on a large scale: the landed gentry. If a sovereign were to attempt to impose new taxes without consulting the gentry then the gentry could have simply refused to collect the taxes, and the monarch would have had little feasible recourse.

Once summoned, a parliament could take the opportunity to submit policy proposals to the monarch ("[[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s"), which would be expected to take precedence over ordinances if signed into law by the monarch, although (s)he was under no obligation to grant the [[Royal Assent]] to any such proposal. However, monarchs did increasingly use parliaments more widely in lawmaking as a way of gaining popular support for their policies. One example was during the [[English Reformation]], when the Reformation Parliament acting at [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s instigation passed a succession of laws regulating the [[Anglican Church|church in England]].

The first of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchs to rule England, [[James I of England|James I]], was perennially short of money and he was obliged to summon parliaments often. Successive parliaments thereupon sought to turn the King's financial woes to their advantage, requiring various policy concessions before voting taxes. In 1625, James was succeeded by his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who immediately plunged England into an expensive and ultimately unsuccessful war with Spain, in an attempt to force the Catholic Spanish King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] to intercede with the Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] on behalf of Charles's brother-in-law, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], the husband of Charles's sister Elizabeth, to regain the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] and his hereditary lands, which the Emperor had taken from him.

Parliament's protests about the war's mismanagement by the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], and others of Charles' policies, primarily regarding taxation and other methods of acquiring funds, and Charles' refusal to compromise, eventually led to Charles dissolving Parliament in March 1629. He also made peace with Spain and France, largely because the financial burden of waging these wars could not be sustained without funds that Parliament alone could provide.  For the next eleven years, Charles governed with only an advisory council of royal appointees.

==Finances==
The greatest problem Charles initially encountered at this stage was a continued lack of funds. The main sources of income for the King were customs duties, feudal dues and income from the King's personal estates. Nationwide taxation was widely understood to be for emergencies and special purposes, such as war, and it was by this time generally accepted that only Parliament could authorise a general tax. But even in peacetime, the traditional sources of the King's revenue were stretched to the limit to fund the business of government. So Charles and his advisers developed various schemes to raise additional revenue without recourse to Parliament. 

A large fiscal deficit had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|p=40}} Notwithstanding Buckingham's short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, there was little financial capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign Charles was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister, Elizabeth, and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate.{{sfn|Sharpe|1992|pp=509–536, 541–545, 825–834}} England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|p=220}} To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the "Distraint of Knighthood", in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king's coronation to be knighted. Relying on this old statute, Charles fined individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlton|1995|p=190}}; {{harvnb|Gregg|1981|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For comparison, a typical farm labourer could earn 8d a day, or about £10 a year.{{sfn|Edwards|1999|p=18}} }}

The chief tax imposed by Charles was a feudal levy known as [[ship money]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlton|1995|p=191}}; {{harvnb|Quintrell|1993|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than [[tonnage and poundage]] before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adamson|2007|pp=8–9}}; {{harvnb|Sharpe|1992|pp=585–588}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king's prerogative, though some of them had reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cust|2005|pp=130, 193}}; {{harvnb|Quintrell|1993|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution of [[John Hampden]] for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cust|2005|p=194}}; {{harvnb|Gregg|1981|pp=301–302}}; {{harvnb|Quintrell|1993|pp=65–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king also derived money through the granting of monopolies, despite a [[Statute of Monopolies|statute forbidding such action]], which, though inefficient, raised an estimated £100,000 a year in the late 1630s.{{sfn|Loades|1974|p=385}}{{efn|The statute forbade grants of monopolies to individuals but Charles circumvented the restriction by granting monopolies to companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|2003|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Gregg|1981|pp=215–216}}; {{harvnb|Hibbert|1968|p=138}}; {{harvnb|Loades|1974|p=385}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Charles also raised funds from the Scottish nobility, at the price of considerable acrimony, by the Act of Revocation (1625), whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility since 1540 were revoked, with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent. In addition, the boundaries of the [[royal forest]]s in England were extended to their ancient limits as part of a scheme to maximise income by exploiting the land and fining land users within the re-asserted boundaries for encroachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlton|1995|p=190}}; {{harvnb|Gregg|1981|pp=224–227}}; {{harvnb|Quintrell|1993|pp=61–62}}; {{harvnb|Sharpe|1992|pp=116–120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sales of Royal lands, especially the large expanses of under-developed [[Royal forests]] also contributed to finances. Courtiers were asked to survey the lands, to provide programmes to disafforest these areas. The focus of the programme was disafforestation and sale of forest lands for development as pasture and arable, or in the case of the [[Forest of Dean]], development for the iron industry. This included providing compensation to people using the lands in common, especially manorial lords and their tenants. Others who had settled illegally were not entitled to compensation and frequently rioted. The discontent following a major wave of sales included what was known as the [[Western Rising and disafforestation riots|Western Rising]], but extended beyond, for instance to riots in [[Feckenham Forest]] and [[Malvern Chase]].{{sfn|Sharp|1980|p={{page needed|date=May 2017}} }}

The practice of granting extensive monopolies agitated the public, who were forced to pay higher prices by the monopoly holders. Against the background of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in the summer of 1640 as parliament continued to refuse new taxes. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances further refused to make any loans to the king, and likewise he was unable to subscribe any foreign loans. In this extremity, Charles seized the money held in trust at the mint of the Exchequer in the tower of London. The royal mint held a monopoly on the exchange of foreign coin and from this the mint operated as a bank containing much capital of the merchants and goldsmiths of the city. In July, Charles seized all £130,000 of this money, and in August he followed it up by seizing all the stocks of pepper held by the East India Company, and selling it at distress prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1912|pp=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side of the ledger, the government tried to reduce expenditure, especially by avoiding war (thus pursuing an [[isolationist]] foreign policy) and also avoiding large-scale innovations on the domestic front.  Of equal importance, Charles learned to spend less extravagantly compared to his father.

==End==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The Personal Rule began to unravel in 1637, when Charles, along with his advisor [[William Laud|Archbishop Laud]], attempted to reform the then-episcopal [[Church of Scotland]] to bring it into line, especially in its liturgy, with the [[Church of England]]. This met with immense Scottish opposition and when negotiations broke down, a Scottish army invaded England (see the [[Bishop's War]]). Charles could not afford to pay English troops to fight the Scots, and was obliged in 1640 to call the [[Short Parliament]]. This ended the Personal Rule, though Charles dissolved the Short Parliament after only a few days; by the end of the year, with the Scots still in England and no other routes left to him, he summoned the [[Long Parliament]]. In the months that followed, the Parliamentary leaders, turning their attention to domestic matters, demanded from Charles ever more sweeping concessions over government policy. In 1642, Charles left London to raise an army and regain control by force, and the [[English Civil War]] began.

==Ethics of process==
The  [[Italians|Italian]] [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] is heralded as the founding father of the political ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Machiavelli, Niccolò. ''The Prince and the Discourses'' (McGraw Hill, 1950). {{ISBN|978-0075535775}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that a political leader may be required to commit acts that would be wrong if done by private. In contemporary democracies, this idea has been reframed as the problem of [[dirty hands]], described most influentially by [[Michael Walzer]], who argues that the problem creates a paradox: the politician must sometimes do “wrong to do right”.&lt;ref&gt;Walzer, Michael. “Political Action: The Problem of Dirty Hands,” ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'' 2 (1973), pp. 160-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The politician uses violence to prevent greater violence, but his act is still wrong even if justified. [[Michael Walzer|Walzer’s]] view has been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Rynard, and David P. Shugarman (eds.). ''Cruelty &amp; Deception: The Controversy over Dirty Hands in Politics'' (Broadview Press, 2000). {{ISBN|978-1864031072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics object that either the politician is justified or not. If justified, there is nothing wrong, though he may feel guilty. Others say that some of the acts of violence that [[Michael Walzer|Walzer]] would allow are never justified, no matter what the ends. [[Dennis Frank Thompson|Dennis Thompson]] has argued that in a democracy citizens should hold the leader responsible, and therefore if the act is unjustified their hands are dirty too.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. “Democratic Dirty Hands,” in ''Political Ethics and Public Office'' (Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 11-39. {{ISBN|9780674686069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In large organizations it is often not possible to tell who is actually responsible for the outcomes—a problem known as [[the problem of many hands]].&lt;ref name="Thompson_2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dennis F. |chapter=The Problem of Many Hands |title=Restoring Responsibility: Ethics in Government, Business and Healthcare |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2005 |pages=11-32}} {{ISBN|9780521547222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political ethics not only permit leaders to do things that would be wrong in private life, but also requires them to meet higher standards than would be necessary in private life. They may, for example, have less of a right of privacy than do ordinary citizens, and no right to use their office for personal profit. The major issues here concern [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Andrew. ''Conflict of Interest in American Public Life''. (Harvard University Press, 2003). {{ISBN|9780674012134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics of policy==
In the other area of political ethics, the key issues are not the conflict between means and ends but the conflicts among the ends themselves. For example, in the question of [[global justice]], the conflict is between the claims of the [[nation state]] and citizens on one side and the claims of all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Beitz, Charles. “Review Article: International Liberalism and Distributive Justice: A Survey of Recent Thought,” ''World Politics'' 51 (1999), pp. 269-296.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, priority has been given to the claims of nations, but in recent years thinkers known as cosmopolitans have pressed the claims of all citizens of the world.

Political ethics deals not mainly with ideal justice, however, but with realizing moral values in democratic societies where citizens (and philosophers) disagree about what ideal justice is. In a pluralist society, how if at all can governments justify a policy of progressive taxation, [[affirmative action]], the right to abortion, [[universal healthcare]], and the like?&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see note 3 below.&lt;/ref&gt; Political ethics is also concerned with moral problems raised by the need for political [[compromise]], [[whistleblowing]], [[civil disobedience]], and criminal punishment.

==Criticisms==
Some critics (so called [[Political realism|political realists]]) argue that ethics has no place in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/realism-intl-relations/ Korab-Karpowicz, W. Julian. “Political Realism in International Relations,” ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).]&lt;/ref&gt; If politicians are to be effective in the real world, they cannot be bound by moral rules. They have to pursue the [[national interest]]. However, [[Michael Walzer|Walzer]] points out that if the [[Political realism|realists]] are asked to justify their claims, they will almost always appeal to moral principles of their own (for example, to show that ethics is harmful or counterproductive).&lt;ref&gt;Walzer, Michael. ''Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations'' (Basic Books, 1977), pp. 4-13. {{ISBN|978-0465037070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of criticism comes from those who argue that we should not pay so much attention to politicians and policies but should instead look more closely at the larger structures of society where the most serious ethical problems lie.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Brian. ''Why Social Justice Matters'' (Polity Press, 2005). {{ISBN|978-0745629933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of political ethics respond that while structural injustice should not be ignored, too much emphasis on structures neglects the human agents who are responsible for changing them.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1987), pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7195">'''Protective signs''' are symbols to be used during an [[War|armed conflict]] to mark persons and objects under the [[protected person|protection]] of various treaties of [[international humanitarian law]] (IHL). While their essential meaning can be summarized as "Don't shoot" or "Don't attack", the exact conditions implied vary depending on the respective sign and the circumstances of its use. The form, shape and color of these signs are defined by the rules of IHL. Usually, they are easy to draw in order to make even an improvised use as easy as possible, and they were chosen to be as concise, recognizable and visible as possible under all circumstances.

Usage of protective signs is restricted to armed conflicts. They are to be used only by eligible organizations or groups to mark their personnel, vehicles, buildings and other objects. The misuse of protective signs is a violation of international humanitarian law and punishable under the national law of all countries who are state parties to the respective treaties.

== List of protective signs ==

The following signs have a protective meaning under certain conditions:

* the Red Cross&lt;ref name="GC1"&gt;Defined in article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field; August 12, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; and the equivalent signs of the Red Crescent,&lt;ref name="GC1"/&gt; the Red Lion with Sun&lt;ref name="GC1"/&gt; and the Red Crystal &lt;ref name="ZP3"&gt;Defined in article 2 of the Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem (Protocol III), 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to be used to mark all persons and objects under the protection of the four [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949 and their additional protocols of 1977; see [[emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]
* a blue triangle on orange ground as the international distinctive sign of civil defence;&lt;ref name="PA1-A66"&gt;Defined in article 66 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts; June 8, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; to be used to mark the personnel and objects of [[Civil defense|civil defense organizations]]
* the letters "PG" or "PW" to mark a [[prisoner of war]] camp&lt;ref name="GC3"&gt;Defined in article 23 of the Geneva Conventions relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War; August 12, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; and the letters "IC" to mark an internment camp for civilians&lt;ref name="GC4"&gt;Defined in article 83 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War; August 12, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;
* an oblique red band on a white ground to mark Hospital and safety zones&lt;ref name="Gc4-Annex1"&gt;Defined in article 6 of annex I to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War; August 12, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[white flag]];&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;Defined in article 32 of the Hague Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land; July 29, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; used to designate unarmed parliamentaries (negotiators, along with their flag bearer and optional drummer) asking for a [[truce]] or [[ceasefire]], or to symbolise [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]
* the emblem of the [[United Nations]] as well as the letters "UN";&lt;ref name="UN-C"&gt;Defined in article 3 of the [[Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel]]; December 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; to be used to mark the personnel and materiel of UN [[Peacekeeping]] missions
* the distinctive mark of the [[Pax Cultura|Roerich Pact]] for the identification of historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions&lt;ref name="RP-A3"&gt;Defined in article 3 of the Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments; April 15, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; (Such as universities, theatres, [[Stonehenge]])
* the distinctive marking of cultural property,&lt;ref name="CPC-A16"&gt;Defined in article 16 of the Convention for the Protection of cultural property in the Event of Armed Conflict; May 14, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; to be used to mark "movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people"; and the triple use of that sign to mark cultural property under special protection,&lt;ref name="CPC-A16"/&gt; including "refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property" (e.g.: Paintings, sculptures, texts) and "immovable cultural property of very great importance" (such as The [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]], [[Greenwich]], [[London]] or [[The Taj Mahal]], [[Agra]], [[India]])
* the special sign used to facilitate the identification of "works and installations containing dangerous forces" ([[dam]]s, [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear electrical generating stations]]), consisting of three bright orange circles placed on the same axis&lt;ref name="PA1-A56"&gt;Defined in article 56 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts; June 8, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Of these symbols, the distinctive flag of the Roerich Pact was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the Hague Convention of 1954. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between states which are bound by the Washington Treaty of 1935 but not by the convention of 1954. In part because of the efforts of the [[U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield]], the [[United States Senate]] ratified the convention of 1954 on 2008-09-28, so as of that date, [[Chile]] is the only state where this still applies.&lt;ref name="HC2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscbs.org/resources.htm |title=U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield - 1954 Hague Convention |accessdate=2010-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, '''resisting arrest''' is a [[criminal charge]] against an individual who has committed, depending on the jurisdiction, at least one of the following acts:

* fleeing a police officer while being [[arrest]]ed
* threatening a police officer with physical violence while being arrested
* physically struggling to free oneself from being restrained (handcuffed or put into the [[Police transportation|police vehicle]])
* attacking a police officer while being arrested (also known as assault)
* providing an officer with false identification (either verbally or by presentation of a false official document, i.e. a [[fake ID]])

==United States==
The courts in the United States regard resisting arrest as a separate charge or crime in addition to other alleged crimes committed by the arrested person.  It is possible to be charged, tried and convicted on this charge alone, without any underlying cause for the original decision to arrest or even if the original arrest was clearly illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14067499|title=More than a dozen San Jose officers repeatedly used force in resisting arrest cases, probe finds|author=Sean Webby     swebby@mercurynews.com|date=27 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8138600/minnesota-vikings-adrian-peterson-faces-resisting-arrest-charge-incident-houston-night-club|title=Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson faces resisting-arrest charge after incident in Houston night club|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is never advisable to resist even an unlawful arrest as it will likely result in the [[use of force]] by the arresting officer and the addition of the charge of resisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5766&amp;context=faculty_scholarship|title = Retail Rebellion and the Second Amendment|last = Miller|first = Darrell|date = 2011|journal = Duke University Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most states, see below, resisting arrest is a misdemeanor which can result in jail time.

Using or threatening to use physical force against the peace officer or another (2) Using any other means creating a substantial risk of causing physical injury to the peace officer or another (3) Engaging in passive resistance. B. Resisting arrest pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section is a class 6 felony. Resisting arrest pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section is a class 1 misdemeanor. C. For the purposes of this section, "passive resistance" means a nonviolent physical act or failure to act that is intended to impede, hinder or delay the effecting of an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 13-2508 - Resisting arrest; classification; definition|url = http://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/02508.htm|website = www.azleg.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arkansas ===
A person commits the offense of resisting arrest if he or she knowingly resists a person known by him or her to be a law enforcement officer effecting an arrest. (2) As used in this subsection, "resists" means using or threatening to use physical force or any other means that creates a substantial risk of physical injury to any person. (3) It is no defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the law enforcement officer lacked legal authority to make the arrest if the law enforcement officer was acting under color of his or her official authority. (4) Resisting arrest is a Class A misdemeanor. (b)  (1) A person commits the offense of refusal to submit to arrest if he or she knowingly refuses to submit to arrest by a person known by him or her to be a law enforcement officer effecting an arrest. (2) As used in this subsection, "refuses" means active or passive refusal.

=== California ===
Every person who willfully resists, delays, or obstructs any public officer, peace officer, or an emergency medical technician, as defined in Division 2.5 (commencing with Section 1797) of the Health and Safety Code, in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of his or her office or employment, when no other punishment is prescribed, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Things You Didn't Know About Resisting Arrest {{!}} PC 148(a)(1) PC|url = http://www.lacriminaldefensepartners.com/resisting-arrest-penal-code-148-pc/|website = Aizman Law Firm|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colorado ===
A person commits resisting arrest if he knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a peace officer, acting under color of his official authority, from effecting an arrest of the actor or another, by: (a) Using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the peace officer or another; or (b) Using any other means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to the peace officer or another. It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the peace officer was attempting to make an arrest which in fact was unlawful, if he was acting under color of his official authority, and in attempting to make the arrest he was not resorting to unreasonable or excessive force giving rise to the right of self-defense. A peace officer acts "under color of his official authority" when, in the regular course of assigned duties, he is called upon to make, and does make, a judgment in good faith based upon surrounding facts and circumstances that an arrest should be made by him. The term "peace officer" as used in this section and section 18-8-104 means a peace officer in uniform or, if out of uniform, one who has identified himself by exhibiting his credentials as such peace officer to the person whose arrest is attempted. Resisting arrest is a class 2 misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Resisting Arrest Misdemeanor in Colorado|url = http://www.lawinfoboulder.com/colorado_statutes/resisting_arrest.html|website = www.lawinfoboulder.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connecticut ===
Interfering with an Officer:

A person is guilty of interfering with an officer when such person obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers any (peace officer / special policeman / motor vehicle inspector / firefighter) in the performance of such (peace officer's / special policeman’s / inspector’s / firefighter's) duties.

Resisting Arrest With Force:

The effect of § 53a-23 is to require a person to submit to an arrest, even if he or she believes, and ultimately it is determined, that the arrest is illegal.  This provision must be charged in conjunction with the crimes of Interfering with an Officer (§ 53a-167a) or Assault on Public Safety or Emergency Medical Personnel (§ 53a-167c).  See Interfering with an Officer, Instruction 4.3-1, and Assault of Public Safety or Emergency Medical Personnel, Instruction 4.3-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Criminal Jury Instructions 4.3-1|url = https://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/Criminal/Part4/4.3-1.htm|website = www.jud.ct.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delaware ===
A person is guilty of resisting arrest with force or violence when: (1) The person intentionally prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer from effecting an arrest or detention of the person or another person by use of force or violence towards said police officer, or (2) Intentionally flees from a police officer who is effecting an arrest against them by use of force or violence towards said police officer, or (3) Injures or struggles with said police officer causing injury to the police officer.

RESISTING ARREST The defendant is charged with resisting arrest. Section 32B of chapter 268 of our General Laws provides as follows: “A person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he [she] knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer, acting under color of his [her] official authority, from effecting an arrest of [himself] or another [either] by using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another; or [by] using any other means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police officer or another.” In order to prove the defendant guilty of this offense, the Commonwealth must prove four things beyond a reasonable doubt: First: That the defendant prevented or attempted to prevent a police officer from making an arrest (of the defendant) (or) (of another person); Second: That the officer was acting under color of his (her) official authority at the time; Third: That the defendant resisted: either by using, or threatening to use, physical force or violence against the police officer (or another person); or by using some other means which created a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to the police officer (or another person); and Fourth: That the defendant did so knowingly; that is to say, that the defendant knew at the time that he (she) was acting to prevent an arrest by a police officer acting under color of his (her) official authority. As I have indicated, the Commonwealth must prove that the police officer was acting “under color of official authority.” A police officer acts “under color of official authority” when, in the regular course of assigned duties, he (she) makes a judgment in good faith, based on the surrounding facts and circumstances, that he (she) should make an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/courts-and-judges/courts/district-court/jury-instructions-criminal/6000-9999/7460-resisting-arrest.pdf|title = Mass Statue Resisting Arrest|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SoundExchange''' is a [[non-profit]] [[Collective rights management|collective rights management]] organization.  It is the sole organization designated by the U.S. Congress to collect and distribute digital performance [[royalties]] for sound recordings. It pays featured and non-featured artists and master rights owners for the non-interactive use of sound recordings under the statutory licenses set forth in {{UnitedStatesCode|17|112}} and {{UnitedStatesCode|17|114}}.&lt;ref name="MBW"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingham|first1=Tim|title=WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR SOUNDEXCHANGE?|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/what-does-the-future-hold-for-soundexchange/|accessdate=6 December 2017|work=Music Business Worldwide|date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sisario"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisario|first1=Ben|title=Rise of SoundExchange Shows the Growth of Digital Radio Royalties|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/business/media/rise-of-soundexchange-shows-the-growth-of-digital-radio-royalties.html?_r=0|accessdate=6 December 2017|work=New York Times|date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SoundExchange was created as a division of the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 2000. In 2001, major record labels and artists agreed on a standard for paying royalties earned from cable and satellite music services, and SoundExchange made its first payment, distributing $5.2 million in royalties to recording artists and labels. &lt;ref name="Leeds 2001"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeds|first1=Jeff|title=Record Labels, Artists Reach Services Accord|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/08/business/fi-1527|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=November 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, four years after the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] granted webcasters an automatic license to play copyrighted music provided that a royalty was paid, a lengthy  arbitration process was concluded, and a royalty rate was set. SoundExchange was spun off from the RIAA and became an independent non-profit corporation in 2003. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/21/business/technology-internet-radio-criticizes-rate-on-royalties.html|title=TECHNOLOGY; Internet Radio Criticizes Rate On Royalties|last=Harmon|first=Amy|date=2002-06-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oew-healey11jun11-story.html|title=Battle Royalty|date=2007-06-11|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

SoundExchange's first executive director was John Simson, a musician, attorney, and artist manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/02/AR2007070201647.html|title=Jeffrey H.

In 2018 it was announced that the organization had extended his contract through 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://musicrow.com/2018/01/soundexchange-board-extends-presidentceo-michael-huppes-contract/|title=SoundExchange Board Extends President/CEO Michael Huppe’s Contract|date=2018-01-10|work=MusicRow - Nashville's Music Industry Publication - News, Songs From Music City|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard 2018" /&gt; He also serves as the chairman of the board of SXWorks, a subsidiary created by SoundExchange following its acquisition of the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Association (CMRRA).  SXWorks provides administration and back office services to publishers to support multiple licensing configurations. &lt;ref name="Billboard CMRRA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christman|first1=Ed|title=SoundExchange Is Officially Buying CMRRA, A Move Reflecting Evolving Digital Markets|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7793209/soundexchange-buying-cmrra-reflects-evolving-markets|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=Billboard|date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2012, the company announced that it had paid over $1 billion in royalties since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/06/18/soundexchange-passes-1-billion-mark-in-music-royalties-paid/|title=SoundExchange Passes $1 Billion Mark In Music Royalties Paid|last=Greenburg|first=Zack O'Malley|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;As of 2018, it had paid more than $5 billion,&lt;ref name="HR 2018" /&gt; with recording artists and rights holders paid $884 million in 2016 alone.&lt;ref name="Billboard 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard CMRRA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christman|first1=Ed|title=SoundExchange Is Officially Buying CMRRA, A Move Reflecting Evolving Digital Markets|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7793209/soundexchange-buying-cmrra-reflects-evolving-markets|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=Billboard|date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
SoundExchange exists to administer statutory licenses for sound recording copyrights, primarily through the collection and distribution of royalties for sound recording performances occurring under the jurisdiction of federal law. SoundExchange handles the following duties with respect to statutory licenses:
*Collects performance royalties from the statutory licensees;
*Collects and processes all data associated with the performance of the sound recordings;
*Allocates royalties for the performance of the sound recording based on all of the data collected and processed;
*Distributes the featured artist's share directly to the artist;
*Distributes the copyright owner's share directly to the copyright owner;
*Distributes the non-featured artist's share to [[SAG-AFTRA]] and [[American Federation of Musicians|AFM]]'s Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund; and
*Provides detailed reports summarizing the titles, featured artists, and royalty amounts for each of the sound recordings performed by the statutory licensees.

An administrative fee is deducted from royalties before they are distributed, with the remainder divided between the performing artists on a given recording, and the copyright owner of that recording. SoundExchange collects and distributes royalties for all artists and copyright owners covered under the statutory licenses. It has collection agreements with more than 40 international performance rights organizations around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soundexchange.com/artist-copyright-owner/registration-membership/member-benefits/international-collection/|title=International Collection - SoundExchange|work=SoundExchange|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing it to collect and pay royalties to recording artists and rights owners when their music is played in those countries. In 2017, SoundExchange expanded into music publisher administration with its acquisition of Canadian [[Mechanical rights|mechanical rights]] society CMRRA. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/michael-huppe-signs-4-year-extension-remain-soundexchange-ceo/|title=Michael Huppe signs 4-year extension to continue as SoundExchange CEO - Music Business Worldwide|date=2018-01-10|work=Music Business Worldwide|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Authority and structure==
SoundExchange is designated by the [[Librarian of Congress]] as the sole organization authorized to collect royalties paid by services making ephemeral phonorecords or digital audio transmissions of sound recordings, or both, under the statutory licenses set forth in [[Title 17 of the United States Code|17 U.S.C.]] § 112 and [[Title 17 of the United States Code|17 U.S.C.]] § 114. As of January 1, 2003, SoundExchange is designated by the [[United States Copyright Office]] to also distribute the collected royalties to copyright owners and performers entitled under and pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 114(g)(2). Incorporated in the State of Delaware, SoundExchange is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. It operates, in part, pursuant to Copyright Office regulations set forth in 37 C.F.R. Parts 370, 380, 382, 383 and 384.&lt;ref name="notice_of_designation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/carp/notice-designation-collective.pdf|title=Notice of Designation As Collective Under Statutory License filed with the Licensing Division of the Copyright Office|accessdate=2008-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030220250/http://www.copyright.gov/carp/notice-designation-collective.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

SoundExchange is controlled by a Board of Directors composed of recording artists, representatives of recording artists and sound recording copyright owners. As of 2017, the board was composed of Duncan Crabtree-Ireland ([[SAG-AFTRA]]), Jay L. Cooper (attorney), Andrea Finkelstein (Sony Music Entertainment, Inc.), Ray Hair (American Federation of Musicians), Jeff Harleston (Universal Music Group), Michael Hausman (artist manager), Steve Marks (RIAA), [[David Byrne]] (artist), Kendall Minter (attorney), Richard Burgess (American Association of Independent Music), Patrick Rains (artist manager, PRA Records), [[Martha Reeves]] (artist), Perry Resnick (RZO Royalty Management), Paul Robinson (Warner Music Group), Cary Sherman (RIAA), Darius Van Arman (Secretly Group), Ron Wilcox (Warner Music Group) and Victor Zaraya (Razor &amp; Tie).&lt;ref name="BoD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=https://www.soundexchange.com/about/our-team/board-of-directors/|website=soundexchange.com|publisher=SoundExchange|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Royalty rate setting==
As required by {{UnitedStatesCode|17|112}} and {{UnitedStatesCode|17|114}}, SoundExchange, along with other interested parties, participates in each periodic rate-making proceedings to establish rates that compensate copyright owners and performers for the use of copyrighted sound recordings. Such rate setting proceedings may be resolved through proceedings through the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB).&lt;ref name="Sirius settlement 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steele|first1=Anne|title=Sirius XM Satellite Radio to Pay Higher Royalty Rate Starting in 2018|url=http://news.morningstar.com/all/dow-jones/us-markets/201712156584/sirius-xm-satellite-radio-to-pay-higher-royalty-rate-starting-in-2018.aspx|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=Dow Jones (via Morningstar)|date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Satellite radio===
In December 2017, the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) increased the [[Sirius XM]] royalty rate from 11.5% of revenue to 15.5% of revenue through 2022.&lt;ref name="Billboard Sirius Optimism"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bliss|first1=Karen|title=SoundExchange CEO Points to SiriusXM's Growth for Royalty Rate Increase Optimism|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7775025/soundexchange-michael-huppe-siriusxm-royaltiy-rates-crb|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=Billboard|date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRB also rendered a decision on royalty rates paid by [[Muzak]] and [[Music Choice]] in December 2017, reducing the royalty rates paid by those services from 8.5% of revenue to 7.5% of revenue. &lt;ref name="BB muzak"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flanagan|first1=Andrew|title=SoundExchange Files Its Second Lawsuit Over Improper Royalties|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6524108/soundexchange-second-lawsuit-muzak-mood-media|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Billboard|date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 SoundExchange sued Muzak for underpayments of royalties to artists and rights holders. Because its royalty rate was established before the DMCA was enacted, Muzak's streaming services to [[Dish Network]] subscribers was allowed a grandfathered rate standard that resulted in lower royalty rates. The SoundExchange lawsuit sought to implement the standard royalty rate for new subscriptions on Muzak’s
streaming services to other cable/satellite TV providers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-mood-media-announces-update-to-cou/brief-mood-media-announces-update-to-court-proceedings-involving-its-subsidiary-muzak-llc-idUSASA09KE0|title=BRIEF-Mood media announces update to court proceedings involving its subsidiary MuzakLLC|date=April 26, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Webcasting===
The CRB judges established webcasting rates on December 16, 2015, for the 2016-2020 term – $0.0017 for non-subscription performances and $0.0020 for subscription performances for commercial webcasters in 2017, with rates for each subsequent year adjusted upward or downward, according to the Consumer Price Index for the year.  As of 2018, webcasting rates were $0.0018 for non-subscription services and $0.0023 for subscription services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2015/12/articles/crb-announces-webcasting-royalty-rates-for-2016-2020-lower-rates-for-broadcasters-who-stream-minimal-change-for-pureplay-webcasters/|title=CRB Announces Webcasting Royalty Rates for 2016-2020 – Lower Rates for Broadcasters Who Stream, Minimal Change for Pureplay Webcasters {{!}} Broadcast Law Blog|date=2015-12-17|work=Broadcast Law Blog|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Advocacy efforts==
SoundExchange is an advocate for the reform of U.S. music licensing laws, seeking to ensure that music creators earn fair market value for their work when it is used on any music platform. During the 115&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Congress, SoundExchange actively supported the Fair Play Fair Pay Act of 2017 (H.R.1836) and the [[CLASSICS Act]] (H.R.3301). It is a founding member of musicFIRST, a coalition of organizations representing musicians, recording artists, managers, music businesses, and performance rights advocates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-fair-play-fair-pay-act-congress-radio-royalties-20150413-story.html|title=Fair Play, Fair Pay Act of 2015 would require radio to pay for music|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=2015-04-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/congresss-chance-to-be-fair-to-musicians|title=Congress’s Chance to Be Fair to Musicians|last=Tobin|first=Jeffrey|date=2016-05-18|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-01-08|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/fair-play-fair-pay-radio-royalty-act-gains-momentum-1202462359/|title=‘Fair Play, Fair Pay’ Radio-Royalty Act Gains Momentum, But Faces Uphill Climb|last=Parisi|first=Paula|date=2017-06-12|work=Variety|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/2/5/11558712/copyright-office-has-thoughts-on-what-streaming-music-services-should|title=Copyright Office Has Thoughts on What Streaming Music Services Should Pay for Music|work=Recode|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and initiatives==
In March 2016 SoundExchange introduced an online service to allow music services to locate [[Metadata|metadata]] for 20 million sound recordings in its database. The service allows users to search SoundExchange’s database of international standard recording rates, unique identifiers for sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6898444/soundexchange-isrc-tool|title=SoundExchange Debuts Search Tool for Song Codes|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/03/soundexchange-launches-free-20-million-song-search-database.html|title=SoundExchange Launches Free 20 Million Song Search Database|website=hypebot|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 the SoundExchange subsidiary SXWorks launched NOI (Notice of Intention) Lookup.  It allows songwriters and publishers to search a U.S. copyright database which indexes "Address Unknown" notices, the term used when a music service files an intention to use a musical work, but claims that they cannot locate the copyright owner. A free tool, it allows copyright owners to identify their work. In 2017, an average  of 2.5 million monthly address unknown NOI filings were submitted to the US Copyright Office by music services. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/soundexchanges-sxworks-launches-free-tool-to-fix-widespread-noi-copyright-problem-in-the-us/|title=SoundExchange's SXWorks launches free tool to fix widespread NOI copyright problem in the US - Music Business Worldwide|date=2018-01-23|work=Music Business Worldwide|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Criticism==
A 2007 royalty rate increase was reported as establishing a rate that would "render Internet radio unsustainable, or at the very least, more ad-laden than terrestrial radio." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/03/us-copyright-ro/|title=U.S. Copyright Royalty Board Rejects Webcasters, Embraces SoundExchange|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics charged that in negotiating the royalty, SoundExchange was concerned primarily with major labels and their artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9163084|title=New Royalty Rules May Reshape Internet Radio|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of internet broadcasters participated in a "day of silence" protest by cancelling their programming on June 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/25/AR2007062501801.html|title=Web Radio Stations Hope Silence Speaks Volumes About Fee Hike|last=Musgrove|first=Mike|date=2007-06-26|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sydney APEC Leaders' Declaration on Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development''' was adopted at [[APEC Australia 2007]] on 8 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/apec/sydney-declaration-on-climate-change-and-energy/2007/09/09/1189276526002.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 Sydney Declaration on Climate Change and Energy]'', Sydney Morning Herald, 9 September 2007. See also ''[http://www.smh.com.au/pdf/leadersstatement.pdf Leaders Statement (PDF)]'' Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement indicates the wish of signatories to work towards aspirational goals on energy efficiency per unit of [[GDP]] while encouraging [[forest cover]] in the region. The APEC wide regional aspirational goal is to reduce energy intensity by at least 25 percent by 2030 from the 2005 level, and set an APEC-wide regional goal of increasing forest cover in the region by 200,000 square kilometres by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/apec-climate-agreement-a-diplomatic-breakthrough/2007/09/09/1189276521977.html APEC climate agreement a 'diplomatic breakthrough]'', The Age, 9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Environmental and climate organisations such as [[Greenpeace]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Climate Action Network]] criticised the agreement for not setting binding targets on [[greenhouse gas emissions]] for developed countries, and that the statement was little more than a political stunt.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/09/2027701.htm Govt, green groups face off over Sydney Declaration]'' ABC News,  9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace media release, ''[http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/news-and-events/media/releases/climate-change/apec-declaration-a-sydney-dist APEC declaration a Sydney distraction from action on climate change]'', Greenpeace website, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] pointed out that Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] told an APEC lecture in Melbourne in April 2007 that aspirational targets are a "political stunt" and "not a real target at all".&lt;ref&gt;Liz Micnchin, ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/q-when-is-a-stunt-not-a-stunt-a-when-the-boss-likes-the-idea/2007/09/06/1188783413265.html Q: When is a stunt not a stunt? A: When the boss likes the idea]'', The Age, 7 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One Greenpeace spokesperson said the declaration should be named the "'''Sydney Distraction'''" on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gartrell, ''[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22384889-5005961,00.html Greenpeace slams APEC climate pact]'', Herald Sun, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] called the declaration "very weak" and said the "declaration does not advance global discussions on climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation Meadia Release, ''[http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=1408 APEC’s Sydney Declaration is weak on climate ]'' Australian Conservation Foundation website, 8 September 2007.

A '''TXT record''' (short for '''text record''') is a type of [[Domain Name System#DNS resource records|resource record]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) used to provide the ability to associate arbitrary text with a host or other name, such as human readable information about a server, network, data center, or other accounting information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=RFC 1464 Using the Domain Name System To Store Arbitrary String Attributes|rfc=1464|author= Rich Rosenbaum|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1464|year=1993|month=May|accessdate=2016-02-05|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
A domain may have multiple TXT records associated with it, provided the DNS server implementation supports this.&lt;ref name="rfc1464"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1464|title=Using the Domain Name System To Store Arbitrary String Attributes|first=R.|last=Rosenbaum|website=Tools.ietf.org|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each record can in turn have one or more character strings.&lt;ref name="rfc1035"&gt;{{cite IETF |section=3.3.14 |sectionname=TXT RDATA format |title=Domain names - implementation and specification | rfc=1035 |year=1987 |month=November |author=P. Mockapetris |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common uses include verification of domain ownership; implementation of [[Sender Policy Framework]],&lt;ref name="rfc7208-txt"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1 |rfc=7208 |sectionname=DNS Resource Records |section=3.1 |author=Scott Kitterman |year=2014 |month=April |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=2014-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DomainKeys]], or [[DomainKeys Identified Mail]] records for verifying the sender of [[email]] messages;&lt;ref name=google-help&gt;{{cite web|title=About TXT records|url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/2716800|website=Google Apps Administration|publisher=Google|accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zero-configuration networking#DNS-based service discovery|Zero-configuration networking DNS-based service discovery]].&lt;ref name="rfc6762"&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=6762 |year=2013 |month=February |author=S. Cheshire and M.

Cheshire and M. Krochmal, Apple Inc. |title=DNS-Based Service Discovery |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
To store new types of information, the experimental RFC 1464 suggests a structured format in TXT data fields. The format consists of the attribute name followed by the value of the attribute. The name and value are separated by an equals sign (=).&lt;ref name="rfc1464"/&gt;

The general syntax is:&lt;ref name="rfc1464"/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;owner&gt; &lt;class&gt; &lt;ttl&gt; TXT "&lt;attribute name&gt;=&lt;attribute value&gt;"&lt;/pre&gt;

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
name  class   ttl    rr     text
joe    IN           TXT    "Located in a black hole=Likely to be eaten by a grue"
&lt;/pre&gt;

# '''Name''': This is the host for the domain, which is actually a computer within the domain. The domain name is automatically appended to the host name. To make a record for the system www.example.com, the name value is just "www". If the name field is left blank, it will default to be the record for the base domain. The record for the base domain is called the ''root record'' or ''apex record''.
# '''Value''': This can be free form text data of any type. Each word is treated as a separate string unless one or more strings are enclosed in quotes. The maximum length of a string is 255 bytes, but any number of strings can be present in each record, subject to the standard DNS RDATA size limit of 65,535 bytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2009-March/075931.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019200112/https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-users/2009-March/075931.html# |archive-date=2015-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''TTL''': The TTL (Time to Live) is the amount of time, in seconds, the record will stay in cache on systems requesting your record (resolving nameservers, browsers, etc.).

=== Attribute name matching rules ===
The attribute name is considered case-insensitive.&lt;ref name="rfc1464" /&gt;

During lookups, TXT records that do not contain an unquoted "=" are ignored.  TXT records that seem to contain a null attribute name, that is, the TXT-DATA starts with the character "=", are also ignored.&lt;ref name="rfc1464"/&gt;

Leading and trailing whitespace (spaces and tabs) in the attribute name are ignored unless they are quoted with a backtick (`).&lt;ref name="rfc1464" /&gt;

Note that most DNS server implementations require a backslash (\) or double quote (") in a text string to be quoted with a preceding backslash.  The backtick (`) was chosen as a quoting character in this syntax to avoid confusion with backslash (\) (and remove the need for confusing strings that include sequences like "\\\\").&lt;ref name="rfc1464" /&gt;

=== Attribute values ===
All printable ASCII characters are permitted in the attribute value. No characters need to be quoted with a backtick (`).  In other words, the first unquoted equals sign in the TXT record is the name/value delimiter.  All subsequent characters are part of the value.&lt;ref name="rfc1464" /&gt;

'''Tim Wu''' is an American lawyer, professor at [[Columbia Law School]], and contributing opinion writer for the [[New York Times]]. He is best known for coining the phrase [[network neutrality]] in his 2003 paper ''Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = T. | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.388863 | title = Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination | journal =Journal of Telecommunications and High Technology Law | year = 2003 |volume=2 |pages=141–179 | pmid = | pmc = | ssrn=388863}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularizing the concept thereafter. Wu has also made significant contributions to [[Antitrust law|antitrust]] policy and [[wireless]] communications policy, most notably with his "[[Carterfone]]" proposal.&lt;ref name="Ante"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/nov2007/db2007117_264711.htm|title=Tim Wu, Freedom Fighter|last=Ante|first=Spencer E.|date=8 November 2008|website=|publisher=''[[BusinessWeek]]''|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wu was born in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/tim-wu/2938 |title=TIM WU |publisher=General Assembly |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Basel, Switzerland]], and [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/business/defending-the-open-internet.html?_r=0 |title=Defending the Open Internet |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 10, 2014 |first=Jeff |last=Sommer |accessdate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Alan Ming-ta Wu, was from [[Taiwan]] and his mother, [[Gillian E.

At school, he befriended [[Cory Doctorow]].&lt;ref name="nationalpost"/&gt; Wu's father died in 1980 and his mother bought him and his brother an [[Apple II]] computer using some of the insurance money, starting Wu's fascination with [[computers]].&lt;ref name="Ante" /&gt;

Wu attended [[McGill University]], where he initially studied biochemistry&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; and later switched his major to biophysics.&lt;ref name="nationalpost"/&gt; He graduated from McGill with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1995 and received his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1998. At Harvard, he studied under copyright scholar [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

==Academic career==
Wu worked with the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, after graduating from law school, and before starting a clerkship with [[Richard Posner]] on the [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1998-1999.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/Timothy_Wu |title=Tim Wu |publisher=[[Columbia University]] School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also clerked for [[Justice Stephen Breyer|Stephen Breyer]], [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1999-2000.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Following his clerkships, Wu moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], worked at [[Riverstone Networks]], Inc.

==Influence==
[[File:Wikipedia Day New York January 2017 003.jpg|thumb|left|Wu speaks on a panel at [[Wikipedia Day]] 2017.]]
Wu is credited with popularizing the concept of [[network neutrality]] in his 2003 paper ''Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination''. The paper considered network neutrality in terms of neutrality between applications, as well as neutrality between data and Quality of Service-sensitive traffic, and proposed some legislation to potentially deal with these issues.&lt;ref name="WU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepress.net/docs/timwu.pdf|title=Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination |first=Tim |last=Wu|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia Law School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2008/april2008/Wu_FreePress |title=Tim Wu Elected Board Chair At Free Press | first= |last= |date=14 April 2008 |publisher=Columbia Law School }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Wu wrote "The World Trade Law of Internet Filtering", which analyzed the possibility of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s treating [[censorship]] as a [[trade barrier|barrier to trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=Tim|title=The World Trade Law of Internet Filtering|ssrn=882459|date=2006-05-06|publisher=[[SSRN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, when [[Google Inc.]] lobbied the [[United States Trade Representative]] to pursue a complaint against China's censorship at the WTO, Wu's paper was cited as a "likely source" for this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google Fights Internet Censorship|last=Rugaber|first=Christopher S.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/25/AR2007062500364_pf.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Wu was also invited by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to help draft the first [[network neutrality]] rules attached to the [[AT&amp;T]] and [[BellSouth]] merger.&lt;ref name="Ante"/&gt;

In 2007, Wu published a paper proposing a "Wireless [[Carterfone]]" rule for [[mobile phone]] networks;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Tim|year=2007|title=Wireless Carterfone|journal=International Journal of Communication|pages=389–426|url=http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/152/96|accessdate= 2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rule was adopted on July 31, 2007 by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for the [[United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction]], with FCC Commissioner [[Michael Copps]] stating: "I find it extremely heartening to see that an academic paper—in this case by Professor Timothy Wu of Columbia Law School—can have such an immediate and forceful influence on policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pressrelease|title=Statement of FCC Commissioner Michael J.

With his [[Columbia Law School]] colleagues Professors Scott Hemphill and Clarisa Long, Wu co-directs the Columbia Law School Program on Law and Technology, founded in 2007.&lt;ref name=CPLTDetails&gt;{{cite web|title=Program on Law and Technology at Columbia University School of Law|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/center_program?&amp;main.ctrl=contentmgr.detail&amp;&amp;main2.view=static.null&amp;main.view=programs.detail&amp;main.id=10267|work=Programs &amp; Centers|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPLT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbialawtech.org/|title=Program on Law and Technology at Columbia University School of Law|work=columbialawtech.org|publisher=[[Columbia Law School]], [[Columbia University]]|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, in collaboration with the [[University of Colorado School of Law]]'s Silicon Flatirons Program, the Columbia Law School Program on Law and Technology launched a [[Beta version|Beta]] version of [[AltLaw]], which he produced.&lt;ref name=AltLaw&gt;{{cite web|title=About AltLaw|url=http://www.altlaw.org/v1/about|accessdate=2008-08-24|quote=Written by Stuart Sierra and Paul Ohm, with help from Luis Villa and Dana Powers, and produced by Tim Wu. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080713095322/http://www.altlaw.org/v1/about &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu has appeared on the television programs ''[[The Colbert Report]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=End of Net Neutrality - Tim Wu-The Colbert Report - Video Clip {{!}} Comedy Central|url=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/qatuhg/end-of-net-neutrality---tim-wu|accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/205383|title=Charlie Rose|website=Hulu|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Master Switch''==
Wu's 2010 book ''The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires'' described a long "cycle" whereby open information systems become consolidated and closed over time, reopening only after disruptive innovation. The book shows this cycle develop with the rise of the Bell [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] telephone monopoly, the founding of the Hollywood entertainment industry, broadcast and cable TV industries, and finally with the internet industry. He looks at the example of [[Apple Inc.]], which began as a company dedicated to openness that evolved into a more closed system under the leadership of [[Steve Jobs]], demonstrating that the internet industry will follow the historical cycle of the rise of Information empires (though Wu discuss Google as an important counterpoint). The book was named one of the best books of 2010 by ''The New Yorker'' magazine,&lt;ref name="NYer"/&gt; ''Fortune'' magazine,&lt;ref name="Fortune"/&gt; Amazon.com,&lt;ref name=Amazon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;plgroup=1&amp;docId=1000628041 |title= Best Books of 2010 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'',&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/12/the_five_best_books_i_read_thi.html |title = The five best books I read this year | publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'',&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; and others.

== New York politics ==
[[File:Tim Wu, Campaign Event, Summer 2014.jpg|thumb|at a campaign event]]
{{main|New York gubernatorial election, 2014}}
Wu ran for the Democratic nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]] in 2014, campaigning alongside gubernatorial candidate [[Zephyr Teachout]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/jacobfischler/zephyr-teachout-challenges-andrew-cuomo "zephyr-teachout-challenges-andrew-cuomo"], ''buzzfeed.com''&lt;/ref&gt;  Wu and Teachout ran against [[Andrew Cuomo]], the incumbent governor, and [[Kathy Hochul]], an upstate Democrat and former Representative in the House.  Teachout and Wu ran to the left of Cuomo and Hochul.  Hochul won the race for Lieutenant Governor; Wu took 40% of the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://project.wnyc.org/election2014-ny-state/|title=Election 2014 - WNYC|first=WNYC Data|last=News|website=project.wnyc.org|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Washington Post'' interview discussing his candidacy, Wu described his approach to the campaign as one positioned against the concentration of private power: "A hundred years ago, antitrust and merger enforcement was front page news. And we live in another era of enormous private concentration. And for some reason we call all these 'wonky issues.' They're not, really. They affect people more than half a dozen other issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9501">'''Tyke''' (1974&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;August 20, 1994) was an [[African bush elephant]] from [[Mozambique]] who performed with Circus International of [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. On August 20, 1994, during a performance at the [[Neal Blaisdell Center]], she killed her trainer, [[Allen Campbell]], and seriously injured her groomer, Dallas Beckwith. Tyke then bolted from the arena and ran through the streets of the [[Kakaako]] central business district for more than thirty minutes. Unable to calm the elephant, local police eventually opened fire on the animal, which eventually collapsed from the wounds and died. While the majority of the attack in the arena was recorded on consumer videotape by several spectators, additional professional video footage captured the attack on local publicist Steve Hirano and the shooting of Tyke herself (both of which took place outside of the building).

== Background ==
According to Tyrone Taylor, Tyke's responsible trainer at the time (interviewed in documentary film), Tyke had been involved in three incidents prior to the attack of August 1994.&lt;ref name=TykeElephantOutlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4254838/ |title=Documentary: Tyke Elephant Outlaw (2015 Lambert, Moore)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.afi.com/tyke-elephant-outlaw-co-directors-susan-lambert-and-stefan-moore/ |title=The film TYKE ELEPHANT OUTLAW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 21–22, 1993===
On April 21, 1993, Tyke escaped through the front doors of the [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] [[Jaffa Shrine Center]] during a performance, remaining untethered for an hour. The rampage caused more than $14,000 in damage. An [[affidavit]] obtained from a circus worker by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] the following day stated that Tyke had also attacked a tiger trainer, while the circus was in Altoona.&lt;ref name=PetaFactsheet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circuses.com/fact-hawthorn.asp |title=Factsheet: Hawthorn Corporation (John Cuneo) |website=Peta.org |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 23, 1993===
On July 23, 1993, Tyke "ran amok at the [[North Dakota State Fair]] in [[Minot, North Dakota]], trampling and injuring a handler and frightening the crowd as [she] ran uncontrolled for 25 minutes". 

According to USDA and Canadian law enforcement documents, while a Hawthorn elephant named Tyke (possibly the same Tyke involved in the four aforementioned incidents), was performing with Tarzan Zerbini Circus, "The elephant handler was observed beating the single-tusk African elephant in public to the point [where] the elephant was screaming and bending down on three legs to avoid being hit. Even when the handler walked by the elephant after this, the elephant screamed and veered away, demonstrating fear from his presence."&lt;ref name=PetaFactsheet/&gt;

== Casualties ==
On August 20, 1994, during a performance at Circus International in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], Tyke trampled and critically injured her groomer, Dallas Beckwith, throwing him around numerous times in the process, before killing her trainer, [[Allen Campbell]], who was knocked to the ground, dragged and crushed to death under Tyke's massive trunk after he attempted to save Beckwith from being trampled to death during the attack. She then charged out of the arena and onto the streets outside. She additionally attacked and nearly crushed [[publicist]] Steve Hirano, who tried to stop her from escaping from the circus' parking lot. A nearby police officer seeing the attack fired multiple shots in the direction of the elephant, distracting her and causing her to flee away from Hirano. After a half-hour of chasing Tyke down, local police officers fired more than 86 shots at the {{convert|8,000|lb|kg}} elephant. Tyke finally collapsed from the numerous wounds and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vorsino |first=Mary |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2003/12/21/news/story10.html |title=Steve Hirano obituary|newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date=2003-12-21 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following the Hawaii accident of August 20, 1994, Tyke became symbolic of circus tragedies and a symbol for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernardo |first=Rosemarie |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/08/16/news/story2.html |title=Shots killing elephant echo across a decade |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=2004-08-16 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, lawsuits were filed against the City of Honolulu, the State of Hawaii, the circus, and Tyke's owner, John Cuneo, Jr. and his Hawthorn Corp. Honolulu lawyer William Fenton Sink sued Cuneo on behalf of numerous plaintiffs, including young children, who suffered psychological injuries after witnessing Tyke's killing. While the lawsuits were settled out of court, the details of the monetary decision was kept sealed from publication. In honor of Sink's work in the Tyke case, Animal Rights Hawaii renamed its "Order of the Innocent Award", The William Fenton Sink Award for Defense of Animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Aug/20/ln/ln19a.html |title=Slain elephant left tenuous legacy in animal rights |last=Hoover |first=Will |newspaper=[[The Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen Campbell's autopsy revealed that he died from severe internal injuries, including major skull and chest fractures.  It was also determined Campbell had cocaine and alcohol in his system at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=sahagun&gt;{{cite news |author=Sahagun, Louis |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-11/news/mn-49101_1_captive-elephant |title=Elephants Pose Giant Dangers |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=1994-10-11 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wtae&gt;{{cite web |title=Archived copy |last=Parsons |first=Jim |agency=WTAE, Team 4 |date=2002-11-21 |url=http://www.wtae.com/team4/1800419/detail.html |accessdate=2007-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724132848/http://www.wtae.com/team4/1800419/detail.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Officials at the [[Denver Zoo]] confirmed that there were complaints of animal abuse filed against Campbell during the late 1980s, when he operated an elephant and camel ride concession in the city.&lt;ref name=wtae/&gt;

The Tyke incident inspired legislation on local levels in Hawaii and abroad, while [[California]] Congressman [[Sam Farr]] introduced legislation ([http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju65825.000/hju65825_0.HTM HR2323]) into the House of Representatives in 1999 and again in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/congress-considers-ban-on-performing-elephants |title=Congress Considers Ban on Performing Elephants |last=Strand |first=Patti |publisher=[[National Animal Interest Alliance]] |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Experimental [[hardcore punk]]/[[powerviolence]] band [[Man Is the Bastard]] wrote the song "Tyke", about the elephant's escape and rebellion. The song was included on their 1995 album ''[[Thoughtless...]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Is The Bastard – Thoughtless...'', web page on [https://www.discogs.com/it/Man-Is-The-Bastard-Thoughtless/master/92952 www.discogs.com] (accessed on March 23, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian [[thrash metal]] band [[Tourniquet (band)|Tourniquet]], known for its stance against animal abuse, wrote the song "86 Bullets" about Tyke for their 2012 album ''[[Antiseptic Bloodbath]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tourniquet.bandcamp.com/album/antiseptic-bloodbath |title=Antiseptic Bloodbath |website=[[Bandcamp.com]] |date=July 2012 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author K.A. Monroe was inspired by the Tyke incident and published a popular independent children's book ''Tyke and the Elephant Angel''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18278857-tyke-and-the-elephant-angel&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyke is also seen on [[History (U.S. TV network)|The History Channel]] show ''[[Shockwave (TV Series)|Shockwave]]'', ''[[World's Most Amazing Videos]],''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztqZpx0loTk&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Banned from Television]]'' and ''[[Maximum Exposure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CEFgITBpUA&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]] [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|remake]] also mentions the Honolulu attack in [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series, season 6)#ep138|Season 6, Episode 20 ''Ka Haunaele (Rampage)'']].

The '''War Crimes Act of 1996''' is a law that defines a [[war crime]] to include a "[[Geneva Conventions#Grave breaches|grave breach]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]]", specifically noting that "grave breach" should have the meaning defined in any convention (related to the [[laws of war]]) to which the [[United States]] is a party. The definition of "grave breach" in some of the Geneva Conventions have text that extend additional protections, but all the Conventions share the following text in common: "...&amp;nbsp;committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: willful killing, [[torture]] or [[Cruel and unusual punishment|inhuman treatment]], including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health."

The law applies if either the victim or the perpetrator is a national of the United States or a member of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. The penalty may be [[life imprisonment]] or [[death penalty|death]]. The death penalty is only invoked if the conduct resulted in the death of one or more victims.

The act was passed with overwhelming majorities by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

==Legislative history==
The law criminalized breaches of the Geneva Conventions so that the United States could prosecute war criminals, specifically [[North Vietnam]]ese soldiers who tortured U.S. military personnel during the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] "fully support[ed] the purposes of the bill,"&lt;ref name="wp060728"&gt;{{cite news | first = R. Jeffrey | last = Smith | authorlink = R. Jeffrey Smith | title = Detainee Abuse Charges Feared | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072701908_pf.html | work = [[Washington Post]] | page = A1 | date =  2006-07-28 | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending that it be expanded to include a longer list of war crimes. Because the United States generally followed the Conventions, the military recommended making breaches by U.S. military personnel war crimes as well "because doing so set a high standard for others to follow."&lt;ref name="wp060728"/&gt; The bill passed by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate and by a [[voice vote]] in the House,&lt;ref name="wp060728"/&gt; showing that it was entirely uncontroversial at the time.

Ten years later, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|548|05-184|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Geneva Conventions#Common Article 3|Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions]] applied to the [[War on Terrorism]], with the unstated implication that any [[enhanced interrogation|interrogation technique]] that violated Common Article 3 constituted war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0630-27.htm | title = Did Bush Commit War Crimes? | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | last = Brooks | first = Rosa | authorlink = Rosa Brooks | date =  2006-06-30 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | quote = In other words, with the Hamdan decision, U.S. officials found to be responsible for subjecting war on terror detainees to torture, cruel treatment or other 'outrages upon personal dignity' could face prison or even the death penalty.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that American officials and military personnel could be prosecuted for war crimes for committing the "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm | title = Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | author = Diplomatic Conference for the Establishment of International Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War | date =  1949-08-12 | publisher = [[United Nations]] Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | page = I, a. 3, 1(c) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001201518/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited by the Conventions led to a series of proposals to make such actions legal in certain circumstances, which resulted in the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]].

==Potential application==
[[White House]] officials were concerned that they and other U.S. officials could be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act for the U.S. treatment of detainees after the [[September 11 attacks]] for violations of the Geneva Conventions. In a January 2002 memorandum to the president, then-[[White House Counsel]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] authored a controversial memo that explored whether Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to [[Al Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] [[combatants]] captured during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and held in detention facilities around the world, including [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing Common Article 3's protections to Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He concluded that Common Article 3 was outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He described as "quaint" the provisions that require providing captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants "commissary privileges, scrip, athletic uniforms, and scientific instruments". He also argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate to ensure that the principles of the Geneva Conventions would be applied. He also argued that undefined language in the Geneva Conventions, such as "outrages upon personal dignity" and "inhuman treatment", could make officials and military leaders subject to the War Crimes Act of 1996 if mistreatment was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Alberto.
