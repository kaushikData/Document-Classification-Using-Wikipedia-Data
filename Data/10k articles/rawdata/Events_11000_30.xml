The '''ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division''' (colloquially, "'''ASPCA Law Enforcement'''") was the [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] arm of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) from 1866 until 2013, when the law enforcement division was disbanded. The agency enforced animal-related laws, and investigated cases of animal cruelty.

== Agency history ==

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was incorporated in 1866 by a special state legislation to prevent animal cruelty through various programs including animal adoption services, animal education programs and an armed law enforcement division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_home|title=ASPCA|website=ASPCA|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Humane Law Enforcement Division was a branch of the ASPCA staffed by 20 armed [[New York State]] [[peace officer]]s who responded to reports of animal cruelty in marked ASPCA patrol cars in the New York City area as well as perform undercover operations. The officers were empowered through NYS Criminal Procedure Law and NY Agriculture and Markets laws to investigate allegations of animal abuse, seize animals being abused, and make arrests for the prosecution for animal cruelty.

In 2000, the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division received 33,000 calls for service which resulted in 55 arrests, 30 [[summons]]es being  issued, and 537 animal seizures.

== Disbandment of the Law Enforcement Division ==
In December 2013, the president of the ASPCA stated that the Law Enforcement Division would be disbanding and the enforcement of humane laws and response to calls for animal abuse and cruelty would become the responsibility of the NYPD. By early January 2014, half of the officers of the division had been terminated. The reason given for disbanding was that the NYPD was better equipped and had more manpower to handle enforcement of humane laws and to respond to calls for animal abuse/cruelty. Response to the disbanding has been mixed, with some saying the NYPD can do a better job, while others say the NYPD has other, higher-priority situations to handle and the response to animal abuse and cruelty will be slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=21427172|title=ASPCA Closes Storied Enforcement Unit in NYC|website=ABCNews.go.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power and authority of ASPCA Law Enforcement Officers ==

* ASPCA Law Enforcement officers are New York State peace officers under NYS Criminal Procedure Law 2.10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ypdcrime.com/cpl/article2.htm|title=Article 2 - Criminal Procedure Law - Peace Officers|website=YPDCrime.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may make arrests, use physical and deadly force, make car stops, issue summonses, and may carry a firearm, baton, pepper spray, and handcuffs.
* ASPCA Law Enforcement officers may seize any stray or abandoned animal on public streets in accordance with N.Y. Agriculture &amp; Market laws Section 373 subsection 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cruelty_investigate&amp;s_state=newyork State  Anti-Cruelty Investigatory-Arrest Powers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122223855/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cruelty_investigate&amp;s_state=newyork |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ASPCA Law Enforcement officers may lawfully seize any animal on private property that has been kept for more than 12 hours in an unhealthy, dangerous or unsanitary condition in accordance with NY Agriculture and Markets Law Section 373 subsection 2 provided a complaint has been filed.&lt;ref name="aspca.org"&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cruelty_investigate&amp;s_state=newyork  State Anti-Cruelty Investigatory-Arrest Powers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122223855/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cruelty_investigate&amp;s_state=newyork |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ASPCA Law Enforcement officers with a court order may make regular visits to any residence or establishment where an animal is being kept to check to see if the animal is receiving necessary food, water and care according to N.Y. Agriculture &amp; Market law Section 373 subsection 7.&lt;ref name="aspca.org"/&gt;
* NYS Agriculture and Markets Law Section 371 permits an ASPCA Law Enforcement officer to "interfere to prevent the perpetration of any act of cruelty upon any animal" in the presence of the ASPCA officer.&lt;ref name="aspca.org"/&gt;

== Crime scene investigation ==

In 2007, the ASPCA created an animal cruelty crime scene investigation unit. The CSI unit uses a Ford E-450 vehicle equipped with a surgery area for injured animals, evidence processing, documentation, and storage equipment. The van is staffed with a forensic veterinarian to help document evidence to aid in the prosecution of perpetrators. Although the vehicle is used primarily in New York City, it can be deployed to any area of the United States at the request of a law enforcement agency. The Crime Scene Investigation unit was not affected by the disbandment of the Law Enforcement Division and remains active.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aspca.org/animal-rescue/forensic-investigations/forensic-vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement training ==

ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officers received peace officer training in addition to investigator training and firearms training. In 1999, ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement recruits began attending a specialized investigator training course through the [[New York City Police]] academy.

== Equipment ==

ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officers were equipped with either a [[Glock 19]] 9mm or a [[Smith &amp; Wesson 5906]] 9mm handgun, [[pepper spray]], [[ASP baton]], and [[handcuffs]].

Their squad cars were primarily [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s, in addition to [[van]]s, and [[SUVs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://flickr.com/photos/jag9889/2629518568|title=ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Car in Central Park, New York City|website=Flickr.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They carried poles and cages for seizures and catches.

== Rank structure and title ==

There were five titles (referred to as ranks) in the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division:
* Assistant Director of Law Enforcement
* Executive Officer
* Supervisory Special Investigator
* Special Investigator
* Special Agent

== Fallen officers==
One former ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officer is known to have died in the line of duty. The death occurred after the disbandment of the agency and was due to a duty related illness rather than a direct result of carrying out the duties of the position.

'''Akitu''' or '''Akitum'''  ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]:&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ezen á.ki.tum}}, ''akiti-šekinku'', {{sc|á.ki.ti.še.gur₁₀.ku₅}}, {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"the barley-cutting",{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} ''akiti-šununum'', {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"barley-sowing"; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]:&amp;nbsp;''{{lang|akk-Latn|akitu}}'' or ''{{lang|akk-Latn|rêš-šattim}}'', "head of the year") was a [[spring festival]] in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].The Babylonian Akitu festival has played a pivotal role in the development of theories of religion, myth and ritual, yet the purpose of the festival remains a point of contention among both historians of religion and [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]].&lt;ref&gt;The Babylonian Akitu Festival: Rectifying the King or Renewing the Cosmos? (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is from the Sumerian for "[[barley]]", originally marking two festivals celebrating the beginning of each of the two half-years of the Sumerian calendar, marking the sowing of barley in autumn and the cutting of barley in spring. In [[Babylonian religion]] it came to be dedicated to [[Marduk]]'s victory over [[Tiamat]].

==Babylonian Akitu==
The Babylonian festival traditionally started on 1&amp;nbsp;[[Nisannu]]. All the people in the city would celebrate, including the &lt;i&gt;awilu&lt;/i&gt; (upper class), &lt;i&gt;muskena&lt;/i&gt; (middle class), &lt;i&gt;wardu&lt;/i&gt; (lower class), High Priest, and the King&lt;ref&gt;The Babylonian Akitu Festival by Svend Aage Pallis Review by: S. S.The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland , No. 4 (Oct., 1927) , pp. 895-897&lt;/ref&gt;

===First to third Day===
The priest of [[Esagila|Ésagila]] (Marduk’s house) would recite sad prayers with the other priests and the people would answer with equally sad prayers which expressed humanity's fear of the unknown. This fear of the unknown explains why the high priest would head to the Ésagila every day asking for Marduk's forgiveness, begging him to protect Babylon, his holy city, and asking him to have favor on the city. This prayer was called "The Secret Of Ésagila". It reads as followed: "Lord without peer in thy wrath,
Lord, gracious king, lord of the lands,
Who made salvation for the great gods,
Lord, who throwest down the strong by his glance,
Lord of kings, light of men, who dost apportion destinies,
O Lord, Babylon is thy seat, Borsippa thy crown
The wide heavens are thy body....
Within thine arms thou takest the strong....
Within thy glance thou grantest them grace,
Makest them see light so that they proclaim thy power.
Lord of the lands, light of the Igigi, who pronnouncest blessings;
Who would not proclaim thy, yea, thy power?
Would not speak of thy majesty, praise thy dominion?
Lord of the lands, who livest in Eudul, who takest the fallen by the hand;
Have pity upon thy city, Babylon
Turn thy face towards Esagila, thy temple
Give freedom to them that dwell in Babylon, thy wards!"&lt;ref&gt;"The Akitu-Festival - Www.GatewaysToBabylon.com." The Akitu-Festival - Www.GatewaysToBabylon.com. N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day special craftsmen would create two puppets made of wood, gold, and precious stones and dress them in red. These puppets were set aside and would be used on the sixth day&lt;ref&gt;Gard, Carolyn. "Akitu The Babylonian New Year's Festival." Calliope 11.3 (2000): 36. MAS Ultra - School Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Day===
The same rituals would be followed as in the previous three days. Before the sunrise the priests looked for the sacred star group IKU ([[Pegasus (constellation)|“Field”]]). During the day the Epic of Creation ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' would be recited. The Enuma Elish, is most likely the oldest story concerning the birth of the gods and the creation of the universe and human beings. It then explains how all the gods united in the god Marduk, following his victory over Tiamat.  The recitation of this Epic was considered the beginning of preparations for the submission of the [[King of Babylon]] before Marduk on the fifth day of Akitu. During the night a drama was performed that praised Marduk as well.

===Fifth Day===
The submission of the king of Babylon before Marduk. The king would enter to the Esagila accompanied by the priests, they would approach all together the altar where the high priest of the Esagila impersonates Marduk then he approaches the king, begins to strip him of his jewelry, scepter and even his crown then he would slap him hard while the altar would kneel and begins to pray asking for Marduk's forgiveness and submitting to him saying: "I have not sinned O Lord of the universe, and I haven't neglected your heavenly might at all"... Then the priest in the role of Marduk says: "Don't be afraid of what Marduk has to say, for he will hear your prayers, extends your power, and increases the greatness of your reign". The removal of all worldly possessions is a symbol of the submission the king gives to Marduk. After this the king would stand up and the priest would give him back his jewelry, scepter and crown then slaps him hard again hoping for the king to shed tears, because that would express more the submission to Marduk and respect to his power. When the priest returns the crown to the king that means his power was renewed by Marduk, thus April would be considered not only the revival of nature and life but also to the State as well. Thus, these ceremonies would make the greatest and most feared personalities of that time submit to the greatest god, and live a humbling moment with all the population, sharing prayers to prove their faith before the might of God. Following his presence in his earthly home Babylon and renewing its king's power, god Marduk stays in the Etemenanki (a ziggurat or tower composed of seven floors, known in the [[Torah]]{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} as the Tower of Babylon) where was Marduk's dwelling or in the temple Esagila (in the Torah God would dwell on a "mountain" Psalms 74:2). During this day according to the tradition of Akitu, Marduk would enter his dwelling and is surprised by the evil gods who will fight him, then he's taken prisoner by Tiamat, the chaos monster and goddess of the ocean, and awaits for arrival of his son god Nabu who would save him from "Nought" and restore his glory.

===Sixth Day===
Before the gods arrived, the day would be filled with commotion. The puppets that were made on the third day would be burned and mock battle would be taking place as well. This commotion signified that without Marduk, the city would be in constant chaos.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"Middle Eastern religion". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of [[God]] [[Nabu]] in boats accompanied by his assistants of brave Gods coming from [[Nippur]], [[Uruk]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and Eridu (cities ancient Babylonia). The Gods accompanying Nabu would be represented by statues which would be mounted on boats made especially for the occasion. Here the people in huge numbers would begin their walk behind their king towards the Esagila where Marduk is held prisoner, chanting the following :"Here's he who's coming from far to restore the glory of our imprisoned father".

===Seventh Day===
On the third day of his imprisonment Nabu frees Marduk. The evil gods had closed a huge gate behind him when he entered his dwelling. Marduk would be fighting till Nabu's arrival, when he would break in the huge gate and a battle would go on between the two groups, until Nabu comes out victorious and frees Marduk.

===Eighth Day===
When Marduk is set free, the statues of the gods are gathered in the Destinies Hall "Ubshu-Ukkina", to deliberate his destiny, there it is decided to join all the forces of the gods and bestow them upon Marduk. Here, the king implores all the gods to support and honor Marduk, and this tradition was an indication that Marduk received submission from all the gods and was unique in his position.

===Ninth Day===
The victory procession to the "House of Akitu" where Marduk's victory in the beginning of Creation over the dragon Tiamat (goddess of the nether waters) is celebrated. The House of Akitu which the Assyrians of Nineveh called "Bet Ekribi" (“House of Prayers” in old Assyrian language), was about 200 meters outside the city's walls, where there were wonderful trees decorated and watered carefully out of respect to the god who's considered the one to grant nature its life. The victory procession was the population's way to express its joy at Marduk's (Ashur) renewal of power and the destruction of evil forces which almost controlled life in the beginning.

===Tenth Day===
Arriving at "Bet Akitu", god Marduk begins to celebrate with both the upper and nether world gods (the statues of gods were arranged around a huge table such as in a feast) then Marduk returns to the city at night celebrating his marriage to goddess "Ishtar" where earth and heaven are united, and as the gods unite so is this union arranged on earth. Thus the king personifies this union by playing the role of marrying the highest priestess of the Esagila where they would both sit at the throne before the population and they recite special poems for the occasion. This love is going to bring forth life in spring.

===Eleventh Day===
The gods return accompanied by their Lord Marduk to meet again in the Destinies Hall "Upshu Ukkina", where they met for the first time on the eighth day, this time they will decide the fate of the people of Marduk. In ancient Assyrian philosophy Creation in general was considered as a covenant between heaven and earth as long as a human serves the gods till his death, therefore, gods' happiness isn't complete except if humans are happy as well, thus a human's destiny will be to be given happiness on the condition that he serves the gods. So Marduk and the gods renew their covenant with Babylon, by promising the city another cycle of seasons. After the fate of mankind is decided, Marduk returns to the heavens.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

===Twelfth Day===
The last day of Akitu. The gods return to Marduk's temple (the statues are returned to the temple) and daily life resumes in Babylon, Nineveh, and the rest of the Assyrian cities. The people begin to plow and prepare for another cycle of seasons.

==Legacy==
The festival was also adopted in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Iron Age Assyria]], following the destruction of Babylon.
King [[Sennacherib]] in 683 BC built an "Akitu house" outside the walls of [[Assur]]. Another "Akitu house" was built outside [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali Yaseen Ahmad and A. Kirk Grayson, ''Sennacherib in the Akitu House'', Iraq, Vol. 61, (1999), pp. 187-189; Simo Parpola, Neo-Assyrian Treaties from the Royal Archives of Nineveh, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 39, No. 2 (Autumn, 1987), pp. 161-189&lt;/ref&gt; The Akitu festival was continued throughout the [[Seleucid]] period&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Sherwin-White,
''Ritual for a Seleucid King at Babylon?'' The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 103, (1983), pp. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt; and into the [[Roman Empire]] period. At the beginning of the 3rd century, it was still celebrated in [[Emessa]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], in honour of the god [[Elagabal]].
Roman Emperor [[Elagabalus]] (r. 218-222), who was of Syrian origin, even introduced the festival in Italy ([[Herodian]], ''Roman History'', 5.6). [[Iran]]ians traditionally celebrate 21 March as  ''[[Noruz]]'' ("New Day").
[[Kha b-Nissan]] is the name of the spring festival among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].
The festival is celebrated on April 1, corresponding to the start of the Assyrian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;William Ricketts Cooper.

'''Ann Louise Nixon Cooper''' (January 9, 1902 &amp;ndash; December 21, 2009) was a [[centenarian]] mentioned in United States President-elect [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama election victory speech, 2008|November 2008 election speech]] as a representative of the change in status [[African-Americans]] had undergone during the past century and more in America. Before that, she was a noted member of the Atlanta [[African-American]] community and an activist for [[civil rights]].

==Biography==
Cooper was born in [[Shelbyville, Tennessee]], on January 9, 1902, and raised in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].&lt;ref name="AJC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/11/05/106_year_old_obama_speech.html|title=106-year-old in Obama speech: ‘Things can change’|last=Brown|first=Chandler|date=&lt;!-- 6:00 p.m.  --&gt; November 5, 2008|publisher=AJC.COM|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in her early-twenties with her husband, Albert Berry Cooper, a [[dentist]],&lt;ref name="AJC" /&gt; and they had four children together.&lt;ref name="Ann Cooper Biography"&gt;{{cite web| title =Ann Cooper Biography| publisher =The History Makers| url =http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=739| accessdate = 2008-11-06 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081211151338/http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=739| archivedate= 11 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she served more than fifty years in public work on the board of Gate City Nursery Association and also helped found the Girls Club for African-American Youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Profile: Ann Nixon Cooper, 106, singled out for praise by Barack Obama| publisher =Times Online| date = 2008-11-05| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5088360.ece| accessdate = 2008-11-06  | location=London | first=Jenny | last=Booth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there were no integrated [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] troops in 1930s Atlanta, she wrote to the Boy Scouts in New York for help in starting Troop 95, Atlanta's first Boy Scout troop for African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio: Talk of the Nation, December 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When her husband died, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] sent Cooper a telegram; she also met with [[Coretta Scott King]] and saved photographs of the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Ann Nixon Cooper: the history woman| publisher =Times Online| date = 2008-11-06| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5093863.ece| accessdate = 2008-11-06 | location=London | first=Suzy | last=Jagger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper first registered to vote on September 1, 1941. Although she was friends with elite Black Atlantans like [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;B. Du&amp;nbsp;Bois]], [[John Hope Franklin]] and [[Benjamin Mays]], she did not exercise her right to vote for years, because of her status as a [[black woman]] in a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] and [[sexist]] society.&lt;ref name="NYDaily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/11/05/2008-11-05_racism_survivor_ann_nixon_cooper_106_is_.html|title=Racism survivor Ann Nixon Cooper, 106, is honored by Barack Obama|last=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS |date=November 6, 2008 &lt;!-- , 12:57 AM  --&gt; |publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, she served as a tutor to non-readers at [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]]. She also served on the Friends of the Library Board, serving at one time as vice president of the board. In 1980, she received a Community Service Award from [[WXIA-TV|Channel 11]] for being one of the organizers of the black [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] and serving as the first den mother for three and a half years.

She was also awarded the [[Annie L. McPheeters Medallion]] for community service from the [[Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Ann Cooper Biography" /&gt;

==Age issue==

When featured in Obama's 2008 speech, Cooper was 106 years old. Some news outlets erroneously reported her as "oldest voter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebgalz.com/ann-nixon-cooper-ann-nixon-cooper-oldest-american-voter/ |title=Ann Nixon Cooper: Ann Nixon Cooper oldest American voter |publisher=Celebgalz.com |date=November 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813080615/http://celebgalz.com/ann-nixon-cooper-ann-nixon-cooper-oldest-american-voter/ |archivedate=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though there were several older voters, including then-114-year-old Gertrude Baines, 113-year-old Beatrice Farve, 112-year-olds Maggie Renfro and [[George Francis (supercentenarian)|George Francis]], 110-year-olds Virginia Call and Onie Ponder, and 109-year-olds Nettie Whittington and Amanda Jones (all voted for Obama); and 112-year-olds Eunice Sanborn, [[Besse Cooper]], and [[Walter Breuning]] (all indicated they likely voted for McCain) and 109-year-old [[Gertrude Noone]] (who voted for McCain).

Cooper died on December 21, 2009, three weeks before what would have been her 108th birthday.

Census research suggests she may have been a year younger than claimed; the [[1910 U.S. Census]] lists her as seven years old in April 1910. Given a January birthdate, this suggests that she was born in 1903.

{{Events leading to World War I}}

The '''assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria''', [[heir presumptive]] to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] throne, and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], occurred on 28 June 1914 in [[Sarajevo]] when they were mortally wounded by [[Gavrilo Princip]]. Princip was one of a group of six assassins (five [[Serbs]] and one [[Bosniak]]) coordinated by [[Danilo Ilić]], a [[Bosnian Serb]] and a member of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's [[South Slavs|South Slav]] provinces so they could be combined into a [[Yugoslavia]]. The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as [[Young Bosnia]]. The assassination led directly to the [[First World War]] when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an [[July Ultimatum of 1914|ultimatum]] to the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.

In charge of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]], his right-hand man Major [[Vojislav Tankosić]], and the [[spy]] [[Rade Malobabić]]. Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were given access to the same clandestine network of [[safe-house]]s and agents that Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary.

The assassins, the key members of the clandestine network, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.

Under the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], [[Austria-Hungary]] received the mandate to occupy and administer the Ottoman [[Vilayet of Bosnia]], while the [[Ottoman Empire]] retained official sovereignty. Under this same treaty, the [[Great Powers]] (Austria-Hungary, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[German Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and the [[Russian Empire]]) gave official recognition to the [[Principality of Serbia]] as a fully sovereign state, which four years later transformed into a [[Kingdom of Serbia|kingdom]] under Prince Milan IV Obrenović who thus became King [[Milan I of Serbia]]. Serbia's monarchs, at the time from the royal [[House of Obrenović]] that maintained close relations with [[Austria-Hungary]], were content to reign within the borders set by the treaty.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=9–10}}

This changed in May 1903, when Serbian military officers led by [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] [[May Coup (Serbia)|stormed the Serbian Royal Palace]]. After a fierce battle in the dark, the attackers captured General Laza Petrović, head of the Palace Guard, and forced him to reveal the hiding place of [[Alexander I of Serbia|King Alexander I Obrenović]] and his wife [[Draga Mašin|Queen Draga]]. The King and Queen opened the door from their hiding place. The King was shot thirty times; the Queen eighteen. MacKenzie writes that "the royal corpses were then stripped and brutally sabred."{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=22}} The attackers threw the corpses of King Alexander and Queen Draga out of a palace window, ending any threat that loyalists would mount a counterattack."{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=22–23}} General Petrović was then killed too (Vojislav Tankosić organized the murders of Queen Draga's brothers;{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=23–24}} Dimitrijević and Tankosić in 1913–1914 figure prominently in the plot to assassinate [[Franz Ferdinand]]).{{context inline|date=June 2014}}  The conspirators installed [[Peter I of Yugoslavia|Peter I]] of the [[House of Karađorđević]] as the new king.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=23–24}}

The new dynasty was more nationalist, friendlier to Russia and less friendly to Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=24–33}} Over the next decade, disputes between Serbia and its neighbors erupted, as Serbia moved to build its power and gradually reclaim its [[Serbian Empire|14th century empire]]. These conflicts included a [[customs]] dispute with Austria-Hungary beginning in 1906 (commonly referred to as the "[[Pig War (Serbia)|Pig War]]");{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=27}} the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909, in which Serbia assumed an attitude of protest over Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (ending in Serbian acquiescence without compensation in March 1909);{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=291–292}} and finally the two [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913, in which Serbia conquered [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Kosovo]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and drove out Bulgaria.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=364–480}}
 [[File:Gavrilo Princip, outside court.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gavrilo Princip]] outside the courthouse]]
Serbia's military successes and Serbian outrage over the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina emboldened [[Serbian nationalist]]s in Serbia and Serbs in Austria-Hungary who chafed under Austro-Hungarian rule and whose nationalist sentiments were stirred by Serb "cultural" organizations.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=19–23}} In the five years leading up to 1914, lone assassins – mostly Serb citizens of Austria-Hungary – made a series of unsuccessful assassination attempts in [[Croatia]] and Bosnia-Herzegovina against Austro-Hungarian officials.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=236–270}} The assassins received sporadic support from Serbia.

On 15 June 1910, [[Bogdan Žerajić]] attempted to kill the iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General [[Marijan Varešanin]]. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from [[Nevesinje]], Herzegovina, who was a student at the [[Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb]] and made frequent trips to [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=243}} (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising in the second half of 1910).{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=203–204}} The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić "was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him. It is there that I made up my mind sooner or later to perpetrate an [[Propaganda of the deed|outrage]]."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=50}}

In 1913, Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] commanded Archduke Franz Ferdinand to observe the military maneuvers in Bosnia scheduled for June 1914.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=285}} Following the maneuvers, Ferdinand and his wife planned to visit [[Sarajevo]] to open the state museum in its new premises there.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=9}} Duchess Sophie, according to their eldest son, [[Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg|Duke Maximilian]], accompanied her husband out of fear for his safety.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=286}}

As Sophie, although of high aristocratic birth, was not from a dynastic family, her union with the Habsburg heir presumptive could only be a [[morganatic marriage]]. Emperor Franz Joseph had only consented to their marriage on the condition that their descendants would never ascend the throne. The 14th anniversary of their marriage fell on 28 June. As historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] observes:

[[File:Postcard for the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the Archduke and his wife emerging from the Sarajevo Town Hall to board their car, a few minutes before the assassination]]
{{Quote|[Sophie] could never share [Franz Ferdinand's] rank ... could never share his splendours, could never even sit by his side on any public occasion. There was one loophole ... his wife could enjoy the recognition of his rank when he was acting in a military capacity. Hence, he decided, in 1914, to inspect the army in Bosnia. There, at its capital Sarajevo, the Archduke and his wife could ride in an open carriage side by side ... Thus, for love, did the Archduke go to his death.{{sfn|Taylor|1963|p=13}}}}

Franz Ferdinand was an advocate of [[United States of Greater Austria|increased federalism]] and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=11–17}} A Slavic kingdom could have been a bulwark against Serb [[irredentism]], and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=87–88}} Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=49}}

The day of the assassination, June 28 (June 15 in the [[Julian calendar]]), is the feast of [[St. Vitus]]. In Serbia, it is called [[Vidovdan]] and commemorates the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo]] against the Ottomans, at which the Sultan was assassinated in his tent by a Serb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Isabelle Dierauer|title=Disequilibrium, Polarization, and Crisis Model: An International Relations Theory Explaining Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCuDsecLWmYC|date=16 May 2013|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-6106-5|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preliminaries==

===Planning direct action===
Danilo Ilić was a Bosnian Orthodox Serb. He had worked as a school teacher and as a bank worker but in 1913 and 1914 he lived with, and outwardly off, his mother, who operated a small boarding house in Sarajevo. Secretly, Ilić was leader of the Serbian-[[irredentist]] [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] cell in Sarajevo. In late 1913, Danilo Ilić came to the Serbian listening post at Užice to speak to the officer in charge, Serbian Colonel C. A. Popović, who was a captain at the time and a member of the Black Hand. Ilić recommended an end to the period of revolutionary organization building and a move to direct action against Austria-Hungary. Popović passed Danilo Ilić on to Belgrade to discuss this matter with Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]], known more commonly as Apis.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=27–28; 79}} By 1913, Apis and his fellow military conspirators (drawn heavily from the ranks of the May 1903 coup) had come to dominate what was left of the Black Hand.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=47}}

There are no reports as to what took place between Ilić and Apis, but soon after their meeting, Apis's righthand man and fellow Black Hander, Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosić, who by this time was in charge of guerrilla training, called a Serbian irredentist planning meeting in [[Toulouse]], France.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=76–77}} Amongst those summoned to the Toulouse meeting was [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], a carpenter by trade and son of an impoverished [[Islam|Muslim]] noble from Herzegovina.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=282}} He too was a member of the Black Hand, having been sworn into the organization by Black Hand Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Gacinović and Danilo Ilić. Mehmedbašić was (here quoting Albertini paraphrasing Mehmedbašić) "eager to carry out an act of terrorism to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=78}} During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed, including Franz Ferdinand. However, the participants decided only to dispatch Mehmed Mehmedbašić to Sarajevo, to kill the Governor of Bosnia, [[Oskar Potiorek]].{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=78}}

While Mehmedbašić was travelling to Bosnia-Herzegovina from France, police searched his train for a thief. Thinking the police might be after him, he threw his weapons (a dagger and a bottle of poison) out the train window.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=78}} Once he arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina he had to set about looking for replacement weapons.

===Franz Ferdinand chosen===
The search for new weapons delayed Mehmedbašić's attempt on Potiorek. Before Mehmedbašić was ready to act, Ilić summoned him to Mostar. On 26 March 1914,{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=283|ps=; Dedijer placed the meeting in Sarajevo, not Mostar.}} Ilić informed Mehmedbašić that Belgrade had scrapped the mission to kill the governor. The plan now was to murder Franz Ferdinand, and Mehmedbašić should stand by for the new operation.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=78–79|ps=; Note the date error: 25 July should read 25 June}} (Apis confessed to the Serbian Court that he ordered the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in his position as head of the Intelligence Department.){{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=398}} The assassination was planned with the knowledge and approval of the Russian ambassador in Belgrade [[Nicholas Hartwig|Nikolai Hartwig]] and the Russian military attache in Belgrade [[Viktor Artamonov]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vQF099JYW_EC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=nikolai+hartwig+viktor+artamonov&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=14SxU5iCBOrG0QX1jICwBQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nikolai%20hartwig%20viktor%20artamonov&amp;f=false The Russian Origins of the First World War, by Sean McMeekin, page 47]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilić recruited the Serbian youths [[Vaso Čubrilović]] and [[Cvjetko Popović]] shortly after Easter (Orthodox Easter as given by Dedijer: 19 April 1914), for the assassination, as evidenced by the testimony of Ilić, Čubrilović, and Popović at the Sarajevo trial.{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=117–118; 129–131; 140; 142}} Three youths – [[Gavrilo Princip]],{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=58–59}} [[Trifko Grabež]],{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=93–94}} and [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]]{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=26–28; 30}} – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that at about the same time (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.

Agreement in principle was quickly reached, but delivery of the weapons was delayed for more than a month. The assassins would meet with Ciganović and he would put them off. At one point, Ciganović told Grabež: "Nothing doing, the old Emperor is ill and the Heir Apparent {{sic}} will not go to Bosnia."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=56}} When Emperor Franz Joseph's health recovered the operation was a "go" again. Tankosić gave the assassins one [[FN Model 1910]] pistol. They practiced shooting a few rounds of scarce and expensive [[.380 ACP]] pistol ammunition in a park near Belgrade.&lt;ref name=nra&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vanderlinden |first=Anthony |year=2014 |title=The FN Browning 1910 Pistol &amp; The Great War |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=162 |issue=September |pages=67–69 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the weapons were finally delivered on 26 May.{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=59}} The three assassins from Belgrade testified that Major Tankosić, directly and through Ciganović, not only provided six [[hand grenade]]s and four new [[John Browning|Browning]] FN Model 1910 automatic pistols with .380 ACP ammunition,&lt;ref name=nra/&gt; but also money,{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=59}} suicide pills,{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=41; 46}} training,{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=93–94}} a special map with the location of gendarmes marked,{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=109–110}} knowledge of contacts on a clandestine tunnel used to infiltrate agents and arms into Austria-Hungary,{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=106}} and a small card authorizing the use of that tunnel.{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=40; 59}} Major Tankosić confirmed to the journalist and historian Luciano Magrini that he provided the bombs and pistols and was responsible for training Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović and that he (Tankosić) initiated the idea of the suicide pills.{{sfn|Magrini|1929|pp=94–95}}

===Tunnel===
[[File:Szarajevói merénylők útvonala 1914.svg|thumb|350px|Route of the [[assassin]]s from Belgrade to Sarajevo]]
[[File:Szarajevói fegyverek útvonala 1914.svg|thumb|350px|Route of the weapons from [[Belgrade]] to [[Sarajevo]]]]
Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović left Belgrade by boat on 28 May and traveled along the Sava River to [[Šabac]] where they handed the small card to Captain Popović of the Serbian Border Guard. Popović, in turn, provided them with a letter to Serbian Captain Prvanović, and filled out a form with the names of three customs officials whose identities they could assume and thereby receive discounted train tickets for the ride to [[Loznica]], a small border town.{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=36–38}}{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=296}}

When Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović reached Loznica on 29 May, Captain Prvanović summoned three of his revenue sergeants to discuss the best way to cross the border undetected. While waiting for the sergeants to arrive, Princip and Grabež had a falling out with Čabrinović over Čabrinović's repeated violations of operational security.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=295–297}} Čabrinović handed over the weapons he was carrying to Princip and Grabež. Princip told Čabrinović to go alone to Zvornik, make an official crossing there using Grabež's ID card and then go on to Tuzla and link back up.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=296–297}}

On the morning of 30 May Prvanović's revenue sergeants assembled and Sergeant Budivoj Grbić accepted the task and led Princip and Grabež by foot to Isaković's Island, a small island in the middle of the Drina River that separated Serbia from Bosnia. They and their weapons reached the island on 31 May. Grbić passed the terrorists and their weapons to the agents of the Serbian [[Narodna Odbrana]] for transport into Austro-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house. Princip and Grabež crossed into Austria-Hungary on the evening of 1 June.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=298}} Princip and Grabež and the weapons were passed from agent to agent until on 3 June they arrived in Tuzla. They left the weapons in the hands of the Narodna Odbrana agent Miško Jovanović and rejoined Čabrinović.{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=61–64}}

The Narodna Odbrana agents reported their activities to the Narodna Odbrana President, Boža Janković, who in turn reported to the then Serbian Caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Pašić.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=388–389}} The report to Pašić added the name of a new military conspirator, Serbian Major Kosta Todorović, Boundary Commissioner and Director of Serbian Military Intelligence Services for the frontier line from Rada to Ljubovija. Pašić's handwritten notes from the briefing (estimated by Dedijer to have taken place on 5 June) included the nickname of one of the assassins ("Trifko" Grabež) and also the name of Major Tankosić.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=503}} The Austrians later captured the report, Pašić's handwritten notes, and additional corroborating documents.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=390; 505}}

Čabrinović's father was a Sarajevo police official. In Tuzla, Čabrinović bumped into one of his father's friends, Sarajevo Police Detective Ivan Vila, and struck up a conversation. By coincidence, Princip, Grabež and Čabrinović boarded the same train for Sarajevo as Detective Vila. Čabrinović inquired of the detective the date of Franz Ferdinand's visit to Sarajevo. The next morning, Čabrinović passed on the news to his fellow assassins that the assassination would be on 28 June.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=300–301}}

On arriving in Sarajevo on 4 June, Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović went their separate ways. Princip checked in with Ilić, visited his family in Hadžici and returned to Sarajevo on 6 June taking up residence at Ilić's mother's house with Ilić.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=303}} Grabež joined his family in Pale. Čabrinović moved back into his father's house in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=305}}

On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla to bring the weapons to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović hid the weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went separately by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić.{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=185–186}} Later that day, Ilić returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside Sarajevo and then quickly transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić hid the weapons in a suitcase under a sofa.{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=118–119}} Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation of the reason for his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent the assassination.{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=126}} Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize the assassination.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=309}}

===Eve of the attacks===
Ilić began handing out the weapons on 27 June. Until 27 June Ilić had kept the identities of the assassins from Belgrade secret from those he had recruited locally and vice versa. Then, that night, as Mehmedbašić told Albertini:  "On the eve of the outrage Ilić introduced me to Princip in a Sarajevo café with the words 'Mehmedbašić who to-morrow is to be with us.'"{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=49}} The three sent a postcard to Black Hand Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina [[Vladimir Gaćinović]] in France.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=49}}

The following morning, on 28 June 1914, Ilić positioned the six assassins along the motorcade route. Ilić walked the street, exhorting the assassins to bravery.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=49}}

==Assassination==
[[File:FranzFerdinandCar.jpg|thumb|The 1911 [[Gräf &amp; Stift]] 28/32 PS ''Double Phaeton'' in which the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was riding at the time of his assassination, [[Museum of Military History, Vienna]] (2003)]]

===Motorcade===
On the morning of 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and his party proceeded by train from Ilidža Spa to Sarajevo.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=9}} Governor [[Oskar Potiorek]] met the party at Sarajevo station. Six automobiles were waiting. By mistake, three local police officers got into the first car with the chief officer of special security; the special security officers who were supposed to accompany their chief got left behind.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=11}} The second car carried the Mayor and the Chief of Police of Sarajevo. The third car in the motorcade was a [[Gräf &amp; Stift]] 28/32 PS open sports car with its top folded down. Franz Ferdinand, Sophie, Governor Potiorek, and Lieutenant Colonel Count Franz von Harrach rode in this third car.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=11}} The motorcade's first stop on the preannounced program was for a brief inspection of a military barracks. According to the program, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the motorcade was to leave the barracks for the town hall by way of the Appel Quay.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=9; 12}}

Security arrangements within Sarajevo were limited. The local military commander, General Michael von Appel, proposed that troops line the intended route but was told that this would offend the loyal citizenry. Protection for the visiting party was accordingly left to the Sarajevo police, of whom only about 60 were on duty on the Sunday of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Greg|last=King|pages=168–169|title=The Assassination of the Archduke|ISBN=978-1-4472-4521-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bombing===
[[File:1914 Sarajevo assassination map.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A map annotated with the events of 28&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1914, from an official report]]
The motorcade passed the first assassin, Mehmedbašić. Danilo Ilić had placed him in front of the garden of the Mostar Cafe and armed him with a bomb.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=313}} Mehmedbašić failed to act. Ilić had placed Vaso Čubrilović next to Mehmedbašić, arming him with a pistol and a bomb. He too failed to act. Further along the route, Ilić had placed [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]] on the opposite side of the street near the [[Miljacka|Miljacka River]], arming him with a bomb.

At 10:10 am,{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=12}} Franz Ferdinand's car approached and Čabrinović threw his bomb. The bomb bounced off the folded back convertible cover into the street.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=35}}&lt;!-- Note: One witness stated that the Archduke blocked it with his hand and this was picked up by the New York Times despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. As it was a [[percussion bomb]] (you must strike it against something to set off the timer), Čabrinović struck it against a lamp post. The sound of this attracted the attention of Franz Ferdinand, who saw an object flying at him and reflexively put his arm up in a failed effort to block the detached detonator cap which ultimately scratched the archduchess's cheek or neck on its way by. --&gt; The bomb's timed detonator caused it to explode under the next car, putting that car out of action, leaving a {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}}, {{convert|6.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-deep}} crater,{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=12}} and wounding 16–20 people.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|loc= Chapter XIV, footnote 21}}

Čabrinović swallowed his [[cyanide pill]] and jumped into the Miljacka river. Čabrinović's suicide attempt failed, as the old [[cyanide]] only induced vomiting, and the Miljacka was only 13&amp;nbsp;cm deep due to the hot, dry summer.&lt;ref&gt;Malmberg, Ilkka: ''Tästä alkaa maailmansota''. ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' monthly supplement, June 2014, pp. 60-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Police dragged Čabrinović out of the river, and he was severely beaten by the crowd before being taken into custody.

The procession sped away towards the Town Hall leaving the disabled car behind. Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, and Trifun Grabež failed to act as the motorcade passed them at high speed.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=318–320; 344}}

===Town Hall reception===
[[File:Sarajevo-assn-chart.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the place where the Archduke was killed]]
Arriving at the Town Hall for a scheduled reception, Franz Ferdinand showed understandable signs of stress, interrupting a prepared speech of welcome by [[Fehim Čurčić|Mayor Fehim Curčić]] to protest: "Mr. Mayor, I came here on a visit and I am greeted with bombs. It is outrageous."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=36–37}} Duchess Sophie then whispered into Franz Ferdinand's ear, and after a pause, Franz Ferdinand said to the mayor: "Now you may speak."{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=12}} He then became calm and the mayor gave his speech. Franz Ferdinand had to wait as his own speech, still wet with blood from being in the damaged car, was brought to him. To the prepared text he added a few remarks about the day's events thanking the people of Sarajevo for their ovations "as I see in them an expression of their joy at the failure of the attempt at assassination."{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=13–14}}

Officials and members of the Archduke's party discussed what to do next. The archduke's chamberlain, Baron Rumerskirch, proposed that the couple remain at the Town Hall until troops could be brought into the city to line the streets. Governor-General Oskar Potiorek vetoed this suggestion&lt;ref name="Buttar 282"&gt;{{cite book|first=Prit|last=Buttar|page=282|title=Collision of Empires|ISBN=978-1-78200-648-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that soldiers coming straight from maneuvers would not have the dress uniforms appropriate for such duties. "Do you think that Sarajevo is full of assassins?" he concluded.&lt;ref name="Buttar 282"/&gt;

Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave up their planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a protective position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=15}} This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45&amp;nbsp;a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie got back into the motorcade, once again in the third car.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=15}} In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, [[Leopold Lojka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722283,00.html |title=Time Magazine Milestones (as Leopold Lojka) |publisher=Time.com |date=1926-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The reason for this is that Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/sarajevothestory010489mbp/sarajevothestory010489mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Sarajevo The Story of a Political Murder" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.

===Fatal shooting===
[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|thumb|right|The aftermath of the assassination{{sfn|Butcher|2014|loc=p. 277; Many sources describe this picture as showing Princip being arrested, but modern historians believe that the man was a bystander named Ferdinand Behr}}]]
[[File:Gabrillo Princip's pistol (3444725633).jpg|thumb|Princip's [[FN Model 1910]] pistol, displayed at the Museum of Military History, Vienna, 2009]]
After learning that the first assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and decided to move to a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the [[Latin Bridge in Sarajevo|Latin Bridge]].{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=67-8}} At this point the Archdukes' motorcade turned off the Appel Quay, mistakenly following the original route which would have taken them to the National Museum.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the second vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to reverse and take the Quay to the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Driver Lojka stopped the car close to where Princip was standing, prior to backing up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The latter stepped forward and fired two shots from a distance of about {{convert|1+1/2|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} using a [[Belgian]]-made 9×17mm ([[.380 ACP]]) ''[[Fabrique Nationale]]'' [[FN Model 1910|model 1910]] [[semi-automatic pistol]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074.{{sfn|Belfield|2005|p=237}} According to Albertini, "the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the [[jugular vein]], the second inflicted an abdominal wound on the Duchess."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=36}} Princip was immediately arrested. At his sentencing, Princip stated that his intention had been to kill [[Oskar Potiorek|Governor Potiorek]], rather than Sophie.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=346}}

Both victims remained seated upright, but died while being driven to the Governor's residence for medical treatment. As reported by Count Harrach, Franz Ferdinand's last words were "Sophie, Sophie! Don't die! Live for our children!" followed by six or seven utterances of "It is nothing," in response to Harrach's inquiry as to Franz Ferdinand's injury.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=37–38}} These utterances were followed by a long [[death rattle]]. Sophie was dead on arrival at the Governor's residence. Franz Ferdinand died 10 minutes later.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=38}}

===Funeral===
The bodies were transported to Trieste by the battleship {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} and then to Vienna by special train. Even though most foreign royalty had planned to attend, they were pointedly disinvited and the funeral was just the immediate imperial family, with the dead couple's three children excluded from the few public ceremonies. The officer corps was forbidden to salute the funeral train, and this led to a minor revolt led by [[Charles I of Austria|Archduke Karl]], the new heir presumptive. The public viewing of the coffins was curtailed severely and even more scandalously, Montenuovo tried unsuccessfully to make the children foot the bill. The Archduke and Duchess were interred at [[Artstetten Castle]] because the Duchess could not be buried in the [[Imperial Crypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Funeral of the Archduke |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n64/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |location=New York |date=Jul 13, 1914|page=59 |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
[[File:1914-06-29 - Aftermath of attacks against Serbs in Sarajevo.png|thumbnail|right|250px|Crowds on the streets in the aftermath of the [[Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo]], 29 June 1914]]
All of the assassins were eventually caught.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=45}} Those in Austro-Hungarian custody were tried together with members of the infiltration route who had helped deliver them and their weapons to Sarajevo. Mehmedbašić was arrested in Montenegro, but was allowed to "escape" to Serbia where he joined Major Tankosić's auxiliaries,&lt;ref&gt;''Documents Diplomatiques Francais III Serie 1911–14,3'', X Doc. 537&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1916 Serbia imprisoned him on other false charges (see criminal penalty section below).

[[Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo|Anti-Serb rioting broke out in Sarajevo]] and various other places within Austria-Hungary in the hours following the assassination until order was restored by the military.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=120-1}} On the night of the assassination, country-wide anti-Serb pogroms and demonstrations were also organized in other parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, particularly on the territory of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports Service: Southeast Europe series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGtWAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 December 2013|year=1964|publisher=American Universities Field Staff.|page=44|quote=... the assassination was followed by officially encouraged anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo and elsewhere and a country-wide pogrom of Serbs throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProhićBalić1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kasim Prohić|author2=Sulejman Balić|title=Sarajevo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVdpAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 December 2013|year=1976|publisher=Tourist Association|page=1898|quote= Immediately after the assassination of 28th June, 1914, veritable pogroms were organised against the Serbs on the...}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=27}} They were organized and stimulated by [[Oskar Potiorek]], the Austro-Hungarian governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="Novak1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Viktor|authorlink=Viktor Novak|title=Istoriski časopis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To9pAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 December 2013|year=1971|page=481|quote=Не само да Поћорек није спречио по- громе против Срба после сарајевског атентата већ их је и организовао и под- стицао.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first anti-Serb demonstrations, led by the followers of [[Josip Frank]], were organized in early evening of 28 June in [[Zagreb]]. The following day, anti-Serb demonstrations in Sarajevo became more violent and could be characterized as a [[pogrom]]. The police and local authorities in the city did nothing to prevent anti-Serb violence.{{sfn|Mitrović|2007|p=18}} Writer [[Ivo Andrić]] referred to the violence in Sarajevo as the "Sarajevo frenzy of hate."{{sfn|Gioseffi|1993|p=246}} Two Serbs were killed on the first day of pogrom in Sarajevo, many were attacked, while around 1,000 houses, shops, schools and institutions (such as banks, hotels, printing houses) owned by Serbs were razed or pillaged.{{sfn|Donia|2006|p=125}}

==Trials and punishment==

===Sarajevo trial (October 1914)===
[[File:Proces w Sarajewie s.jpg|thumb|250px|The Sarajevo trial in progress. Princip is seated in the center of the first row.]]
Austro-Hungarian authorities arrested and prosecuted the Sarajevo assassins (except for Mehmedbašić who had escaped to Montenegro and was released from police custody there to Serbia)&lt;ref&gt;''Documents Diplomatiques Francais III Serie 1911–14,3'', X Doc. 537. This document notes that the diplomatic cable was forwarded to the Secret Service of the National Security Department to investigate the matter of the January 1914 irredentist planning meeting in France but the Secret Service did not report back.&lt;/ref&gt; together with the agents and peasants who had assisted them on their way. The top count in the indictments was conspiracy to commit high treason involving official circles in the Kingdom of Serbia. Conspiracy to commit high treason carried a maximum sentence of death which conspiracy to commit simple murder did not. The trial was held from 12 October to 23 October with the verdict and sentences announced on 28 October 1914.

The adult defendants, facing the death penalty, portrayed themselves at trial as unwilling participants in the conspiracy. The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court:  "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason and we are going to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'"{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=159}} Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež."{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=170}} Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: "I was more afraid of terror than the law."{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=170}}

In order to refute the charge, the conspirators from Belgrade, who because of their youth did not face the death penalty, focused during the trial on putting blame on themselves and deflecting it from official Serbia and modified their court testimony from their prior depositions accordingly.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=50-1}} Princip stated under cross examination: "I am a Yugoslav nationalist and I believe in unification of all South Slavs in whatever form of state and that it be free of Austria." Princip was then asked how he intended to realize his goal and responded: "By means of terror."{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=56}} Cabrinović, though, testified that the political views that motivated him to kill Franz Ferdinand were views held in the circles he traveled in within Serbia.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=50}} The court did not believe the defendants' stories claiming to hold official Serbia blameless.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=68}} The verdict ran: "The court regards it as proved by the evidence that both the ''Narodna Odbrana'' and military circles in the Kingdom of Serbia in charge of the espionage service, collaborated in the outrage."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=68}}

Prison terms, death sentences and acquittals were as follows:{{sfn|Owings|1984|pp=527–530}}

At trial Čabrinović had expressed his regrets for the murders. Following sentencing, Čabrinović received a letter of complete forgiveness from the three young children the assassins had orphaned.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=345–346}} Čabrinović and Princip died of [[tuberculosis]] in prison. Those under the age of 20 years at the time of the crime could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years under Austrian-Hungarian law. The court heard arguments regarding Princip's age, as there was some doubt as to his true date of birth but concluded that Princip was under 20 at the time of the assassination.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=343}} Because Bosnia and Herzegovina had not yet been assigned to Austria or to Hungary, the Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister administered Bosnia and Herzegovina and had responsibility for recommending clemency to the Kaiser.

===Salonika trial (spring 1917)===
In late 1916 and early 1917, secret peace talks took place between Austria-Hungary and France. There is circumstantial evidence that parallel discussions were held between Austria-Hungary and Serbia with Prime Minister Pašić dispatching his righthand man Stojan Protić and Regent [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] dispatching his confidant{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=53}} Colonel [[Petar Živković]] to Geneva on secret business.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=70–71}} [[Charles I of Austria]] laid out Austria-Hungary's key demand for returning Serbia to the control of the Serbian Government in exile: that Serbia should provide guarantees that there be no further political agitation emanating from Serbia against Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=72}}
[[File:Salonika Trial, after verdict.jpg|thumb|Indictees at the Salonika trial, after the verdict]]
For some time, Regent Alexander and officers loyal to him had planned to get rid of the military clique headed by Apis as Apis represented a political threat to Alexander's power.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=56–64}} The Austro-Hungarian peace demand gave added impetus to this plan. On 15 March 1917 Apis and the officers loyal to him were indicted, on various false charges unrelated to Sarajevo (the case was retried before the Supreme Court of Serbia in 1953 and all defendants were exonerated),{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=2}} by Serbian Court Martial on the French-controlled [[Salonika]] front. On 23 May Apis and eight of his associates were sentenced to death; two others were sentenced to 15 years in prison. One defendant died during the trial and the charges against him were dropped. The Serbian High Court reduced the number of death sentences to seven. Regent Alexander commuted four of the remaining death sentences, leaving just three death sentences in place.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=344–347}}
Amongst those tried, four of the defendants had confessed their roles in Sarajevo and their final sentences were as follows:{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=329; 344–347}}

In justifying the executions, Prime Minister Pašić wrote to his envoy in London:"...Dimitrijević (Apis) besides everything else admitted he had ordered Franz Ferdinand to be killed. And now who could reprieve them?"{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=392}}

As the three condemned men were driven to their execution, Apis remarked to the driver "Now it is clear to me and clear to you too, that I am to be killed today by Serbian rifles solely because I organized the Sarajevo outrage.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=80–81}}

Vojislav Tankosić died in battle in late 1915 and so was not put on trial.{{sfn|Magrini|1929|p=95}}

==Controversy about responsibility==

===Serbia's "warning" to Austria-Hungary===
Following the assassinations, Serbian Ambassador to France [[Milenko Radomar Vesnić|Milenko Vesnić]] and Serbian Ambassador to Russia [[Miroslav Spalajković]] put out statements claiming that Serbia had warned Austria-Hungary of the impending assassination.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=100–101}} Serbia soon thereafter denied making warnings and denied knowledge of the plot. Prime Minister Pašić himself made these denials to ''Az Est'' on 7 July and to the Paris Edition of the ''New York Herald'' on 20 July.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=99}} Other voices eventually spoke out on the "warning". As Serbian Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović wrote in ''Krv Sloventsva'', in late May or early June, Prime Minister Pašić reviewed the plot of the impending assassination with members of his cabinet.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=90}} On 18 June, a telegram, lacking in specifics, ordered Serbia's Ambassador to Vienna, Jovan Jovanović, to warn Austria-Hungary that Serbia had reason to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=101}} On 21 June, Ambassador Jovanović met with Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister Bilinski. According to Serbian Military Attaché to Vienna, Colonel Lesanin, Ambassador Jovanović, spoke to Bilinski and "...stressed in general terms the risks the Archduke heir apparent {{sic}} might run from the inflamed public opinion in Bosnia and Serbia. Some serious personal misadventure might befall him. His journey might give rise to incidents and demonstrations that Serbia would deprecate but that would have fatal repercussions on Austro-Serbian relations."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=104–105}} Jovanović came back from the meeting with Bilinski and told Lesanin that "...Bilinski showed no sign of attaching great importance to the total message and dismissed it limiting himself to remarking when saying goodbye and thanking him:  'Let us hope nothing does happen.'"{{sfn|Magrini|1929|pp=115–116}} The Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister took no action based on Jovanović's remarks.

In 1924 J. Jovanović went public stating that his warning had been made on his own initiative, and what he said was that "Among the Serb youths (in the army) there may be one who will put a ball-cartridge in his rifle or revolver in place of a blank cartridge and he may fire it, the bullet might strike the man giving provocation (Franz Ferdinand)."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=102–103}} J. Jovanović's account changed back and forth over the years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=102–105}}  Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=102–103}}

In the days leading up to the assassination, Pašić was caretaker prime minister because during this period the Serbian Government briefly fell to a political alliance led by the Serbian Military. The military favored promoting Jovan Jovanović to Foreign Minister,{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=106}} and Jovanović's loyalties one might expect to have been divided and his orders therefore carried out poorly. By choosing a military loyalist to convey the message, and by not including any of the specifics such as the conspirators' names and weapons, Pašić, a survivor, hedged his bets against the various possible outcomes and consequences of the impending assassination.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=106–109}}

===Rade Malobabić===
In 1914, Rade Malobabić was Serbian Military Intelligence's chief undercover operative against Austria-Hungary. His name appeared in Serbian documents captured by Austria-Hungary during the war. These documents describe the running of arms, munitions, and agents from Serbia into Austria-Hungary under Malobabić's direction.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=388–389}}

Owing to the suppression by Serbia of Apis's confession and of the Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. Apis's confession, however, states that "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination on the occasion of the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo."{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=398}} At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified:  'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [signed by Marshal Putnik, Serbia's top military officer] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent {{sic}} them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.'  Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand."{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=241–242}} On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war."{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=399}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=391}} Vladimir Dedijer in ''The Road to Sarajevo'' presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=394}} This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.

==="Black Hand" or Serbian military intelligence?===
{{Further|Black Hand (Serbia)}}

An alternative theory to the Sarajevo attack being a Serbian Military Intelligence Operation was that it was a "Black Hand" operation. The "Black Hand" was a Serbian military society formed on 9 May 1911 by officers in the [[Army of the Kingdom of Serbia]], originating in the conspiracy group that assassinated the Serbian royal couple in May 1903, led by captain Dragutin Dimitrijević (Commonly referred to as "Apis").{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=27-28, 585}}

After Serbia's victory over Bulgaria in Macedonia in the [[Balkan Wars]], the "Black Hand" became moribund because of the death of its president and the failure to replace him, an inactive secretary, casualties, broken links between its three-man cells, and a drying up of funding.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=133–134; 137; 143}} By 1914 the "Black Hand" was no longer operating under its constitution but rather as a creature of the Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Apis, and its active ranks were composed mostly of Serbian officers loyal to Apis. Apis's confession to ordering the operation that begins with the phrase "As the Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff",{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=398}} the fact that the military chain of command was invoked, the moribund nature of the "Black Hand" and the fact that under the "Black Hand" constitution Article 16, such an assassination could only be ordered by a vote of the Supreme Council Directorate, the President or the Secretary and no such order was made,{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|p=46}} are factors in favor of assigning responsibility to Serbian Military Intelligence. The fact that Milan Ciganović was involved, that the key officers involved were "Black Hand" members,{{sfn|Craig|2005|p=3}}{{sfn|Remak|1971|p=71}} that "Black Hand" Provincial Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina Vladimir Gaćinović was consulted{{sfn|MacKenzie|1989|p=135}} and that there was no official budget for the operation favors assigning responsibility to the "Black Hand".

===The newspaper clipping===
At trial, it was noted that the three assassins from Belgrade tried to take all blame on themselves. Čabrinović claimed the idea of killing Franz Ferdinand came from a newspaper clipping he received in the mail at the end of March announcing Franz Ferdinand's planned visit to Sarajevo.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=289}} He then showed the newspaper clipping to Princip and the next day they agreed they would kill Franz Ferdinand. Princip explained to the court he had already read about Franz Ferdinand's upcoming visit in German papers.{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=57}} Princip went on to testify that, at about the time of Easter (19 April), he wrote an allegorical letter to Ilić informing him of the plan to kill Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=65}} Grabež testified that he and Princip, also at about the time of Easter, agreed between them to make an assassination of either Governor Potiorek or Franz Ferdinand and a little later settled on Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Owings|1984|p=89}} The defendants refused or were unable to provide details under examination.

On 26 March Ilić and Mehmedbašić had already agreed to kill Franz Ferdinand based on instructions from Belgrade predating the newspaper clipping and the discussions amongst the three assassins in Belgrade.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=283|ps=; Dedijer placed the meeting in Sarajevo, not Mostar.}}

===Narodna Odbrana===
{{Further|Narodna Odbrana}}

Serbian Military Intelligence – through remnants of the "Black Hand" – penetrated the Narodna Odbrana, using its clandestine tunnel to smuggle the assassins and their weapons from Belgrade to Sarajevo. In the 5 June 1914 report by the President of the Narodna Odbrana Boža Milanović to Prime Minister Pašić one can sense the frustration of the President over the hijacking of his organization in the final sentence dealing with Sarajevo:  "Boža has informed all the agents that they should not receive anyone unless he produces the password given by Boža."{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=390; 505}}

===Milan Ciganović===
Prime Minister Pašić received early information of the assassination plan. The information was received by Pašić early enough, according to Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović, for the government to order the border guards to prevent the assassins from crossing. This places the cabinet minister discussions in late May and the information release to some time before that.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=92}} Albertini concluded that the source of the information was most likely Milan Ciganović.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=282–283}} Bogičević made a more forceful case.

The circumstantial evidence against Ciganović includes his sinecure government job, his protection by the Chief of Police and Serbia's failure to arrest him (Austria-Hungary demanded Serbia arrest Major Vojislav Tankosić and Ciganović, but Serbia arrested only Tankosić and lied saying that Ciganović could not be found), Serbia's protection of Ciganović during the war, and the government's provision for Ciganović after it. In 1917, all of the Sarajevo conspirators within Serbia's control were tried at Salonika on false charges, except Ciganović, who even gave evidence against his comrades at the trial.

===Russian military attaché's office===
Apis's confession to ordering the assassination of Franz Ferdinand states that Russian Military Attaché Artamonov promised Russia's protection from Austria-Hungary if Serbia's intelligence operations became exposed and that Russia had funded the assassination. Artamonov denied the involvement of his office in an interview with Albertini. Artamonov stated that he went on vacation to Italy leaving Assistant Military Attaché Alexander Werchovsky in charge and though he was in daily contact with Apis he did not learn of Apis's role until after the war had ended.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=84–85}} Albertini writes that he "remained unconvinced by the behavior of this officer."{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=85}} Werchovsky admitted the involvement of his office and then fell silent on the subject.{{sfn|Trydar-Burzinski|1926|p=128}}

There is evidence that Russia was at least aware of the plot before 14 June. De Schelking writes: {{quotation|On 1 June 1914 (14 June new calendar), Emperor Nicholas had an interview with King Charles I of Roumania, at Constanza. I was there at the time ... yet as far as I could judge from my conversation with members of his (Russian Foreign Minister Sazonov's) entourage, he (Sazonov) was convinced that if the Archduke (Franz Ferdinand) were out of the way, the peace of Europe would not be endangered.{{sfn|De Schelking|1918|pp=194–195}}}}

The murder of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife produced widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position. Ordinary people did not really care about what happened, and on the evening of the assassination the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/european-powers-maintain-focus-despite-killings-in-sarajevo|title=European powers maintain focus despite killings in Sarajevo&amp;nbsp;— History.com This Day in History|date=30 June 1914|publisher=History.com|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=26}} Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and [[German Empire|Germany]] advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied "Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government." An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=273}}

After conducting a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, [[Austria-Hungary]] issued a formal letter to the government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil who were involved in the assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=285–289}}

This letter became known as the [[July Ultimatum]], and Austria-Hungary stated that if Serbia did not accept all of the demands in total within 48 hours, it would recall its ambassador from Serbia. After receiving a telegram of support from Russia, Serbia mobilized its army and responded to the letter by completely accepting point #8 demanding an end to the smuggling of weapons and punishment of the frontier officers who had assisted the assassins and completely accepting point #10 which demanded Serbia report the execution of the required measures as they were completed. Serbia partially accepted, finessed, disingenuously answered or politely rejected elements of the preamble and enumerated demands #1–7 and #9. The shortcomings of Serbia's response were published by Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary responded by breaking diplomatic relations.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=373}}

The next day, Serbian reservists being transported on tramp steamers on the [[Danube]] crossed onto the Austro-Hungarian side of the river at [[Kovin|Temes-Kubin]] and Austro-Hungarian soldiers fired into the air to warn them off.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=461–462; 465}} The report of this incident was initially sketchy and reported to Emperor Franz-Joseph erroneously as "a considerable skirmish".{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=460}}&lt;ref name=Wien&gt;Manfried, Rauchensteiner.

Under the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Secret Treaty of 1892]] Russia and France were obliged to mobilize their armies if any of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] mobilized. Russia's mobilization set off full Austro-Hungarian and German mobilizations. Soon all the Great Powers except Italy had chosen sides and gone to war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5069">[[File:Bollaert vu depuis le terril du 11-19.JPG|thumb|Nivel was assaulted in the vicinity of the [[Stade Félix Bollaert]] in Lens]]
On 21 June 1998, Daniel Nivel, member of the National Gendarmerie was assaulted in the city of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] by German [[football hooligans]] during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. He fell into a six-week coma and was left with permanent disability.

One of his attackers was arrested at the scene and tried in France, receiving a jail sentence of five years and being barred from returning to the country. Four others were tried in [[Essen]] in their own country and found guilty, with one being jailed for ten years for attempted murder and the others receiving shorter sentences for serious bodily harm.

The attack was deemed a national shame by German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. In the years since, Nivel has been a guest of honour at Germany football matches and a foundation in his name has opposed football hooliganism.

==Attack==
After Germany's 2–2 draw with [[FR Yugoslavia national football team|FR Yugoslavia]] at the [[Stade Félix Bollaert]], 43-year-old Nivel was one of three members of the National Gendarmerie attacked by hooligans. He was struck by advertising boards and when he was lying on the floor without his helmet, was stamped and kicked in the head. Nivel fell into a [[coma]] until 4 August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup Gendarme out of coma|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/144985.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=5 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was left with permanent disability in his speech and movement.&lt;ref name=may01&gt;{{cite news|title=German fan jailed for gendarme attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1344821.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Helmut Kohl]] called the attack a national disgrace and requested that the team withdraw from the tournament.&lt;ref name=april99/&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Markus Warnecke, a [[Braunschweig]] native in his late 20s, was arrested at the scene of the crime. He was a bouncer and tattoo artist, and an alleged far-right activist. Warnecke was tried in nearby [[Saint-Omer]]; the prosecution considered him the ringleader, while the defence claimed that photographic element refuted that. Facing a maximum sentence of 15 years, Warnecke was jailed for five in May 2001. He was banned from all sports venues for five years and made ''[[persona non grata]]'' in France for ten.&lt;ref name=may01/&gt;

In April 1999, the trial began for four defendants in [[Essen]]. Andre Zawacki, Frank Renger and Tobias Reifschlaeger all confessed, while Christopher Rauch used his right to remain silent. Nivel did not attend the start of the trial due to his speech problems.&lt;ref name=april99&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans on trial for World Cup attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/332356.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, all four were found guilty: Zawacki was sentenced to ten years in prison for attempted murder; Reifschlaeger, Renger and Rauch were convicted of serious bodily harm. They were jailed for six, five, and three-and-a-half years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans jailed for World Cup attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/511253.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=9 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2000, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) set up the Daniel Nivel Foundation to confront football hooliganism and support victims.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;

On 14 June 2006, Nivel was the DFB's guest of honour for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game between that country and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at the [[Westfalenstadion]] in [[Dortmund]]; he was seated next to Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. The game was also marred by hooliganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelso|first1=Paul|title=Police arrest around 200 fans after city centre trouble|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/15/worldcup2006.sport26|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=The Guardian|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nivel was also invited to Germany's match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], in [[Lille]] near Lens.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany invite victim of football hooliganism to Euro 2016 opener|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/germany/story/2888579/germany-invite-victim-of-football-hooliganism-to-euro-2016-opener|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=ESPN FC|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2018, prior to the [[UEFA Nations League]] football match between France and Germany, Nivel was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] by the german Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Heiko Maas]] in Paris.

[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|The original goat pentagram first appeared in the book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' by French occultist [[Stanislas de Guaita]], in 1897. This symbol would later become synonymous with Baphomet, and is commonly referred to as the Sabbatic Goat. [[Samael]] is a figure in [[Talmud]]ic lore, and [[Lilith]] is a female demon in [[Jewish mythology]]. The Hebrew letters at the five points of the pentagram spell out [[Leviathan]], a mythic creature in Jewish lore.

'''Baphomet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|f|oʊ-|m|ɛ|t}};{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Baphometh'', ''Baffometi'', [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''Bafometz'') is a deity that the [[Knights Templar]] were falsely accused of worshipping and that subsequently was incorporated into disparate occult and mystical traditions.

==History==
The name Baphomet first appeared in trial transcripts for the Inquisition of the Knights Templar starting in 1307.&lt;ref name=Michelet/&gt; It first came into popular English usage in the 19th century during debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templars.&lt;ref&gt;"In the 19th century a fresh impetus was given to the discussion by the publication in 1813 of [[François Just Marie Raynouard|F.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;M. Raynouard's]] brilliant defence of the order. The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol. On the other hand, Wilhelm Havemann (''Geschichte des Ausganges des Tempelherrenordens, Stuttgart and Tübingen'', 1846) decided in favour of the innocence of the order. This view was also taken by a succession of German scholars, in England by C. G. Addison, and in France by a whole series of conspicuous writers: ''e.g.'' Mignet, Guizot, Renan, Lavocat. Others, like Boutaric, while rejecting the charge of heresy, accepted the evidence for the ''spuitio'' and the indecent kisses, explaining the former as a formula of forgotten meaning and the latter as a sign of ''fraternité!''" ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1856, the name Baphomet has been associated with a "Sabbatic Goat" image drawn by [[Eliphas Levi]]&lt;ref name=Waite/&gt; which contains binary elements representing the "sum total of the universe" (e.g. male and female, good and evil, on and off, etc.).&lt;ref name="Guiley2008"&gt;Guiley, "Baphomet".&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, Lévi's intention was to symbolize his concept of "the equilibrium of the opposites" that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light; on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a  tradition that should result in a perfect social order.&lt;ref name="correspondencesjournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://correspondencesjournal.com/15303-2/|title=The "Baphomet" of Eliphas Lévi - Correspondences: Online Journal for the Academic Study of Western Esotericism|website=correspondencesjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Baphomet'' appeared in July 1098 in a letter by the crusader Anselm of Ribemont:

A chronicler of the [[First Crusade]], [[Raymond of Aguilers]], called the mosques ''Bafumarias''.&lt;ref&gt;"Raimundus de Agiles says of the Mahometans: In ecclesiis autem magnis '''Bafumarias''' faciebant .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. habebant monticulum ubi duæ erant '''Bafumariæ'''.

When the medieval order of the Knights Templar was suppressed by King [[Philip IV of France]], on Friday 13&amp;nbsp;October 1307, Philip had many French Templars simultaneously arrested, and then tortured into confessions. Over 100&amp;nbsp;different charges had been leveled against the Templars. Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the [[Catharism|Cathars]]&lt;ref&gt;Barber 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt; and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and charged him with near identical offenses of heresy, spitting and urinating on the cross, and [[sodomy]]. Yet [[Malcolm Barber]] observes that historians "find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication".&lt;ref&gt;Barber 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;306.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Chinon Parchment]] suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross," says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the [[Saracen]]s, where they were taught how to commit [[apostasy]] "with the mind only and not with the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Michael Haag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Haag |title=Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's temple to the Freemasons |publisher=Profile Books |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation ritual.

{{quote| The indictment (acte d'accusation) published by the court of Rome set forth ... "that in all the provinces they had idols, that is to say, heads, some of which had three faces, others but one; sometimes, it was a human skull ... That in their assemblies, and especially in their grand chapters, they worshipped the idol as a god, as their saviour, saying that this head could save them, that it bestowed on the order all its wealth, made the trees flower, and the plants of the earth to sprout forth."&lt;ref name=Michelet&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA375&amp;id=drQMAQAAMAAJ |title=History of France |first=Jules |last=Michelet |date=30 March 1860 |publisher=D. Appleton |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name ''Baphomet'' comes up in several of these confessions. Peter Partner states in his 1987 book ''The Knights Templar and their Myth'', "In the trial of the Templars one of their main charges was their supposed worship of a heathen idol-head known as a 'Baphomet' ('Baphomet' = Mahomet)."&lt;ref name=partner&gt;Partner, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The description of the object changed from confession to confession. Some Templars denied any knowledge of it. Others, under torture, described it as being either a severed head, a cat, or a head with three faces.&lt;ref&gt;Read, p.&amp;nbsp;266.&lt;/ref&gt; The Templars did possess several silver-gilt heads as [[Reliquary|reliquaries]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; including one marked ''capud {{smallcaps|lviii}}&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'',&lt;ref&gt;"''Per quem allatum fuit eis quoddam magnum capud argenteum deauratum pulcrum, figuram muliebrem habens, intra quod erant ossa unius capitis, involuta et consuta in quodam panno lineo albo, syndone rubea superposita, et erat ibi quedam cedula consuta in qua erat scriptum capud {{smallcaps|lviii}}&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, et dicta ossa assimilabantur ossibus capitis parvi muliebris, et dicebatur ab aliquibus quod erat capud unius undecim millium virginum.''" {{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22920 |title=Procès |volume=ii |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; another said to be [[Euphemia|St. Euphemia]],&lt;ref&gt;Barber 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the actual head of [[Hugues de Payens]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is possible that the head mentioned was in fact a reliquary of Hugh of Payns, containing his actual head." Barber 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;331.&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of an idol named Baphomet were unique to the Inquisition of the Templars.&lt;ref name=Ngeo&gt;{{cite media |publisher=[[National Geographic Channel]] |title=Knights Templar |date=22 February 2006 |medium=video documentary |author=Jesse Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Ralls, author of the ''Knights Templar Encyclopedia'', argues that it is significant that "no specific evidence [of Baphomet] appears in either the Templar Rule or in other medieval period Templar documents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ralls |first=Karen |title=Knights Templar Encyclopedia |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars agree that the name of Baphomet was an Old French corruption of the name Muhammad, with the interpretation being that some of the Templars, through their long military occupation of the [[Outremer]], had begun incorporating Islamic ideas into their belief system, and that this was seen and documented by the Inquisitors as heresy.&lt;ref name=barber&gt;Barber 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;321.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Demurger]], however, rejects the idea that the Templars could have adopted the doctrines of their enemies.&lt;ref name=BarberTale&gt;Barber 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Nicholson writes that the charges were essentially "manipulative"—the Templars "were accused of becoming fairy-tale Muslims."&lt;ref name=BarberTale/&gt; Medieval Christians believed that Muslims were [[Idolatry|idolatrous]] and worshipped Muhammad as a god, with ''mahomet'' becoming ''[[wikt:mammet|mammet]]'' in English, meaning an idol or false god.&lt;ref&gt;Games and Coren, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–144.&lt;/ref&gt; This idol-worship is attributed to Muslims in several ''[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''. For example, one finds the gods ''Bafum e [[Termagant|Travagan]]'' in a Provençal poem on the life of [[Honoratus|St. Honorat]], completed in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA2&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Ctc5AAAAcAAJ#v=onepage |title=La vida de Sant Honorat (La vie de Saint Honorat) Légende en vers provençaux du XIIIe siècle par Raymond Féraud: Analyse et morceaux choisis avec la traduction textuelle des dits morceaux, la biographie du vieux poète [Féraud], et une notice historique sur Saint Honorat et sur les iles de Lérins, par A.

==Alternative etymologies==

While modern scholars and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' reports "Baphomet" as a medieval form of Mahomet, but does not find a first appearance in English until [[Henry Hallam]], ''The View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages'', which also appeared in 1818.&lt;/ref&gt; state that the origin of the name Baphomet was a probable Old French version of "Mahomet",&lt;ref name=partner/&gt;&lt;ref name=barber/&gt; alternative etymologies have also been proposed.

According to Pierre Klossowski in ''Le Baphomet'' (1965, Editions Mercure de France, Paris; translated into English by Sophie Hawkes and published as ''The Baphomet'' in 1988 by Eridanos Press): “The ''Baphomet'' has diverse etymologies… the three phonemes that constitute the denomination are also said to signify, in coded fashion, '''Ba'''sileus philoso'''pho'''rum '''met'''aloricum: the sovereign of metallurgical philosophers, that is, of the alchemical laboratories that were supposedly established in various chapters of the Temple.  The androgynous nature of the figure apparently goes back to the Adam Kadmon of the Chaldeans, which one finds in the Zohar” (pages 164-165).

In the 18th century, speculative theories arose that sought to tie the Knights Templar with the origins of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref name="knighttemplars"&gt;Hodapp, pp. 203–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Bookseller, Freemason and [[Illuminati|Illuminatus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McKeown| first = Trevor W| title = A Bavarian Illuminati Primer| accessdate = 2011-04-21| url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/illuminati.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christoph Friedrich Nicolai]] (1733–1811), in ''Versuch über die Beschuldigungen welche dem Tempelherrenorden gemacht worden, und über dessen Geheimniß'' (1782), was the first to claim that the Templars were [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], and that "Baphomet" was formed from the Greek words βαφη μητȢς, ''baphe metous'', to mean ''Taufe der Weisheit'', "Baptism of Wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-3A31ED-VFgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136 Nicolai, vol. i, p. 136 ff.] Nicolai's theories are discussed by [[Thomas De Quincey]] in {{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhaaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA444|title=Historico-Critical Inquiry into the Origin of the Rosicrucians and the Free-Masons|journal=London Magazine|date=1824}} See also Partner, p. 129: "The German Masonic bookseller, Friedrich Nicolai, produced an idea that the Templar Masons, through the medieval Templars, were the eventual heirs of an heretical doctrine which originated with the early Gnostics. He supported this belief by a farrago of learned references to the writings of early Fathers of the Church on heresy, and by impressive-looking citations from the Syriac. Nicolai based his theory on false etymology and wild surmise, but it was destined to be very influential. He was also most probably familiar with [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s claim, made in the early sixteenth century, that the medieval Templars had been wizards."&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolai "attached to it the idea of the image of the supreme God, in the state of quietude attributed to him by the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Gnostics", according to F.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;M. Raynouard, and "supposed that the Templars had a secret doctrine and initiations of several grades" which "the Saracens had communicated&amp;nbsp;... to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA496&amp;id=mAcMAAAAYAAJ|title=The History of the Crusades|first=Joseph Fr|last=Michaud|date=30 March 2018|publisher=Redfield|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further connected the ''figura Baffometi'' with the pentagram of Pythagoras:
{{Quote|What properly was the sign of the Baffomet, 'figura Baffometi,' which was depicted on the breast of the bust representing the Creator, cannot be exactly determined&amp;nbsp;... I believe it to have been the Pythagorean pentagon (Fünfeck) of health and prosperity: ...&amp;nbsp;It is well known how holy this figure was considered, and that the Gnostics had much in common with the Pythagoreans. From the prayers which the soul shall recite, according to the [[Ophite Diagrams|diagram of the Ophite-worshippers]], when they on their return to God are stopped by the Archons, and their purity has to be examined, it appears that these serpent-worshippers believed they must produce a token that they had been clean on earth. I believe that this token was also the holy pentagon, the sign of their initiation (τελειας βαφης μετεος).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA284&amp;id=XFgDAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage|title=Symbols and Symbolism|journal=Freemasons' Quarterly Magazine|volume=1|location=London|year=1854|pages=275–92}} p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Émile Littré]] (1801–1881) in ''Dictionnaire de la langue francaise'' asserted that the word was [[Kabbalah|cabalistically]] formed by writing backward ''tem. o. h. p. ab'', an abbreviation of ''templi omnium hominum pacis abbas'', 'abbot' or 'father of the temple of peace of all men.' His source is the "Abbé Constant", which is to say, Alphonse-Louis Constant, the real name of Eliphas Levi.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Longmead, Shaftesbury, Dorset SP7 8BP, England: Element Books Ltd., 1984; 1998 paperback reissue, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the scholars who worked on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], argued in his book ''The Essene Odyssey'' that the word "Baphomet" was created with knowledge of the [[Atbash|Atbash substitution cipher]], which substitutes the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet for the last, the second for the second last, and so on. "Baphomet" rendered in Hebrew is בפומת; interpreted using Atbash, it becomes שופיא, which can be interpreted as the Greek word "[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]", meaning wisdom. This theory is an important part of the plot of the novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

In 1818, the name Baphomet appeared in the essay by the Viennese Orientalist [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|Joseph Freiherr von Hammer-Purgstall]], ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum, seu Fratres Militiæ Templi, qua Gnostici et quidem Ophiani, Apostasiæ, Idoloduliæ et Impuritatis convicti, per ipsa eorum Monumenta''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage|author=Hammer-Purgstall|title=Mysterium Baphometis revelatum|journal=Fundgruben des Orients|volume=6|location=Vienna|year=1818|pages=1–120; 445–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Discovery of the Mystery of Baphomet, by which the Knights Templars, like the Gnostics and [[Ophites]], are convicted of Apostasy, of Idolatry and of moral Impurity, by their own Monuments"), which presented an elaborate pseudohistory constructed to discredit [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Templarist Masonry]] and, by extension, Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Partner, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Nicolai, he argued, using as archaeological evidence "Baphomets" faked by earlier scholars and literary evidence such as the Grail romances, that the Templars were Gnostics and the "Templars' head" was a Gnostic idol called Baphomet.

{{quote|His chief subject is the images which are called Baphomet&amp;nbsp;... found in several museums and collections of antiquities, as in Weimar&amp;nbsp;... and in the imperial cabinet in Vienna.

The inscriptions he reduces almost all to ''Mete''[, which]&amp;nbsp;... is, according to him, not the Μητις of the Greeks, but the ''Sophia, Achamot Prunikos'' of the Ophites, which was represented half man, half woman, as the symbol of wisdom, unnatural voluptuousness and the principle of sensuality&amp;nbsp;...

Hammer's essay did not pass unchallenged, and F.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;M.

==Eliphas Lévi==
[[File:Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae - The hermaphrodite.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Androgyne of [[Heinrich Khunrath]], ''Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae''.]]

Later in the 19th century, the name of Baphomet became further associated with the [[occult]]. [[Eliphas Levi]] published ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' ("Dogma and Rituals of High Magic") as two volumes (''Dogme'' 1854, ''Rituel'' 1856), in which he included an image he had drawn himself which he described as Baphomet and "The Sabbatic Goat", showing a winged humanoid goat with a pair of breasts and a torch on its head between its horns (''illustration, top''). This image has become the best-known representation of Baphomet. Lévi considered the Baphomet to be a depiction of the absolute in symbolic form and explicated in detail his symbolism in the drawing that served as the frontispiece:
{{quote|The goat on the frontispiece carries the sign of the [[pentagram]] on the forehead, with one point at the top, a symbol of light, his two hands forming the sign of occultism, the one pointing up to the white moon of [[Chesed]], the other pointing down to the black one of [[Gevurah|Geburah]]. This sign expresses the perfect harmony of mercy with justice. His one arm is female, the other male like the ones of the androgyne of Khunrath, the attributes of which we had to unite with those of our goat because he is one and the same symbol. The flame of intelligence shining between his horns is the magic light of the universal balance, the image of the soul elevated above matter, as the flame, whilst being tied to matter, shines above it. The beast's head expresses the horror of the sinner, whose materially acting, solely responsible part has to bear the punishment exclusively; because the soul is insensitive according to its nature and can only suffer when it materializes. The rod standing instead of genitals symbolizes eternal life, the body covered with scales the water, the semi-circle above it the atmosphere, the feathers following above the volatile. Humanity is represented by the two breasts and the androgyne arms of this sphinx of the occult sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"Le bouc qui est représenté dans notre frontispice porte sur le front le signe du pentagramme, la pointe en haut, ce qui suffit pour en faire un symbole de lumière; il fait des deux mains le signe de l'occultisme, et montre en haut la lune blanche de Chesed, et en bas la lune noire de Géburah. Ce signe exprime le parfait accord de la miséricorde avec la justice. L'un des ses bras est féminin, l'autre masculin, comme dans l'androgyne de Khunrath dont nous avons dû réunir les attributs à ceux de notre bouc, puisque c'est un seul et même symbole. Le flambeau de l'intelligence qui brille entre ses cornes, est la lumière magique de l'équilibre universel; c'est aussi la figure de l'âme élevée au-dessus de la matière, bien que tenant à la matière même, comme la flamme tient au flambeau. La tête hideuse de l'animal exprime l'horreur du péché, dont l'agent matériel, seul responsable, doit seul à jamais porter la peine: car l'âme est impassible de sa nature, et n'arrive à souffrir qu'en se matérialisant. Le caducée, qui tient lieu de l'organe générateur, représente la vie éternelle; le ventre couvert d'écailles c'est l'eau; le cercle qui est au-dessus, c'est l'atmosphère; les plumes qui viennent ensuite sont l'emblème du volatile; puis l'humanité est représentée par les deux mamelles et les bras androgynes de ce sphinx des sciences occultes." {{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|authorlink=Éliphas Lévi|title=Dogme et rituel de la haute magie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFOi-CfETNIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA211|year=1861|publisher=G.

===Witches' Sabbath===
Lévi's depiction of Baphomet is similar to that of [[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] in early [[Tarot]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{script|Hebr|ס}} ''Le ciel de Mercure, science occulte, magie, commerce, éloquence, mystère, force morale. Hiéroglyphe, {{smallcaps|le diable}}, le bouc de Mendès ou le Baphomet du temple avec tous ses attributs panthéistiques.''" [https://books.google.com/books?id=KFOi-CfETNIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA352 Lévi, p. 352.]&lt;/ref&gt; Lévi, working with correspondences different from those later used by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|S.&amp;nbsp;L. MacGregor Mathers]], "equated the Devil Tarot key with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]," giving "his figure Mercury's [[caduceus]], rising like a phallus from his groin."&lt;ref&gt;Place, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévi believed that the alleged devil worship of the medieval [[Witches' Sabbath]] was a perpetuation of ancient pagan rites. A goat with a candle between its horns appears in medieval witchcraft records,&lt;ref&gt;In [[Margaret Murray]]'s survey of ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'', the devil was said to appear as "a great ''Black Goat'' with a ''Candle'' between his Horns". Murray, p. 145. For the devil as a goat, see pp. 63, 65, 68–69, 70, 144–146, 159, 160, 180, 182, 183, 233, 247, 248.&lt;/ref&gt; and other pieces of lore are cited in ''Dogme et Rituel''.

{{quote|Below this figure we read a frank and simple inscription—THE DEVIL. Yes, we confront here that phantom of all terrors, the dragon of the all theogenies, the Ahriman of the Persians, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Python of the Greeks, the old serpent of the Hebrews, the fantastic monster, the nightmare, the Croquemitaine, the gargoyle, the great beast of the Middle Ages, and—worse than all these—the Baphomet of the Templars, the bearded idol of the alchemist, the obscene deity of Mendes, the goat of the Sabbath. The frontispiece to this ‘Ritual’ reproduces the exact figure of the terrible emperor of night, with all his attributes and all his characters.... Yes, in our profound conviction, the Grand Masters of the Order of Templars worshipped the Baphomet, and caused it to be worshipped by their initiates; yes, there existed in the past, and there may be still in the present, assemblies which are presided over by this figure, seated on a throne and having a flaming torch between the horns. But the adorers of this sign do not consider, as do we, that it is a representation of the devil; on the contrary, for them it is that of the god Pan, the god of our modern schools of philosophy, the god of the Alexandrian theurgic school and of our own mystical Neoplatonists, the god of Lamartine and Victor Cousin, the god of Spinoza and Plato, the god of the primitive Gnostic schools; the Christ also of the dissident priesthood.... The mysteries of the Sabbath have been variously described, but they figure always in grimoires and in magical trials; the revelations made on the subject may be classified under three heads—1. those referring to a fantastic and imaginary Sabbath; 2. those which betray the secrets of the occult assemblies of veritable adepts; 3. revelations of foolish and criminal gatherings, having for their object the operations of black magic.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi, trans. Waite, [https://archive.org/stream/transcendentalma00leviuoft/transcendentalma00leviuoft_djvu.txt "The Sabbath of the Sorcerers,"] pp. 288–292.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lévi's Baphomet, for all its modern fame, does not match the historical descriptions from the Templar trials, although it may also have been partly inspired by [[grotesque]] carvings on the Templar churches of Lanleff in Brittany and Saint-Merri in Paris, which depict squatting bearded men with bat wings, female breasts, horns and the shaggy hindquarters of a beast,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Nigel &amp; Michael Howard (2003). ''The Pillars of Tubal Cain''. Milverton, Somerset: Capall Bann Publishing. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date=April 2011}} as well as [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]'s vivid [[gargoyle]]s that were added to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] about the same time as Lévi's illustration.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Contemporary context of socialism, romanticism, and magnetism===

Lévi's references to the School of Alexandria and the Templars can be explained against the background of debates about the origins and character of true Christianity. It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of Romantic Socialism, or [[Utopian Socialism]], which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. Lévi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the ''Histoire des Montagnards'' (1847) by his best friend and political comrade [[Alphonse Esquiros]]. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by Lévi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the "emancipation of humanity" and the establishment of a perfect social order.&lt;ref name="correspondencesjournal.com"/&gt;

In Lévi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called "spiritualist magnetism": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a "synthesis" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.&lt;ref name="correspondencesjournal.com"/&gt; Spiritualist mangetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for Lévi. At the same time, Lévi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.&lt;ref name="correspondencesjournal.com"/&gt; The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:

{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &amp;c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi, trans. Waite, [https://archive.org/stream/transcendentalma00leviuoft/transcendentalma00leviuoft_djvu.txt "The Sabbath of the Sorcerers,"] p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Goat of Mendes===

[[File:Banebdjed Tomb KV19.jpg|150px|thumb|Banebdjedet]]
Lévi called his image "The Goat of Mendes", possibly following [[Herodotus]]' account&lt;ref name=Herodotus&gt;{{cite book |author=Herodotus |author-link=Herodotus |title=Histories |at=ii. 42, 46 and 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the god of Mendes — the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt — was depicted with a goat's face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly [[zoophilia|copulated with a goat]].&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch specifically associates [[Osiris]] with the "goat at Mendes". {{cite book |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th140.htm |title=De Iside et Osiride |page=lxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] writes,

{{quote|At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus (ii. 46) instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Diodorus Siculus |author-link=Diodorus Siculus |title=Bibliotheca Historica |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html#ref32 |at=i. 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, a king of the second dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |title=The Gods of the Egyptians: Studies in Egyptian mythology |first=Ernest Alfred Wallis, Sir |last=Budge |date=30 March 2018 |publisher=Methuen &amp; Company |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historically, the deity that was venerated at Egyptian Mendes was a ram deity, [[Banebdjedet]] (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles ''Devil'' card and refigured the ram ''Banebdjed'' as a he-goat, further imagined by him as "copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Aleister Crowley==
The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of Thelema, the mystical system established by [[Aleister Crowley]] in the early twentieth century. Baphomet features in the Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church recited by the congregation in ''[[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|The Gnostic Mass]]'', in the sentence: "And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mysteries, in His name BAPHOMET."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Helena|author2=Tau Apiryon| title = The Invisible Basilica: The Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church: An Examination| accessdate = 2009-08-09| url = http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/creed_egc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', Crowley asserted that Baphomet was a divine androgyne and "the hieroglyph of arcane perfection": Seen as that which reflects. "What occurs above so reflects below, or As above so below"
{{quote|The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unity would be a God... 'The Devil' is, historically, the God of any people that one personally dislikes... This serpent, SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade 'Know Thyself!' and taught Initiation. He is 'The Devil' of The Book of Thoth, and His emblem is &lt;small&gt;BAPHOMET&lt;/small&gt;, the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection... He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreover his letter is ''ayin'', the Eye, so that he is Light; and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = S.

For Crowley, Baphomet is further a representative of the spiritual nature of the spermatozoa while also being symbolic of the "magical child" produced as a result of [[sex magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Feral House| last = Carter| first = John| title = Sex and Rockets: the Occult Life of Jack Parsons| location = USA| year = 2005| isbn = 9780922915972| pages = 151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Baphomet represents the Union of Opposites, especially as mystically personified in [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and [[Babalon]] combined and biologically manifested with the sperm and egg united in the zygote.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Crowley proposed that Baphomet was derived from "Father Mithras". In his ''Confessions'' he describes the circumstances that led to this etymology:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Mandrake Press| last = Crowley| first = Aleister| title = The Spirit of Solitude: an autohagiography: subsequently re-Antichristened The Confessions of Aleister Crowley| location = London| year = 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I had taken the name Baphomet as my motto in the O.T.O. For six years and more I had tried to discover the proper way to spell this name. I knew that it must have eight letters, and also that the numerical and literal correspondences must be such as to express the meaning of the name in such a ways as to confirm what scholarship had found out about it, and also to clear up those problems which archaeologists had so far failed to solve&amp;nbsp;... One theory of the name is that it represents the words βαφὴ μήτεος, the baptism of wisdom; another, that it is a corruption of a title meaning "Father Mithras". Needless to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified itself as being the cube of nine. The word κηφας, the mystic title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name Baphomet to their so-called idol. Baphomet was Father Mithras, the cubical stone which was the corner of the Temple.}}

==Modern interpretations and usage==
[[File:RWS Tarot 15 Devil.jpg|thumb|100px|upright|right|[[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck]].]]

Lévi's Baphomet is the source of the later Tarot image of the Devil in the Rider-Waite design.&lt;ref name=Waite&gt;"Since 1856 the influence of Eliphas Lévi and his doctrine of occultism has changed the face of this card, and it now appears as a pseudo-Baphometic figure with the head of a goat and a great torch between the horns; it is seated instead of erect, and in place of the generative organs there is the Hermetic caduceus." [http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/pkt0102.htm Waite, part i, §2.]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a downward-pointing pentagram on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosmic man]] arranged within a similar but upright pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;"''Le pentagramme élevant en l'air deux de ses pointes représente Satan ou le bouc du sabbat, et il représente le Sauveur lorsqu'il élève en l'air un seul de ses rayons&amp;nbsp;... En le disposant de manière que deux de ses pointes soient en haut et une seule pointe en bas, on peut y voir les cornes, les oreilles et la barbe du bouc hiératique de Mendès, et il devient le signe des évocations infernales.''" [https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA1-PA93&amp;id=KFOi-CfETNIC Lévi, pp. 93-98.]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' by [[Stanislas de Guaita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeYNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387#v=onepage|title=Essais de sciences mandites|first=Stanislas de|last=Guaita|date=30 March 1897|publisher=Chamuel|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this image that was later adopted as the official symbol—called the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]—of the [[Church of Satan]], and continues to be used among Satanists.&lt;ref name="churchofsatan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/BaphometSigil.html|title=Sigil of Baphomet - churchofsatan.com|first=High Priest, Magus Peter H.|last=Gilmore|website=www.churchofsatan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LeoTaxilmysteres.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Promotional poster for [[Léo Taxil]], ''Les Mystères de la franc-maçonnerie dévoilés'' (1886), adapts Lévi's invention.]]

Baphomet, as Lévi's illustration suggests, has occasionally been portrayed as a synonym of [[Satan]] or a [[demon]], a member of the hierarchy of Hell. Baphomet appears in that guise as a character in [[James Blish]]'s ''[[The Day After Judgment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ketterer, David (1987). Imprisoned in a tesseract: The Life and Work of James Blish. Kent State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-87338-334-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian evangelist [[Jack T. Chick]] claimed that Baphomet is a demon worshipped by Freemasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1074/1074_01.asp|title=That's Baphomet?|website=www.chick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that apparently originated with the [[Taxil hoax]]. [[Léo Taxil]]'s elaborate hoax employed a version of Lévi's Baphomet on the cover of ''Les Mystères de la franc-maçonnerie dévoilés'', his lurid paperback "exposé" of Freemasonry, which in 1897 he revealed as a hoax intended to ridicule the Catholic Church and its anti-Masonic propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxilconfession.html "Leo Taxil's confession"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confessed.html|title=Leo Taxil’s confession|first=Trevor W.|last=McKeown|website=freemasonry.bcy.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of demon lords in Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Baphomet|Baphomet]] appears in [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] as a powerful [[Demon lord (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|demon lord]], and is also known as the "Horned King", or the "Prince of Beasts". Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named "Heartcleaver", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the "Endless Maze", and is the sworn enemy of [[List of demon lords in Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Yeenoghu|Yeenoghu]], another demon lord.

Baphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.

An interpretation of [[List of demon lords in Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Baphomet|Baphomet]], referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]],  ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].'' It is the first game in the ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series. The player assumes the role of [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy much of which is influenced by and includes factual and fictional references and narrative devices relating to the History of the Knights Templar.

In the popular [[Personal Computer|PC]] video game [[Doom II: Hell on Earth]], in the final mission "Icon of Sin", the titular antagonist has a look similar to that of early depictions of Baphomet.

In July 2015 YouTube star and singer [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]] depicted the deity in the music video for her single Lowlife. Poppy can be seen imitating the famous pose of Baphomet.

The 2018 [[Netflix]] series [[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|''Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'']] has a large statue of Baphomet displayed at the Academy of Unseen Arts. [[The Satanic Temple]] has accused the show of plagiarizing their depiction of Baphomet, though later settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2018/11/01/the-satanic-temple-netflixs-sabrina-remake-plagiarized-our-baphomet-statue/|title=The Satanic Temple: Netflix’s ‘Sabrina’ Remake Plagiarized Our Baphomet Statue|last=Atheist|first=Friendly|work=Friendly Atheist|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Sports Car Championship''', was a British domestic motor racing championship which was originally created for sports cars complying with Appendix C of the International Sporting Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Goodwood-1964-03-30s.jpg Official Programme, Goodwood International Motor Racing, Easter Monday 1964, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 22 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Brands_Hatch-1965-08-30e.jpg Official Programme, Guards International Brands Hatch, 30 August 1965, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 22 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; For 1966 the championship was for [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7 Sports Racing Cars]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Brands_Hatch-1966-08-29e.jpg Programme, Guards International Trophy, Brands Hatch, 29 August 1966, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 22 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and for 1967 it was restricted to [[Group 4 Sports Cars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Brands_Hatch-1967-08-28e.jpg Programme, Evening News International Trophy, Brands Hatch, 28 August 1967, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 22 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, the 2-litre sports category had become very popular across Europe, therefore the organisers decided to change the championship regulations, admitting only these cars. The championship was abandoned during the 1972 season, after one race, because of a lack of entries. An attempt to re-launch the championship lead to a one-off single season being run in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/championship/British%20Sports%20Car%20Championship.html |title=British Sports Car Championship - Championships |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/bscc.html |title=World Sports Racing Prototypes - British Sports Car Championship |publisher=Wsrp.ic.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227223242/http://www.wsrp.ic.cz/bscc.html# |archive-date=2014-02-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began in 1964 with the Lavant Cup at [[Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit|Goodwood]] being won by [[John Coundley]], however by the end of the inaugural season, established Formula One drivers were taking part, with the reigning World Drivers Champion, [[Jim Clark]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] among the race winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/bscc.html |title=World Sports Racing Prototypes - British Sports Car Championship |publisher=Wsrp.ic.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227223242/http://www.wsrp.ic.cz/bscc.html# |archive-date=2014-02-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Byham Theater''' is a landmark building at 101 Sixth Street in the [[Cultural District, Pittsburgh|Cultural District]] of [[Downtown Pittsburgh|Downtown]] [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Originally built in 1903 as The Gayety Theater, the former [[vaudeville]] house was renovated and reopened as The Byham Theater in 1990.

Built in 1903 and opened [[Halloween]] night 1904, the then-named Gayety Theater was stage and [[vaudeville]] house, and it featured stars such as [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and [[Helen Hayes]]. It was renamed The Fulton in the 1930s when it became a full-time movie theater. The classic horror film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', which was filmed in and around Pittsburgh, had its world premiere at the Fulton in 1968. In 1990 the [[Pittsburgh Cultural Trust]] bought the theater and refurbished the Fulton as part of its plan for the Cultural District. [[Carolyn M. Byham]] and [[William C. Byham]] of Pittsburgh made a major naming gift for a 1995 renovation, and it has been the Byham Theater since.

==1960 World Series Game Seven==
For the 50th anniversary of the [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s series winning home run, the first public showing of the [[1960 World Series#Game 7 telecast|Game 7 taped discovered]] in December 2009 was hosted by [[Bob Costas]] at the theater on November 13, 2010 at 6 p.m.  Mazeroski was joined by Pirate MVP [[Dick Groat]] and former Yankee [[Bobby Richardson]] to be interviewed during the showing of the game. [[MLB Network]] then telecast the game and interviews nationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://communityvoices.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/sports/bob-smiziks-blog/25834-gala-celebrating-1960-world-series-set-for-byhan-theater-on-nov-13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''California Hot Rod Reunion''' is a gathering of drag racers, hot rod enthusiasts and street rodders held in [[Bakersfield, California]].  The event was created by Steve Gibbs, vice-president of the [[National Hot Rod Association]], in October 1992, as a one-time event to gather some of the old drag racers together.  It has since become an annual event in early October at [[Auto Club Famoso Raceway]] outside [[Bakersfield]].  It has also spawned the [[National Hot Rod Reunion]], held each year in Bowling Green KY.  Honorees are named at each year's reunion.  The Honorees are pioneers in the sport of drag racing and [[hot rod]]ding.  The 26th annual event, presented by AAA and associate sponsor Good Vibrations Motorsports, will be held Oct 19-21, 2018 .


Information on the honorees may be found at http://museum.nhra.com

'''Cow Harbor Day''' is an annual festival celebrating the history of the village of [[Northport, New York]], which was once known as Great Cow Harbor.  It is held annually on the Sunday of the third full weekend in September, and since 1977 following the [[Great Cow Harbor 10K]] held on the Saturday before.

Cow Harbor Day draws thousand of visitors to Northport each September.  Events kick off with a parade down Main Street, featuring floats, the area's best marching bands, [[antique car]]s and a temporary resurrection of the trolley that was once commonplace along this route.  Bovine related costumes and floats are also a common theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dougherty | first = Paul | title = Welcome to Northport – Living in Northport, Visit Northport | publisher = Localism | date = September 9, 2008 | url = http://localism.com/ny/northport | accessdate = 2008-09-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110216203400/http://localism.com/ny/northport | archivedate = February 16, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celebrations are held at Northport Memorial Park at the harbor's edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rather | first = John | title = If You're Thinking of Living In/Northport; Waterfront Village That Feels Like Home | newspaper = The New York Times | date = July 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E0DE113AF935A35754C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  live music, boat races, and other attractions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

'''Disaster research''' deals with conducting field and survey research on group, organizational and community preparation for, response to, and recovery from natural and technological disasters and other community-wide crises.  The purpose behind this field of research is to attempt to advance and communicate knowledge on mitigation techniques and procedures and disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.

There are countless academic fields that are useful in the realm of disaster research which contribute to mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. One such field is anthropology. Natural disasters are acceptable areas for anthropological work because of the effect they have on human populations and environments. These events create utter chaos in the lives of everyone affected by them and have long-lasting effects on multiple areas of society including: social organization, political organization and empowerment, economic consequences, environmental degradation, human and environmental adaptation and interactions, oral history, traditional knowledge, psychological consequences, public health and the broader historical record of the affected region.

There are many things to consider in the way of preparing for disasters in any area, but a specific area of concern that can be addressed through anthropological research is public health preparedness in the face of catastrophe. Anthropology can contribute to this area by providing for cultural awareness, respect and preparation for different parties that could potentially be involved in an event. For example, public health can become compromised during the relief period of a disaster if considerations for cultural and religious beliefs, including taboos, are not acknowledged or known by emergency and medical personnel. Due to personal and cultural values, treatment can become compromised by both a patient refusing to be treated and by personnel refusing to treat victims because of a violation of values and beliefs that could arise from treatment.

==History==
The Disaster Research Center (DRC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/DRC/aboutus/index.html Disaster Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first social science research center in the world devoted to the study of disasters. It was established at [[Ohio State University]] in 1963 and moved to the [[University of Delaware]] in 1985.  The Center conducts field and survey research on group, organizational and community preparation for, response to, and recovery from natural and technological disasters and other community-wide crises. DRC researchers have carried out systematic studies on a broad range of disaster types, including [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s, [[earthquakes]], [[tornadoes]], [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemical]] incidents, and [[plane crash]]es. DRC has also done research on civil disturbances and [[riot]]s, including the 1992 [[Los Angeles]] unrest. Staff have conducted nearly 600 field studies since the Center’s inception, traveling to communities throughout the United States and to a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Turkey. Faculty members from the University's Sociology and Criminal Justice Department and Engineering Department direct DRC's projects. The staff also includes postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates and research support personnel.

Work in the Disaster research field attempts to yield social science knowledge on disasters and information that can and has been applied to develop more effective policies, programs, and planning to reduce disaster impacts.  The Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware not only maintains its own databases but also serves as a repository for materials collected by other agencies and researchers.  The DRC's special collection contains over 50,000 items, making it the most complete collection on the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in the world.

Studies in the field of Disaster Research are supported by many diverse sources, such as:

*[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA)
*Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research
*[[National Institute of Mental Health]]
*National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Sea Grant Program
*[[National Science Foundation]]
*Public Entity Risk Institute
*Social Science Research Council
*[[U.S. Geological Survey]]

Additionally, there are numerous academic and national policy boards in the realm of disaster research:

*National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council's Commission on International Disaster Assistance and Board on Natural Disasters
*National Science Foundation's Social Hazard Review Panel
*U.S. Committee on the UN Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction

A '''divorce party''' (also known as a '''divorce ceremony''') is a way to have a ceremony that celebrates the end of a [[marriage]] or [[civil union]]. Types of divorce parties vary greatly, and can involve either one or both members of the separating couple. Divorce parties have been called the final frontier in the [[wedding industry]] complex, and often involve a toast that emphasizes the couple beginning new chapters in their lives.

Similar to weddings, divorce parties take on many tenors and serve different purposes. Divorce parties in which couples have become independent of one another are often an announcement of new found singledom.  These divorce parties are often equated to [[bachelor party|bachelor]] or [[bachelorette party]] and involve tongue-in-cheek items such as divorce cakes, wedding ring coffins, just-divorced banners, and divorce rings (a notched, or broken, circle).  [[Shanna Moakler]] hosted her now-infamous divorce party in [[Las Vegas]], complete with a cake-topper of a dead groom.  Las Vegas is very widely considered as the divorce party capital of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thebachelorscode.com/why-las-vegas-is-widely-considered-as-the-divorce-party-capital-than-a-bachelor-party-capital/|title = Why Las Vegas Is Widely Considered As The Divorce Party Capital Than A Bachelor Party Capital|author = The Bachelors Code}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divorce parties that couples co-host often have a serious tone, and are aimed at healing the rifts among family and friends that divorces may cause. The idea is to acknowledge the good, even as the marriage is ending, and to let go of the accompanying anguish.  When a couple co-hosts a party, they often celebrate what they’ve shared and ask friends and family for support as they separate from each other.  A recent [[CNN]] article on the subject of divorce parties noted that divorce parties are growing in popularity, and helping alleviate the stigma surrounding the end of marriage.  

[[Laura Dave]] wrote the first novel about divorce parties, which is entitled ''The Divorce Party''.  Christine Gallagher developed the divorce party concept on her website DivorcePartyPlanner.com and in her book "The Divorce Party Handbook".  

Italian sociologist Laura Arosio argued that the breakdown of the marriage via legal separation and divorce begins for the first time in contemporary Western societies to be regarded as an event of transition in the life course of individuals. Her belief is that the phenomena which are spreading together with marital instability - from the divorce party to service agencies for the newly separated- can be interpreted as an attempt to build a ceremony for this emerging rite of passage (i.e. a divorce rite). Arosio assumes that in the rite of divorce the three phases - separation, transition, and re-incorporation, as described for the other rites of passage, can be recognized.

==Religious divorce ceremonies in North America==

===Judaism===
{{main|get (divorce document)}}

===Unitarian Universalism===
A divorce ceremony performed by Unitarian Universalist clergy is known as a "ceremony of hope", which is normally carried out in a public forum. According to ''[[Beliefnet]]'', the two divorcees are expected to exchange requests and acceptances of forgiveness for supposed infractions which damaged confidence in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Unitarian-Universalist/Unitarian-Ceremony-Of-Hope.aspx|title = Unitarian ceremony of Hope|publisher = Beliefnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Methodism===
A United Methodist church may perform a divorce ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/2001/04/Methodist-Divorce-Service.aspx|title = Methodist Divorce Service|author = Jennifer M. Paquette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asia==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2013}}
Divorce ceremonies have gained currency in [[Japan]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. In Mandarin, they are known as ''Líhūn yíshì'' ({{zh|离婚仪式}}) or ''Líhūn diǎnlǐ'' ({{zh|离婚典礼}}), and in Japanese they are known as ''Rikon-shiki'' ({{lang-ja|離婚式}}).

The festival originated from a nightclub event in 2008 called Blowfish Warehouse Project at Jakarta’s renowned night club Blowfish. Featuring 3 arenas within the club’s vicinity, the festival’s first edition boasted more than 5.000 audience. The second edition of the festival was planned to be held on 24 April 2010. However, a fight broke out three weeks before the planned date of the festival, damaging parts of the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.detik.com/news/berita/1331621/bentrokan-di-blowfish-buntut-peristiwa-sabtu-malam|title=Bentrokan di Blowfish Buntut Peristiwa Sabtu Malam|work=detiknews|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisers moved the festival to Pantai Carnaval in Ancol and rebranded the festival with a new name, Djakarta Warehouse Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.scmp.com/culture/music/article/2112901/largest-edm-festival-asia-how-indonesias-djakarta-warehouse-project|title=How an Indonesian EDM festival became Asia’s largest rave|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''faked death''', also called a "staged death" and '''pseudocide''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livescience.com/22473-faking-death-crime-law.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201704/pseudocide-the-art-faking-your-death|title=Pseudocide: The Art of Faking Your Death|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/es/diccionario/ingles/pseudocide|title=Pseudocide definición y significado - Diccionario Inglés Collins|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a case in which an individual leaves evidence to suggest that they are [[death|dead]] to mislead others. This is done for a variety of reasons, such as to [[fraud]]ulently collect [[insurance]] money or to avoid capture by law enforcement for some other crime.

People who fake their own deaths sometimes do so by pretend [[drowning]]s, because it provides a plausible reason for the [[Declared death in absentia|absence of a body]].

There are several how-to books on the subject of faking one's death, including ''[[How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found]]''.

==Notable faked deaths==
* [[John Stonehouse]], a British politician who faked his own [[suicide]] by drowning to escape financial difficulties and live with his mistress. He was discovered in [[Australia]] - where police initially thought he might be [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] - and jailed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*[[Timothy Dexter|"Lord" Timothy Dexter]], an eccentric 18th-century New England businessman who faked his own death to see how people would react. His wife did not shed any tears at the wake, and as a result he caned her for not being sufficiently saddened at his passing.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, William Cleaves ''Timothy Dexter.'' Boston, Massachusetts: David Clapp &amp; Son., 1886: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Darwin disappearance case|John Darwin]], a former teacher and prison officer from [[Hartlepool]], [[England]] faked his own death on 21 March 2002 by canoeing out to sea and disappearing. His ruse fell apart in 2006 when a simple Google search revealed a photo of him buying a house in Panama.
*[[Marcus Schrenker]], a financial manager from [[Fishers, Indiana]], was charged with defrauding clients, and attempted to fake his own death to avoid prosecution.  He was captured following a multi-state, three-day manhunt.
*[[Samuel Israel III]], an [[United States|American]] [[hedge fund]] manager who was facing twenty years in prison for fraud, left his car and a suicide note on the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] in an attempted fake suicide in 2008. He later surrendered himself to authorities. It was always suspected that his suicide was faked since, among other things, passersby reported that a car had picked someone up on the bridge from near Israel's abandoned car.
*Charles Mulet, a corrupt Louisiana policeman, had been accused of molesting a teenage girl in 1988. Mulet left his truck alongside a bridge and sent a note to his police department. The suicide was ruled inconclusive after police failed to find a corpse in the river, and a hiker reported to police a man opening fire on him without warning, whose description matched Mulet's. The case being profiled on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' led to Mulet's capture.
*[[David Friedland]], a former New Jersey senator, faked his own death via scuba-diving accident in 1985 while awaiting trial on racketeering charges.
*[[Francisco Paesa]], agent of [[Centro Nacional de Inteligencia]], the [[Spanish secret service]]. In 1998 he faked a fatal cardiac arrest in Thailand, after tricked [[Luis Roldán]], known for being the general of the [[Spanish Civil Guard]] when a big scandal of corruption arose in 1993, into stealing all the money that Roldán had previously stolen in that case. He appeared in 2004. During these years, he opened an offshore company, as it was exposed thanks to [[Panama Papers]].
*[[Arkady Babchenko]], a Russian journalist living in Ukraine who in 2018 faked his own assassination, which was widely reported in the international press, as part of a sting operation aimed at exposing an agent sent to kill him. Babchenko's appearance at a press conference the day after his "death" caused an international sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Murdered' Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko is alive |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44307611 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
*In ''[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]'', [[Sherlock Holmes]] re-appears to [[Dr. Watson]] several years after his presumed death grappling with [[Professor Moriarty]] at the Reichenbach Falls.  He explains that he survived the fall where Moriarty did not, but had to remain "officially" dead while Moriarty's lieutenant, [[Sebastian Moran]], was still at large.  [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] originally intended Holmes's "death" in ''[[The Final Problem]]'' to be the conclusion of the Holmes stories, but was persuaded by fan pressure to "resurrect" the character.
**In ''The Reichenbach Fall'', the final episode of the second season of the television series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', Sherlock ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) intentionally fakes his death by jumping off the roof of [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]] in order to protect his friends from assassins hired by Jim Moriarty ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]) and track down the remainder of Moriarty's criminal network in secret.
*In the [[Everybody Dies (House)|series finale]] of [[House (TV series)|House, M.D.]], after a prank goes very badly, [[Gregory House|House]] fakes his death to avoid being sent back to jail so that he can spend time with his best friend [[James Wilson (House)|Wilson]], who has five months to live as a result of terminal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Everybody Dies (House)|date=2018-08-26|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Everybody_Dies_(House)&amp;oldid=856686409|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the book ''[[Visser (novel)|Visser]]'', the details of how Visser One (Edriss 562) made Marco's mother Eva fake her death in order to focus more on directing the Yeerk invasion of Earth are covered. The "death" itself happens before the first book in the series.
*Alison DiLaurentis allowed herself to be presumed dead while she went into hiding for several years in the television series ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''
*In [[Carl Hiaasen]]'s novel ''[[Bad Monkey (novel)|Bad Monkey]]'', a [[Medicare fraud]]ster goes to extreme lengths to fake his death in order to avoid prosecution for his crimes.  Both the criminal and the protagonists reflect that faking one's own death is a common ploy used by criminals, but it rarely works unless the criminal goes to such extreme lengths.
*In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]] faked his death during the ''Knightfall Protocol''.
*In ''[[Double Jeopardy (1999 film)|Double Jeopardy]]'', a 1999 film starring [[Ashley Judd]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]], a man fakes his death in order to move with his mistress, along with his son, while his wife is jailed for his supposed murder.
*In [[J.K Rowling|J.K Rowling's]] [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]], it is revealed that [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] faked his own death after framing [[Sirius Black]] for betraying [[James and Lily Potter]] to [[Lord Voldemort]].
*In the 2002 [[Tom Clancy]] novel ''[[Red Rabbit]]'', MI6 and CIA attempt to protect a KGB defector along with his wife and daughter by causing a hotel fire then planting the recently deceased corpses of a man, woman, and little girl.
*In [[Gillian Flynn]]'s novel ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'' and its [[Gone Girl (film)|2014 film adaptation]], starring [[Rosamund Pike]] and [[Ben Affleck]], the character Amy Elliott Dunne fakes her death in order to punish her husband for his infidelity.
*In the series [[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]], Richard Kimble fakes his death multiple times to avoid being arrested and executed for a crime he didn't commit.
*In the [[South Park]] episode [[Marjorine]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] fakes his death with a [[pig]] [[cadaver]].
*In the final episode of [[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]], starring [[Matt Bomer]] as ex-con turned FBI criminal informant [[Neal Caffrey]] and [[Tim DeKay]] as FBI Special Agent Peter Burke, Caffrey fakes his death, when really all along it it was "Neal Caffrey's greatest con" as the ending scene sees him walking the streets of Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8991">The '''General Conference Session''' is the official world meeting of the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]] of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]],  held every five years. At the session, delegates from around the world elect the Church's World Leaders, discuss and vote on changes to the Church's Constitution, and listen to reports from the Church's 13 Divisions on activities going on within its territory.

The first session was held on May 20, 1863 in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] with 20 delegates in attendance. The early sessions were held every year in a small church. As the Church's membership grew, time between sessions lengthened, meeting places got bigger, and more delegates attended. Today the sessions are held every five years in cities with stadiums that can seat more than 70,000 attendees, which includes the more than 2,400 delegates attending and the visitors from around the world who are watching the session.

'''Gibellina''' ([[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: ''Gibbiddina'') is a small city and ''[[comune]]'' in  the [[Province of Trapani]], the mountains of central [[Sicily]], [[Italy]]. It was destroyed by the [[1968 Belice earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837724,00.html The Day the Earth Shook], Time Magazine, January 26, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The new city, Gibellina Nuova, was rebuilt some {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} distant from the old one.  The new city was designed by many of the most prominent artists and architects in Italy, but done in a piecemeal fashion so that the parts of the new city bear little relation to one another or to the indigenous architecture of Sicily.

'''Ruderi di Gibellina''' (as the ruins of the city are now referred to) remained just as it was after the earthquake, practically a ghost-town. Artist [[Alberto Burri]] covered the entirety of the ruins in concrete, while preserving the streetscape.  Additionally, Italian sculptor [[Pietro Consagra]] and Senator [[Ludovico Corrao]] formed an open-air museum with a Consagra sculpture "Porta del Belice" or "Door to Belice" at the entrance. Consagra expressed a wish to be buried at Gibellina on his deathbed in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.it/english/news.pl?doc=200507161738-1121-RT1-CRO-0-NF11&amp;page=0&amp;id=agionline-eng.oggitalia Agenzia Giornalistica Italia news story on death and burial of Consagra]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Fire of New York''' was a devastating fire that burned through the night of September 20, 1776, and into the morning of September 21, on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of what then constituted [[New York City]] at the [[Lower Manhattan|southern end]] of the island of [[Manhattan]].{{sfnp|Stokes|1915–1928|loc=[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5800727_005/pages/ldpd_5800727_005_00000074.html v. 5, pp. 1020–24]}} It broke out in the early days of the [[military occupation]] of the city by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] forces during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The fire destroyed about one third of the city, while some unaffected parts of the city were plundered. Many people believed or assumed that one or more people deliberately started the fire, for a variety of different reasons. British leaders accused revolutionaries acting within the city and state, and many residents assumed that one side or the other had started it.  The fire had long-term effects on the British occupation of the city, which did not end until 1783.

==Background==
{{details|topic=the British capture of New York|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in April 1775. The city of New York was already an important center of business but had not yet become a sprawling metropolis. It occupied only the lower portion of the island of [[Manhattan]] and had a population of approximately 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war began, the [[Province of New York]] was politically divided, with active [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] organizations and a colonial assembly that was strongly [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]].&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]], Patriots seized control of the city and began arresting and expelling Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYC1776.jpg|thumb|right|A 1776 map of New York and environs (labeled New York Island instead of Manhattan)]]
Early in the summer of 1776, when the war was still in its early stages, British General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] embarked on a campaign to gain control of the city and its militarily important harbor. After occupying [[Staten Island]] in July, he launched a successful [[Battle of Long Island|attack on Long Island]] in late August, assisted by naval forces under the command of his brother, Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Richard Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, pp. 94–224&lt;/ref&gt; American General [[George Washington]] recognized the inevitability of the capture of New York City, and [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrew]] the bulk of his army about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north to [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Harlem Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Several people, including General [[Nathanael Greene]] and New York's [[John Jay]] advocated burning the city down to deny its benefits to the British.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Washington laid the question before the [[Second Continental Congress]], which rejected the idea: "it should in no event be damaged."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 1776, British forces under Howe [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed on Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 179–193&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning, some British troops marched toward Harlem, where the two armies [[Battle of Harlem Heights|clashed again]], while others marched into the city.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

A civilian exodus from the city had begun well before the British fleet arrived in the harbor. The arrival the previous February of the first [[Continental Army]] troops in the city had prompted some people to pack up and leave,&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; including Loyalists who were specifically targeted by the army and Patriots.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The capture of [[Long Island]] only accelerated the abandonment of the city. During the Continental Army's occupation of the city, many abandoned buildings were appropriated for the army's use.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  When the British arrived in the city, the property of Patriots was confiscated for the British army's use.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, housing and other demands of the military occupation significantly strained the city's available building stock.&lt;ref name=S209&gt;Schecter, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire==
According to the eyewitness account of [[John Joseph Henry]], an American prisoner aboard HMS ''Pearl'', the fire began in the Fighting Cocks Tavern, near Whitehall Slip.&lt;ref name=S204&gt;Chester, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Abetted by dry weather and strong winds, the flames spread north and west, moving rapidly among tightly packed homes and businesses. Residents poured into the streets, clutching what possessions they could and found refuge on the grassy town commons (today, [[City Hall Park]]). The fire crossed Broadway near Beaver Street and then burned most of the city between Broadway and the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=L135&gt;Lamb, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The fire raged into the daylight hours and was stopped by changes in wind direction as much as by the actions of some of the citizenry and British marines sent, according to Henry, "in aid of the inhabitants." &lt;ref name=S204/&gt; It may also have been stopped by the relatively undeveloped property of [[King's College (New York)|King's College]], located at the northern end of the fire-damaged area.&lt;ref name=L135/&gt;&lt;ref name=S205&gt;Chester, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for the number of buildings destroyed range from 400 to 1,000, representing between 10 and 25 percent of the 4,000 city buildings in existence at the time.&lt;ref name=S204/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Chester claims 1,000, Trevelyan notes estimates in this range, with a precise claim of 493.--&gt;  Among the buildings destroyed was [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]]; [[St. Paul's Chapel (New York, New York)|St. Paul's Chapel]] survived.&lt;ref name=S205/&gt;

==Suspicions of arson==
Howe's report to London implied that the fire was deliberately set: "a most horrid attempt was made by a number of wretches to burn the town."&lt;ref name=S205/&gt; Royal Governor [[William Tryon]] suspected that Washington was responsible, writing that "many circumstances lead to conjecture that Mr. Washington was privy to this villainous act" and that "some officers of his army were found concealed in the city."&lt;ref name=S206&gt;Schecter, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Many Americans also assumed that the fire was the work of Patriot arsonists. John Joseph Henry recorded accounts of marines returning to the ''Pearl'' after fighting the fire in which men were "caught in the act of firing the houses."&lt;ref name=S207/&gt;

Some Americans accused the British of setting the fire so that the city might be plundered. A [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] major noted that some who fought the blaze managed to "pay themselves well by plundering other houses near by that were not on fire."&lt;ref name=S207/&gt;

[[File:NYCGreatFire1776.jpg|300px|thumb|right|This 1776 map has contemporary markings in red depicting the area damaged by the fire]]
Washington wrote to [[John Hancock]] on September 22, specifically denying knowledge of the fire's cause.&lt;ref name=S207&gt;Schecter, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his cousin [[Lund Washington|Lund]], Washington wrote, "Providence—or some good honest fellow, has done more for us than we were disposed to do for ourselves".&lt;ref name=S208&gt;Schecter, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Barnet Schecter, no accusation of arson has withstood scrutiny. The strongest circumstantial evidence in favor of arson theories is the fact that the fire appeared to start in multiple places. However, contemporary accounts explain that burning debris from wooden roof shingles spread the fire. One diarist wrote that, "the flames were communicated to several houses" by the debris "carried by the wind to some distance."&lt;ref name=S206/&gt;

The British interrogated more than 200 suspects, but no charges were ever filed.&lt;ref name="S206"/&gt;  Coincidentally, [[Nathan Hale]], an American captain engaged in spying for Washington, was arrested in [[Queens]] the day the fire started. Rumors attempting to link him to the fires have never been substantiated; there is nothing indicating that he was arrested (and eventually hanged) for anything other than [[espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, pp. 210–215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on British occupation==
Major General [[James Robertson (loyalist)|James Robertson]] confiscated surviving uninhabited homes of known Patriots and assigned them to British officers. Churches, other than the [[state church|state churches]] ([[Church of England]]) were converted into prisons, infirmaries, or barracks. Some of the common soldiers were [[billet]]ed with civilian families. There was a great influx of Loyalist refugees into the city resulting in further overcrowding, and many of these returning and additional Loyalists from Patriot-controlled areas encamped in squalid tent cities on the charred ruins. The fire convinced the British to put the city under martial law rather than returning it to civilian authorities. Crime and poor sanitation were persistent problems during the British occupation, which did not end until they [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuated the city on November 25, 1783]].&lt;ref name=S275&gt;Schecter, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">The '''Great Fire of Northampton''' occurred in September 1675 in [[Northampton]] in [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]]. The blaze was caused by sparks from an open fire in St. Mary’s Street, near [[Northampton Castle]]. The fire devastated the [[town centre]], destroying about 700 buildings [out of 850] including [[All Saints' Church, Northampton|All Saints church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Northampton (England) |display=Northampton |volume=19 |page=767}}&lt;/ref&gt; in six hours. Three quarters of the town was destroyed, 11 people died and about 700 families were made homeless. Many people escaped the fire by going through Welsh House on the [[market square]] to safety.

Local people and businesses raised £25,000 towards re-building the town centre based around the Market Square. Streets were widened to help prevent a re-occurrence. [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] donated 1,000 tons of timber from [[Salcey Forest]] for the re-building.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;[[William A. Shaw]] (ed.),[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=83489 Donation listed in Shaw's ''Calendar of Treasury Books''], ''Calendar of Treasury Books, Volume 6: 1679-1680.'' (1913), pp. 11-18. [[British History Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; A commemorative statue of the king (dressed in a Roman [[toga]]) stands on the portico of the re-built All Saints church.

In 1724, the town's new appearance inspired author and traveler [[Daniel Defoe]] to describe Northampton as the "handsomest and best built town in all this part of England…..finely rebuilt with brick and stone, and the streets made spacious and wide".

The fire received fictional treatment in book 2 of [[Alan Moore]]'s 2016 novel ''[[Jerusalem (Moore novel)|Jerusalem]]''.

==Early life==
Fischer was born near [[Lone Rock, Iowa]], in a farm on May 8, 1925. 

==Military service==
After service with the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]], followed by service with the [[United States Army]], Fisher transferred into the United States Air Force in 1949.

Serving with the [[39th Flying Training Squadron]], Fischer saw action in the [[Korean War]], shooting down eleven [[MiG]] aircraft in his more than 175 combat missions. On April 7, 1953, he was shot down and ejected from his [[F-86 Sabre]] north of the [[Yalu River]], in a dogfight with three MiGs that extended into [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] territory, an area that the Air Force had specifically ordered its pilots not to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/interview-with-harold-e-fischer-korean-war-jet-ace-and-pow.htm|title=Interview with Harold E.

Fischer was taken captive by Chinese military personnel and imprisoned near [[Shenyang]], [[Liaoning Province]]. Although the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] called for the release of all prisoners of war, Fisher was not freed. After a thwarted escape attempt nine months into his captivity, he was routinely tortured and ultimately admitted to trumped up charges that he had been ordered to enter Manchuria and that he had participated in [[germ warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Rebekah|title=Col.

A mock trial led to his release in May 1955. Fischer was returned to active service two months later.

He also served in the [[Vietnam War]], mainly as a [[helicopter]] pilot. He flew more than 200 missions over [[South Vietnam]].

Fisher served for a full 30 years, receiving many decorations, including the [[Silver Star]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].

==Later life==
Fischer died on April 30, 2009, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], from complications after back surgery. He was 83. He is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Section 59.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4750">'''Human-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]] of [[humans]].  There are at least three known documented cases of human-baiting, all of which occurred in England in the 19th century.

==Gentleman and the Bull Dog==
[[Image:Gentle-Bulldog.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Gentleman and the Bulldog (circa 1807)]]
''[[The Sporting Magazine]]'', [https://books.google.ca/books?id=2048jwEACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Sporting+Magazine+volume+18&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyvMX6x77ZAhUDW60KHZVPDuEQ6AEIMzAC vol. XVIII], documented a fight between parties labeled simply the ''Gentleman and the Bull Dog''.  ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' also reported on this fight, which occurred in 1807.  The story illustrates the outcome of a large, mastiff-like dog charging its opponent. Despite the handicap of a muzzle, the dog was the winner.

{{quote|A fight between a man and Bull Dog took place some time ago to settle a bet. With its first charge the Bull Dog already succeeded in throwing and pinning its opponent. Although the dog's jaws were nearly closed by a muzzle, it succeeded in sinking its teeth into the man's body. Had the dog not been pulled away immediately, it would have disemboweled the man.}}

==Physic versus Brummy==
[[Image:Physic-Brummy1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Physic and Brummy, An Evening at Hanley]]
On 6&amp;nbsp;July 1874 the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' published an article, written by [[James Greenwood (journalist)|James Greenwood]], in which he reported on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1874 to have witnessed a fight between a man and a dog.  Greenwood recounted the tale in his 1876 book, ''[[s:Low-Life Deeps|Low-Life Deeps]]'', in the chapter called [[s:Low-Life Deeps/Chapter 1|In the Potteries]].  On July 11, 1874, ''[[The Spectator]]'' published an article called ''The Dog-Fight at Hanley'' that described the circumstances of the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/11th-july-1874/12/the-dog-fight-at-hanley Spectator Archive: The Dog-Fight at Hanley (July 11, 1874)]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fighter, named Brummy, was a middle-aged dwarf about {{convert|4.5|ft}} tall, with oversized features, and bowed legs.  He had apparently agreed to fight the dog for a bet, on his theory that no dog "could lick a man".  His opponent was a white [[bulldog]] named Physic.  Held by its guardian, the dog apparently did not bark, but was excited to the point where tears ran from its eyes.  The fight, watched by an audience of about&amp;nbsp;50, occurred at an old inn at [[Hanley, Staffordshire]], in a large guest room, its windows closed and its floor covered in sawdust, with the ring cordoned off by a line.

During the fight Brummy was bitten deeply several times on his arms, and the Bulldog was dealt several heavy blows to the head and ribs.  After ten rounds the Bulldog's head was heavily swollen, it had lost two teeth, and one of its eyes was closed.  The fight lasted until round eleven when Brummy knocked the dog out.

This story was reported on by ''[[The New York Times]]'', which stated that the story is probably false, though noting that the ''Daily Telegraph'' insisted on its veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/07/28/79077537.pdf |title=A Dog and a Man Fight in England |date=1874-07-28 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East End Club==

In 1892, another human-baiting occurred between the human combatant James Oxley and a fighting dog named Crib. The following is extracted from a contemporary report:&lt;ref&gt;Homan, M. (2000). ''A Complete History of Fighting Dogs'', pp. 101–104. Howell Book House {{ISBN|1-58245-128-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1=An arbite (man and dog fight) took place in an East End Club. The match was that James Oxley, a man well known in the neighbourhood of [[Shoreditch]], would stall off for thirty-minutes a fighting dog called 'Crib' owned by Robert Green. The match came off not many yards from the [[Britannia Theatre]], [[Hoxton]] and excited considerable interest amongst those in the know. Some of the prominent people, who brought about this sickening match, when interviewed, stated that for twenty-one minutes Oxley kept the dog off by using his fists. But, at one moment, the dog made a desperate effort to get past the man's guard and did and jumped over his left shoulder, wheeled round and fastened on the man's right ear, and dragged him to the ground. As soon as it was possible, the dog was choked off, but the upper part of Oxley's ear had disappeared.}}

The '''Miami Pop Festival''' was the name of two unrelated [[music festival]]s that took place in May and December 1968 at [[Gulfstream Park]], a horse racing track in [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale]], [[Florida]] (now called Hallandale Beach), just north of [[Miami]]. The first took place on May 18–19, 1968, and was promoted by [[Richard O'Barry]] and [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]], later famous as promoter of [[Woodstock]]. Main headliners included [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]].

==History==
===The festival===
The May event was officially publicized on promotional materials and in radio ads as the "1968 Pop and Underground Festival," and "The 1968 Pop Festival". An estimated 25,000 people attended this event,&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Michael (2009-06-30). The Road to Woodstock (p. 28). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; which was promoted by [[Richard O'Barry]] and [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]]. Bands featured at the festival included [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[The Mothers of Invention]], [[Blue Cheer]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]], [[Blues Image]], Charles Austin Group, and Evil. The opening act on Saturday was a little-known group called The Package, and the closing act was The Jimi Hendrix Experience.  The second part of what was originally scheduled as a two-day event, Sunday's concert was rained out, but there was at least one beneficial result — it inspired Hendrix to write "Rainy Day, Dream Away."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Michael (2009-06-30). The Road to Woodstock (p. 32). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decades later, the festival began to be referred to colloquially as the "Miami Pop Festival", leading to confusion with the actual [[Miami Pop Festival (December 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]].

===Media===
On November 5, 2013, a CD and DVD were released containing the first available audio and film of the Experience at the festival.  The CD, ''The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Miami Pop Festival'', contains about an hour of previously unreleased music.  The DVD, ''Jimi Hendrix: Hear My Train A Comin’'', features a two-hour documentary on Hendrix’s life, including previously-unseen film of Hendrix and the band at the Miami festival, as well as some extras with additional footage from the festival.  The documentary was also broadcast in the US on November 5, 2013, by the Public Broadcasting Service as part of its [[American Masters]] series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/11/jimi-hendrix-miami-pop-festival-american-masters-jimi-hendrix-hear-train-comin/ Horowitz, Hal.

'''Mortality [[forecasting]]''' refers to the art and science of determining likely future mortality rates.  It is especially important in rich countries with a high proportion of aged people, since aged populations are expensive in terms of [[pensions]] (both public and private).  It is a major topic in [[Ageing]] studies.

[[File:Nobel Peace Prize Concert 2008 Scarlett Johansson Michael Caine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Michael Caine]] at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert 2008]]

The '''Nobel Peace Prize Concert'''  ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''{{lang|sv|{{lang|no|Nobels fredspriskonsert}}}})''  has been held annually since 1994 on 11 December, to honour the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate. The award ceremony on 10 December takes place in [[Oslo City Hall]], while the concert has been held at [[Oslo Spektrum]], with the attendance of the laureate and other prominent guests. The Concert is broadcast to a global audience and reaches up to 350 million households in 100 countries.

In 2015 a new distributor was announced and after 20 years at [[Oslo Spektrum]], a change of concert venue was announced. The much larger [[Telenor Arena]]. The international entertainment giant IMG lost the job in obtaining sponsors and distribute it.
Instead the concert will be produced by the Norwegian event agency Gyro in cooperation with the television production department to Norwegian Warner Bros, the former Eyeworks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/10/12/kultur/nobels_fredspris/nobels_fredspriskonsert/fredspriskonserten/nobelkonserten/41453677/&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert features performers from a wide range of musical genres, the exception being the year of 1995, when a classical concert was held instead. Several editions of the concert are recorded, with different lengths and content, for airing in several countries.

The hosts give descriptions of the winner's work, an interview with the winner is shown, and the winner gives a speech during the concert.

In 2018, the concert organizers announced that the show would be put on hiatus for 2018, hoping to hold a relaunched concert the following year. The official website stated, "The decision emerges from a wish to re-think the concert format and content but also reflects the challenging financial situation of the concert in recent years. Moreover, people’s media preferences have undergone radical change since the first concert in 1994. This is something the concert organizers and producers are keenly aware of as they move forward. We have struggled to maintain an appropriate level of financing and want to use the year ahead to develop a new format for the concert. Our ambition is to launch a renewed and better concert in 2019. [...] We plan to use this break to further develop the format and strengthen the financing beyond the continuing and generous support of our long term Norwegian sponsors. The firmer our financial base, the stronger our independence in choice of concert format and profile, say concert producers Odd Arvid Strømstad (Warner Bros. Norway) and Kristian Kirkvaag (Gyro)."

==Laureates, hosts and artists by year==
Since planning starts in January, the artists invited to the concert aren't typically connected to the winner, who is announced in October. However, a few late additions are usually made to reflect the winner. Originally, the show was hosted by Norwegian celebrities or television personalities. However, since  the year 2000 hosts have with few exceptions come from the United States of America. 
The [[Norwegian Radio Orchestra]] is the main orchestra every year.

At the concert in 1998, American TV network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], did not include [[A-ha]]'s performance, which was edited out. Another performance edited out by Fox in 1998, was Norwegian artist [[Espen Lind]]'s "Pop From Hell". The word "hell" was not the problem, but the following sentence: "You make me so [[Erection|hard]]/because you're a star". A Fox-producer stated it would be too much to take for the American family audience. Espen Lind was told his performance would not be edited out if he did not include the word "hard" in the song, but he would not change the lyrics. He said he did not want to let himself be controlled by a double-moralistic American family channel, and that such compromises were not acceptable for him to make.

'''Occupational crime''' is [[crime]] that is committed through opportunity created in the course of legal occupation.  [[Theft]]s of company property, [[vandalism]], the misuse of information and many other activities come under the rubric of occupational crime.The concept of occupational crime - as one of the principal forms of white collar crime - has been quite familiar and widely invoked since the publication of Clinard and Quinney's influential Criminal Behavior Systems: A Typology. More recently, however, the term occupational crime has been applied to activities quite removed from the original meaning of white collar crime, and it has been used interchangeably with such terms as occupational deviance and workplace crime. In the interest of greater conceptual clarity within the field of white collar crime the argument is made here for restricting the term 'occupational crime' to illegal and unethical activities committed for individual financial gain - or to avoid financial loss - in the context of a legitimate occupation. The term 'occupational deviance' is better reserved for deviation from occupational norms (e.g. drinking on the job; sexual harassment), and the term 'workplace crime' is better reserved for conventional forms of crime committed in the workplace (e.g. rape; assault). The conceptual conflation of fundamentally dissimilar activities hinders theoretical, empirical, and policy-related progress in the field of white collar crime studies.

'''Pompeii''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɒ|m|ˈ|p|eɪ|i}}) was an ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city near modern [[Naples]] in the [[Campania]] region of Italy, in the territory of the [[comune]] of [[Pompei]]. Pompeii, along with [[Herculaneum]] and many villas in the surrounding area (e.g. at [[Villa Boscoreale|Boscoreale]], [[Stabiae]]), was buried under {{convert|4|to|6|m|abbr=on}} of [[volcanic ash]] and [[pumice]] in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Mount Vesuvius]] in AD 79. Many of the inhabitants were also buried before they could escape.

The catastrophe was described in a surviving letter by [[Pliny the Younger]] who saw the eruption from a distance and described the death of his uncle [[Pliny the Elder]], an admiral of the Roman fleet, who tried to rescue citizens. The site was eventually lost until its initial rediscovery in 1599 and broader rediscovery almost 150 years later by Spanish engineer [[Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre]] in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Ozgenel, Lalo, A Tale of Two Cities: In Search of Ancient Pompeii and Herculaneum.&lt;/ref&gt; The city has been largely preserved because of lack of air and moisture. The artefacts preserved provide an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of the city. During excavations liquid plaster was used to fill the voids in the ash that once held human and animal bodies, giving often gruesome images of their last moments.

== Name ==
[[File:Ruins of Pompeii with the Vesuvius.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Pompeii from above, with Vesuvius in the background]]
Pompeii ({{IPA-la|pɔmˈpɛjjiː|pron}}) in Latin is a second [[Latin declension|declension]] plural (''Pompeiī, -ōrum''). According to Theodor Kraus, "The root of the word Pompeii would appear to be the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] word for the number five, ''pompe'', which suggests that either the community consisted of five hamlets or, perhaps, it was settled by a family group (''[[Pompeia (gens)|gens Pompeia]]'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kraus|1975|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The modern town is indeed named "Pompei" with a single "i". Please do not correct it to "Pompeii". --&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Ruins of Pompeii showing Mount Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Jupiter with [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] in the distance]]
The ruins of Pompeii are located near the modern suburban town of [[Pompei]] (nowadays written with one 'i'). It stands on a spur formed by a lava flow to the north of the mouth of the [[Sarno River]] (known in ancient times as the Sarnus).

The city had suffered from other seismic events before the eruption. Three sheets of sediment have also been found on top of the lava that lies below the city which were created by large [[landslide]]s, perhaps triggered by extended rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Senatore|Stanley|Pescatore|2004|p={{Page needed|date=September 2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is some distance inland, but in ancient times was nearer to the coast. Pompeii is about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Mount Vesuvius]]. It covered a total of 64 to {{convert|67|ha}} and was home to approximately 11,000 to 11,500 people on the basis of household counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Andrew |chapter=City Sizes and Urbanization in the Roman Empire |title=Settlement, Urbanization, and Population |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |isbn=978-0-19-960235-3 |pages=171–172 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yf5b50KuibQC&amp;pg=PA171 |editor1-last=Bowman |editor1-first=Alan |editor2-last=Wilson |editor2-first=Andrew |series=Oxford Studies on the Roman Economy |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a major city in the region of Campania.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Archaeology has shown that the town was founded in the 7th or 6th century BC by the [[Osci]] or Oscans, a people of central Italy, on what was an important crossroad between [[Cumae]], [[Nola]] and [[Stabiae]]. It had already been used as a safe port by Greek and [[Phoenicia]]n sailors. According to [[Strabo]], Pompeii was also captured by the [[Etruscan civilisation|Etruscans]], and recent{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} excavations have shown the presence of Etruscan inscriptions and a 6th-century BC [[necropolis]]. Pompeii was captured for the first time by the Greek colony of [[Cumae]], allied with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], between 525 and 474 BC.

In the 5th century BC, the [[Samnites]] conquered it (and all the other towns of [[Campania]]); the new rulers imposed their architecture and enlarged the town. After the [[Samnite Wars]] (4th century BC), Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''socium'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy. In the 4th century BC it was fortified with walls. Pompeii remained faithful to Rome during the [[Second Punic War]].

The [[Temple of Apollo (Pompeii)|Temple of Apollo]] was built in the 2nd century BC as the city's most important religious structure.

Pompeii took part in the [[Social War (90–88 BC)|war]] that the towns of Campania initiated against Rome, but in 89 BC it was besieged by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]. Although the battle-hardened troops of the Social League, headed by [[Lucius Cluentius]], helped in resisting the Romans, in 89 BC Pompeii was forced to surrender after the conquest of Nola, culminating in many of Sulla's veterans being given land and property, while many of those who went against Rome were ousted from their homes. It became a Roman colony with the name of ''Colonia [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[Venus (mythology)|Veneria]] Pompeianorum''. The town became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]].

It was fed with water by a spur from [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built c. 20 BC by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]]; the main line supplied several other large towns, and finally the naval base at [[Misenum]]. The [[castellum]] in Pompeii is well preserved, and includes many details of the distribution network and its controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrightpaleo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Pompeii-June.pdf|last=Lorenz|first=Wayne|title=Pompeii (and Rome) Water Supply Systems|date=June 2011|website=Wright Paleohydrological Institute|page=26|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavated city offers a snapshot of Roman life in the 1st century, frozen at the moment it was buried in Autumn AD 79.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Carolis|Patricelli|2003|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forum (Roman)|The forum]], the baths, many houses, and some out-of-town villas like the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] remain well preserved.

Details of everyday life are preserved. For example, on the floor of one of the houses (Sirico's), a famous inscription ''Salve, lucru'' ("Welcome, profit") indicates a trading company owned by two partners, Sirico and Nummianus (but this could be a nickname, since ''nummus'' means "coin; money"). Other houses provide details concerning professions and categories, such as for the "laundry" workers (''[[Fullo]]nes''). Wine jars have been found bearing what is apparently the world's earliest known marketing pun (technically a [[Blend word|blend]]), ''Vesuvinum'' (combining [[Vesuvius]] and the Latin for wine, vinum).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The numerous [[graffiti]] carved on the walls and inside rooms provides a wealth of information regarding [[Vulgar Latin]], the form of Latin spoken colloquially rather than the literary language of the classical writers.
[[File:Pompeii-couple.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Terentius Neo with his wife found on the wall of a Pompeii house. ([[Portrait of Paquius Proculo]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=262–264}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 89 BC, after the final occupation of the city by Roman General [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], Pompeii was finally annexed by the [[Roman Republic]]. During this period, Pompeii underwent a vast process of infrastructural development, most of which was built during the Augustan period. These include an [[amphitheatre]], a [[palaestra]] with a central [[natatorium]] (cella natatoria) or swimming pool and an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] that provided water for more than 25 street fountains, at least four public baths, and a large number of private houses ([[domus|domūs]]) and businesses. The amphitheatre has been cited by modern scholars as a model of sophisticated design, particularly in the area of crowd control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Berinato | first=Scott | date=May 18, 2007 | url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/221329/modern-crowd-control-lessons-from-ancient-pompeii- | title=Crowd Control in Ancient Pompeii | publisher=''CSO'' | accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aqueduct branched through three main pipes from the [[Castellum Aquae]], where the waters were collected before being distributed to the city. In extreme [[drought]], the water supply would first fail to reach the public baths (the least vital service), then private houses and businesses—and if there were no water flow at all, the system would fail to supply the public fountains (the most vital service) in the streets of Pompeii. The pools in Pompeii were mostly for decoration.

The large number of well-preserved [[fresco]]es provide information on everyday life and have been a major advance in [[art history]] of the ancient world, with the innovation of the [[Pompeian Styles]] (First/Second/Third Style). Some aspects of the culture were distinctly [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|erotic]], including frequent use of the phallus as [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaion]] or good-luck charm in various types of decoration. A large collection of erotic votive objects and frescoes were found at Pompeii. Many were removed and kept until recently in [[Secret Museum, Naples|a secret collection]] at the University of Naples.

At the time of the eruption, the town may have had some 11,000 inhabitants, and was located in an area where Romans had holiday villas. William Abbott explains, "At the time of the eruption, Pompeii had reached its high point in society as many Romans frequently visited Pompeii on vacations." It is the only ancient town of which the whole topographic structure is known precisely as it was, with no later modifications or additions. Due to the difficult terrain, it was not distributed on a regular plan as most Roman towns were, but its streets are straight and laid out in a grid in the Roman tradition. They are laid with polygonal stones, and have houses and shops on both sides of the street. It followed its [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] (main east/west road) and its [[cardo]] (main north/south road), centred on the forum.

Modern archaeologists have excavated garden sites and urban domains to reveal the agricultural staples in Pompeii’s economy prior to AD 79.  Pompeii was fortunate to have a fruitful, fertile region of soil for harvesting a variety of crops. The soils surrounding Mount Vesuvius even preceding its eruption have been revealed to have good water-holding capabilities, implying access to productive agriculture. The [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]’s airflow provided hydration to the soil despite the hot, dry climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Frederick G (edited by Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski)|title=The natural history of Pompeii|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521800549|page=65|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural areas surrounding Pompeii had abundant agricultural land that was very fertile and could produce much larger quantities of goods than the city needed. Some speculate that much of the flat land in [[Campania]], surrounding the areas of Pompeii was dedicated to grain and wheat production. [[Cereal]], [[barley]], [[wheat]], and [[millet]] were all produced by the locals in Pompeii. These grains, along with wine and olive oil, were produced in abundance for export to other regions.&lt;ref name="Agriculture in Pompeii"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernick|first1=Christie|title=Agriculture in Pompeii|url=https://sites.google.com/site/cmp6euva/agricultureinpompeii|website=Wall Paintings of the Pompeii Forum|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of wine imported nationally from Pompeii in its most prosperous years can be found from recovered artefacts such as wine bottles in Rome.&lt;ref name="Agriculture in Pompeii"/&gt; For this reason, vineyards were of utmost importance to Pompeii’s economy. Agricultural policymaker [[Columella]] suggested that each vineyard in Rome produced a quota of three [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|cullei]] of wine per [[jugerum]], otherwise the vineyard would be uprooted. The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient at this and were often able to exceed these requirements by a steep margin, therefore providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves.&lt;ref name="Agriculture in Pompeii"/&gt; While wine was exported for Pompeii’s economy, the majority of the other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities relevant to the city’s consumption.

Remains of large formations of constructed wineries were found in [[Forum Boarium]], covered by cemented casts from the eruption of Vesuvius.&lt;ref name="Agriculture in Pompeii"/&gt; It is speculated that these historical vineyards are strikingly similar in structure to the modern day vineyards across Italy.  [[Depression (geology)|Water depressions]] have also been found in close proximity to the wineries and served as water wells for the produce and livestock.

Carbonised food plant remains, roots, seeds and pollens, have been found from gardens in Pompeii, Herculaneum and from the Roman villa at [[Torre Annunziata]]. They revealed that [[emmer]] wheat, [[Setaria italica|Italian millet]], [[Panicum miliaceum|common millet]], walnuts, pine nuts, chestnuts, hazel nuts, chickpeas, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], broad beans, olives, figs, pears, onions, garlic, peaches, carob, grapes, and dates were consumed. All except the dates could have been produced locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Frederick G.|title=Carbonized Food Plants of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and the Villa at Torre Annunziata|journal=New York Botanical Garden: Economic Botany|date=October–December 1980|volume=34|issue=4|page=419|jstor=4254221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the forum, many other services were found: the ''[[Macellum]]'' (great food market), the ''[[Pistrinum]]'' (mill), the ''[[Thermopolium]]'' (sort of bar that served cold and hot beverages), and ''[[caupona]]e'' (small restaurants). An amphitheatre and two theatres have been found, along with a palaestra or [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. A hotel (of 1,000 square metres) was found a short distance from the town; it is now nicknamed the "Grand Hotel Murecine". [[Geothermal heating|Geothermal energy]] supplied channelled [[district heating]] for baths and houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=R.

In 2002, another discovery at the mouth of the [[Sarno River]] near [[Sarno]] revealed that the port also was populated and that people lived in [[palafitte]]s (stilt-houses), within a system of channels that suggested a likeness to [[Venice]] to some scientists.

=== AD 62–79 ===
{{Main|Mount Vesuvius#Precursors and foreshocks|l1=Mount Vesuvius Precursors and foreshocks}}

The inhabitants of Pompeii had long been used to minor quaking (indeed, the writer [[Pliny the Younger]] wrote that earth tremors "were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania"), but on 5 February 62,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Patterns of Reconstruction at Pompeii | url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/struct/pompeii/patterns/sec-02.html | publisher=University of Virginia | accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[62 Pompeii earthquake|severe earthquake]] did considerable damage around the bay, and particularly to Pompeii. It is believed that the earthquake would have registered between about 5 and 6 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].&lt;ref name="archaeology1"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa/issues/cwa4/pompeii/eruption.htm | title=Visiting Pompeii | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820155345/http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa/issues/cwa4/pompeii/eruption.htm | archivedate=August 20, 2008 | publisher=Current Archaeology | page=3 | accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that day in Pompeii, there were to be two sacrifices, as it was the anniversary of Augustus being named "Father of the Nation" and also a feast day to honour the guardian spirits of the city. Chaos followed the earthquake. Fires, caused by oil lamps that had fallen during the quake, added to the panic. Nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.&lt;ref name="archaeology1"/&gt;

Temples, houses, bridges, and roads were destroyed. It is believed that almost all buildings in the city of Pompeii were affected. In the days after the earthquake, [[anarchy]] ruled the city, where theft and starvation plagued the survivors. In the time between 62 and the eruption in 79, some rebuilding was done, but some of the damage had still not been repaired at the time of the eruption.&lt;ref name="archaeology1"/&gt; Although it is unknown how many, a considerable number of inhabitants moved to other cities within the Roman Empire while others remained and rebuilt.

An important field of current research concerns structures that were being restored at the time of the eruption (presumably damaged during the earthquake of 62). Some of the older, damaged paintings could have been covered with newer ones, and modern instruments are being used to catch a glimpse of the long hidden frescoes. The probable reason why these structures were still being repaired around 17 years after the earthquake was the increasing frequency of smaller quakes that led up to the eruption.

=== Eruption of Vesuvius ===
{{Main|Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79}}

By the 1st century AD, Pompeii was one of a number of towns near the base of the volcano, Mount Vesuvius. The area had a substantial population, which had grown prosperous from the region's renowned agricultural fertility. Many of Pompeii's neighbouring communities, most famously Herculaneum, also suffered damage or destruction during the 79 eruption.&lt;ref name="Eyewitness to history"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/pompeii.htm | title=The Destruction of Pompeii, AD 79 | year=1999 | publisher=EyeWitness to History | accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption 3.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|'''Pompeii''' and other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash and cinder. Modern coast lines are shown.]]
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Casti Amanti - Banquet.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, Pompeii]]
A multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]]. The results of the study, published in 2010, show that exposure to at least {{convert|250|C|F}} hot surges (known as [[pyroclastic flows]]) at a distance of {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the vent was sufficient to cause instant death, even if people were sheltered within buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total {{convert|25|m|ft|1}} deep, which rained down for about six hours.

[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims. As admiral of the fleet, Pliny the Elder had ordered the ships of the Imperial Navy stationed at [[Miseno|Misenum]] to cross the bay to assist evacuation attempts. Volcanologists have recognised the importance of Pliny the Younger's account of the eruption by calling similar events "[[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]".  It had long been thought that the eruption was an August event based on one version of the letter but another version&lt;ref name="Stefani 2006 10–14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stefani|2006|pp=10–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; gives a date of the eruption as late as 23 November.  A later date is consistent with a charcoal inscription at the site, discovered in 2018, which includes the date of 17 October and which must have been recently written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45874858|title=Pompeii's destruction date could be wrong|date=October 16, 2018|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Gabi Laske| url= http://quakeinfo.ucsd.edu/~gabi/erth15/lecture08/pliny.html| title= The A.D. 79 Eruption at Mt.

Further support for an October/November eruption is found in the fact that people buried in the ash appear to have been wearing heavier clothing than the light summer clothes typical of August. The fresh fruit and vegetables in the shops are typical of October{{spaced ndash}}and conversely the summer fruit typical of August was already being sold in dried, or conserved form. Wine fermenting jars had been sealed, which would have happened around the end of October. Coins found in the purse of a woman buried in the ash include one with a 15th [[imperator]]ial acclamation among the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s titles. These coins could not have been minted before the second week of September.&lt;ref name="Stefani 2006 10–14"/&gt;

After thick layers of ash covered Pompeii and Herculaneum, they were abandoned and eventually their names and locations were forgotten. The first time any part of them was unearthed was in 1599, when the digging of an underground channel to divert the river Sarno ran into ancient walls covered with paintings and inscriptions. The architect [[Domenico Fontana]] was called in; he unearthed a few more frescoes, then covered them over again, and nothing more came of the discovery. A wall inscription had mentioned a ''decurio Pompeii'' ("the town councillor of Pompeii") but its reference to the long-forgotten Roman city was missed.

Fontana's covering over the paintings has been seen both as a broad-minded act of preservation for later times, and as censorship in view of the frequent sexual content of such paintings, as he would have known that paintings of the hedonistic kind later found in some Pompeian villas were not considered in good taste in the climate of the [[counter-reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herculaneum was properly rediscovered in 1738 by workmen digging for the foundations of a [[summer palace]] for the [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]]. Pompeii was rediscovered as the result of intentional excavations in 1748 by the Spanish military engineer [[Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These towns have since been excavated to reveal many intact buildings and wall paintings. Charles of Bourbon took great interest in the findings even after becoming king of Spain because the display of antiquities reinforced the political and cultural power of Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Jakob Weber|Karl Weber]] directed the first real excavations;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parslow|1995|p={{Page needed|date=September 2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was followed in 1764 by military engineer Franscisco la Vega. Franscisco la Vega was succeeded by his brother, [[Pietro la Vega|Pietro]], in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pagano|1997|p={{Page needed|date=September 2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the French occupation Pietro worked with Christophe Saliceti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediterranees.net/voyageurs/pompeia/intro/Intro9.html ''POMPEIA'' d'Ernest Breton (3eme éd. 1870) "Introduction&amp;nbsp;– La résurrection de la ville"] in French.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |publisher=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains. It was Fiorelli who realised these were spaces left by the decomposed bodies and so devised the technique of injecting [[plaster]] into them to recreate the forms of Vesuvius's victims. This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum]] left the archaeologists with a dilemma&amp;nbsp;– between the mores of [[sexuality in ancient Rome]]
and in Counter-Reformation Europe lay a [[culture shock|clash of cultures]]. An unknown number of discoveries were hidden away again. A wall fresco depicting [[Priapus]], the ancient god of sex and fertility, with his extremely enlarged penis, was covered with plaster. An older reproduction was locked away "out of prudishness" and opened only on request—and only rediscovered in 1998 due to rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;As reported by the ''Evangelist pressedienst'' press agency in March, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, an ancient fresco depicting an erotic scene of "[[Leda and the Swan]]" was discovered at Pompeii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/fresco-erotic-pompeii-leda-and-swan-intl/index.html|title=Ancient erotic fresco uncovered in Pompeii ruins|date=2018-11-20|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] from the buried cities are preserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. In 1819, when [[Francis I of Naples|King Francis]] visited the Pompeii exhibition there with his wife and daughter, he was so embarrassed by the erotic artwork that he decided to have it locked away in a so-called "secret cabinet" (''gabinetto segreto''), a gallery within the museum accessible only to "people of mature age and respected morals". Re-opened, closed, re-opened again and then closed again for nearly 100 years, the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Naples "Secret Museum"]] was briefly made accessible again at the end of the 1960s (the time of the [[sexual revolution]]) and was finally re-opened for viewing in 2000. Minors are still allowed entry only in the presence of a guardian or with written permission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Schefold]] (2003), ''Die Dichtung als Führerin zur Klassischen Kunst.

== Tourism ==
[[File:Pompeii-Street.jpg|thumb|A paved street. Pedestrians used the blocks in the road to cross the street without having to step onto the road, which doubled up as Pompeii's drainage and sewage disposal system.  The spaces between the blocks let vehicles pass along the road.]]

Pompeii has been a popular tourist destination for over 250 years;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rowland|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it was on the [[Grand Tour]]. By 2008, it was attracting almost 2.6 million visitors per year, making it one of the most popular tourist sites in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeau, Barbie [http://www.newsweek.com/id/132027 ''Selling Pompeii''], Newsweek, April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a larger Vesuvius National Park and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997. To combat problems associated with tourism, the governing body for Pompeii, the Soprintendenza Archaeological di Pompei, have begun issuing new tickets that allow for tourists to also visit cities such as [[Herculaneum]] and [[Stabiae]] as well as the [[Villa Poppaea]], to encourage visitors to see these sites and reduce pressure on Pompeii.

Pompeii is also a driving force behind the economy of the nearby town of [[Pompei]]. Many residents are employed in the tourism and hospitality business, serving as taxi or bus drivers, waiters or hotel operators. The ruins can be easily reached on foot from ''[[Pompei Scavi-Villa dei Misteri (Circumvesuviana station)|Pompei Scavi-Villa dei Misteri station]]'' by [[Circumvesuviana]] [[commuter rail]] Naples – Sorrento route , directly at the ancient site. There are also car parks nearby.

Excavations in the site have generally ceased due to the moratorium imposed by the superintendent of the site, Professor Pietro Giovanni Guzzo. Additionally, the site is generally less accessible to tourists, with less than a third of all buildings open in the 1960s being available for public viewing today. Nevertheless, the sections of the ancient city open to the public are extensive, and tourists can spend several days exploring the whole site.

== Conservation ==
{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}

Objects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years. The lack of air and moisture let objects remain underground with little to no deterioration. Once excavated, the site provided a wealth of source material and evidence for analysis, giving detail into the lives of the Pompeiians. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.

Weathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern for conservation has continually troubled archaeologists. The ancient city was included in the [[1996 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]], and again in [[1998 World Monuments Watch|1998]] and in [[2000 World Monuments Watch|2000]]. In 1996 the organisation claimed that Pompeii "desperately need[ed] repair" and called for the drafting of a general plan of [[building restoration|restoration]] and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_Catalog_1996.pdf |title=World Monuments Fund, '&amp;#39;List of 100 Most Endangered Sites&amp;nbsp;– 1996,'&amp;#39; New York, NY: 1996, p. 31. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320153209/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_Catalog_1996.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation supported conservation at Pompeii with funding from [[American Express]] and the [[Samuel Henry Kress#The Kress Foundation|Samuel H. Kress Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/project/ancient-pompeii |last=World Monuments Fund|title=Ancient Pompeii|date=2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, funding is mostly directed into conservation of the site; however, due to the expanse of Pompeii and the scale of the problems, this is inadequate in halting the slow decay of the materials. An estimated US$335 million is needed for all necessary work on Pompeii.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} A recent study has recommended an improved strategy for interpretation and presentation of the site as a cost-effective method of improving its conservation and preservation in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5334/pia.406 |journal=[[Papers from the Institute of Archaeology]] |title=Presenting Pompeii: Steps towards Reconciling Conservation and Tourism at an Ancient Site |volume=22 |year=2012 |pages=115–136 |publisher=[[Ubiquity Press]] |author=Wallace, Alia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 [[UNESCO]] declared: If restoration and preservation works “fail to deliver substantial progress in the next two years,” Pompeii could be placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fall and Rise and Fall of Pompeii|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/?no-ist|accessdate = 2015-07-01|first = Joshua|last = Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== House of the Gladiators collapse ===
The 2,000-year-old Schola Armatorum (House of the Gladiators) collapsed on 6 November 2010. The structure was not open to visitors, but the outside was visible to tourists. There was no immediate determination as to what caused the building to collapse, although reports suggested water infiltration following heavy rains might have been responsible. There has been fierce controversy after the collapse, with accusations of neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/11/06/16003236.html|title=Pompeii collapse prompts charges of official neglect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Pompeii-Gladiator-Centre-Collapses-At-Archaeological-Site-In-Southern-Italy-Cause-Not-Yet-Known/Article/201011115796320?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15796320_Pompeii_Gladiator_Centre_Collapses_At_Archaeological_Site_In_Southern_Italy%2C_Cause_Not_Yet_Known |title=Pompeii Gladiator Training Centre Collapses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompeii was the setting for the British comedy [[television series]] ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'' and the movie of the series. Pompeii also featured in the second episode of the fourth season of revived BBC science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', named ''[[The Fires of Pompeii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/09/25/49091.shtml |title=Doctor Who&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– Rome Sweet Rome |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured Caecilius as a character.

In 1971, the rock band [[Pink Floyd]] filmed a live concert titled ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]'', in which they performed six songs in the ancient Roman amphitheatre in the city. The audience consisted only of the film's production crew and some local children.

[[Siouxsie and the Banshees|Siouxsie and tbe Banshees]] wrote and recorded the punk-inflected dance song “Cities in Dust”, which describes the disaster that befell Pompeii and Herculaneum in A.D. 79. The song appears on their album ''[[Tinderbox (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Tinderbox]]'', released in 1985, on Polydor Records. The jacket of the single remix of the song features the plaster cast of the chained dog killed in Pompeii.

''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' is a novel written by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]] (published in 2003) featuring the account of the aquarius' race to fix the broken aqueduct in the days leading up to the eruption of Vesuvius, inspired by actual events and people.

''[[Pompeii (Bastille song)|Pompeii]]'' is a song by the British band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]], released 24 February 2013. The lyrics refer to the city and the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].

* ''[[Pompeii: The Last Day]]'' (2003), an hour-long drama produced for the [[BBC]] that portrays several characters (with historically attested names, but fictional life-stories) living in Pompeii, Herculaneum and around the [[Bay of Naples]], and their last hours, including a [[Fulling|fuller]] and his wife, two [[gladiator]]s, and [[Pliny the Elder]]. It also portrays the facts of the eruption. It is heavily influenced by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s book ''The Last Days of Pompeii'' (see [[Pompeii in popular culture#Books and other printed works]]), which&amp;nbsp;– while being responsible for the popularisation of Pompeii in Western culture&amp;nbsp;– has been dismissed for its lack of historical credibility. To give some historical reality to the characters, the death throes of the characters portrayed are based on actual skeletons and bodies found during excavations in the 18th century, while Pliny the Elder's death is shown as based on the accounts of how he actually died. Although in the story the narrator uses reports that [[Pliny the Elder]] died from inhaling the fumes of the final and greatest [[pyroclastic surge]], as many reports have found, he most likely had suffered a [[heart attack]] or stroke.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''Richard Wade Farley''' (born July 25, 1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Moffatt |first=Gregory |title=Blind-sided:homicide where it is least expected |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-96929-5 |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Americans|American]] convicted [[mass murderer]]. A former employee of [[ESL Incorporated]] in [[Sunnyvale, California]], he [[stalking|stalked]] his co-worker Laura Black for four years beginning in 1984. Black obtained a temporary restraining order against him on February 2, 1988, with a court date set for February 17, 1988 to make the order permanent.

On February 16, 1988, Richard Farley shot and killed seven people at ESL and wounded four others, including Laura Black. He was convicted of seven counts of first degree [[murder]], and is currently on [[death row]] at [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]].

==Early life==
Richard Farley was born July 25, 1948 in Texas. He was the oldest of six children. His father was in the military, therefore the family frequently relocated, and eventually settled in California. He graduated from high school in 1966 and attended [[Santa Rosa Junior College]]. Farley then joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1967 where he stayed for ten years. After his discharge in 1977, Farley began working as a software technician at ESL Inc., a defense contractor in [[Sunnyvale, California]].&lt;ref name=moffatt&gt;''Blind Sided: Homicide Where it is Least Expected'' Moffatt, Gregory 2000 Praeger Publishers pages 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stalking of Laura Black==
In April 1984, Richard Farley met 22-year-old Laura Black, who also worked at ESL Inc. Farley was immediately smitten and later said that he instantly fell in love with Black. Farley began leaving gifts, including letters and homemade baked goods, on Laura Black's desk and asked her out numerous times.&lt;ref name=moffatt /&gt; Black repeatedly refused the invitations and later said in an interview that she "...tried really to ignore him but to be cordial".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9fMH5O-SSCk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her refusals, Farley persisted; he began calling her desk every few hours as well as showing up at Black's [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]]s class. By providing false information to the ESL HR department through [[pretexting]], Farley was able to obtain Black's home address and home phone number. Farley was also known to have befriended the custodial department in an attempt to copy keys to Black's desk so he could rifle through her files to gain an insight into her life. He was also known to have pried through confidential personnel files of Black through false pretenses.

During this time, Farley was sending one or two letters to Black a week. Though there were periods of time during which the letters would cease, in total Richard Farley sent about two hundred letters over a period of four years, with the final letter sent from his prison cell after his rampage at ESL. Black moved four times during those four years, but Farley was able to obtain her address every time she did so. Farley even doctored photos of him and Black being together and mailed them to her.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3sPn2H8fAC&amp;pg=119 Stopping a Stalker: A Cop's Guide to Making the System Work for You]''; Snow, Robert L. 1998 Perseus Publishing page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall of 1985, Black asked the Human Resources Department at ESL for help. ESL ordered Farley to attend [[psychology|psychological]] counseling sessions, and despite attending these sessions, his harassment of Black continued. By spring of 1986, Farley was threatening fellow ESL employees. Because of his poor work performance, his employment with ESL was officially terminated in May 1986.&lt;ref&gt;''Stalking Crimes and Victim Prevention Davis'', Joseph A. 2001 CRC Press LCC page 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Workplace Violence Prevention Handbook'' Philpott, Don, Don Grimme Government Institutes an Imprint of the Scarecrow Press Inc. 2009 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; He had been working for ESL for nine years and spent several months stalking Black full-time, then found work at a rival company, Covalent Systems Corporation in Sunnyvale.&lt;ref name="MorainStein"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-18/news/mn-43514_1_mr-farley-richard-farley-sunnyvale-public-safety-department | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Dan | last1=Morain | first2=Mark A. | last2=Stein | title=Unwanted Suitor's Fixation on Woman Led to Carnage | date=February 18, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting at ESL==
Laura Black filed for a temporary [[restraining order]] against Farley on February 2, 1988 and it was granted by a family court judge. A court date was set for February 17, 1988 to see if the restraining order should be made permanent.

Farley purchased a shotgun along with various other weapons and equipment. Numerous pistols were also at his disposal along with a total of over 3,000 rounds of extra ammunition. The restraining order did not prevent him from buying weapons during that time. He also owned a variety of other weapons which were not present during the shooting at ESL, including a [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] shotgun barrel and a [[Ruger 10/22|Ruger .22LR carbine]]. On February 9, 1988, he left a package with Black's attorney, claiming to have evidence that he and Black had a longstanding relationship. The package included items such as photographs purportedly showing Black and Farley on dates, a garage door opener to Black's house, and hotel and credit card receipts. Richard Farley even claimed that Black kept a secret stash of cocaine that they shared once. Black's attorney dismissed the package as utter fabrications.

On the day before the court date, February 16, 1988, Farley drove his [[motorhome]] to the ESL parking lot in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. He later claimed he waited for Black to leave work so he could convince her to rescind the restraining order. If she refused, he would kill himself.  At about 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Farley loaded up his various guns, including a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[Benelli (firearms)|Benelli]] Riot [[semi-automatic shotgun]], a [[Ruger M77|Ruger M-77]] [[.22-250 Remington|.22-250]] rifle with a scope, a [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[pump-action shotgun]], a [[Sentinel (revolver)|Sentinel]] [[.22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire|.22 WMR]] revolver, a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[.357 Magnum]] revolver, a [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] [[.380 ACP]] pistol, and a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[9mm]] pistol. He also had a foot-long [[buck knife]] and [[smoke bomb]] and put on a [[bulletproof vest]], inserted earplugs, and put on a leather glove.

Carrying over 1,000 rounds of ammunition with him, he then approached the building while shooting toward bystanders. He entered into a side door by shooting through the glass, and shot at employees he encountered while heading toward Black's office on the second floor. Several employees were killed by his shots as he made his way through his former employer's building. Arriving at Black's office, he opened her door which she slammed in his face. He fired a shotgun round through the door, hitting her in the left shoulder and collapsing a lung.&lt;ref name="MorainStein"/&gt; The injury sent her unconscious to the floor while Farley moved on.&lt;ref name="MorainStein"/&gt;

Farley then held a police [[SWAT team]] at bay for five hours by moving from room to room so the SWAT snipers could not target him. Meanwhile, Black regained consciousness and managed to prevent her wound from bleeding further while she and other survivors hid from Farley. Black and other survivors eventually escaped, and Farley surrendered to police after requesting a sandwich and a soft drink.&lt;ref name="MorainStein"/&gt; A total of seven people were killed by Farley with four more wounded, including Black.&lt;ref name="MorainStein"/&gt; A total of 98 rounds were fired.

==Victims==
;Deceased
*Lawrence J. Kane, 46, from San Jose
*Wayne "Buddy" Williams Jr., 23, from San Jose
*Ronald G. Doney, 36, from Manteca
*Joseph Lawrence Silva, 43

*Ronald Steven Reed, 26
*Helen Lamparter, 49, from Sunnyvale

;Injured
*Laura Black
*Gregory Scott
*Richard Townsley
*Patty Marcott

==Aftermath==
The next day, court commissioner Lois Kittle made the restraining order against Farley permanent and commented, "Pieces of paper do not stop bullets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelleher|first=Michael D. |title=Profiling the Lethal Employee: Case Studies of Violence in the Workplace|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-95756-X|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black survived, but was hospitalized for nineteen days. She continued to work for the same company. Farley wrote to her again from his prison cell, claiming that she had finally won.

During trial, Farley admitted to the killings, but pled not guilty, claiming that he never planned to kill but only wished to get Black's attention or commit suicide in front of her for rejecting him. His attorney claimed that Farley was never a violent man and only had his judgment temporarily clouded by his obsession with Black, and that he would likely never kill again. Prior to the shooting, Farley did not have a [[criminal record]].

The prosecution documented every step of the stalking, produced all the letters he sent, and documented his shotgun and ammunition purchases a week before his rampage at ESL, as well as his other weapons. All this amounted to extensive planning, which was evidence of [[premeditation]].

On October 21, 1991, Farley was found guilty of all seven counts of first degree murder. On January 17, 1992, Superior Court Judge Joseph Biafore Jr. sentenced Farley to [[death penalty|death]]. Because of California law, there were several automatic appeals. On July 2, 2009, the California Supreme Court upheld Farley's death sentence (''People'' v ''Richard Farley'' (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1053). As of 2018, Farley is still on death row in San Quentin Prison.

This massacre helped prompt the State of California's 1990 passage of the [[United States of America]]'s first [[Stalking#United States 2|anti-stalking laws]] nationwide.

==Adaptations==
A movie, ''[[I Can Make You Love Me]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=I Can Make You Love Me| work=IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107178/|accessdate=January 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ''Stalking Laura'' in the [[United Kingdom]]) was made in 1993. [[Brooke Shields]] played Black and [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] played Farley.

The shooting incident is also the subject of a chapter of the book ''[[Chinese Playground: A Memoir]]'' by [[Bill Lee (author)|Bill Lee]], as well as a chapter in ''[[Obsession (book)|Obsession]]'' by [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]] and [[Mark Olshaker]].

'''Scribble Jam''' was an annual [[hip hop]] [[music festival]] hosted in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Dubbed "America's largest hip hop festival", sort of like Woodstock.&lt;ref name="sj1"&gt;[http://www.scribblemagazine.com Scribble Jam Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sentinelsource.com/articles/2010/04/22/entertainment/news/free/id_398410.txt Keene Sentinel]&lt;/ref&gt; it was co-founded in 1996 by "Fat" Nick Accurso,&lt;ref name="enquirer"&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/08/13/tem_scribblejam13.html Cincinnati Enquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jason Brunson, founders of [[graffiti]] magazine ''Scribble'', and [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mr Dibbs]], in the [[parking lot]] of a local nightclub. The following year's event benefitted from better publicity, and included [[rapping|MC]], DJ and [[breakdance]] battles for the first time.&lt;ref name="citybeat2003"&gt;[http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-7860-music-spray-scratch-spit-spin.html Cincinnati] [[Cincinnati CityBeat|CityBeat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, with the addition of new partners Tony Heitz and Pase Rock, the festival grew in popularity, as tens of thousands of hip hop fans flocked to its grounds in early August.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It has been known to attract up to 20,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=10486BEA55386A02&amp;p_docnum=1 Dayton Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt; In early April 2010, Scribble Jam organiser Kevin Beacham confirmed the persistent rumors that the event will not continue this year,&lt;ref name="sjfl"&gt;[http://www.urb.com/2010/12/21/scribble-jammed-festival-in-flux-pt-1/ "Scribble Jam in Flux", Urb Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; citing the struggling economy and difficulty in securing funding as reasons.A kickstarter campaign is currently being held with the final goal being a 2014 Scribble Jam event.&lt;ref name="wcpo"&gt;[http://www.wcpo.com/news/local/story/No-Scribble-Jam-This-Year/G26c8lP5T0m0gQCo8r2J4w.cspx WCPO radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of its existence, Scribble Jam refused corporate sponsorship, which Accurso explained as an attempt to keep the festival from being run by "those who don't understand [hip hop] culture",&lt;ref name="enquirer"/&gt; adding that outside marketing or promotion would "defeat the purpose" of the festival. By 2003, however, the festival had started accepting some corporate sponsors; that year's event was backed by [[Toyota]]/[[Scion (automobile)|Scion]].&lt;ref name="citybeat2003"/&gt;

==Competition==
The centerpieces of the Scribble Jam festival are the five competitions, four of which are designed to highlight the main aspects of [[hip hop culture]]. They include the [[emcee]] competition or [[freestyle battle]], the [[DJ]] battle or [[scratching]] competition, the [[B-boy]] battle or [[breakdancing]] competition, the graff-writer or [[graffiti]] competition, and  the [[beatbox]] competition. Historically, the most popular of the competitions has been the freestyle battle, although all aspects of hip hop culture are well represented. The festival expanded its initial 1996  emcee and b-boy competitions to include the DJ competition in 1998. In 2003 the beatbox competition was added to the line-up. In the last five years of the festival a Production competition was added to the festival line-up, and there were performances by guests including [[KRS-One]],&lt;ref name="citybeat2008"&gt;[http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-16369-music-scribble-jam.html Cincinnati] [[Cincinnati CityBeat|CityBeat]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eminem]], [[Sage Francis]],&lt;ref name="citybeat2003"/&gt; [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], [[Blueprint (rapper)|Blueprint]], [[Eyedea]],&lt;ref name="citybeat2003"/&gt; [[Mr Dibbs]],&lt;ref name="citybeat2008"/&gt; [[Little Brother (band)|Little Brother]] and [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]]&lt;ref name="enquirer"/&gt;  which greatly increased the festival's popularity.

'''Sealioning''' (also spelled '''sea-lioning''' and '''sea lioning''') is a type of [[Internet troll|trolling]] or harassment which consists of pursuing people with persistent requests for evidence or repeated questions, while maintaining a pretense of civility.&lt;ref name="Poland2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jd4nDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|title=Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online|last=Poland|first=Bailey|date=November 2016|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-1-61234-766-0|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a13403/online-harassment-terms-fight-back/|title=Anita Sarkeesian's Guide to Internetting While Female|last=Sarkeesian|first=Anita |author-link=Anita Sarkeesian|date=2015-02-20|work=[[Marie Claire]]|access-date=2018-01-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191803093.001.0001/acref-9780191803093-e-1257|title=A Dictionary of Social Media|last=Chandler|first=Daniel| author-link1=Daniel Chandler |last2=Munday|first2=Rod|date=2016-03-03|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780192518521|location=|pages=|language=en|oclc=952388585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troll pretends ignorance and feigns politeness, so that if the target is provoked into making an angry response, the troll can then act as the aggrieved party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/05/sealioning-new-thing-worry-relationships-online-7680577/|title=Sealioning is the new thing to worry about in relationships and online|last=Lindsay|first=Jessica|date=2018-07-05|work=[[Metro.co.uk]]|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/18/how-to-handle-a-troll-and-neuter-a-sea-lion-dealing-with-online-attacks-astroturfine-trolljacking|title=How to handle a troll … and neuter a sea lion|last=Stokel-Walker|first=Chris|date=2018-08-18|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealioning can be performed by a single troll or by multiple ones acting in concert.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; The technique of sealioning has been compared to the [[Gish gallop]] and metaphorically described as a [[denial-of-service attack]] targeted at human beings.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{Cite web|series=Perspectives on Harmful Speech Online|editor-last=Gasser|editor-first=Urs|publisher=[[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]]|last=Johnson|first=Amy|title=The Multiple Harms of Sea Lions|page=14|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.harvard.edu/files/2017-08_harmfulspeech.pdf|year=2017|ref=harv|accessdate=2018-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated with a 2014 strip of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Wondermark]]'', where a character expresses a dislike of [[sea lion]]s and a sea lion intrudes to repeatedly ask the character to explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/sea-lion.html|title=Definition of Sea lion|last=Maxwell|first=Kerry|date=2015-10-06|website=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Dictionary]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sea lion" was quickly [[verbing|verbed]], the term gained popularity as a way to describe online trolling, and it was used to describe some of the behavior of supporters of the [[Gamergate controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jhaver |first1=Shagun |last2=Ghoshal |first2=Sucheta |last3=Bruckman |first3=Amy |last4=Gilbert |first4=Eric  |author-link3=Amy S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">The '''Society of Martha Washington''' was formed in 1939, in [[Laredo, Texas]].  The Society hosts the Colonial Ball, which is an annual [[debutante ball]] where young women make their debut into society.  The Colonial Ball is held at the Laredo Civic Center and is a part of a citywide festival called the [[Washington's Birthday Celebration]], which takes place in February every year.&lt;ref name="Kendall-2002"&gt;Kendall, Diana E. The Power of Good Deeds: Privileged Women and the Social Reproduction of the Upper Class. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society of Martha Washington helps Laredo present an image of “racial and national harmony” by working in conjunction with the Princess [[Pocahontas]] Council, and the Abrazo Children.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Elliott. "Red Men, Princess Pocahontas, and George Washington: Harmonizing Race Relations in Laredo at the Turn of the Century." The Western Historical Quarterly 29.1 (1998): 48-85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the Society is exclusive, yet there is no discrimination based on race or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Kendall-2002" /&gt;  Unlike the debutante balls from the early 1900s up north, where racial and ethnic differences were implied as a definition of social class, Modern Laredo's elite consists of bicultural individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Elinse Chenier “Class, Gender, and the Social Standard: The Montreal Junior League, 1912–1939” The Canadian Historical Review 688. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society was founded with bicultural roots. As a result, a good number of the girls who are presented are Latinas.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Claudia A.; Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline (Eds.). Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia [Two Volumes]. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Members who are chosen for the Society usually come from a small group of old families.&lt;ref&gt;"Once Upon a Time in Laredo." National Geographic Nov.-Dec. 2006: 94-109. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The pageant==
The society chooses two prominent members of Laredo's society to portray President [[George Washington|George]] and [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge Washington]].  The debutantes that are presented every year as well as their escorts, either have family in the Society or are invited as guests. The participants portray contemporaries based on the story line, which changes every year, that come out to honor the President and his First Lady.&lt;ref&gt;Brezosky, Lynn. [http://209.189.226.235/stories/021807/texas_20070218015.php "Laredo Pulls out All Stops for First President's Birthday | The Bryan-College Station Eagle."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704120553/http://209.189.226.235/stories/021807/texas_20070218015.php |date=2011-07-04 }} 8 February 2007. Web. 16 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debutantes==
Each debutant is dressed in an elaborate hand-made colonial dress. Color options must be approved by the Mistress of Wardrobe. The dress is composed of several parts which include: a corset, bloomers, a cage, a petticoat, and finally the dress itself.  Most dresses are custom made in a collaboration between the debutant and the dressmaker. Linda Leyendecker Gutierrez, a gifted designer and experienced professional, is the official dressmaker for the pageant.  [[Silk]]s, [[satin]]s, and [[velvet]]s fabricated all over the world are uniquely hand picked and adorned with all types of [[bead]]s, [[lace]], and [[ribbon]] to create the perfect colonial debutante dress.  The dresses can weigh up to {{Convert|80|lb|kg}} because of the tremendous amounts of intricate beading.&lt;ref&gt;Horvart, Marian T.

The '''Space RIDER''' (Space '''R'''eusable '''I'''ntegrated '''D'''emonstrator for '''E'''urope '''R'''eturn) is a planned [[Uncrewed spacecraft|uncrewed]] [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[spaceplane]] aiming to provide the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) with affordable and routine access to space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Rider|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Transportation/Space_Rider|website=ESA|publisher=ESA|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its expected [[maiden flight]] is for late 2021.&lt;ref name="SR Factsheet"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/space_transportation/Space_Rider_factsheet_HiRes_ok.pdf |title=SPACE RIDER |format=PDF |publisher=[[ESA]] |access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Pultarova 2018'/&gt;

Development of Space RIDER is being lead by the Italian [[Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe|PRIDE programme]] in collaboration with ESA, and is the continuation of the [[Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle]] (IXV) experience,&lt;ref name='Space Rider PRIDE'&gt;[https://www.cira.it/en/space/accesso-allo-spazio-satelliti-ed-esplorazione/pride/Space%20Rider%20PRIDE Space RIDER PRIDE].

The cost of this phase, not including the launcher, is at least $36.7 million.&lt;ref name='bbc'/&gt;

== History ==

The European Space Agency has a program called [[Future Launchers Preparatory Programme]] (FLPP), which made a call for submissions for a reusable spaceplane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Transportation/New_milestone_in_IXV_development New milestone in IXV development]. ESA. 15 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the submissions was by the [[Italian Space Agency]], that presented their own [[Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe]] (PRIME program) which went ahead to develop the precursor called [[Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle]] (IXV) and the resulting Space RIDER.&lt;ref name='Space Rider PRIDE'/&gt;

Funding was initially approved by the ESA in 2016, with the project being lead by the [[Italian Aerospace Research Centre]] (CIRA).&lt;ref name='bbc'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coppinger|first1=Rob|title=The reusable spaceplane launched inside a rocket|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170411-the-reusable-spaceplane-launched-inside-a-rocket|accessdate=19 December 2017|publisher=BBC|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thales Alenia Space and [[Lockheed Martin]] were tasked with completing the design by 2019.

== Design ==

The Space RIDER design inherits technology developed for the earlier [[Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle]], also within the [[Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe|Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe (PRIDE)]].&lt;ref name='Space Rider PRIDE'/&gt;&lt;ref name='bbc' /&gt;&lt;ref name='sn_funding' /&gt; The design team considered the trade-offs of using only a [[lifting body]] and also using optional wings or vertical fins.&lt;ref name='Rider Aeroshape 2017'&gt;[https://www.eucass.eu/doi/EUCASS2017-416.pdf Aeroshape Trade-Off and Aerodynamic Analysis of the Space-Rider Vehicle].

Denaro. 7th European Conference for Aeronautics and Space Sciences (EUCASS). 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then decided in 2017 that the design should optimise the internal volume of the Vega [[Payload fairing|rocket fairing]], so its aerodynamic shape will be a simple lifting body, as tested on its predecessor, the [[Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle|IXV]].&lt;ref name='Rider Aeroshape 2017'/&gt; 3-axis control is achieved by the use of rear flaps.&lt;ref name='Rider Aeroshape 2017'/&gt; 

Space RIDER will have the potential to allow experiments in microgravity, such as exposure of materials to outer space and in-orbit validation of technologies, as well as deployment of small satellites.&lt;ref name="spaceRider"/&gt; The re-entry module itself is a [[testbed]] for entry technologies as the IXV precursor was, so future improvements are envisioned,&lt;ref name='Haya 2017'&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319980436_Mission_and_GNC_Challenges_from_IXV_to_Space_Rider Mission and GNC Challenges from IXV to Space Rider.] Rodrigo Haya Ramos, Davide Bonetti. ''Research Gate''. Conference: Fourteenth International Planetary Probe Workshop, At The Hague, The Netherlands. June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; including point-to-point flights, even "space tourism".&lt;ref name='bbc'/&gt;

In 2019, some [[parafoil]] guided landing tests will be performed by dropping a full-scale model from helicopters or balloons.&lt;ref name='bbc'/&gt;

Space RIDER is designed to launch atop the [[Vega-C]] rocket,&lt;ref name='private'/&gt;&lt;ref name='SR Factsheet'/&gt; and its maiden flight will be from the French Guiana in 2021, to land on a runway on [[Santa Maria Island]], in the [[Azores]].&lt;ref name='private' /&gt; The spacecraft is designed to conduct missions up to two months long in [[low Earth orbit]] with up to 800 kg of cargo.&lt;ref name='SR Factsheet'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Descent Subsystem 2017'/&gt;  Activities for Phase-B2/C, covering the preliminary design review and the critical design review, started on 25 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/space-rider.htm Space Rider].

===Landing===
[[File:X-38 Landing (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Space RIDER will use a controllable [[parafoil]] for landing, as used by the [[NASA X-38]] in 1999.]]
Upon [[atmospheric entry]], the lifting body shape will decelerate the spacecraft to subsonic speed (below Mach 0.8), when one or two [[drogue parachute]] will be deployed at about 15-12 km altitude to slow it further (to Mach 0.18 - 0.22)&lt;ref name='Descent Subsystem 2017'&gt; [https://www.eucass.eu/doi/EUCASS2017-624.pdf Conceptual Design of the Descent Subsystem for the Safe Atmospheric Re-Entry Flight of Space Rider].

[[File:Royalerp37.jpg|thumb|right|Royale RP37]]'''Sports 2000''' is a restricted-rules class of two-seat, mid-engined, open-cockpit, full-bodied [[sports-prototype]] racecar used largely in amateur road racing. Sometimes known as S2000 or S2, the class was developed by John Webb, then of the [[Brands Hatch]] racing circuit in England, as an affordable form of sports car racing, essentially a sports car version of [[Formula Ford|Formula Ford 2000]]. The key attributes of the class were a body design reminiscent of two-liter [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6 sports racing cars]] like the [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]] B21 and [[Lola Cars|Lola]] T-212 but with an ultra-reliable and inexpensive drivetrain comprising a two-liter [[Ford Pinto engine|"Pinto" overhead camshaft engine]] with very limited allowed modifications and the well-proven, VW-based [[Hewland]] Mk 9 transaxle. S2000 aerodynamics continued to evolve beyond their 1970s Group 6 roots, with very 'slippery' cars featuring spats over the wheels becoming the norm.

In the UK S2000 was largely seen as an alternative to front-engined [[Clubmans]] racing, a class for amateurs who were often deeply involved in developing their own cars over periods of years. The category suffered due to the demise of FF2000 in the late 1980s, and further when Clubmans transformed into the rear-engined National Supersports category, but it has recently undergone something of a revival in both historic and contemporary forms as a  (relatively) low-cost form of sports car racing.

In the US, while it continues to have popularity as an amateur race class within [[SCCA]] competition in the USA, at one point in the late 1980s and early 1990s, professional Sports 2000 racing was prevalent. One such series was the American Cities Racing League (ACRL) where the teams represented cities (primarily on the US West Coast) much as in stick-and-ball sports. Rather than individual drivers running for the championship, the two team drivers earned points for their sponsor city, a concept revived for the [[A1GP]], where teams represent countries rather than cities. This series used the uprated Cosworth/Ford YAC engine. Another series was the North American Pro Series or NAPS which visited many of the classic roadrace circuits in the U.S. and was often a support race for IMSA weekends. Later this series became the Oldsmobile Pro Series running the Oldsmobile Quad 4 engine.

In Sports 2000 racing in the UK, the Pinto engine has recently been replaced with the Mazda-based [[Ford Duratec]] engine, although Pintos continue to compete as a separate class.

In South Africa, an innovative transverse engined version of the Sports 2000 participated in a highly successful national series throughout the 1990s.

Early Sports 2000 cars are now of a sufficient age that they are being welcomed by several vintage racing sanctioning bodies in the US.

Companies that manufactured Sports 2000 chassis include: [[Carbir]], [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]], Crossle, [[Lola Cars|Lola]], [[March Engineering|March]], MCR, Reynard, [[Rotor Racing Cars|Rotor]], Royale, Shannon, [[Swift Engineering|Swift]], [[Tiga Race Cars]] and [[Van Diemen]].

'''Summer Jam''' is the annual hip-hop fest held in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] and sponsored by New York-based radio station [[WQHT|Hot 97FM]]. Normally held in June, the concert features the most popular acts that [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[R&amp;B]] have to offer in a particular year.

The hip-hop summer festival format was originally pioneered and popularized by [[San Francisco]] radio station [[KMEL]] with their large-scale ''Summer Jam'' concerts&lt;ref name="KMEL1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njs4ever.com/index.cfm/pageId/315 |title=KMEL Summer Jam Part 1 - The Original "Summer Jam" concerts by Andrew Knyte of NJS4E |publisher=njs4ever.com |date=2003 |accessdate=2014-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320100609/http://njs4ever.com/index.cfm/pageId/315 |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1987 through the 1990s and present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://njs4ever.com/index.cfm/pageId/316 |title= KMEL Summer Jam Part 2 |publisher=njs4ever.com |date=2003 |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; KMEL continues to host smaller versions of the event annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmel.com/pages/summerjam/ |title=Summer Jam 2014 |publisher=Kmel.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Los Angeles]] station [[KKLQ (FM)|KKBT]] held an annual ''Summer Jam'' hip-hop concert during the 1990s after hiring KMEL's Program Director in 1993.&lt;ref name="KMEL1" /&gt; The concert was discontinued as the station switched formats.

The concert has increasingly  become a scene of drug use and violence over the years. The most recent festival held on June 7, 2015 included a riot in the stadium parking lot. The disturbance began when crowds of people without tickets attempted to enter the stadium anyway by climbing over the fence and were stopped by [[New Jersey State Police]]. At this time, the decision to close all gates to the stadium was made and those in the parking lot were asked to leave. Instead of leaving, the crowd began throwing glass bottles and other objects at police. The police responded with [[riot gear]], [[armored vehicles]], and [[pepper spray]]. Multiple arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/news/arrests-made-at-summer-jam-concert-after-some-fans-clash-with-state-police-1.1351014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONCERT_ROWDY_CROWD?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2015-06-07-23-14-12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Televoting''', '''telephone voting''' or '''phone voting''' is a method of [[decision making]] and [[opinion poll]]ing conducted by telephone. Televoting can also extend to voting by [[SMS]] text message via a mobile cell phone.

== Broadcast contest televoting ==
Televoting involves broadcasters providing an audience with different telephone numbers associated with contestants participating; the outcome is decided by the number of calls to each line. Televotes are most commonly used to determine weekly results in [[reality competition]]s, such as the ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[Idol franchise|Idol]]'', and ''[[The X Factor]]'' franchises. 

In [[1997 Eurovision Song Contest|1997]], the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] began to phase in public televoting to determine its winner, with a mass rollout beginning in [[1998 Eurovision Song Contest|1998]]. Initially, televotes completely replaced the previous system, in which entries were scored by regional juries. These changes led to the increased prominence of "[[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Regional block voting|bloc voting]]"—in which a country's voting pattern would commonly favour neighbouring nations (such as [[Scandinavia]]n, [[Baltic States|Baltic]], [[Balkan]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries), and countries with similar cultures ([[UK]] and [[Ireland]]). From 2009 to 2015, most countries used a 50/50 split between a jury and televoting results. Since 2016, most countries still use a televoting process and a jury to determine the results, the votes are no longer combined and instead treated separately.

== Deliberative democracy televoting ==
A televote is initiated by random sampling of a population by means of random digit dialling.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Those contacted are requested to volunteer to receive written background briefing materials regarding a particular issue, that have been prepared by a panel of representatives of different stakeholder groups affected by that issue, and incorporating various views or perspectives.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Volunteers are requested to discuss the issue amongst their families and friends until they have reached a decision.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  At the conclusion of this period they are polled again by telephone in order to determine their views.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Advantages of televoting ===
Televoting is a more cost-effective method of democratic deliberation than many alternatives such as [[Deliberative opinion poll|deliberative polling]], as it does not require the participants to meet in person.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Common to other deliberative democratic techniques, it also tends to produce more reasoned decisions than "raw" opinion polling, because participants are exposed to various perspectives other than their own in the briefing materials that they receive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Disadvantages of televoting ===
Televoting may be less effective than other methods of democratic deliberation in which a trained moderator or facilitator is available in person to ensure that groups seriously deliberate on the issue before them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

''Space Encounters'' begins with Richard and Karen Carpenter performing "Sweet, Sweet Smile" in their recording studio, assisted by Charlie Callas. As they are performing, we see that they are being observed by the occupants of an alien spaceship (John Davidson and Suzanne Somers) who are on their way to Earth to meet The Carpenters. After Richard and Karen finish the song, the lights in the studio begin to flicker uncontrollably and musical instruments begin to move and play by themselves. At that moment, John [[Teleportation|teleports]] down to the studio and tells Richard and Karen how the people from his planet lack the ability to make music and he requests their help. Richard and Karen tell John about their earlier days in music and John uses his hi-tech pocket video screen to show The Carpenters performing "[[Fun Fun Fun]]" and "[[Dancing in the Street]]". After watching them, John tells them he wants to try singing himself and teleports to a more romantic setting to perform "[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]".

The Carpenters continue to reminisce about their earlier recordings and they perform "[[Goofus (song)|Goofus]]" in an old garage, similar to the one in which they recorded their first record in.

Richard, on piano, then performs the Space Encounters Medley, which includes the themes to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'', on stage with a full orchestra, complete with laser and starlight effects.

Back in the recording studio, Karen and John continue to reminisce about her early days in music and she performs "[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]". Afterwards, everybody teleports up to the spaceship's own nightclub, "The Galaxy Room", where Richard plays "Piano Picker", and Karen and Suzanne perform "Man Smart, Woman Smarter". Karen and John then perform "The Old-Fashioned Way" and then the whole cast (complete with dancers) perform a disco-medley including "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]", "[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]" and "[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]".

The Carpenters then perform "[[Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft]]" and the show ends with an instrumental version of "[[We've Only Just Begun]]".

'''Triplemanía III-C''' was the third part of the third [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). 1995 was second year to feature the "Triplemanía Series" of shows with 3, referred to as III-A, III-B and III-C, where this was the third and final of the series in 1995. The show was the seventh overall show held under the Triplemanía name. The show took place on June 30, 1995 in Madero, Mexico. The Main event featured a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls match|Best two out of three falls]] ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' "Mask vs. Mask" match where friends and [[tag team]] partners  [[Super Caló]] and [[Abismo Negro|Winners]] put their [[wrestling mask|masks]] on the line in the match.

==Production==

===Background===
Initial plans for the 1995 Triplemanía III series of events included a storyline where ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]'' members [[Eddie Guerrero|Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Art Barr]] would turn on teammate [[Konnan]] in the fall of 1994. This was supposed to turn ''técnico'' and set up a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, between Konnan and Art Barr where both would put their hair on the line.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAA booker [[Antonio Peña]] was hoping to actually sell out the 130,000 seat [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; The plans never came to fruition as Art Barr died suddenly on November 23, 1994 before the storyline even had a chance to start.&lt;ref name="HardcoreHistory"&gt;{{cite book | last=Williams | first=Scott | title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW'| pages=45–46 | publisher=SportsPublishingLLC |  year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr's death, coupled with the [[Mexican peso crisis]] in 1994 led to Guerrero leaving AAA to work in the United States instead and thus made a ''Los Gringos Locos'' storyline impossible to piece together. AAA still planned on making the 1995 Triplemanía III event a series of shows, spread out over several weeks, serving as the [[Super Bowl]] of AAA's year.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

===Storylines===
The event featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico) or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

One of the main storylines that would highlight all three Triplemanía III shows was the ongoing storyline between two teams, the masked, young ''técnico'' team of [[Super Caló]] and [[Abismo Negro|Winners]], fighting against the''rudo'' team known as ''[[Los Diabolicos]]'', in this case the two masked members Marabunta and Ángel Mortal. The basic storyline centered on two the "veteran" wrestlers in ''Los Diabolicos'' getting annoyed with the fan reaction Super Caló and Winners were getting without, in their opinion, earning it by proving themselves in the ring.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt; In the weeks prior to Triplemanía ''Los Diabolicos'' had faced off against Super Caló and Winners, often in [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|six-man tag team match]] with the third ''Diabolic'' Mr. Condor against Caló, Winners and various young ''tecnicos''. During those matches ''Los Diabolicos'' would often either steal the mask of their opponents, or rip the masks apart during their matches.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt; This led to all four wrestlers signing a contract for a series of ''[[Lucha de Apuesta]]'', or bet matches, where each competitor would wager their mask on the outcome of the match. In ''Lucha Libre'' a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match is viewed as more prestigious than a championship match and is often promoted as the main event of major shows.&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three match series would mean that three out of the four wrestlers would be unmasked by the time the third and final Triplemanía III match was over.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt; At [[Triplemanía III-A]] Winners and Marabunta won their match, which resulted in Super Caló later pining Ángel Mortal to unmask him.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-a | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = July 11, 2015| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory for Winners and Marabunta did not mean that their masks were safe, instead it meant that the two had to wrestle in the main event of TripleManía III-B under ''Lucha de Apuestas'' rules. At TripleManía III-B Super Caló defeated and unmasked Marabunta. Due to the contract that Winners and  Super Caló had agreed to the tag team partners, and friends would be forced to wrestle each other, defending their masks in the main event of TripleManía III-B.

==Aftermath==
Winners and Super Caló remained friends and occasional tag team partners after Winners lost his mask to Super Caló. Unmasked he became very popular with the female fans in the audience over the next year, but by the fall of 1996 Winners disappeared from AAA. [[Antonio Peña]] decided that the man behind the Winners character, Andrés Palomeque González, would be given a new character, a masked character known as "Abismo Negro" ("Black Abyss") a ''rudo'' character that was the complete opposite of the Winners character he had previously played.&lt;ref name=SL308&gt;{{cite news|last=Flores|first=Manuel|title=Abismo Negro Adiós al rey de marinete|work= SuperLuchas|id=308|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexican Federal District|D.F.]]|pages=24–26|date=March 30, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 years after Super Caló won the mask of his friend he found himself involved in another ''[[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Parejas Suicidas|Relevos Suicidas]]'', this time at [[Triplemanía XV]], this time Super Caló and [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Super Fly]] lost to [[Laredo Kid]] and [[Gran Apache]] and were forced to fight for their masks. On the night Super Fly pinned his friend and some times tag team partner Super Caló to force him to unmask and reveal his real name, Rafael García.&lt;ref name="Trip15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#xv|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|accessdate=April 19, 2010|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1995 Konnan and several other AAA workers created ''Promotora Mexicana de Lucha Libre'' (PROMLL), later named [[Promo Azteca]], talking a large number of AAA main stays with them. Initially they worked with AAA, acting more as a booking agency than a separate promotion, but by 1996 Promo Azteca broke off their relationship with AAA completely.

In the months following Triplemanía III-C the [[Mattel]] corporation threatened an infringement lawsuit by AAA use of the ''Los Power Raiders'' characters, citing that they were direct copies of the [[Power Rangers]] franchise. AAA abandoned the "Power Raiders" concept, creating all original characters known as ''[[Los Cadetes del Espacio]]'' ("The Space Cadets") with [[Venum Black|Venum]], [[Ludxor]], [[Discovery (wrestler)|Discovery]], [[Lasser (wrestler)|Frisbee]] and [[Skayde|Boomerang]].&lt;ref name="TomoVenum"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Venum Black | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo V | pages = 23 | date = November 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TomoLudxor"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Ludxoc | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo IV | pages = 40 | date = October 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TomoDiscovery"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Discovery | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo II | pages = 33 | date = August 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TomoFrisbee"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Frisbee | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo III | pages = 11 | date = November 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TomoBoomerang"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Boomerang | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo I | pages = 19 | date = July 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
John Molinario, who writes about wrestling for the [[Canadian Online Explorer]], called the three TripleManía III shows "an outstanding TripleMania series" when reviewing the first five years of AAA's Triplemanía in a 2000 article.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;
