[[File:Maschera del Badalisc - Andrista - Cevo (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|250px|thumb|The Badalisc]]
The '''Badalisc''' (also '''Badalisk''') is a [[mythology|mythical]] creature of the [[Val Camonica]], [[Italy]], in the [[Southern Limestone Alps|southern central Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.demologia.it/brescia/feste/3cevo/basfest.htm
| title       = Festa del Badalisc ad Andrista (località di Cevo)
| language    = italian
| accessdate  = 2011-01-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Badalisc is represented today as a creature with a big head covered with a [[goat]] skin, two small horns, a huge mouth and glowing eyes.

==The celebration==
According to legend the Badalisc lives in the woods around the village of [[Andrista]] (commune of [[Cevo]]) and is supposed to annoy the community: each year it is captured during the period of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (5 &amp; 6 January) and led on a rope into the village by musicians and masked characters, including ''il giovane'' (the young man), ''il vecchio'' (the old man), ''la vecchia'' (the old woman) and the young ''signorina'', who is "bait" for the animal's lust. There are also some old [[witch]]es, who beat drums, and bearded shepherds, and a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]] (''un torvo gobetto'') who has a "rustic duel" with the animal. Traditionally only men take part, although some are [[Drag (clothing)#Theatre|dressed as women]]. In ancient times women were prohibited from participating in the exhibition, or even to see or hear the Badalisc's Speech; if they did so they would be denied [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] the following day.

In the village square (formerly in a stable) the ''Badalisc's speech'' (''la 'ntifunada'') is read, in which the mythological animal [[gossip]]s about the community. The Badalisc itself is a dumb creature, so the speech, nowadays written in rhyme, is read by an "interpreter". Once improvised, now written in advance, the speech reveals all the supposed sins and scheming of the community. During the speech the hunchback bangs his stick rhythmically at intervals.

The speech is followed by singing, dancing and feasting. In the evening the community eats the "Badalisc [[polenta]]" (a commercial version of this traditional food was launched in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bresciaoggi.it/stories/Home/138775_tradizioni_il_badalisc_diventa_una_occasione_gastronomica/ Bresciaoggi: ''tradizioni_il_badalisc_diventa_una_occasione_gastronomica''] Accessed 21 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, village children would beg from house to house during the Badalisc celebrations for cornmeal to make the polenta; a Badalisc [[salami]] was also specially made for them. The badalisc has a place of honour at the feasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demologia.it/brescia/feste/3cevo/basalisk.htm Demologia.it] Accessed 21 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day, at the end of the exhibition, the Badalisc is set free and allowed to return to the woods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://it.wikinews.org/wiki/Andrista:_catturato_il_%C2%ABBadalisc%C2%BB,_inizia_la_festa Wikinews (Italy) ''Andrista: catturato il «Badalisc», inizia la festa''] Monday 5 Jan 2009, Wikinews&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related customs==
The ritual has strong similarities with the ''Bosinada'', ''Bosinade'' or ''Businade'', satirical performances of prose, poetry or song, in which a storyteller (the ''Bosin'') denounced the misdeeds of the community. Known from the 16th century, these were once widespread throughout northern Italy and derived from the purification rituals of [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;Barozzi, Giancorrado &amp; Varini, Mario, ''Tradizioni popolari del ciclo dell'anno in provincia di Brescia'', Fondazione Civiltà Bresciana, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Any link between the Badalisk of Andrista and the mythical [[Basilisk]] (half lizard, half serpent, with a head like a cat, but squarer, like a toad) that incinerates everything on which it rests its gaze (well known in Cevo and elsewhere in northern Italy) is unclear.

It was one of Sweden's first ISPs.&lt;ref name="IDG 2010-04-15"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jon Karlung kliver av |trans-title=Jon Karlung steps down |first=Daniel |last=Goldberg |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.310737/jon-karlung-kliver-av |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG Sweden]] |language=Swedish |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is publicly traded since December 2007 under the name BAHN-B (Aktietorget).&lt;ref name="AnnRep 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahnhof.se/data/filestorage/pressreleases/arsredovisning2007.pdf |title=Årsredovisning för räkenskapsåret 2007 |trans-title=Annual Report for fiscal year 2007 |year=2008 |publisher=Bahnhof AB |page=2 |language=Swedish |accessdate=18 March 2011 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206125547/http://www.bahnhof.se/data/filestorage/pressreleases/arsredovisning2007.pdf |archive-date=6 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 2008, Bahnhof opened a new computer center inside the former civil defence center [[Pionen]] in the [[Vita Bergen|White Mountains]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref name="IDG 2008-12-09"&gt;{{cite news |title=Serversafari 30 meter under jorden |trans-title=Serversafari 30 meters under the earth |first=Linus |last=Larsson |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.199188/serversafari-30-meter-under-jorden |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG Sweden]] |language=Swedish |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Realtid 2008-09-10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahnhof spränger Vita bergen |trans-title=Bahnhof blasts the White Mountains |first=Ian |last=Hammar |url=http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/200809/10/20080910185323_Realtid224/20080910185323_Realtid224.dbp.asp |work=Realtid.se |language=Swedish |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On 10 March 2005, the [[Swedish Police Authority|Swedish police]] confiscated four [[server (computing)|servers]] placed in the Bahnhof premises, hoping to find [[copyright]]ed material. Although these servers were located near Bahnhof's server park (in a network lab area) the company claimed they were not their property since they had been privately purchased by staff. They further presented evidence showing the material on these servers had been planted there by someone hired by [[Svenska Antipiratbyrån]], a Swedish organisation fighting against copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="Aftonbladet 2005-03-22"&gt;{{cite news |title=Antipiratbyrån anklagas för piratverksamhet |trans-title=Antipiratbyrån accused of piracy |first=Caroline |last=Olsson |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/pryl/article274012.ab |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=22 March 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Bahnhof generated controversy by failing to store the [[IP address]]es of customers, in order to defeat the Swedish government's new laws on illegal [[file sharing|file-sharing]], [[transposition (law)|transposing]] the EU [[IPRED]] regulations, which enabled ISPs to retain data longer than the [[data protection]] regulations would allow, in order for them to be available on police request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/18882.html |title=ISP sabotages file sharing law |work=[[The Local]] |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[whistleblower|whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]] was kicked off of [[Amazon Web Services]] in December 2010, it bought server space from Bahnhof, as its chairman Jon Karlung revealed in press interviews after in the light of the new controversy created by [[Afghan War documents leak|the leaks about]] the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)]], even showing journalists the two servers on which the data was held. The chairman said that WikiLeaks is treated like any other of Bahnhof's clients.

In April 2014, however, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|CJEU]] struck down the [[Data Retention Directive]]. [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority|PTS]], Sweden's telecommunications regulator, told Swedish [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] and telcos that they would no longer have to retain call records and internet metadata.&lt;ref name="PC WOrld 2014-04-11"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Essers |first1=Loek |title=Sweden won't enforce data retention law against ISP that deleted metadata |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2142780/sweden-wont-enforce-data-retention-law-against-isp-that-deleted-metadata.html |work=PCWorld |date=11 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But after two government investigations found that Sweden's data retention law did not break its obligations to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the PTS reversed course.&lt;ref name="ZDNet 2014-10-29"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tung|first1=Liam|title=Swedish data retention back in full swing minus one ISP |url=http://www.zdnet.com/swedish-data-retention-back-in-full-swing-minus-one-isp-7000035206/ |work=ZDNet |date=29 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Sweden's major telecommunications companies complied immediately, though [[Tele2]] lodged an unsuccessful appeal. Bahnhof was the one holdout and it was given an order to comply by November 24 deadline or face a five million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] ($680,000) fine.&lt;ref name="GigaOm 2014-10-29"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meyer |first1=David |title=Swedish ISP Bahnhof threatened with fine for not storing customer data for law enforcement |url=https://gigaom.com/2014/10/29/swedish-isp-bahnhof-threatened-with-fine-for-not-storing-customer-data-for-law-enforcement/ |work=GigaOm |date=29 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Bahnhof offered all their customers a free VPN-service.&lt;ref name="Bahnhof 2014-11-16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bahnhof.se/press/press-releases/2014/11/16/bahnhof-aktiverar-plan-b-erbjuder-fri-anonymisering |title=Bahnhof aktiverar "plan B": erbjuder fri anonymisering |date=16 November 2014 |publisher=Bahnhof AB |accessdate=15 October 2015 |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COLA''' stands for Combined Object Lambda Architecture, and is a system for experimenting with [[Computer software|software]] [[Software design|design]] currently being investigated by the [[Viewpoints Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vpri.org/vp_wiki/index.php/Main_Page |title= Viewpoints Research Institute software page |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A COLA is a self-describing [[Programming language|language]] in two parts, an [[Object-oriented programming|object]] system which is implemented in terms of objects, and a [[Functional programming|functional]] language to describe the computation to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vpri.org/pdf/rn2006001a_colaswp.pdf |title= Accessible Language-Based Environments of Recursive Theories (a white paper advocating widespread unreasonable behavior) |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a COLA is [[Self-hosting|written in itself]], the whole environment (when [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapped]]) can be rewritten and extended by programming with the COLA; in other words, it does not require more knowledge to rewrite a COLA than it does to write a program to run in it (as opposed to running [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code in [[CPython]] for example, which requires knowledge of [[C (programming language)|C]] in order to reprogram the language).

This flexibility has led to the work-in-progress COLA called 'idst'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piumarta.com/software/cola/ |title= idst homepage |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the implementation vehicle of choice for the Viewpoints Research Institute's research into 'reinventing programming', since it allows rapid creation and modification of new programming languages for study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2008003_experimenting.pdf |title= Experimenting with programming languages |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
A COLA is designed to be the simplest possible language which can be described in itself, so that the implementation exactly describes itself. In order to do this the structure of the environment is separated from the semantics of the computation performed.

The object system describes the structure of a [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] Object Oriented environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piumarta.com/software/cola/prototypes.html |title= Pepsi's object system |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is implemented in terms of objects and message passing, which is in fact the same system it is describing. This allows modification of the system by using the same object oriented knowledge used to write any other application.

This object system is turned into a useful programming language by complementing it with a functional language describing what each object's methods do. The methods called from the object language are [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] running a functional programming language.

Combined together, these two parts form a complete prototype-based Object Oriented programming language which is entirely self-hosting.

=== Natural language analogy ===
In order to illustrate the concept, we can consider an analogy in natural language, say English. To define the whole of English for someone who speaks a foreign language would be a monumental task, especially since it would have to be done over and over again for each foreign language we're coming from. However, we could instead define a simpler subset of English as a base which is just expressive enough to understand definitions given in English. For example, such a subset would not need a word for "giraffe", since it could be added later with a statement like "A giraffe is a herbivore with a long neck." Similarly the definitions of herbivore, neck and long can be added later with other statements, and so on. This way we can remove every part of English which we do not need in our subset.

The bits we keep are those which are needed to understand definitions and statements (so that we can expand the language later), along with everything needed to define those, and so on. What we end up with is a self-contained language, written in itself (a subset of English) and capable of being expanded with statements like the giraffe one above.

Any English speaker is thus capable of changing the language itself as easily as they speak (since it is defined in English) by rewriting, overriding or bypassing the statements given in the base, turning the language into anything (including existing ones).

Also, anyone can become an English speaker simply by having this base translated into their native tongue (a more tractable problem than translating the whole of English). Once they know this subset then they know enough English to understand other statements like the giraffe one, and thus grow their knowledge to the whole language through English sentences (which can be reused by everyone, regardless of their first language). This is analogous to the bootstrapping and compatibility of a COLA.

The way a COLA such as idst implements this can be thought of as defining words using other words (the object system) separately to defining the grammar (the functional language).

== Features ==
A COLA can be used in two ways:

Due to their flexible and extensibility it is possible to make COLAs compatible with many [[Application binary interface|ABI]]s, which allows integration into existing libraries (for example, those written in C) whilst maintaining the ability to mutate the COLA into another (perhaps custom) language.

A completely COLA-based computer system, whilst capable of implementing the operating system, libraries, applications and other levels of a traditional computer system, allows these distinctions to blur or disappear if the end-user wishes. Every aspect of the computer system, since it is written in a COLA (including the COLA itself), can be overridden, mutated, bypassed, etc. just as the local datastructures and functions in a traditional program can. There is also flexibility in how code is run, since there is a choice of interpreting, static compilation, dynamic compilation, in fact if the COLA is given a suitable backend object then it can even reprogram [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]'s to run arbitrary sections of the system.

== Current Implementation ==

=== Idst ===
Ian Piumarta's 'idst' system (the name is currently in flux) is a work-in-progress implementation of a COLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piumarta.com/software/cola/colas-whitepaper.pdf |title= Experimenting with programming languages |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of several components, such as the Id object model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piumarta.com/software/cola/objmodel2.pdf |title= Id object model |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jolt function language &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piumarta.com/software/cola/coke.html |title= Coke programming guide |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pepsi object oriented language. Pepsi was bootstrapped by writing two Pepsi compilers, one in C++ and one in Pepsi, then compiling the latter with the former, then in with itself. This made Pepsi self-hosting, and the C++ version was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piumarta.com/software/cola/pepsi.html |title= Pepsi not quite The Real Thing |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Projects ===
The idst COLA has already been used in the following projects:

[[OMeta]] - An object oriented pattern matching language based on [[Parsing expression grammar|Parsing Expression Grammars]]

JOHN - A [[goal-oriented programming language]]

JITBLT - An image compositing engine

A '''demand letter''', or  '''letter of demand'''&lt;ref name="Victoria Legal Aid - Creditor notices and letters of demand"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legalaid.vic.gov.au/find-legal-answers/debt-and-financial-issues/creditor-notices-and-letters-of-demand|title=Creditor notices and letters of demand|work=[[Victoria Legal Aid]]|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of payment), is letter stating a legal claim (usually drafted by a [[lawyer]]) which makes a demand for [[restitution]] or performance of some obligation, owing to the recipients' alleged [[breach of contract]], or for a [[tort|legal wrong]]. Although demand letters are not legally required they are frequently used, especially in [[Contract law|contract]] law, [[Tort law|tort]] law, and [[Commercial law|commercial]] law cases. For example, if one anticipates a breach, it is advantageous to send a demand letter asserting that the other side appears to be in breach and requesting assurances of performances. Demand letters that are not responded to may constitute admissions by silence. Also, a demand letter will often generate a denial letter stating the basis for rejecting your side's claim (such as when the incorrect entity is sued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.litigant.com.au/blog/responding-letter-demand|title=Responding to a Letter of Demand|website=www.litigant.com.au|language=LANGUAGE|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and is sometimes a good indication of what defenses will be raised if suit is brought later.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Litigation for Paralegals by Marlene Maerowitz &amp; Thomas Mauet. Eighth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand letters are sometimes used as a form of harassment and/or intimidation.

==Insurance claims==

In personal injury claims, the settlement negotiation process begins by the victim submitting a demand letter to the insurance companies.  The purpose of the demand letter is to present facts about the accident in order to persuade the insurance companies to provide adequate compensation. A typical demand letter is structured in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop Copyright Infringement with a Demand Letter|url=http://www.ceasethendesist.com/|website=www.ceasethendesist.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Description of the Accident
* Discussion of Accident Liability
* Description of Personal injuries
* Description of Medical treatments
* List of Medical Bills/Lost Income Statements
* Injury Settlement Demand

The personal injury demand letter is then sent to the insurance companies with supplemental documents that are referenced in the letter.  This may include copies of accident reports, photographs of the accident/injuries, medical bills, doctor’s statements etc.

The insurance company will then analyze the arguments made in the demand letter and respond with a counter settlement offer.

==Debt collection==
In the [[United States]], demand letters from a [[debt collector]] relating to a consumer debt must comply with the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]].&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. § 1692g&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain types of legal proceedings in [[Quebec]], a demand letter is mandatory; without it, a person could lose his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demand letters|url=http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/English/sujets/glossaire/mise-a.htm|website=www.justice.gouv.qc.ca|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6036">'''''Dorland's''''' is the brand name of a family of medical [[reference work]]s (including [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], spellers and word books, and [[Spell checkers|spell-check software]]) in various media spanning printed books, CD-ROMs, and online content. The flagship products are '''''Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary''''' (currently in its 32nd edition) and '''''Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary''''' (currently in its 29th edition). The principal dictionary was first published in 1890 as the '''''American Illustrated Medical Dictionary''''', including 770 pages. The pocket edition, called the '''''American Pocket Medical Dictionary''''', was first published in 1898, consisting of just over 500 pages.

With the death of the editor William Alexander Newman Dorland, AM, MD in 1956, the dictionaries were retitled to incorporate his name, which was how they had generally come to be known.  The illustrated dictionary had grown to 2208 pages for the 31st edition.

The dictionaries were historically published by [[W.B. Saunders Company|Saunders]].

==Publisher==

Dorland's was published for over a century by the [[W.B. Saunders Company]], which was an independent medical publisher during most of that time. In the 1980s and 1990s, W.B. Saunders was acquired first by [[CBS]] and then by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]]. Today the company has been absorbed into [[Elsevier]], where the name ''Saunders'' (without the ''W.B.'') is used as an imprint name.

Contexo Media's Dorland Healthcare Information, publisher of ''Dorland's Medical Directory'', appears to be unrelated to Elsevier, Saunders, and the Dorland's family of medical reference works.

'''False documentation''' is the process of creating documents which record fictitious events.  The documents can then be used to "prove" that the fictional events happened.  A common [[propaganda]] tool, false documentation is often used by [[management]] groups and [[totalitarian]] governments for four basic reasons:
# to have a basis for accusations against groups or individuals who oppose those in authority,
# to invoke hatred against certain [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[ethnic]] or [[religious]] groups (appeal to bigotry),
# To support the actions of those in power (appeal to [[patriotism]]), and
# To cover the mistakes of those in power ([[deniability]]).

Perhaps the best illustration of false documentation is [[Nazi Germany]], where the authorities falsified documents for all four reasons.

There are three basic methods for falsifying documentation.  One way, of course, is to create an entirely fictional event and write it down.  The other is to misrepresent an actual incident by embellishment or exaggeration so that the blame for the incident is misplaced.  The third is to refuse to document an actual event, thereby exonerating the instigators for lack of proof.

The practice of false documentation rests on the fallacy, promoted by management organizations and governments, that whatever has been written down is unquestionably true.  In business, it rests on a further bias: the tendency of management to believe managers rather than to collect and objectively judge evidence.  As [[folklorist]] [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] points out, when a story or a claim appears in print, it gains an air of authority.  Many people are skeptical of spoken rumors, but few doubt the veracity of stories appearing in the news media.

A related fallacy is, of course, that whatever has ''not'' been documented must not have happened. Although absence of evidence is [[evidence of absence]], whether any given event happened is entirely independent of whether it was documented.

In [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''1984'', the [[Ministry of Truth]] has an entire department devoted to altering past editions of [[newspapers]] in the belief that changing documentation will change the public's perception of history.  One of the novel's greatest ironies is that the Ministry of Truth deals exclusively in lies.

'''''Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.''''', 499 U.S. 340 (1991), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] establishing that information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|link=|volume=499|page=340|pin=|year=1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case appealed, Feist had copied information from Rural's [[telephone directory|telephone listings]] to include in its own, after Rural had refused to license the information. Rural sued for [[copyright infringement]]. The Court ruled that information contained in Rural's phone directory was not copyrightable and that therefore no infringement existed.

==Background==
Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc. is a [[telephone cooperative]] providing services for areas in northwest Kansas, with headquarters in the small town of [[Lenora, Kansas|Lenora]], in [[Norton County, Kansas|Norton County]]. The company was under a statutory obligation to compile a phone directory of all their customers free of charge as a condition of their monopoly franchise.

Feist Publications, Inc. specialized in compiling telephone directories from larger geographic areas than Rural from other areas of Kansas. They had licensed the directory of 11 other local directories, with Rural being the only hold-out in the region. Despite Rural's denial of a license to Feist, Feist copied some 4000 entries from Rural's directory. Because Rural had placed a small number of [[Fictitious entry|phony entries]] to detect copying, Feist was caught.

Prior to this case, the substance of copyright in United States law followed the [[sweat of the brow]] doctrine, which gave copyright to anyone who invested significant amount of time and energy into their work. At trial and appeal level the courts followed this doctrine, siding with Rural.

==Ruling of the court==
The ruling of the court was written by [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]]. It examined the purpose of copyright and explained the standard of copyrightability as based on [[originality]].

The case centered on two well-established principles in United States copyright law: That facts are not copyrightable, but that compilations of facts can be.

"There is an undeniable tension between these two propositions," Justice O'Connor wrote in her decision. "Many compilations consist of nothing but raw data -- i.e. wholly factual information not accompanied by any original expression. On what basis may one claim a copyright upon such work? Common sense tells us that 100 uncopyrightable facts do not magically change their status when gathered together in one place. … The key to resolving the tension lies in understanding why facts are not copyrightable: The ''sine qua non'' of copyright is originality."

Rural claimed a collection copyright in its directory. The court clarified that the intent of copyright law was not, as claimed by Rural and some lower courts, to reward the efforts of persons collecting information — the so-called "[[sweat of the brow]]" or "industrious collection" doctrine — but rather "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" ([[Copyright Clause|U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8]]). That is, to encourage creative expression.

The [[Threshold of originality|standard for creativity]] is extremely low. It need not be novel, rather it only needs to possess a "spark" or "minimal degree" of creativity to be protected by copyright.

In regard to collections of facts, Justice O'Connor stated that copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange it, it would destroy the copyright owned in the data. "Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another's publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement," Justice O'Connor wrote.

The court ruled that Rural's directory was nothing more than an alphabetic list of all subscribers to its service, which it was required to compile under law, and that no creative expression was involved. The fact that Rural spent considerable time and money collecting the data was irrelevant to copyright law, and Rural's copyright claim was dismissed.

While the other justices joined Justice O'Connor's majority opinion, [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] only concurred in judgement, but never filed a concurring opinion to explain his reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Philip H. Miller, ''Life After Feist: Facts, the First Amendment, and the Copyright Status of Automated Databases'', 60 Fordham L. Rev. 507 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
{{see also|Idea-expression divide|Threshold of originality}}
The ruling has major implications for any project that serves as a collection of knowledge.  Information (that is, [[fact]]s, discoveries, etc.), from any source, is fair game, but cannot contain any of the "expressive" content added by the source [[author]].  That includes not only the author's own comments, but also his choice of which facts to cover, his choice of which links to make among the bits of information, his order of presentation (unless it is something obvious like an alphabetical list), any evaluations he may have made about the quality of various pieces of information, or anything else that might be considered "original creative work" of the author rather than mere facts.

For example, a [[recipe]] is a process, and not copyrightable, but the words used to describe it are; see [[idea-expression divide]] and ''[[Publications International v Meredith Corp.]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;''Publications International v Meredith Corp.'', 88 F.3d 473 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]], 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, you can rewrite a recipe in your own words and publish it without infringing copyrights. But, if you rewrote every recipe from a particular [[cookbook]], you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright in the choice of recipes and their "coordination" and "presentation", even if you used different words; however, the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity carried over from the original presentation.  It should be noted that a sufficiently novel, useful, and unique (i.e. non-obvious) recipe can be granted protection under [[patent]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/02/10/the-law-of-recipes-are-recipes-patentable/id=22223/ "The Law of Recipes: Are Recipes Patentable?" (Feb 10, 2012) IPWatchdog]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Feist'' proved most important in the area of copyright of legal case law publications.  Although one might assume that the text of U.S. case law is in  [[public domain]],  [[Thomson West]] had claimed a copyright as to the first page citations and internal pin-point page citations of its versions of court opinions (case law)  found in its printed versions of the case law ("West's citation claims.")  West also had claimed a copyright in the text of its versions of the case law, which included parallel citations and typographical corrections ("West's text claims.") The text claim would have barred anyone from copying the text of a case from a West case law reporter, since the copied text would include West enhancements to which West claimed copyright.

In a pre-''Feist'' case, West's citation [[copyright]] claim had been affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in a preliminary injunction case in 1986 brought by West against Mead Data, owner of Lexis. ''[[West Publishing Co. v. Mead Data Central|West v. Mead]]'' (1986);&lt;ref&gt;''West Publishing Co. v. Mead Data Central'', [http://showcase.netins.net/web/trhalvorson/law/799_f2d_1219.html 799 F.2d 1219] (''United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Cir.]], 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; however, in a case commenced in 1994 in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found ''Feist'' to have undermined the reasoning in ''West v. Mead''.   West's citation claims were challenged in 1994 by legal publisher, Matthew Bender &amp; Company and by a small CD-Rom publisher HyperLaw, Inc. HyperLaw intervened, joining Matthew Bender in the citation challenge and separately challenging West's text copyright claims.  West was found by the Second Circuit in 1998 not to have a protectable copyright interest in its citations; neither to the first page citations nor to its internal pagination citations.  See ''Matthew Bender  v. West'',  Citation Appeal.&lt;ref name = "cite-ca2"&gt;
Second Circuit - Citation Appeal: [http://www.hyperlaw.com/westlit/litdocs/1998-11-03-second-circuit-opinion-citation-HLvWest-97-74301.html '' Matthew Bender  v. West'', 158 F.3d 693 (2d Cir. 1998), ''cert. denied'', 526 U.S. 1154 (1999) ].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Circuit thereby rejected the 1996 determination of a Minnesota district court in ''Oasis Publishing Co. v. West Publishing Co.'', 924 F.Supp. 918 (D. Minn. 1996), that the outcome of ''West'' is not changed by ''Feist''.

In the same case, but in separate decisions in which Matthew Bender was not involved, HyperLaw successfully challenged West's text claims.  Judge John S. Martin ruled in favor of HyperLaw against West in a U.S. District Court decision in May, 1996.
''Matthew Bender v. West'', No. 94 Civ. 0589, 1997 WL 266972 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 1997), ''aff'd'', 158 F. 3d 674 (2nd Cir. 1998), ''cert. denied sub. nom.'' ''West v. Hyperlaw'', 526 U.S. 1154 (1999).&lt;ref name = "text-sdny"&gt;District Court - HyperLaw Text Decision: [http://www.hyperlaw.com/westlit/litdocs/1997-05-19-176-Martin-Order-Text.html ''Matthew Bender v.

Hyperlaw'', 526 U.S. 1154 (1999).]&lt;/ref&gt;    West lost  to HyperLaw in its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and [[certiorari]] was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref name = "text-ca2"&gt;
Second Circuit - HyperLaw Text Appeal Decision:  [http://www.hyperlaw.com/westlit/litdocs/1998-11-03-second-circuit-opinion-ctation-HLvWest-97-74301.html ''Matthew Bender v.

After the 1986 ''West v. Mead'' decision, Mead Data and Lexis were acquired by [[Reed Elsevier]], a large English-Dutch based publisher.  During the ''Matthew Bender v. West'' case, Reed Elsevier and Matthew Bender entered into a strategic relationship, culminating in Reed Elsevier's acquisition of Matthew Bender in 1998, just after the Second Circuit appeals were argued.    Reed Elsevier now was on the side of West and filed an amicus brief opposing HyperLaw and supporting West.  Thus, although the name of the case might suggest that Matthew Bender challenged West on the text claim, by the middle of the case Matthew Bender was on the side of West on the text issue.  Reed Elsevier's support of West's claims to a copyright in text was consistent with the initiatives, discussed below, to sidestep ''Feist'' by implementing database protection, through legislation and treaties discussed below. Similarly, during the case, West was acquired by the Canadian-based international publisher, the Thomson Corporation.

Another case covering this area is ''[[Assessment Technologies v. Wiredata]]'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;''Assessment Technologies v. Wiredata'', [http://www.law.pitt.edu/madison/copyright/supplement/assessment_v_wiredata.pdf 350 F.3rd 640] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]], 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that a copyright holder in a compilation of public domain data cannot use that copyright to prevent others from using the underlying public domain data, but may only restrict the specific format of the compilation, if that format is itself sufficiently creative.  ''Assessment Technologies'' also held that it is a [[fair use]] of a copyrighted work to [[reverse engineer]] that work in order to gain access to uncopyrightable facts.  ''Assessment Technologies'' also created new law, stating that it is a [[copyright misuse]] and an [[abuse of process]] if one attempts to use a [[contract]] or [[license agreement]] based on one's copyright to protect uncopyrightable facts.

In the late 1990s, Congress attempted to pass laws which would protect collections of [[data]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techlawjournal.com/congress/h2652data/Default.htm ''H.R. 2652, Collections of Information Antipiracy Act''] 1998&lt;/ref&gt; but these measures failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/01band.html ''Armageddon on the Potomac: the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act''] 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, the [[European Union]] has a ''[[sui generis]]'' (specific to that type of work) [[Database right|intellectual property protection for collections of data]].

=== Other countries ===
{{see also|Sui generis database rights}}

The applicability of copyright to phone directories has come up in several other countries.

In Canada, the appeal-level case of ''[[Tele-Direct (Publications) Inc. v. American Business Information Inc.]]'' (1997) 76 C.P.R. (3d) 296 (F.C.A.) reached a similar result to that of ''Feist''. However, the Supreme Court partially backed away from the originality doctrine in ''[[CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada]]''.  Under the CCH ruling, someone may assert protection in a database where the facts are themselves not copied from another source. For example, a person may assert protection in a collection of her own recipes, but she may not assert protection in a database of facts about persons and their ancestry compiled from census records.

In Australia, the Federal Court decision of [[Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems|''Desktop Marketing Systems v Telstra '']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|112|2002|litigants=Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Limited |link=Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems |date=15 May 2002 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed the UK approach in ''[[Walter v Lane]]'' and ruled that copyright law did, in fact, follow the "sweat of the brow" doctrine.  However, ''Desktop v Telstra'' held, as did ''CCH Canadian'', that collections of facts must not be copied from other sources to be eligible for protection. In 2010, the Telstra decision was overturned in a ruling by Justice Gordon in ''[[Telstra v Phone Directories]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|44|2010|litigants=Telstra Corporation Ltd v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd |link=Telstra v Phone Directories |date=8 February 2010 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the decision of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] in [[Australian Digital Alliance#IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009)|IceTV v Nine Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|2009|litigants=IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd |link=Australian Digital Alliance#IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009) |parallelcite=(2009) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 458 |date=22 April 2009 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with treaties==
Congress has been considering whether to implement a [[treaty]] negotiated at the [[World Trade Organization]].  Part of the [[Uruguay Round|Uruguay Round Agreement]] resulted in text which states, in Part II, Section 1, Article 10:

{{quote|Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.}}

The text mirrors that of Article 2(5) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which applies to "collections of literary or artistic works".

This treaty provision is broadly in line with the [[United States Copyright Act]] and the Act's [[case law]], which protects compilations of data whose "selection and arrangement" is sufficiently original. ''See'' {{usc|17|101}} ("compilation" as defined by the [[United States Copyright Act]] includes compilations of data). The standard for such originality is fairly low; for example, business listings have been found to meet this standard when deciding which companies should be listed and categorizing those companies required some kind of expert judgment. ''See Key Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chinatown Today Pub. Enters.'', 945 F.2d 509 (2d Cir. 1991) (applying ''Feist''). As such, implementation of this treaty would not overrule ''Feist''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8303">'''Geoffrey Bennington''' (born 1956) is Asa Griggs Candler Professor of [[French language|French]] and Professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Emory University]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]], and Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref name="egs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/geoffrey-bennington/biography/ | title=Geoffrey Bennington Faculty Page at European Graduate School (Biography and bibliography) | publisher=[[European Graduate School]] | author= | accessdate=2010-11-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095834/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/geoffrey-bennington/biography/ | archivedate=2010-11-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a member of the [[International College of Philosophy]] in [[Paris]]. He is a [[literary critic]] and [[philosopher]], best known as an expert on [[deconstruction]] and the works of [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. Bennington has translated many of Derrida's works into English.

==Education==
Bennington received his B.A., M.A., and D.Phil. from [[Oxford University]].

==Teaching positions==
He took up a teaching appointment at the [[University of Sussex at Brighton]], where he created an M.A. program in Modern French Thought and twice served as chair of the French department.  Since arriving at Emory in 2001, he has chaired both the French and the Comparative Literature Departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2001/November/er.Nov5/11_05_01distinguished.html Emory announcement of appointment] 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
He co-wrote the book ''Jacques Derrida'' with Derrida.  Bennington's contribution, "Derridabase", is an attempt to provide a comprehensive explication of Derrida's work.  "Derridabase" appears on the upper two-thirds of the book's pages, while Derrida's contribution, "Circumfession", is written on the lower third of each page.  Derrida's "Circumfession" is, among other things, intended to show how Derrida's work exceeds Bennington's explication: by introducing details about his own circumcision and its possible meanings Derrida shows the impossibility of such a regulated database of his writings.  Many of Bennington's essays on Derrida collected in ''Legislations, Interrupting Derrida'', and ''Not Half No End'', have criticized explanations of Derrida's work attempted by other scholars.  Bennington has also written two monographs on Lyotard, ''Writing the Event'' and ''Late Lyotard'', and has also written extensively on Rousseau and Kant, developing original accounts of the "paradox of the legislator" in the former and "interrupted teleology" in the latter.  He is currently writing a deconstructive account of political philosophy.

He has translated a number of works by Derrida and others, and is General Editor (with [[Peggy Kamuf]]) of the English translations of Derrida's posthumously published [http://derridaseminars.org seminars].

He has at times tried to engage members of the British press hostile to Derrida's work and has also attempted to explicate the relationship between deconstruction and [[analytic philosophy]], which has generally had difficulties receiving work by Derrida and others.

'''Hamed Abdel-Samad''' ({{lang-ar|حامد عبد الصمد}}, ''Ḥāmid ʿAbd aṣ-Ṣamad'', {{IPA-arz|ˈħæːmed ʕæbdesˈsˤɑmɑd|IPA}}; born in 1972) is a [[Germany|German]]-Egyptian [[Political science|political scientist]] and [[author]].

== Life ==

Abdel-Samad was born as the third of five children, the son of a Muslim Sunni [[Imam]].&lt;ref Name="taz20090908"&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/leben/buch/artikel/1/ich-bin-zum-wissen-konvertiert/ Ich bin zum Wissen konvertiert (I converted to knowledge)], [[tageszeitung]], 8 september 2009, accessed on 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel-Samad came to Germany in 1995 at the age of 23. He soon married an 18 years older, "rebellious, left-wing teacher with a penchant for mysticism." Abdel-Samad studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]], English and [[French language|French]] in Cairo&lt;ref&gt;[[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]]:[http://www.swr.de/swr1/bw/programm/leute/-/id=1895042/nid=1895042/did=5281022/1e3o8kj/index.html Der Ägypter und die erlittene Gewalt:Hamed Abdel-Samad (The Egyptian and the violence suffered:Hamed Abdel-Samad)], retrieved on December 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as political science in Augsburg. He worked as a scholar in Erfurt and Braunschweig. In Japan, where he was involved with eastern spirituality, he met his second wife. He taught and conducted research until the end of 2009 at the Institute for Jewish History and Culture at the [[University of Munich]]; his dissertation topic was: ''Bild der Juden in ägyptischen Schulbüchern'' ("Image of the Jews in Egyptian textbooks”). Subsequently he decided to become a full-time professional writer.

A member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in his university days, a stay in a summer camp run by them triggered doubts, causing him to become skeptical, and finally become an atheist.

On Sunday 24 November 2013, Egyptian news websites (citing his brother Mahmoud) reported that Hamed Abdel-Samad had been kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-author-abdel-samad-resurfaces-in-egypt-after-kidnap-fears/a-17256338|title=German author Abdel-Samad resurfaces in Egypt after kidnap fears|work=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/361524|title=الوطن - اختطاف الكاتب حامد عبدالصمد.. وشقيقه يتهم قيادات سلفية بعد إهدارهم دمه|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then reported that he resurfaced on Wednesday 27 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/347653|title="الداخلية": عودة الروائي حامد عبدالصمد بعد اختطافه لمدة 3 أيام من قبل مجهولين|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother denied that he had been kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawabhnews.com/576545|title=البوابة نيوز: والدة حامد عبد الصمد: ابني لم يتعرض للاختطاف|work=البوابة نيوز}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work  ==

Abdel-Samad became known to the German public through his book ''Mein Abschied vom Himmel''  (''My Farewell from Heaven'') (2009). Abdel-Samad said that the book was neither an attack on his culture, nor a call to abandon the Muslim faith. Rather, he just wanted to understand the contradictions of his own life.&lt;ref name="taz20090908"/&gt; Following the book’s publication in Egypt, a group issued a [[fatwa]] threatening Abdel-Samad and he was put under police protection.&lt;ref name="taz20090908"/&gt;

Abdel-Samad calls for an "Islam light" in Europe without [[shari'a]], [[jihad]], gender apartheid, [[proselytism]] and “entitlement mentality”.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed Abdel-Samad: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/kommentare/und-es-gibt-ihn-doch-den-islam/1658256.html Und es gibt ihn doch – den Islam! (And yet there is such a thing – Islam!)]- [[Tagesspiegel]] of 5 Jan. 2010, retrieved on December 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the German political establishment for appeasing Islam, while ignoring fears about Islam. According to Abdel-Samad, this behavior created resentment in the German population.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed Abdel-Samad. [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/andere-meinung/die-muslime-sind-zu-empfindlich/1836668.html Die Muslime sind zu empfindlich (The Muslims are too sensitive)], [[Tagesspiegel]], 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdel-Samad participated in the 2nd German Islam Conference 2010-2013 held at the invitation of the German Federal Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]].

In autumn 2010, Abdel-Samad took the journalist [[Henryk M. Broder]] on a 30,000&amp;nbsp;km-long road trip through Germany for a five-part TV series.

In an interview aired on the Salafi Islamist Egyptian channel [[Al-Hafez]] on June 7, 2013 (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), hardline Egyptian cleric and [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] professor Mahmoud Shaaban&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/02/2013271927215636.html Security hiked for Egypt opposition], Aljazeera, February 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/07/us-egypt-islamists-idUSBRE9160R020130207 Egypt secures liberals' homes after calls for their death] by Alexander Dziadosz, [[Reuters]], Feb 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/64712/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-death-threats-sheikh-released-on-bail.aspx Egyptian 'death threats' sheikh released on bail], Ahram Online, Wednesday, February 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; accused Abdel-Samad of committing "heresy" and stated that "he must be killed for being a heretic... if he refuses to recant." Shaaban also stated that "after he has been confronted with the evidence, his killing is permitted if the [Egyptian] government does not do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3892.htm Egyptian Cleric Mahmoud Shaaban Issues Fatwa: Egyptian-German Scholar Should Be Killed for Heresy], MEMRI, clip 3892 (transcript), (video clip [http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/3892.htm available here]), June 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2015, he launched the show ''Ṣundūq al-Islām'' ("Box of Islam") on his official [[YouTube]] channel, Hamed.TV, which as of 20 October 2018 had more than 100,000 subscribers and more than 21 million video views.&lt;ref&gt;[https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCnTJcc901wCa5vZQQot8fCw/monthly Hamed.TV] profile on SocialBlade.com&lt;/ref&gt; The channel is almost entirely in Arabic, containing but one German-language video.

In 2016, he was questioned by the Berlin police for alleged [[sedition]]. This was criticized as an attack on free speech by him and German-Israeli historian [[Michael Wolffsohn]] in the German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article153357890/Der-Islamkritiker-als-Volksverhetzer.html|title=Der Islamkritiker als Volksverhetzer?|last=Wolffsohn|first=Michael|date=2016-03-16|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HistoryCener from Strip District.JPG|left|thumb|300px|View of the Senator John Heinz History Center from Pittsburgh's Strip District]]The History Center features the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum and the Library and Archives, and includes six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania.  Though it was originally established in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/life/seen/2014/11/24/1879-Founders-Dinner-held-at-Heinz-History-Center/stories/201411230222 |title=1879 Founders dinner held at Heinz History Center |newspaper=Post-Gazette |date=November 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VG75xbuu?url=http://www.post-gazette.com/life/seen/2014/11/24/1879-Founders-Dinner-held-at-Heinz-History-Center/stories/201411230222 |archivedate=January 1, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania]] opened its current location in the historic Strip District along the Allegheny River in 1996. It is named for [[H. John Heinz III]], the late US Senator from Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

The century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted by the Pittsburgh office of the architecture firm of [[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]], who did the design and oversaw construction. The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is an exhibit in its own right. The History Center also features the following permanent exhibitions:

* ''Pittsburgh: A Tradition of Innovation'' celebrates 250 years of Western Pennsylvania's significant contributions to the world, from Dr. [[Jonas Salk]]'s discovery of the polio vaccine to the invention of the Big Mac.
* ''Senator John Heinz: A Western Pennsylvania Legacy'' details the life and legacy of one of Pittsburgh's most beloved philanthropists and politicians.
* Pittsburgh's reign as America's "glass city" is showcased in ''Glass: Shattering Notions''.
* ''Heinz 57'' chronicles the history of the H.J. Heinz Company.
* The ''Special Collections'' Gallery houses more than 3,000 artifacts illustrating the rich ethnic history and corporate fabric of the Pittsburgh region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/exhibits/special-collections|title=Special Collections Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, this was the home to a lot of artifacts from [[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= August 31, 2017|title= Pittsburgh's oldest building, Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, and Ketchup from Pickles!|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpYnqcDnqXQ|access-date= May 25, 2018|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= [[YouTube]]|time= 12:07 to 22:52|location= |publisher= JustinScarred|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those items are still there today. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/exhibits/mister-rogers-neighborhood|title=Mister Rogers' Neighborhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum's history began in 1879, with the formation of a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. In 1884 it changed its name to the [[Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania]] (HSWP) and has been operating continuously since then. It is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization.

HSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of [[steamboat]] navigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955 it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. In the early years, HSWP held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, it was granted a space for its archives at the new [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood. By 1914, it had its own building nearby. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip District. The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by an Inaugural Gala there on April 26, 1996 for 900 guests.

==Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the History Center==
Located in the Smithsonian wing of the Senator John Heinz History Center, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum spans {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space over two floors. The "museum within a museum" captures the Pittsburgh region's evolution and influence as a sports leader over more than a century, from amateur to pro and across the spectrum of sports. The Sports Museum captures tales of Pittsburgh sports through hundreds of artifacts, more than 70 hands-on interactive exhibits, and 20 audio-visual programs.

Select artifacts include [[Franco Harris]]' "[[Immaculate Reception]]" shoes; [[Mario Lemieux]]'s hockey skates; [[Satchel Paige]]'s baseball glove; the pitching rubber from the 1960 World Series; [[Billy Conn]]'s gloves and light heavyweight champion belt; [[Arnold Palmer]]'s sweater and golf bag; [[Chip Ganassi]]'s 2000 Indy 500-winning race car; the "Ultimate Steelers Fan's Car;" the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]] women swimmers [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals from the 1920s and 1930s; and hundreds of [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] [[baseball cards]].

==Detre Library &amp; Archives at the History Center==
The History Center's Detre Library &amp; Archives is an extensive scholarly resource documenting 250 years of life in Western Pennsylvania. The collection includes books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, atlases, newspapers, films, recordings and other memorabilia.

==Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village==
The History Center also operates [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]], a world-renowned [[archaeological]] site south of Pittsburgh near [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]'s [[Avella, Pennsylvania|Avella]] community.

The Rockshelter is the oldest site of human habitation in North America, with evidence of man living there for nearly 16,000 years.  The site was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2005.

Adjacent to the Rockshelter is the historic village. The History Center operates this as a living museum, with re-enactors recreating rural life in the 19th century.

==Fort Pitt Museum==
The History Center also operates the Fort Pitt Museum, a two-floor, {{convert|12000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} museum that tells the story of Western Pennsylvania’s pivotal role during the [[French and Indian War]], the [[American Revolution]], and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh.

'''John Dobrée Pascoe''' (26 September 1908 – 20 October 1972) was a New Zealand [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]], photographer, writer, editor, historian and archivist.

==Early life==
Pascoe was born in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand in 1908; his twin brother was [[Paul Pascoe|Paul]], who would later become a notable architect. John Pascoe received his education at [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] School and [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College]]. He joined his father's law firm and studied the subject, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="DNZB Pascoe"&gt;{{DNZB|Phillips|Jock|5p15|John Dobrée Pascoe|23 April 2017||Jock Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Pascoe was bored with legal work, so he enquired with [[Joe Heenan]], the under-secretary for the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]], whether there were employment opportunities. Pascoe was put on a team working on the 1940 centennial publications, and he thus moved to [[Wellington]]. Pascoe was the founding secretary of the [[Heritage New Zealand|National Historic Places Trust]] in 1955. In 1960 he was controller of the Wildlife Branch.&lt;ref name="DNZB Pascoe" /&gt; As National Archivist, he convinced the government statistician to keep the [[1966 New Zealand census|1966 census]] forms for future research. Unlike most other countries, New Zealand had never kept its census forms, and upon Pascoe's initiative, the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976]] and [[1986 New Zealand census|1986]] forms were subsequently also kept and are in secure storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did you know?|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/info-about-the-census/intro-to-nz-census/history/did-you-know/historic-forms.aspx|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mountaineering==
Pascoe climbed extensively throughout the [[South Island]] of New Zealand conquering many previously unclimbed peaks. It is claimed he conquered over 100 peaks, of which some 23 were previously unclimbed. For his work on New Zealand mountaineering, literature, mapping and photography, he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

Pascoe never climbed without his camera and notebook, records from which contributed to a stream of publications.

'''''Johnston v Leal'''''&lt;ref&gt;1980 (3) SA 927 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African contract law]], heard in the Appellate Division on 22 February [[1980 in South Africa|1980]], by Jansen JA, Corbett JA, Miller JA, Van Winsen AJA and Botha AJA, with judgment handed down on 30 May. The case is valuable, ''inter alia'', for its exposition of the [[parole evidence rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis ''et al'' 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15824">A '''letter of recommendation''' or '''recommendation letter''', also known as a '''letter of reference''', '''reference letter''' or simply '''reference''', is a document in which the writer assesses the qualities, characteristics, and capabilities of the person being recommended in terms of that individual's ability to perform a particular task or function. Letters of recommendation are typically related to [[employment]] (such a letter may also be called an '''employment reference''' or '''job reference'''), [[University and college admission|admission to institutions of higher education]], or [[scholarship]] eligibility. Recommendation letters are usually specifically requested to be written about someone, and are therefore addressed to a particular requester (such as a new employer, university admissions officer, etc.), although they may also be issued to the person being recommended without specifying an addressee.

References may also be required of companies seeking to win contracts, particularly in the fields of engineering, consultancy, industry and construction, and with regard to [[public procurement]] and [[tender offer|tenders]]. Reference letters for organizations are used to assess its ability to deliver the required level of service.

Some applications, such as professional schools give applicants the choice to waive their right to view their letters or not. Usually, applicants are encouraged to waive their rights because if they do not, it is a sign they are not confident in their recommenders.

== Referee ==

The person providing a reference is called a '''referee'''. An employment reference letter is usually written by a former employer or manager, but references can also be requested from co-workers, customers and vendors.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Alison|title=References for employment|url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/referencetips.htm|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers and professors often supply references for students who have taken their classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requesting Letters of Recommendation|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~psy301/lettersrec.html|website=PSY 301|publisher=California State University Long Beach|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reference letters for organizations are usually supplied by parties to which the company has provided similar services in the past. 

== Content ==
The employment reference letter can cover topics such as:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Häusermann: ''Arbeitszeugnisse – wahr, klar und fair. Tipps und Anregungen für verantwortungsbewusste Arbeitgeber''. 6. Auflage. Spektramedia, Zürich 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-908244-08-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the employee's tasks and responsibilities
* the duration of employment or tasks/ responsibilities
* the position relative to the author of the reference letter
* the employee's abilities, knowledge, creativity, intelligence
* the employee's qualifications (foreign languages, special skills)
* the employee's social attitude
* the employee's power of rapport
* reason(s) of employment termination
* some text with the actual recommendation itself (e.g. 'I unequivocally recommend ... [name] as a ... [function/ role] and would be happy to hire him/ her again').

== Language ==
In some countries, elements of performance are evaluated using established forms of expression, sometimes [[euphemism|euphemistic]]. For example, in the German-language ''Arbeitszeugnis'', the following terms are frequently used:&lt;ref&gt;Günter Huber, Waltraud Müller: ''Das Arbeitszeugnis in Recht und Praxis. Rechtliche Grundlagen, Musterzeugnisse, Textbausteine, Zeugnisanalyse''. 12. Auflage. Haufe, Freiburg/Breisgau, Berlin, Planegg bei München, Würzburg 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-448-09322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excellent = ''stets zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit erledigt'' (always done to our complete satisfaction)
* Good = ''stets zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit'' (always to our full satisfaction)
* Satisfactory = ''zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit'' (to our full satisfaction)
* Adequate = ''zu unserer Zufriedenheit'' (to our satisfaction)
* Poor = ''hat sich bemüht, den Anforderungen gerecht zu werden'' (has endeavored to meet the demands)

This language established itself as an unwritten code in the employment world. Its purpose was to give even weakly performing employees a letter of recommendation that does not sound negative. However, the euphemistically glazed-over descriptions are now codified and generally known, so that the original cryptic intent is no longer served. &lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Knobbe, Mario Leis, Karsten Umnuß: ''Arbeitszeugnisse: Textbausteine und Tätigkeitsbeschreibungen'' (dt./engl.). 5. Auflage. Haufe, Freiburg/Breisgau, Berlin, Planegg bei München, Würzburg 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-448-10118-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is still standard to use this codified language.

== Checking of references ==
Most potential employers will contact referees to obtain references before offering a job to a new employee.  A  survey by the [[Society for Human Resource Management]] (SHRM) found that eight out of ten resource professionals said they regularly conduct reference checks for professional (89%), executive (85%), administrative (84%) and technical (81%) positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Alison|title=References - Will They or Won't They?|url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/gettingreferences/a/references.htm|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates are advised to ensure that they provide a suitable list of referees to their new prospective employer or institution, and to contact those referees to ensure that they are able and willing to provide a suitable reference. In some cases employers will contact a candidate's former company for a reference even if no contact is supplied by the candidate.

==Duty to provide a reference==

Some employers may not be willing to provide reference letters because they may be worried about potential lawsuits.

While there is no [[common law]] duty to provide a reference,&lt;ref&gt;''Lawton v BOC Transhield Ltd'', [1987] 2 All ER 608&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has held that a refusal to do so may constitute "conduct that is [[Injustice|unfair]] or is in [[bad faith]]" with respect to a [[wrongful dismissal]], and thus "indicative of the type of conduct that ought to merit compensation by way of an addition to the [[notice period]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd|link=Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd|year=1997|court=scc|num=332|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 96-101|parallelcite=[1997] 3 SCR 701|date=1997-10-30|courtname=auto|juris=}}, subsequently affirmed in {{cite CanLII|litigants=Honda Canada Inc v Keays|link=Honda Canada Inc v Keays|year=2008|court=scc|num=39|pinpoint=par. 57|parallelcite=[2008] 2 SCR 362|date=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[duty of care]] to ensure that, where one is provided, it is accurate and fair and not give a misleading impression,&lt;ref name="Eversheds2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eversheds.com/global/en/what/articles/index.page?ArticleID=en/Employment_and_labour_law/Regulatory_references_are_you_ready|title= Regulatory references: are you ready?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 28 January 2016|website= |publisher= [[Eversheds]]|access-date= 13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as held by the [[House of Lords]] in ''[[Spring v Guardian Assurance plc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Spring v Guardian Assurance plc|link=Spring v Guardian Assurance plc|court=UKHL|year=1994|num=7|parallelcite=[1995] 2 AC 296|date=7 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an employer goes beyond what a reference should contain, or if it gives inaccurate or misleading information, liability may arise in the areas of [[breach of statutory duty]], [[negligent misstatement]], [[Tort of deceit|deceit]], [[defamation]] or [[malicious falsehood]].&lt;ref name="Eversheds2016"/&gt; It does not matter what form the reference might take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Byrnell v British Telecommunications &amp; Anor |link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2009|num=727|para=29, 32|parallelcite=|date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, references received by an employer from another person or organization can be disclosed to the person about whom they are written under the subject access provisions of the [[Data Protection Act 1998]], but certain confidentiality considerations apply as to the identity of the person giving the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2775/references_v1_final.pdf|title= Data Protection Good Practice Note: Subject access and employment references |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 16 November 2005|website= |publisher= [[Information Commissioner's Office]]|access-date= 14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, together with the duty of care under ''Spring'', many organizations have issued guidance as to [[best practice]] to be undertaken by reference providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.stir.ac.uk/media/services/registry/planning/legalcompliance/ReferencesAdvisoryNote.pdf|title= Data Classification: Issuing of Staff and Student References Advisory Note|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 2015|website= stir.ac.uk|publisher= [[University of Stirling]]|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sath.nhs.uk/Library/Documents/HR/Policies/HR70%20Employment%20References%20v1.pdf|title= Human Resources Policy No. HR70: Employment References|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 2010|website= sath.nhs.uk|publisher= [[Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust]]|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duty of care has also been held to apply in non-reference situations, as noted in 2011 in '' McKie v Swindon College''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Salter|first= Michael|last2= Bryden|first2= Chris|date= 24 June 2011|title= Gone but not forgotten|url= http://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/nlj/content/gone-not-forgotten|journal= [[New Law Journal]]|publisher= |volume= 161|issue= 7471|pages= |doi= }}, discussing {{cite BAILII|litigants=McKie v Swindon College|link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2011|num=469|parallelcite=|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] has held that "a reference must not give an unfair or misleading impression overall, even if its discrete components are factually correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Bartholomew v London Borough Of Hackney &amp; Anor |link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1998|num=1604|parallelcite=|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while a reference must be accurate and fair, it is not necessary to report all material facts concerning an individual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Cox v Sun Alliance Life Ltd|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=649|parallelcite=|date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be argued that, if an agreed reference arising from a [[settlement agreement]] is misleadingly incomplete, the employer can be sued by a subsequent employer for breaching its duty of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Smith|first1= Ian|last2= Baker|first2= Aaron|date= 2015|title= Smith &amp; Wood's Employment Law|edition=12th|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=rpFcCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=jvZ2eKiOVY&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|page= 163|isbn=978-0-19-872735-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]], in an [[unfair dismissal]] case, ruled that, in preparing a reference, it was not reasonable to provide details of complaints against an employee of which the employee was not aware.&lt;ref&gt;''TSB Bank Plc v Harris'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/1999/1145_97_0112.html &amp;#91;1999&amp;#93; UKEAT 1145_97_0112] (1 December 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal has further held that, if an employee leaves when an investigation is ongoing but has not been concluded, or where issues arise after an employee leaves that have not been investigated, employers can disclose this information but should do so in a measured and fair way, which will be particularly important if to omit this information would mean providing a misleading reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Jackson v Liverpool City Council |link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2011|num=1068|parallelcite=|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] are issuing rules that will require the furnishing of references, before any approval or certification may be given by them, as well as specifying the information that they must contain.&lt;ref name="Eversheds2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fca.org.uk/news/cp15-31-regulatory-references|title= CP15/31: Strengthening accountability in banking and insurance: regulatory references|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 6 October 2015|website= |publisher= [[Financial Conduct Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/publications/cp/2015/cp3615.aspx#|title= Strengthening accountability in banking and insurance: regulatory references - CP36/15|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 6 October 2015|website= |publisher= [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mainz Anonymous''''' or ''The Narrative of the Old Persecutions'' is an account of the [[First Crusade]] of 1096 written soon thereafter by an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[Jew]]ish author.

==Composition==

The work is written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Its author is unknown and it deals primarily with the Crusaders' actions in [[Mainz]]; hence the name commonly applied to it. However, it also deals with the [[ShUM-cities]] in the [[Rhineland]], specifically [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. It is not entirely [[Fact|accurate]]: it has a definite Jewish [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] and fictionalizes [[anecdote]]s occasionally to make a point. It also includes occasional anguished [[supplication]]s to [[God]].

'''Mildred Bliss''' (August 5, 1915 – February 18, 1989), better known by the [[ring name]] '''Mildred Burke''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].

Burke is a member of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a [[WWE Hall of Fame#Legacy inductees|Legacy inductee]], [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] as well as the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame|Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;&lt;ref name=inductee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/wohof.htm|title=Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame Inductees|accessdate=May 5, 2007|publisher=Wrestling Information Archive|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213801/http://100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/wohof.htm|archivedate=October 11, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her heyday lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, when she held the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] for almost twenty years. Burke started out in 1935, wrestling men at carnivals. She was managed by her second husband, promoter [[Billy Wolfe]].&lt;ref name=owow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/mildred-burke.html|title=Mildred Burke Online World of Wrestling Profile|accessdate=May 5, 2007|publisher=onlineworldofwrestling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Mildred Burke, aged 15, began to work as a waitress on the [[Zuni Indian Reservation]] in [[Gallup, New Mexico]]. She lived there for three years, before leaving for [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] after agreeing to marry her boyfriend. He took her to a professional wrestling event, which sparked her interest in the sport. Burke, who was pregnant at the time, later persevered.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
[[File:Mildredburke.jpg|thumb|Burke in 1937]]
Prior to wrestling, she was an office stenographer by day, had outstanding muscle development, and was hoping to become a professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=p290&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 290, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, [[Billy Wolfe]] was training aspiring [[Women's professional wrestling|women professional wrestlers]]. At first, Wolfe did not want to train Burke and instructed a male wrestler to [[body slam]] her, so she would stop asking Wolfe to train her. Burke, however, performed a body slam on the man instead, which resulted in Wolfe agreeing to train her.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe tutored her and realized that she was the prospect for which he was waiting. The close proximity of their training resulted in a relationship and ultimately marriage. Changing her name to Mildred Burke, she defeated Clara Mortenson for the [[Women's World Championship]] in January 1937.&lt;ref name=p290/&gt;

In the 1930s, Burke wrestled over 200 men, but only lost to one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the riches that her husband earned as a [[Professional wrestling promoter|promoter]] of women grapplers, there was a dark side to their marriage. On the road, Wolfe stood as a father figure to the women he trained and managed, but he also earned reputation as a womanizer. Their marriage was not monogamous, as Wolfe enjoyed the companionship of women with whom he traveled.&lt;ref name=p291&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 291, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divorce from Billy Wolfe ===
Tensions emanated from the extramarital activity and in 1952, Wolfe and Burke went their own ways. Burke found herself frozen out of professional wrestling among all [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) channels.&lt;ref name=p291/&gt; Desperate, Burke decided to consult [[Jack Pfefer]] for help. The NWA attempted to reconcile the couple, but the only agreed upon solution was that one would sell out to the other. Burke volunteered to sell to Wolfe for Burke's Attractions, Inc. went into bankruptcy and into the hands of receiver James Hoff of Columbus. Eight months later, Hoff named Wolfe as administrator and was approved by [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] Judge William Bryant.&lt;ref name=p291/&gt; A memorandum dated August 20, 1953, was circulated by Wolfe, in which he boldly announced that he was the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]] for Burke and her [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] of 27 wrestlers. The claim was disputed by Burke on August 26, 1953, by stating that the issue would be settled in the courts. It was emphasized that her contract prohibited Wolfe from competing in wrestling and was in breach of the binding agreement.&lt;ref name=p291/&gt; She consulted with [[Leroy McGuirk]] and hoped that she would be vindicated by the NWA at their September 1953 meeting in Chicago.&lt;ref name=p291/&gt;

=== Dealings with the NWA ===
Burke faced many obstacles, as women were banned from yearly NWA conferences, and this diminished the importance of women in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=p292&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 292, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the discrimination was evident during the dispute with Wolfe. Burke sat in the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel in [[Chicago]] as male dignitaries argued behind closed doors about her future. Wolfe's voice was the only one heard by the membership. In the end, the NWA declined to recognize women's wrestling after the meeting, Wolfe regained his stake, but many women were loyal to Burke and refused to wrestle for Wolfe.

=== Genuine animosity ===
In a letter to NWA members on November 4, 1953, Burke refuted Wolfe's claim that she would wrestle only one woman grappler.&lt;ref name=p292/&gt; She claimed that there were twelve grapplers with whom she would work. Wolfe, however, used his influence to get her frozen from NWA members and her promising run in the Southeast with [[Cowboy Luttrall]] and [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]] in 1954 fizzled.&lt;ref name=p292/&gt;

Emotionally exhausted, Burke wrestled Wolfe's daughter-in-law [[June Byers]] and there was genuine [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] between the two. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name=p292/&gt; It was a grudge match that quickly became a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] fight, due to genuine enmity between the two women.&lt;ref&gt;Molinaro, John F.: ''Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', page 177, Winding Stair Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe had the local commission in his corner and slid a friendly referee into the match. Burke later admitted that she had given up the [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] first fall with the intention of competing stronger in the second.&lt;ref name=p292/&gt; The second fall never had a finish. Officials called the match, and Burke left the ring believing that her title was safe because she had not lost two falls. The result was that many in the press stated that Byers had defeated her and the importance of Burke's championship began to diminish.&lt;ref name=p292/&gt;

=== Legacy ===
[[File:Mildred Burke poster.jpg|thumb|upright|A Jacksonville, Florida poster advertises Burke]]
In the early 1950s, Burke started the [[World Women's Wrestling Association]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She returned to her promotion after her match with Byers, still recognizing herself as the World Women's Champion even after the NWA had recognized rival June Byers as champion since then, and continued to defend it. She [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#V|vacated]] the title in 1956, when she retired from professional wrestling. In 1970, the title was revived by [[All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling]] (AJW) as their top prize.

After the tensions with Wolfe and the NWA, Burke traveled with an escort for the rest of her career as a protective measure. She started International Women's Wrestlers Inc. with Bill Newman and the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] had offices in New York City, San Francisco and [[Sydney, Australia]].&lt;ref name=p293&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 293, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These offices served in the dual capacity of booking offices and training centers.

Her efforts to spread women's wrestling internationally reached Japan and brought about the [[World Wide Women's Wrestling Association]] (WWWA).

In her later years, Burke ran a women's wrestling school in [[Encino, California]].&lt;ref name="wrestling-titles.com"&gt;[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/personalities/burke_mildred/death.html MILDRED BURKE, 73, DIES AFTER STROKE – February 14, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Among her students was Canadian [[Rhonda Sing]], who went on to fame as [[WWWA World Championship|WWWA World Champion]], Monster Ripper, and [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWF Women's Champion]] Bertha Faye.

Burke died from a [[stroke]] on February 18, 1989 in Northridge, California,&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; and was buried at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

In 2002, she was posthumously inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="p293" /&gt;

On April 2, 2016, Burke was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a [[WWE Hall of Fame#Legacy inductees|"Legacy" member]].

The '''National Archives of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Arsip Nasional Republik Indonesia}}, ANRI) is the non-departmental government institution of [[Indonesia]] responsible for maintaining a central [[archive]]. It holds the largest archive collection related to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). In 2003, Indonesia introduced a joint submission to the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] with the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], and [[Sri Lanka]] for their archival collections related to the VOC. The National Archives collection traces its origins to the work of [[Jacob Anne van der Chijs]], who was appointed the first archivist of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in 1892 by the colonial government.

== History ==
[[File:National Archives of Indonesia (new location).jpg|thumb|New complex in [[South Jakarta]]]]
The task of archive management in the early period of Dutch presence in Indonesia fell upon the General Secretariat of the colonial government. Archive material received little attention during this period and was often unmaintained, resulting in accumulation of material and insect damage. During the [[interregnum]] period (1811–1816) arising from [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British took over administration of the Dutch East Indies. Archive maintenance fell upon the hands of the librarian of the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences]]. On 19 February 1819, the archive was returned to the management of the General Secretariat and remained within its jurisdiction until 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balk|van Dijk|Kortlang|2007|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, [[Jacob Anne van der Chijs]] and [[Henry David Levyssohn Norman]] were commissioned to investigate the existing archives. Over the next several years, 15 chests of archive material were transported to the [[Nationaal Archief]] in the Netherlands. Plans to send all material overseas were blocked by the Batavian Society, and a commission was charged in 1872 to determine which materials important enough to be kept would be transferred to the Society. Van der Chijs was recommissioned in 1880 to create the archive's first [[collection catalog]], which was eventually published in two years later. The collection contained 18,387 items, and work began to order and number them definitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balk|van Dijk|Kortlang|2007|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Chijs was appointed the first archivist of the Indies on 28 January 1892 through a government decree. Although van der Chijs regarded his work as provisional, his successors did not continue the work to document the VOC archives. In 1925, the collection was moved to the former country estate of [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies|Governor-General]] [[Reynier de Klerck]], where it remained undamaged during the period of [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]]. When the Dutch transferred sovereignty of the Indies to Indonesia in 1949, the collections were handed to the current National Archives. They were finally moved to the new location of the National Archives in 1975.&lt;ref name="BDK 143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balk|van Dijk|Kortlang|2007|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
Indonesia holds the largest archive collection related to the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balk|van Dijk|Kortlang|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with documents dating between 1612 and 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Boven|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection encompasses almost half of the VOC archives worldwide with a total of 15,000 entries on 1,800 meters of shelf space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Boven|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a joint nomination to include the combined archives of the Dutch East India Company in the [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] with the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], and [[Sri Lanka]] was submitted to and approved by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Archives of the Dutch East India Company | url = http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21303&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | accessdate = 8 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Notsnitsa''' in [[Slavic mythology]], is a [[nightmare]] spirit that also goes by the name kriksy, plaksy, plachky, plaksivicy, kriksy-varaksy, kriksy-plaksy, night hag, night maiden. She is referred to as '''Načnica''' in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] , '''Nocnica''' or '''Płaczka''' in [[Polish language|Polish]], '''горска майка''' (gorska majka), '''ношно''' (nošno) in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], '''Шумска маjка''' (Šumska majka), '''бабице''' (babice), '''ноћнице''' (noćnice) in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], '''mrake''', '''vidine''' in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], '''nočnine''', '''mračnine''' in [[Slovene language|Slovene]].

The Notsnitsa is also present in [[Russian folklore|Russian]] and Slovak folklore. She is known to torment children at night, and a stone with a hole in the center is said to be a protection from the Nocnitsa. Mothers in some regions will place a knife in their children’s cradles or draw a circle around the cradles with a knife for protection. This is possibly based on the belief that supernatural beings cannot touch iron.
In the Roman tradition,an incubus is a demon in male form who, according to mythological and legendary traditions, lies upon sleeping women, in order to engage in sexual activity with them. Its female counterpart is a succubus. Salacious tales of incubi and succubi have been told for many centuries in traditional societies. Some traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, mental state, or even death.

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

The Nocnitsa is known to sit on one’s chest, drawing "life energy". Because of this, many refer to Nocnitsa as a type of vampire. The Nocnitsa will often continue visiting. According to some folklore, night hags visit when one sleeps on one’s back, with the hands on the chest (a position allegedly called "sleeping with the dead"). According to some folklore, night hags are made of shadow. She might also have a horrible screeching voice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} She might allegedly also smell of the moss and dirt from her forest of origin.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Nocnitsa is almost certainly linked to the common apparition seen during the [[hypnagogic state]] of [[sleep]].

{{main|Passing (sociology)}}
Racial '''passing''' occurs when a person classified as a member of one [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] group is also accepted as a member of a different racial group. The term was used especially in the [[United States]] to describe a [[person of color]] or [[Multiracial American|multiracial ancestry]] assimilating into the [[White American|white majority]] during times when legal and social conventions of [[hypodescent]] classified the person as a minority, subject to [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and discrimination.

==In the United States==
===Passing for white===
In 1857, fifteen-year-old runaway slave Jane Morrison, blonde and blue-eyed, went to court in Louisiana to win her freedom in the case ''[[Morrison v. White]]''. Instances such as late 19th-century [[Jim Crow]] state laws establishing segregation in public facilities, and early 20th-century state laws establishing the "[[one-drop rule]]" for racial classification (as in Virginia in 1924), were examples of European Americans attempting to impose regulations of [[hypodescent]]. Then, someone who identified by appearance and majority ancestry might be described as "passing" for Caucasian. In [[Louisiana]], [[people of color]] who passed as white were referred to as ''passe blanc''.

The [[civil rights movement|US civil rights]] leader [[Walter Francis White]] (who was blond-haired, blue-eyed, and very fair) was of mixed-race background, mostly European ancestry, as 27 of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents were white; the other five were classified as black and had been slaves. He grew up with his parents and family in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in the black community and identified with it. He served as the chief executive of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) from 1929 until his death in 1955. In the earlier stages of his career, he conducted investigations in the South, during which he sometimes passed as [[Whites|white]] to gather information more freely on [[lynching]]s and [[hate crime]]s, and to protect himself in socially hostile environments.

In the 20th century, ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' comics creator [[George Herriman]] was a [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] cartoonist born to [[mulatto]] parents, who claimed [[Greeks|Greek]] heritage throughout his adult life. The 20th-century writer and critic [[Anatole Broyard]] was a Louisiana Creole who chose to pass for white in his adult life in [[New York City]] and [[Connecticut]]. He wanted to create an independent writing life and not be classified as a black writer. In addition, he did not identify with northern urban black people, whose experiences had been much different from his as a child in New Orleans' Creole community. He married an American woman of European descent. His wife and many of his friends knew he was partly black in ancestry. His daughter Bliss Broyard did not find out until after her father's death. In 2007, she published a memoir that traced her exploration of her father's life and family mysteries entitled ''One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life: A Story of Race and Family Secrets''.

In 21st-century [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] discourse, the term "white-passing" refers to someone who identifies as a [[person of color]] but benefits from [[white privilege]] due to their appearance.

===Passing as indigenous Americans===
In a limited reversal of the usual pattern, some people of European ancestry have chosen to pass as members of other races.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valaskakis, Gail Guthrie.

To try to protect Native American artists from the claims of non-Native impersonators, the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]] was passed in the United States. It requires artists to be enrolled members of a [[state-recognized tribe|state]] or [[federally recognized tribe]] in order to claim to be a Native American artist.

The [[Native American and Indigenous Studies Association]]'s Statement on Indigenous Identity Fraud says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we believe in Indigenous self-determination as a value and goal, then questions of identity and integrity in its expression cannot be treated as merely a distraction from supposedly more important issues. Falsifying one’s identity or relationship to particular Indigenous peoples is an act of appropriation continuous with other forms of colonial violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAISA Statement on Indigenous Identity Fraud |url=http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=42a60b451fd1cbd5c894f6f2b&amp;id=b15fd225fc&amp;e=b7bb9ee7e4 |website=Native American and Indigenous Studies Association |accessdate=20 September 2015 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Passing as African American and other races===
Civil rights activist [[Rachel Dolezal]], then president of the Spokane chapter of the [[NAACP]], claimed in a February 2015 profile to have been born in a "Montana tepee" and have hunted for food with her family as a child "with bows and arrows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://easterneronline.com/35006/eagle-life/a-life-to-be-heard/ |title=A Life to be Heard |first=Shawntelle |last=Moncy |date=February 5, 2015 |work=[[The Easterner]] |accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She primarily identified as [[African American]] and had established herself as an activist in Spokane. In 2015 Dolezal's mother disputed her daughter's accounts, saying that the family's ancestry was Czech, Swedish, and German, with "faint traces" of Native American heritage. She also denied various claims made by her daughter about her life, including having lived in Africa when young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jun/12/naacp-presidents-claims-about-background-disputed/ |title=Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal's claims about background disputed |first1=Kip |last1=Hill |first2=David |last2=Wasson |date=June 12, 2015 |work=The Spokesman-Review |accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolezal ultimately resigned from her position at the Spokane NAACP chapter.

New Zealand actors of [[Māori people|Māori]] descent working in the American film industry—such as [[Cliff Curtis]] and [[Temuera Morrison]]—are frequently called on to play Hispanic roles. Curtis has appeared as a Mexican or Latino characters in at least half a dozen feature films, among them ''[[Fracture (2007 film)|Fracture]]'', ''[[Colombiana]]'', ''[[Last Knights]]'', ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'', and ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]''.

===Creole culture in Louisiana===
A mixed-race Creole class developed in Louisiana before the United States purchased the territory. In the early years of the French and Spanish colony, men took enslaved African or Native American women as wives or mistresses. In the Latin culture, the wealthy men often had their mixed-race sons educated in Europe or trained in skilled trades. Gradually a third caste developed, made up of free people of color, or mixed-race Creoles. Creoles were often educated, and many became wealthy property owners. They also formed a community of [[artisans]] in New Orleans. Beautiful young Creole women often became the official mistresses of white French colonists, who provided financial settlements for them and their children in a system known as ''[[plaçage]]''. This enabled them to have their children educated.

===Jefferson descendants===

There were many generations of mixed-race people in the American South. In the later 18th and 19th centuries, they were often the children of white planter fathers and enslaved women. Among the most famous were the multiracial slave children born to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Sally Hemings]] from their long relationship after he became a widower. Hemings was three-quarters white, as her mother was half-black and half-white. Betty Hemings was the daughter of a slave woman and an English sea captain; she became the longtime mistress of Jefferson's father-in-law John Wayles after he became a widower for the third time, and had several children with him. Sally was the half-sister of Jefferson's late wife Martha Wayles Jefferson.

In 1998, DNA studies showed that the descendants of Eston Hemings, Sally's youngest son, were related to the Jefferson male line. Most historians, the [[National Genealogical Society]], and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation of Monticello believe that the weight of historical evidence suggests Jefferson was the father of Eston and all of Hemings' children (who were thus seven-eighths European by ancestry and legally white under Virginia law at the time). The historian [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 2010 for her work on the history of the Jeffersons and the Hemings families (which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and 15 other major awards), and for "changing the course of Jeffersonian scholarship" by showing how earlier historians had disregarded or discounted important evidence from slave testimonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.6241239/k.C7C4/Annette_GordonReed.htm "Annette Gordon-Reed"], MacArthur Foundation.

==Treatment in popular culture==

===Literature===
* [[Frank J. Webb]]'s 1857 novel, ''The Garies and Their Friends'', explores the choices in the racist antebellum north (Philadelphia) of three mixed-race characters who could pass for white: George Winston, who opts to leave the United States rather than be subjected to discriminatory laws; Emily Garie who marries into the coloured society that she identifies with and defends; and her brother, Clarence Gary, who secretly passes after attending a white boarding school, falls in love with a white woman, is exposed as being part black, and dies of tuberculosis and despair.
* [[Kate Chopin]]'s 1893 short story, ''[[Désirée's Baby|The Father of Désirée's Baby]]'', tells the story of an abandoned baby raised by a wealthy French Creole family. The baby (Désirée) grows up to marry a wealthy man of good name. When their baby is born, in a few months it becomes apparent the child is part black. The husband, Armand, sends her and the baby away. The final scene reveals that Armand knew that he was the part-black one.
* [[Mark Twain]]'s 1894 novel, ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson|The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'', is a scathing satire of passing in the antebellum south. Roxy, a slave, is one-sixteenth black; in order to avoid being sold down the river, she decides to switch her own baby (who is 1/32 black) and a white baby she is caring for. Her baby Tom, who passes for white, is raised as a spoiled aristocrat, but when his true identity becomes known as the child of a slave and thus born into slavery, he is sold down the river.
* Writing in the late 19th century, [[Charles W. Chesnutt]] explored issues of mixed-race people passing for white in several of his short stories and novels set in the South after the [[American Civil War]]. It was a tumultuous time, with dramatic social changes following the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]; many of the slaves were mixed race because of generations of white men having taken sexual advantage of slave women or having more conventional liaisons with them.
* In 1912, [[James Weldon Johnson]] anonymously published ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]]'', which depicts the life of a biracial man who, after witnessing a lynching, chooses to live as white. Doing so causes him to lose his connection to and dream of making music steeped in African-American roots.
* [[Jessie Redmon Fauset]] published ''[[Plum Bun]]'' in 1928, a novel in which the African-American protagonist, Angela Murray, tries to leverage her light skin tone to gain social advantage, but she discovers a deeper need for honesty than for societal acceptance.
* [[Nella Larsen]]'s 1929 novella, ''[[Passing (novel)|Passing]]'', deals with two [[biracial]] women's [[racial identity|racial identities]] and their social experience: one generally passes for white and has married white; the other is married to a black man and lives in the black community of [[Harlem]]. She occasionally passes for white for convenience, as it was a time of social [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in some public facilities.
* [[Fannie Hurst]]'s 1933 bestselling novel, ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'', includes the character Peola, a light-skinned African-American girl who rejects her darker-skinned mother in order to pass for white.

* [[Boris Vian]]'s 1946 pulp fiction novel, [[I Spit on Your Graves|J'irais cracher sur vos tombes]], describes the story of Lee Anderson, a White passing African American man who infiltrates a White community by charm and seduction in order to take violent revenge for the lynching of his [[Emmett Till]]-like little brother. The novel was extremely controversial and even banned, and is quite an insightful window into US race relations. 
* [[Ray Sprigle]], a white journalist, disguised himself as black and travelled in the [[Deep South]] with [[John Wesley Dobbs]], a guide from the [[NAACP]]. Sprigle wrote a series of articles under the title ''I Was a Negro in the South for 30 Days''.  The articles formed the basis of Sprigle's 1949 book ''In the Land of [[Jim Crow]]''.
* [[Langston Hughes]] wrote several pieces related to passing, including two relevant short stories. One, titled "Passing" in the 1934 collection ''[[The Ways of White Folks]]'', concerns a son who thanks his mother for literally passing him on the street as he is passing for white. The other, titled "Who's Passing for Who" (1952), portrays a couple whose racial ambiguity leads to questioning whether they are passing for white or for black.

* Mat Johnson and Warren Pleese's graphic novel, ''Incognegro'', is inspired by [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]]'s work as an investigative reporter for the [[NAACP]] on [[lynchings]] in the South in the early 20th century. It tells of Zane Pinchback, a young, light-skinned, African-American man whose eyewitness reports of lynchings are regularly published in a New York periodical under the byline "Incognegro".&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=137901 Mat Johnson on Incognegro]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Newsarama]], November 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harlan Ellison]], the [[speculative fiction]] writer, examines the emotional impact of passing in his allegorical short story, "Pennies, Off a Dead Man's Eyes". In it, a white man (secretly an alien non-human who was stranded on Earth as a child) attends the funeral of a beloved black man who raised him, and who taught him how to blend in and appear human.

=== Art ===

* Racial passing is a recurring theme in American artist [[Adrian Piper]]'s work. For example, in her 1988 visual performance piece ''Cornered'', Piper states "I'm black" and explains that this statement may surprise her audience because Piper, who is a light-skinned African American, could pass as white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-adrian-pipers-massive-moma-survey-will-force-face-prejudices|title=Adrian Piper's Massive MoMA Survey Will Force You to Face Your Prejudices|last=Sargent|first=Antwaun|date=2018-04-09|work=Artsy|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Jews===
[[Image:Grey Owl.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of [[Grey Owl]] taken by [[Yousuf Karsh]] in 1936. Born in England, he went to Canada and lived with [[First Nations]] people, passing as part [[First Nations|Native American]] for many years.]]
In [[Nazi Germany]] and in areas controlled by Germany before and during [[World War II]], some Jewish people who [[Nordic race|looked "Aryan"]] (in terms of their facial features and [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]] in general) passed as "Aryan" and tried to be "[[more German than the Germans]]" in order to avoid [[Holocaust train|deportation to ghettos or death camps]]. [[Edith Hahn Beer]] was Jewish and passed as "Aryan"; she survived the Holocaust by living with and marrying a Nazi officer. Hahn-Beer wrote a memoir called: ''The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust''. Another such example is [[Stella Kübler]], a Jewish collaborator who initially attempted to [[Crypto-Jew|hide her Jewish background]].

===Indigenous peoples of the Americas===
Examples of racial passing have been used by people to assimilate into groups other than European. Marie Lee Bandura, who grew up as part of the [[Qayqayt First Nation]] in [[New Westminster]], British Columbia, was orphaned and believed she was the last of her people. She moved to [[Chinatown (Vancouver)|Vancouver's Chinatown]], married a Chinese man, and raised her four children as Chinese. One day she told her daughter Rhonda Larrabee about her heritage: "I will tell you once, but you must never ask me again."&lt;ref name="onf-nfb.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?lg=en&amp;id=51207 |title=A Tribe of One |work=Government of Canada |publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]] |accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hui2003"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://content.lib.sfu.ca/utils/getfile/collection/peak_A/id/28740/filename/28734.pdfpage/page/10 |title=Film: The story of the smallest tribe |date=May 26, 2003 |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225123828/http://peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2003-2/issue4/ar-tribe.html |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |dead-url=no |first=Stephen |last=Hui |publisher=Simon Fraser University |location=Burnaby, British Columbia |volume=114 |issue=4 |format=PDF |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmentalist [[Grey Owl]] was a white [[United Kingdom|British]] man named Archibald Belaney, rather than [[First Nations]] as he claimed to be. When asked to explain his European appearance, he lied and claimed he was half [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and half [[Apache]]. Belaney learned some of the [[Ojibwe language]] and wilderness skills, and attempted to live by his [[Anachronism#Behavioral and cultural anachronism|anachronistic]] idea of what makes someone [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Donald B. Smith, ''From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl'', (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America, generational acculturation and assimilation took place via intermarriage. Medium-brown offspring of even dark parents were no longer "black", but were labeled with any of a half-dozen terms denoting class as much as skin tone. Descendants who were European-looking were accepted as white.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8559">'''Political class''', or '''political elite''' is a concept in comparative political science originally developed by Italian political theorist theory of [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1941). It refers to the relatively small group of activists that is highly aware and active in politics, and from whom the national leadership is largely drawn.  As  [[Max Weber]] noted, they not only live "for politics"—like the old notables used to—but make their careers "off politics" as policy specialists and experts on specific fields of public administration.&lt;ref&gt;Weber 1958 p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca approached the study of the political class by examining the mechanisms of reproduction and renewal of the ruling class; the characteristics of politicians; and the different forms of organization developed in their wielding of power. 

Elected legislatures may become dominated by subject-matter specialists, aided by permanent staffs, who become a political class.&lt;ref&gt;Eliassen and Pedersen, (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Comparative elites==
The presence or absence of a political class in a country depends on its history. For example Germany (since 1945) has a very weak political class, with a "striking taboo" against the sort of elitism that dominated Germany before 1945, including Imperial Germany, Weimar and the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Thies and Schneider (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In sharp contrast France has a very prestigious political class trained in special elite schools.

===Britain===
Until the 1970s Britain featured a tight-knit political class that emerged from upper-class families whose sons came to know each other at elite "public schools" (like [[Eton College]] and [[Harrow School]]) and the "old boy" network, based on Oxford and Cambridge, which dominates public life.  After 1970, however, the political class became much more open in terms of the social origins of British politicians and top civil servants. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) have increasingly been educated at nonelite schools and have been of more modest social backgrounds. Labour MPs, in turn, are increasingly middle class, white-collar and university educated.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kavanagh, "Changes in the political class and its culture," ''Parliamentary Affairs,'' Jan19 92, Vol. 45 Issue 1, pp 18-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
A political class emerged in [[History of Spain|Spain]] during the reign (1833–68) of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]].  A modern political class emerged in Spain, adapted to the needs of a representative state that was under construction. To bring that about, the circles of power were open to intense renewal, coopting families of provincial gentry networks. The result was a political class composed mostly of jurists and attached to the values and interests of landed property. It was a new ruling class. Although originally inspired by revolutionary principles, it soon limited the circle of power, becoming aristocratic and largely closed to new membership.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Pro Ruiz, "La Formacion De La Clase Politica Liberal En España (1833–1868)," ["The formation of the liberal political class in Spain, 1833-68"] ''Historia Contemporanea,'' 2001, Issue 2, pp 445-481&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
Lucas (1998) examines despotic versus infrastructural power in terms of relations between the military leaders and the civilian political class in Nigeria from 1985 to 1993. He concludes that weak states experience a conflict between these two types of power. Despotic power, in sociologist [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]]'s definition, refers to the state's repressive capacities, while infrastructural power refers to its ability to penetrate society and implement its decisions. Whereas leaders cultivate alliances with powerful social groups to realize their infrastructural power, the exercise of despotic power can undermine such patterns of collaboration. 

Military leaders relied on a number of despotic strategies to extend their control over the political class as part of a promised transition to democracy: many politicians were banned, two government-created political parties were imposed, and elections that yielded outcomes threatening to military interests were annulled. While the military leadership was successful in repressing the politicians, it was unable to restructure the civilian leadership in ways that would further the institutional power of the state. The military's persistent reliance on despotic strategies led to a long-term decline in the integrity and infrastructural capacity of the state.&lt;ref&gt;John Lucas, "The tension between despotic and infrastructural power: The military and the political class  in Nigeria, 1985–1993," ''Studies in Comparative International Development,'' Fall 1998, Vol. 33 Issue 3, pp 90-113&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[History of China|China]], the country was prevalently agricultural, dominated by an imperial bureaucracy that was crowned by the Mandarins. This was made up of judges, governors, administrators, all highly qualified in the art of governing. The literary official became the pillar of the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, ''The Search for Modern China'' (1991),&lt;/ref&gt;

==Populism==
{{main|Populism}}
Populist political movements portray themselves as the enemies of the established political class and outsiders from the main political class that no longer represents the people and are morally corrupt. Such movements have included France's [[National Front (France)|National Front]], Austria's [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] and Belgium's [[Vlaams Belang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Sosa-Buchholz and Michael L. Conniff "Populism"  in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Modern World,'' ed. by Peter N. Stearns. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term ''political class'' has recently been used as an epithet by conservatives, such as the editors of ''National Review''.  The theme is that the political elite is undemocratic and has an agenda of its own—especially the aggrandizement of its own power—that is hostile to the larger national interest, and which ought to be opposed by grassroots of populist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was a large movement for [[term limits in the United States]] in the 1990s to weaken the political class by limiting the number of terms an elected legislator could serve. Even though it succeeded in many states and cities it was rejected as unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] when it tried to limit the number of terms that a federal officeholder could serve.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== American Wrestling Association (1972–1974) ===
Flair trained as a professional wrestler with [[Verne Gagne]].&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/flair.html |title=Ric Flair|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=November 13, 2007|author=Milner, John and Richard Kamchen}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Gagne's first wrestling camp with Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell, [[Iron Sheik|The Iron Sheik]] and [[Ken Patera]] at Gagne's barn outside Minneapolis in the winter of 1971. On December 10, 1972, he made his debut in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, battling George "Scrap Iron" Gadaski to a 10-minute draw while adopting the ring name Ric Flair.&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="woodward"/&gt; During his time in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), Flair had matches with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Chris Taylor (wrestler)|Chris Taylor]], [[André the Giant]], [[Larry Hennig]] and [[Wahoo McDaniel]].&lt;ref name="Acclerator Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/flair.html#nwama |title=Ric Flair |accessdate=March 6, 2008 |publisher= Acclerator3359.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G69Kkb0VGE|title=Ric Flair vs Chris Taylor (AWA 1974)|first=|last=paywindahdusty|date=June 21, 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan (1973–2013) ===
Flair first competed in Japan in 1973 for [[International Wrestling Enterprise]] (IWE), due to a working agreement between AWA promoter [[Verne Gagne]] and the IWE. After Flair left the AWA for [[Jim Crockett Jr.]]'s [[Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] (MACW) in 1974, he began working tours for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW). On April 27, 1978, Flair challenged for the [[NWA United National Championship]] in a losing effort. Throughout the 1980s, Flair defended the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in All Japan against the likes of [[Genichiro Tenryu]], [[Riki Choshu]], [[Jumbo Tsuruta]], [[Harley Race]], and [[Kerry Von Erich]]. On October 21, 1985, Flair wrestled [[Rick Martel]] in a double title match where he defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged for the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]], but the match ended in a double countout. As All Japan withdrew from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in the late 1980s, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) began a working agreement with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW). In 1989, the working agreement led to a feud between Flair and [[Keiji Mutoh]], who was wrestling under The Great Muta [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], in the United States for WCW. On March 21, 1991, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] for the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] in a double title match on the [[WCW/New Japan Supershow]] at the [[Tokyo Dome]]. Fujinami beat Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but later lost the title at WCW's [[SuperBrawl I]] on May 19, 1991 in the United States.&lt;ref name="smokyrobmoore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/smokyrobmoore/jp082399.htm|title=View from the Rising Sun by Masanori Horie-Ric Flair: To Be The Man, You've Got To Beat The Man|publisher=Geocities.com|accessdate=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109045521/http://www.geocities.com/smokyrobmoore/jp082399.htm|archive-date=November 9, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Flair left WCW for the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1991, he continued to tour Japan in the [[Super World of Sports]] (SWS) promotion, due to an agreement between WWF and SWS. He defended and retained the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Genichiro Tenryu]] on September 15, 1992 in a match that resulted in a draw. In August 1995, under a WCW contract, Flair participated in the [[G1 Climax]] tournament in New Japan, where he beat [[Shiro Koshinaka]], drew [[Masahiro Chono]], and lost to Keiji Mutoh. On July 17, 1996, Flair challenged [[Shinya Hashimoto]] for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort in NJPW.&lt;ref name="smokyrobmoore"/&gt;

Once again under the WWE banner, Flair continued to tour Japan periodically between 2002 and 2008. He successfully defended the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] against [[The Dudley Boyz]] twice in February 2004. On the February 7, 2005 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', broadcast from the [[Saitama Super Arena]] in Japan, Flair lost to [[Shawn Michaels]] in a singles match. In February 2008, Flair wrestled [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Kennedy]] in the [[Ariake Coliseum]] and [[William Regal]] in the [[Budokan Hall]], both under the stipulation that he would retire if he lost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2, 2013, All Japan announced that Flair would make his return to AJPW for the first time in five years on January 26, 2013, teaming with Keiji Mutoh to take on [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] and [[Seiya Sanada]]. This would have been his first professional wrestling match since his September 2011 loss to [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] on ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]'' and his first for All Japan since March 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74384|title=Ric Flair Returning To The Ring, Full Details|publisher=PWInsider.com|date=January 3, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_67600.shtml|title=Flair News: It's official – Ric Flair wrestling again|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=January 3, 2013|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on January 26, just moments before the start of the All Japan event, the promotion announced that Flair was forced to pull out of his match because of a "sudden illness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/sports/fight/headlines/article/20130126-00000003-spnavi|script-title=ja:リック・フレアーが急病で緊急欠場=1.26全日本プロレス|date=January 26, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2013|work=Sports Navi|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219031329/http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/sports/fight/headlines/article/20130126-00000003-spnavi|archivedate=February 19, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; later reported as a badly swollen left leg.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1974–1991)===
==== Becoming the Nature Boy (1974–1981) ====
In 1974, Flair left the AWA for [[Jim Crockett]]'s Mid-Atlantic region in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA)&lt;ref name="Acclerator Bio"/&gt; and he soon captured his first singles title, when on February 9, 1975 he beat [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|Mid-Atlantic TV Championship]]. On October 4, 1975, however, Flair's career nearly ended when he was in a serious plane crash in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] that took the life of the pilot and paralyzed [[Johnny Valentine]] (also on board were [[Mr. Wrestling]], Bob Bruggers, and promoter [[David Crockett (wrestling)|David Crockett]]).&lt;ref name="slam1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingFlair/planecrash-can.html|title=The plane crash that changed wrestling|publisher=SLAM!

Flair won the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] when he defeated [[Bobo Brazil]] on July 29, 1977. During the next three years, he held five reigns as NWA United States Heavyweight Champion while feuding with [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Roddy Piper]], [[Mr. Wrestling]], [[Jimmy Snuka]] and [[Greg Valentine]] (with whom he also formed a championship tag team). However, Flair reached elite status when he began referring to himself as "The Nature Boy" in order to incite a 1978 feud with the original "Nature Boy" [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]], who put Flair [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#P|over]] in one encounter.

==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (1981–1991) ====

On September 17, 1981, Flair beat [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] for his first [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=pwhof/&gt; In the following years, Flair established himself as the promotion's main franchise in the midst of emerging competition from [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). An unsanctioned title loss took place on January 6, 1983 to [[Carlos Colón Sr.]] in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="worldtitles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=30190&amp;p=1|title=Ric Flair: The 16-time... 18-time... 21-time... Exactly how many times has he been World Champion?|author=Buck Woodward|publisher=PWInsider.com|date=April 2, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair recovered the championship belt in a phantom change seventeen days later not officially recognized by the NWA. [[Harley Race]] won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Flair in 1983, but Flair regained the title at [[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]] in a [[steel cage match]].&lt;ref name=pwhof/&gt; Officially, Flair won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship eight more times. Flair lost the title to Race and won it back in the span of three days in New Zealand and Singapore in March 1984. At the first [[David Von Erich]] Memorial Parade of Champions at [[Texas Stadium]], Flair was pinned by [[Kerry Von Erich]], but he regained the title eighteen days later in Japan and reigned for two years, two months and two days, losing the title to Dusty Rhodes on July 26, 1986 at [[The Great American Bash (1986)|The Great American Bash]]. However, Flair regained the title two weeks later.

In late 1985, the tag team of [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Ole Anderson]] began aiding Flair (whom [[Anderson family|they claimed as a "cousin"]]) in attacks against Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and [[Michael Smith (wrestler)|Sam Houston]]. A few weeks later, the Andersons interrupted Houston's match against [[Tully Blanchard]] and the three villains combined to rough up the youngster. Shortly thereafter, Flair, Blanchard and the Andersons formalized their alliance, calling themselves [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]], with Blanchard's manager [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]] also coming on board. Upon the group's inception, it was clear that The Four Horsemen were unlike any villainous alliance that had ever existed, as the four rule breakers immediately used their strength in numbers to decimate the NWA's top fan favorites while controlling the majority of the championship titles.

By 1986, wrestling promoter [[Jim Crockett, Jr.|Jim Crockett]] had consolidated the various NWA member promotions he owned into a single entity, running under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance. Controlling much of the traditional NWA territories in the southeast and Midwestern United States, Crockett looked to expand nationally and built his promotion around Flair as champion. During this time, Flair's bookings as champion were tightly controlled by Crockett, and a [[Big Gold Belt|custom championship belt]] was created for Flair. Flair lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Detroit to [[Ron Garvin]] on September 25, 1987. Garvin held the title for two months before losing to Flair on November 26, 1987 at WCW's first pay-per-view event, [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade]], in Chicago.

In early 1988, [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and Flair fought to a 45-minute time-limit draw at the first ever ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions I|Clash of the Champions]]''. On February 20, 1989, at [[Chi-Town Rumble]] in Chicago, [[Ricky Steamboat]] pinned Flair to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This prompted a series of rematches, where Steamboat was presented as a "family man" (often accompanied by his wife and young son), while Flair opposed him as an immoral, fast-living "ladies man". Following a best-of-three falls match with Steamboat that lasted just short of the 60-minute time limit (and ended with a disputed finish where Steamboat retained the title) at ''[[Clash of the Champions|Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin' Cajun]]'' on April 2, Flair regained the title from Steamboat on May 7, 1989 at [[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]] in a match that was voted 1989's "[[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]]" by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''. On July 23, 1989, Flair defeated Terry Funk at [[The Great American Bash (1989)|The Great American Bash]], but the two continued to feud through the summer and eventually Flair reformed The Four Horsemen, with the surprise addition of longtime rival Sting, to combat Funk's [[J-Tex Corporation]]. This led to an [["I Quit" match]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions IX: New York Knockout]]'' which Flair won. Flair then kicked Sting out of The Four Horsemen upon his challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, resulting in a revived feud between the two. On July 7, 1990, Flair dropped the title to Sting at [[The Great American Bash (1990)|The Great American Bash]].&lt;ref name=pwhof/&gt; After being unmasked as The Black Scorpion at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade]] in 1990, Flair regained the title from Sting on January 11, 1991.

Subsequent to this title win, Flair was recognized by WCW as the first [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]], though he was still also recognized as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On March 21, 1991, [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] defeated Flair in a match in Tokyo at the [[WCW/New Japan Supershow#I|WCW/New Japan Supershow]]. While the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion, WCW did not because Fujinami had backdropped Flair over the top rope in a violation of WCW rules. On May 19, 1991, Flair defeated Fujinami at [[SuperBrawl I]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] to reclaim the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. In the spring of 1991, Flair had a contract dispute with WCW president [[Jim Herd]], who wanted him to take a substantial pay cut. Flair had resigned as head booker in February 1990 and Herd wanted to reduce Flair's role in the promotion even further, despite the fact that Flair was still a top draw. According to Flair, Herd also proposed changes in his appearance and ring name (i.e. by shaving his hair, wearing a diamond earring and going by the name [[Spartacus]]) in order to "change with the times".&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/27/516827.html|title=Flair rips Mick Foley|last=Baines|first=Tim|publisher=Ottawa Sun|date=June 27, 2004|accessdate=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair disagreed with the proposals and two weeks before [[The Great American Bash (1991)|The Great American Bash]], Herd fired him and vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. While Flair had left for the WWF, he was still recognized as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion until September 8, when the title was officially vacated.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1991–1993) ===
Flair signed with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in September 1991 and began appearing on television with the [[Big Gold Belt]], calling himself "The Real World Champion".&lt;ref name=pwhof/&gt; Led by his "financial adviser" [[Bobby Heenan]] and his "executive consultant" [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]], Flair repeatedly issued challenges to WWF wrestlers like [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]] and [[Hulk Hogan]], wrestling a team led by Piper at [[Survivor Series (1991)|Survivor Series]] in November 1991 and helping [[The Undertaker]] defeat Hogan for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] that same night.&lt;ref name="cardspg90"/&gt; WCW sued Flair in an attempt to reclaim the championship belt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Death of WCW|last1=Reynolds|first1=R.D.|last2=Alvarez|first2=Bryan|page=38|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1-55022-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Flair claimed that he owned the title belt in lieu of the US$25,000 deposit paid by NWA champions upon winning the title, which had not been returned to him when he was fired from WCW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|date=2008|title=Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection|medium=DVD|language=English|publisher=Warner Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]], Flair won the Rumble match to claim the vacant WWF Championship. Flair entered as number three in the Rumble match and lasted 60 minutes, last eliminating [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] with help from Hulk Hogan, who had been eliminated by Justice seconds earlier.&lt;ref name="cardspg90"&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randy Savage]] then challenged Flair for the WWF Championship as part of the double main event at [[WrestleMania VIII]]. In the storyline, Flair taunted Savage by claiming that he had a prior relationship with Savage's wife, [[Miss Elizabeth]]. Savage defeated Flair for the title at WrestleMania.&lt;ref name="cardspg90"/&gt; In July 1992, as Savage prepared to defend the title against [[The Ultimate Warrior]] at [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam]],&lt;ref name="cardspg90"/&gt; Flair and Mr. Perfect sowed distrust between the two by suggesting that they would back one or the other during their match. They actually attacked both Savage and Warrior and injured Savage's knee, an injury that Flair exploited to regain the title in a match with Savage on September 1. His second reign was short-lived, however, as he lost the title to [[Bret Hart]] on October 12, 1992.

Flair teamed with [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] to take on Savage and Perfect at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]] in November 1992.&lt;ref name=cardspg90/&gt; Flair appeared in the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1993, then lost a [[Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves the WWF match]] to Mr. Perfect on the next night's (January 25) ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in a match taped six days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1993/ |title=RAW 1993 Results |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |author=Online World of Wrestling |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173201/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1993/ |archivedate=June 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair then fulfilled his remaining house show commitments, making his last appearance on February 10, 1993, before returning to WCW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/93.htm|title=History of WWE: 1993|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210002116/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/93.htm|date=February 10, 2005|archivedate=February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WCW (1993–2001)===
==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1993–1996) ====
Flair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993, as a result of a "no-compete" clause he was unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short-lived talk show in WCW called ''A Flair for the Gold''. Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show's set, and Flair's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating [[Barry Windham]] at [[Beach Blast (1993)|Beach Blast]] before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At [[Fall Brawl (1993)|Fall Brawl]], Flair lost the title, now rebranded the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship]], to [[Rick Rude|"Ravishing Rick" Rude]]. At [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]] in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival [[Ricky Steamboat]] and challenged Steamboat to a match at [[Spring Stampede (1994)|Spring Stampede]] which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held-up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged [[Robert Fuller (wrestler)|Col. Robert Parker]] to wrestle one of his men at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]], which turned out to be [[Barry Windham]], whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took [[Sherri Martel]] as his manager. He would also wrestle [[Lord Steven Regal]] in a five-match series under [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]], which aired on [[WCW Worldwide]] between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.

In June 1994 at ''[[Clash of the Champions|Clash of the Champions XXVII]]'', Flair defeated Sting in a unification match, merging the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and solidifying his heel turn. After becoming the unified and undisputed WCW champion, Flair feuded with Hulk Hogan upon Hogan's arrival in WCW in June 1994, losing the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to him in July at [[Bash at the Beach 1994|Bash at the Beach]]. Flair continued to feud with Hogan and finally lost to Hogan in a steel cage retirement match at [[Halloween Havoc 1994|Halloween Havoc]]. Flair took a few months off afterwards before returning as a wrestler and part-time manager for [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] in 1995 (explained on-air by having Flair nag Hogan for months until Hogan and Savage both petitioned WCW management to let Flair come back).

On April 29, 1995, Flair wrestled [[Antonio Inoki]] in front of 190,000 spectators in [[Pyongyang, North Korea]] at the May Day Stadium in a losing effort under a joint show between [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]]. The event was broadcast on August 4, 1995 on [[pay-per-view]] under the title of [[Collision in Korea]]. In the fall of 1995, Flair began a short feud with Arn Anderson, which culminated in a tag match that saw Flair turning on Sting to reform the new Four Horsemen with Flair as the leader, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Chris Benoit as the members. With the new Four Horsemen, Flair won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship two more times before the nWo invasion storyline began in WCW, with the first one being in December 1995 at [[Starrcade (1995)|Starcade]], where Flair defeated Lex Luger and Sting by countout and then defeated Savage after all three Four Horsemen members ran to the ring and Arn Anderson knocked out Savage with brass knuckles, thus allowing Flair to pin Savage to win the match and the title. Afterwards Savage won the title back on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' after Starcade, but Flair won the next match at [[SuperBrawl VI]] to regain the championship. During the feud, Savage's manager Miss Elizabeth turned against him and became Flair's valet. Together with Woman and Debra McMichael they would escort Flair to his matches until Miss Elizabeth was taken by the nWo in the fall and eventually returned as Savage's valet when he joined the nWo in 1997. Flair lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship eventually three months later to The Giant. The feud with Savage continued with The New Four Horseman joining the Dungeon of Doom to create an Alliance to end Hulkamania. Together the factions wrestled Hogan and Savage in a triple steel cage, End of Hulkamania match; losing to the reunited Mega Powers. Afterwards, Flair went on to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and there were also changes in the Four Horseman in 1996, as Brian Pillman left WCW and Steve "Mongo" McMichael became the fourth member.

==== Feud with the New World Order (1996–1999) ====
Once again as a top [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], Flair played a major role in the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) invasion storyline in late 1996 and throughout 1997. He and the other Horsemen often took the lead in the war against [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hulk Hogan]], whom Flair immediately challenged for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at the ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXXIII|Clash of the Champions XXXIII]]'', but won only by disqualification. In September 1996, Flair and Anderson teamed with their bitter rivals, [[Sting and Lex Luger]], to lose to the nWo (Hogan, [[Kevin Nash]], [[Scott Hall]], and an [[Jeff Farmer (wrestler)|impostor Sting]]) in the WarGames match at [[Fall Brawl (1996)|Fall Brawl]] when Luger submitted to the impostor Sting's [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Scorpion Deathlock]].

In October 1996, two developments occurred that affected the Four Horsemen when [[Jeff Jarrett]] came over to WCW from the WWF, and expressed his desire to join the Horsemen as he immediately gained a fan in Ric Flair, much to the chagrin of the other Horsemen. Flair finally let Jarrett join the group in February 1997, but the others did not want him, and in July 1997 was ultimately kicked out of the group by Flair himself, who had enough of the instability Jarrett's presence caused the Horsemen. Flair also feuded with [[Roddy Piper]], [[Sean Waltman|Syxx]], and his old nemesis [[Curt Hennig]] in 1997, after Hennig was offered a spot in The Four Horsemen only to turn on Flair and The Four Horsemen at [[Fall Brawl (1997)|Fall Brawl]] in September 1997, in which Hennig punctuated the act by slamming the cage door onto Flair's head.

[[File:Ric Flair with Paul Billets.jpg|thumb|A fan with Flair]]
In April 1998, Flair disappeared from WCW television, due to a lawsuit filed by Eric Bischoff for no-showing a live episode of ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' on April 16, 1998 in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. After the case was settled, Flair made a surprise return on September 14, 1998 to ceremoniously reform the Four Horsemen (along with [[Steve McMichael]], [[Dean Malenko]], and [[Chris Benoit]]). Flair feuded with Bischoff for several months afterward. Flair repeatedly raked Eric Bischoff's eyes during this feud. This culminated in a match at [[Starrcade (1998)|Starrcade]] between Bischoff and Flair in December 1998, which Bischoff won after interference from Curt Hennig, a former member of the Four Horsemen. The following night in Baltimore on ''Nitro'', Flair returned and threatened to leave WCW, demanding a match against Bischoff for the presidency of the company. The match was made, and despite the nWo interfering on Bischoff's behalf Flair won and was granted the position of president of WCW. This resulted in a match at Superbrawl between Flair and Hollywood Hogan for the WCW Championship, which Flair lost after being betrayed by his own son [[David Flair]].

==== Final world championship reigns (1999–2001) ====
In spite of his son's betrayal, Flair signed a rematch at [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored]] which was billed as a First Blood barbed wire steel cage Match against Hogan where Flair's presidency and Hogan's WCW World Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Despite being the first to bleed, Flair won the match by pinfall thanks to the bias of the referee [[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]], who counted Hogan out.

As on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing his power much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan favorites and even awarding the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] (which was vacated by [[Scott Steiner]] due to injury) to his son David and resorting to whatever means necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included [[Roddy Piper]], Arn Anderson and the [[Jersey Triad]] to keep things in order. Flair's reign as president came to an end on the July 19 episode of ''Nitro'', when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper to ring the bell, which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).

Flair won his last world titles in his career by winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship twice during 2000, the company's last full year of operation. When WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, Flair was the leader of the villainous group called the [[Magnificent Seven (professional wrestling)|Magnificent Seven]]. Flair lost the final match of ''Nitro'' to Sting, recreating the second match of ''Nitro'' in 1995. Nevertheless, Flair has repeatedly stated in various interviews how happy he was when WCW finally closed down, although at the same time the fact that many people would lose their jobs saddened him.&lt;ref&gt;''WWE: The Monday Night Wars'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WWF/WWE (2001–2009)===

On the May 13 episode of ''Raw'', Flair challenged [[Hulk Hogan]] to a no disqualifications match for the [[WWE Undisputed Championship]]. Flair would later lose the contest before moving onto a rivalry with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. At [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]], Flair teamed with The Big Show in losing fashion as they faced Steve Austin in a two-on-one handicap tag team match. On the June 3 episode of ''Raw'', the feud between Flair and Austin would escalate after Austin defeated Flair in a singles contest. After Steve Austin abruptly left the renamed WWE in June while in a program with Flair, a match was hotshotted between Flair and McMahon for sole ownership of WWE, which Flair lost after interference from [[Brock Lesnar]] on the June 10 edition of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020610.html|title=RAW – June 10, 2002 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flair's rivalry with Lesnar would continue into the month of June with Lesnar picking up wins over Flair in a singles match on the July 1 episode of ''Raw'' and in a tag team contest on the July 15 episode of ''Raw''. At [[King of the Ring (2002)|King of the Ring]], Flair defeated [[Eddie Guerrero]] in a singles match after Guerrero and [[Chris Benoit]] would interrupt Flair's speech regarding losing his position as WWF co-owner; afterwards, Guerrero would lock Flair in his own signature figure four leg lock with help from Benoit. Flair then became involved in a short lived rivalry with [[Chris Jericho]], leading to Flair defeating Jericho at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]], resulting in Flair being granted a World Championship match against [[Triple H]] on the September 2 episode of ''Raw'', which he lost. Later on that same night, Flair would team with [[Rob Van Dam]] as the duo were successful in defeating the team of Triple H and Chris Jericho. At [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]], Flair was unsuccessful in capturing the Intercontinental Championship in a singles contest against Jericho.

==== Evolution (2003–2005) ====
{{main|Evolution (professional wrestling)|l1=Evolution}}
In September 2002 at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]], [[Triple H]] defended the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Rob Van Dam]]. During the match, Flair came down to the ring and grabbed the sledgehammer from Triple H and teased hitting him before hitting Van Dam, allowing Triple H to get the win, turning him heel in the process and accompanied Triple H to the ring as his manager.&lt;ref name="Unforgiven - HHH vs RVD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/history/2002/rawmainevent/ |title=Triple H vs. Rob Van Dam for the World Heavyweight Championship |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |publisher=WWE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921081355/http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/history/2002/rawmainevent/ |archivedate=September 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, [[Dave Batista|Batista]] moved from ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' to ''Raw'' and Flair also began accompanying him to the ring while continuing to second Triple H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030124.html|title=RAW – January 24, 2003 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2003 at [[Bad Blood (2003)|Bad Blood]], Flair was able to defeat Shawn Michaels after Orton struck Michaels with a chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/040322.html|title=RAW – March 22, 2004 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of Evolution's power, the group controlled all of the male-based championships of ''Raw'' after [[Armageddon (2003)|Armageddon]]. Batista teamed with Flair to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] from the [[Dudley Boyz]] ([[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]]) in a [[Gauntlet match|tag team turmoil match]] and Triple H regained the World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg (in a [[triple threat match]] that also involved [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]), with the help of the other members. In January 2004 at the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]], Flair and Batista successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a [[Tables Match|tables match]], and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a [[Last Man Standing match]], thus retaining the championship. Flair and Batista lost the World Tag Team Championship on February 16 edition of Raw to [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Rob Van Dam]]. At [[WrestleMania XX]], Evolution defeated the [[Rock 'n' Sock Connection]] ([[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Mick Foley]]) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. The following week on ''Raw'' during the [[2004 WWE draft lottery]], Flair and Batista defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] to win their second and final World Tag Team Championship. While still world champion, Benoit teamed with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] to take the World Tag Team Championship from Flair and Batista on April 19 ''Raw''.

At SummerSlam, Orton pinned Benoit to become the new World Heavyweight Champion and the youngest World Champion in WWE history to date. Batista hoisted Orton on to his shoulders in what appeared to be a celebration, but following the [[thumbs signal|thumbs down]] from Triple H, the group proceeded to attack Orton. At [[Unforgiven (2004)|Unforgiven]], Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and [[Jonathan Coachman]]. Orton's feud with Evolution continued until [[Survivor Series (2004)|Survivor Series]] where Triple H, Batista, [[Gene Snitsky]], and Edge were defeated by Orton, [[Maven Huffman|Maven]], Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit in a [[Survivor Series Match|Survivor Series]] match for control of ''Raw'' over the following month.

In the Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution, Batista, Orton and Triple H were the last three remaining in the match. Orton eliminated Batista with a RKO and Triple H pinned Orton with Batista's help to win the title. Triple H suggested that Batista not enter the Royal Rumble match, wanting the group to focus on Triple H retaining the title. Batista declined, entered the Rumble at number 28 and won. Triple H tried to persuade Batista to challenge the WWE Champion [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] of [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] rather than for his World Heavyweight Championship. This involved Triple H plotting a feud between JBL and Batista, showing JBL badmouthing Batista in an interview and staging an attack on Batista with a limousine designed to look like Layfield's. The scheme was unsuccessful and at the [[2005 WWE Draft Lottery|brand]] contract signing ceremony, Batista chose to remain on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], infuriating Triple H and thus quitting the faction. Batista defeated Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania 21]].

After Vengeance, Triple H took time off, Flair turned face for the first time since 2002 before going on to win the Intercontinental Championship, and the group was dissolved. Triple H returned at the "Homecoming" episode of ''Raw'' on October 3 where he was to team with Flair in a tag team match against [[Carly Colón|Carlito]] and [[Chris Masters]]. After winning that match, Triple H betrayed Flair and attacked him with a sledgehammer. Flair retained the Intercontinental Championship against Triple H at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]] in a steel cage match, which was voted as such by the fans. Flair later lost to Triple H in a Last Man Standing non-title match at [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series]] which ended their feud.

==== Final storylines and first retirement (2005–2008) ====
At the end of 2005, Flair had a feud with Edge that culminated in a WWE Championship [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|Tables, Ladder and Chairs match]] on ''Raw'' in early 2006, which Flair lost. On the February 20 episode of ''Raw'', he lost the Intercontinental Championship to [[Shelton Benjamin]], thus ending his reign at 155 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060220.html|title=RAW – February 20, 2006 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair took some time off in mid-2006 to rest and marry for the third time and he returned in June to work a program with his real-life rival [[Mick Foley]] that played off their legitimate past animosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060612.html|title=RAW – June 12, 2006 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair defeated Foley at [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of a singles match|two out of three falls match]], then at [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]] in an [["I Quit" match]].&lt;ref name="cardspg122" /&gt;

[[File:HBK-and-Flair-backhand-chops.jpg|thumb|Flair and [[Shawn Michaels]] in 2007]]
Subsequently, he was involved in a rivalry with the [[Spirit Squad]] on ''Raw''. On November 5, 2006 at [[Cyber Sunday (2006)|Cyber Sunday]], he captured the World Tag Team Championship from the Squad with Roddy Piper.&lt;ref name="cardspg122"&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling almanac &amp; book of facts|work=Wrestling's historical cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the November 13 episode of ''Raw'', Flair and Piper lost the Tag Titles to [[Rated-RKO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/061113.html|title=RAW – November 13, 2006 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a disc problem with Piper and had to be flown immediately back to the USA as soon as ''Raw'' was off the air. On November 26, 2006 at [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]], Flair was the sole survivor of a match that featured himself, [[Ron Simmons]] (replacing an injured Piper), Dusty Rhodes and [[Sgt. Slaughter]] versus the Spirit Squad.&lt;ref name="cardspg122"/&gt; Flair then left television due to his divorce hearings.

Flair then began teaming with Carlito after Flair said that Carlito had no heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated, May 2007|work=Arena Reports|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=May 2007|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair defeated Carlito in a match after which Carlito realized that Flair was right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070212.html|title=RAW – February 12, 2007 Results|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair and Carlito faced off against [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch]] in a number one contender's match for the World Tag Team Championship but were defeated. The two teamed up on the [[WrestleMania 23]] pre-show, and defeated the team of [[Chavo Guerrero]] and [[Gregory Helms]].

==== Part-time appearances (2008–2009) ====
[[File:Ricflairwm24.jpg|thumb| Flair at [[WrestleMania XXIV]]]]
On the March 31, 2008 episode of ''Raw'', Flair delivered his farewell address. Afterward, Triple H brought out many current and retired superstars to thank Flair for all he has done, including Shawn Michaels, some of the Four Horsemen, [[Harley Race]], and [[Chris Jericho]], followed by [[The Undertaker]] and then [[Vince McMahon]]. Along with the wrestlers, the fans gave Flair a [[standing ovation]]. This event represented a rare moment in WWE as both the heels and the faces broke [[Kayfabe|character]] and came out to the ring together. Flair made his first post retirement appearance on the June 16, 2008 episode of ''Raw'' to confront Chris Jericho about his actions during a rivalry with Shawn Michaels. He challenged Jericho to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Parking Lot Brawl|fight in the parking lot]], rather than an official match, but  Jericho was stopped by Triple H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/06162008/|title=Plight of Champions|publisher=WWE|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year on February 9, Flair once again confronted Jericho on ''Raw''. Jericho was attacking Hall of Fame members and Flair demanded he respect them, before punching Jericho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02092009/|title=Coast busted!|publisher=WWE|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair appeared a month later to distract him during a [[Money in the Bank ladder match#2009|Money in the Bank]] Qualifying Match. Jericho then challenged Flair to come out of retirement for [[WrestleMania XXV]]; instead Flair managed [[Roddy Piper]], [[Jimmy Snuka]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]] in a three-on-one handicap match at WrestleMania in a losing effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03092009/ |title=In your house|publisher=WWE|date=August 22, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03162009/|title=Texas Hold 'Em|publisher=WWE|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03232009/ |title=Kiss of death|publisher=WWE|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, Flair returned during the [[Judgment Day (2009)|Judgment Day]] pay-per-view, coming to the aid of Batista, who was being attacked by [[The Legacy (professional wrestling)|The Legacy]] (Randy Orton, [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Ted DiBiase Jr.|Ted DiBiase]]). On the June 1 episode of ''Raw'', Flair challenged Orton in a parking lot brawl match, after an interference from the rest of The Legacy, the fight ended with Flair was trapped inside a steel cage and was punted by Orton. After ''Raw'', Flair left WWE when his contract expired on June 2, 2009.

(Flair got the inspiration from [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]' "[[Great Balls of Fire]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.providr.com/ric-flair-woo/2/|title=Ric Flair Reveals The Origin Of His Infamous 'Woo' Catchphrase|date=2016-12-13|work=Providr.com|access-date=2017-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Wooo!" yell{{efn|"Wooo!" is officially spelled with four o's according to his autobiography, but can extend to any number of o's.&lt;ref name=RicFlairToBeTheMan4&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flair|first1=Ric|authorlink1=|editor1-first=Mark|editor1-last=Madden|editor2-first=Keith Elliot|editor2-last=Greenberg|editor1-link=Mark Madden|editor2-link=Keith Elliot Greenberg|title=Ric Flair: To Be The Man|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Ric-Flair-To-Be-The-Man/Ric-Flair/9780743491815/excerpt_with_id/10729|accessdate=July 2, 2017|edition=Hardcover, 352pp|date=June 2004|publisher=[Simon &amp; Schuster Adult Publishing Group]|location=|isbn=978-0-7434-5691-3|quote=The "Woooo" started out short and clipped.

From the late 1970s, Flair wore ornate fur-lined robes of many colors with sequins during in-ring appearances,&lt;ref name="wwe-bio"/&gt; and since the early 1980s, his approach to the ring was usually heralded by the playing of the "Dawn" section of [[Richard Strauss]]' "''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]''" (famous for being used in the 1968 motion picture ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and for the introduction to [[Elvis Presley]]'s concerts of the 1970s). Flair also described himself as a "[[limousine]]-ridin', jet-flyin', kiss stealin', wheelin' dealin', son-of-a-gun (who kissed all the girls worldwide and made em cry)".

On October 19, 1998, it was declared "Ric Flair Day" in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Mayor Sharon Belton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1998103m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro 10/19/98|first=Bill|last=Wade|accessdate=July 18, 2010|publisher=notifylist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 15, 2008, it was declared "Ric Flair Day" in Norfolk, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvvHNgI225U|title=Ric Flair at VCW Pt. 2|accessdate=July 18, 2010|publisher=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 24, 2008, Mayor Bob Coble, of Columbia, South Carolina, declared March 24 to be Ric Flair Day in Columbia.

[[File:Ric Flair - Wooooo.jpg|thumb|left|Flair yelling "Wooooo!"]]
On the February 18, 2008 episode of ''Raw'', Shawn Michaels announced Flair as the first inductee into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2008)|class of 2008]]. The induction ceremony took place on March 29, 2008, with Triple H inducting him. This made him the first person to be inducted while still an active competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02182008/|title=Hall Monitor|date=February 18, 2008|last=Adkins|first=Greg|accessdate=March 16, 2008|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair was later inducted into the [[NWA Hall of Fame]] in Atlanta, Georgia, but he did not participate in the event. On January 9, 2012 it was announced that the Four Horsemen would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, thus making Flair the first person to have been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/wwe-hall-of-fame/ric-flair-to-be-at-hall-of-fame|title=Flair will be in Miami|author=|date=March 27, 2012|work=|publisher=WWE|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2008, Flair was honored in Congress by a representative from North Carolina, Republican [[Sue Myrick]], who praised his career and what he means to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/6885730|title=Ric Flair Honored in Congress|author=Gaston Gazette|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=April 16, 2008|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 2008, it was announced that Flair's signature sequin covered robe that he wore at WrestleMania XXIV, in what was to be his last WWE match, would be placed in the pop culture section of the [[National Museum of American History]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2008/sep/28/a_new_kind_female_company_flair56149/|title=A new kind of female company for Flair|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|publisher=The Post and Courier|date=September 28, 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Flair the greatest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingNWA51/nwa_greatest.html|title=Nature Boy a natural choice: Experts pick Flair as greatest NWA champ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Flair was named the greatest professional wrestler of all time in the book ''The Top 100 Wrestlers of All Time'' by John Molinaro, edited by [[Dave Meltzer]] and [[Jeff Marek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Molinaro|first=John|year=2003|title=The Top 100 Wrestlers of All Time|isbn=1-55366-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2016, Luke Winkie of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' also named Flair the greatest professional wrestler of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2016/07/26/wwe-wcw-ecw-100-best-wrestlers-all-time|title=Ranking the top 101 wrestlers of all time |last=Winkie|first=Luke|work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 26, 2016|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flair's "Wooo" chant has been used throughout pop culture, in hip-hop music in particular. Rapper Pusha T has paid homage to Flair in numerous songs. For example, on the track "Sweet Serenade", he says, "Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Wooo!), They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Wooo!), In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Wooo!), Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Pusha-t-sweet-serenade-lyrics/|title=Sweet Serenade Lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper Killer Mike also has a track named "Ric Flair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/killer-mike-takes-over-los-angeles-with-ric-flair-20150421|title=Watch Killer Mike Take Over Los Angeles in 'Ric Flair' Video|publisher=RollingStone|accessdate=August 14, 2017|date=April 21, 2015|author=Blistein, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]] paid tribute to Flair in his hit song "[[Ric Flair Drip]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Offset-and-metro-boomin-ric-flair-drip-lyrics|title=Ric Flair Drip|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction to later career ===
Some have looked unfavorably upon Flair's career from the 1990s onward. In 1998, wrestler and former WCW colleague [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] said that Flair had reached the "time to hang it up", having not been great for a "long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/may6_otr.html|title=The Bottom Line: The TSN, Off The Record - Stone Cold Interview|date=May 6, 1998|website=Slam! Sports|access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Molinaro of [[Canoe.ca|Slam! Sports]] penned a 1999 article titled, "Ric Flair is tarnishing his legacy"; Molinaro saw Flair as a wrestler whose prestige was "in jeopardy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingEditorial/jul5_molinaro.html|title=Wrestling Editorial: Ric Flair is tarnishing his legacy|last=Molinaro|first=John|date=July 5, 1999|website=Slam! Sports|access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' writer Frank Ingiosi said that Flair had a "personal vendetta against his legend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PWI update archives: July 2006 - Respect Thine Elders|last=Ingiosi|first=Frank|url=http://www.pwi-online.com/pages/pwiuarchivejuly06.html|website=[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless continued to wrestle until retiring in 2008, at age 59. Following an elaborate farewell ceremony staged for Flair by WWE, wrestling personality [[Paul Heyman]] lamented his cutting promos at "low rent wrestling shows", calling it "painful to watch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/1596414/Paul-Heyman-says-Ric-Flair-deserves-better.html|title=Ric Flair deserves better|last=Heyman|first=Paul|date=August 22, 2008|website=The Sun|access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flair would ultimately return to the ring in 2009 and signed to wrestle for TNA the following year, breaking a vow to never again lace up his boots.&lt;ref name="fsm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingspiritmagazine.co.uk/art/news/107/ric-flair-claims-he-will-never-wrestle-again|title=Ric Flair Claims He Will Never Wrestle Again|date=December 17, 2012|website=[[Fighting Spirit Magazine]]|access-date=January 23, 2016|quote=Wrestling several matches on television and Pay-Per-View, Flair broke his promise... there was a feeling that Flair had tarnished his legacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestler [[Axl Rotten]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Axl Rotten|series=Busted Open|station=[[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]]|date=August 22, 2011|quote=How terrible is it that Ric Flair, one of the greatest wrestlers of all time had to come and tarnish his name and his reputation the way he has in TNA?

Asked in 2011 if Flair was tainting his prestige, former opponent [[Shane Douglas]] was harsher, stating that he had "been tarnishing his legacy since 1990".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9paNKjdKNE&amp;t=15m40s|title=Interview with Shane Douglas|date=March 22, 2011|website=WNSvideo|access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Kevin Eck of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' criticized the aging Flair for being unable to separate himself from his ostentatious [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] when not wrestling, and said: "I don't know what's sadder, Ric Flair tarnishing his legacy in the ring or embarrassing himself away from the ring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2011/01/latest_incident_another_embarrassment_for_ric_flair.html|title=Latest incident another embarrassment for Ric Flair|last=Eck|first=Kevin|date=January 26, 2011|website=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about Flair in 2015, wrestler [[The Honky Tonk Man]] felt that viewers would "remember only the last years of his career", which consist of "bad memories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96cBVYb8Yac&amp;t=1m56s|title=Honky Tonk Man on Ric Flair|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=The Hannibal TV|access-date=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, professional wrestling announcer [[Jim Ross]] in 2012 felt that Flair had not tarnished his legacy, observing only "passion and need to earn a living".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrsbarbq.com/jrs-qa/wrestling/do-you-think-ric-flair-has-somewhat-tarnished-his-legacy-wrestling-after-his-retire|title=Q&amp;A|last=Ross|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Ross|date=April 23, 2012|website=JR's BarBQ|access-date=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Flair said continuing to wrestle in TNA was the "number one" regret of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/ric-flair-regrets-working-for-tna/|title=Ric Flair Says He Totally Regrets Wrestling For TNA, Surprising Literally No One|last=Matheson|first=Danielle|date=August 3, 2016|publisher=[[Uproxx]]|access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
In December 2005, a judge issued arrest warrants for Flair after a [[road rage]] incident that took place in Charlotte, North Carolina in which Flair allegedly got out of his car, grabbed a motorist by the neck, and kicked the door off the motorist's sport utility vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsoctv.com/news/5420940/detail.html|title=Wrestler Ric Flair Accused of Road Rage|date=November 28, 2005|publisher=WSOC Charlotte|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921025712/http://www.wsoctv.com/news/5420940/detail.html|archivedate=September 21, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair was charged with two misdemeanors, injury to personal property and simple assault and battery.

In September 2007, Flair opened a financial business called Ric Flair Finance. In July 2008, Flair Finance filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2008/08/ric_flairs_departure_from_wwe.html|title=Ring Posts: Ric Flair’s departure from WWE|publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Flair's debut in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] his former employer, [[Ring of Honor]], filed a lawsuit in 2010, alleging that Flair owed them over $40,000 and that he had not appeared at several events that he was contractually obligated to appear at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1264921058|title=ROH files lawsuit against Ric Flair|date=January 31, 2010|last=Martin|first=Adam|accessdate=June 26, 2011|publisher=Wrestleview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was never resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwinsider.com/article/88060/former-roh-owner-rips-ric-flair.html?p=1|title=Former ROH owner rips Ric Flair|date=September 5, 2014|last=Johnson|first=Mike|accessdate=January 27, 2016|work=PWInsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of racism ===
According to [[Teddy Long]], during his tenure in NWA, Flair had approached him backstage and asked, “[[Nigger]], do you like working here?” Long stated that wrestlers [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] mentioned how Flair disliked the idea of him becoming manager. Retired professional wrestling executive, [[Jim Herd]], had also spoke to Long about Flair’s dislike for him. Long would say in a separate interview how he never understood why Flair had hated him, saying he was “only doing his job.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ringsidenews.com/2018/10/20/teddy-long-says-ric-flair-called-n-word-face/|title=Teddy Long Says Ric Flair Called Him The N-Word To His Face|date=October 20, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2015/07/wwe-racism/ric-flair|title=12 Other Pro Wrestling Personalities Who Reportedly Said Horrifically Racist ThingsRic Flair|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Flair has long supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political candidates in [[North Carolina]] politics.&lt;ref name="governor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFlair/jan18_gov.html|title=Flair aims to be N.C governor|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling| accessdate=March 11, 2008|date=February 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Flair explored the possibility of running for [[governor of North Carolina]],&lt;ref name="governor"/&gt; but he never filed the papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFlair/feb8_gov.html|title=Flair doesn't file to be N.C. governor – yet|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 11, 2008|date=February 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Flair declared his support for the Republican presidential candidate [[Mike Huckabee]]. He said of Huckabee, "[Huckabee] is a quality person, self-made, a great family man and he has a great vision for our country. And I'm here to excite the crowd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/25/huckabee-tailgates-and-welcomes-wrestler-support/ |title=Huckabee tailgates and welcomes wrestler support |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |date= November 25, 2007|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flair endorsed [[Ted Cruz]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=PaulFSU|author=FSU Paul|number=630411988838031360|date=9 August 2015|title=@nwalker6399 @RealBPhil I'm not against Trump.

===Medical problems===
Flair has a heart condition called [[alcoholic cardiomyopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ric-Flair-Be-Man-WWE/dp/0743456912/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=To Be the Man|first=Ric|last=Flair|authorlink=Ric Flair|editor=Mark Madden|publisher=[[WWE Books]]|via=[[Pocket Books]]|edition=1st|location=[[Stamford, Connecticut]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0743456913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2017, Flair had surgery in Georgia to remove an [[bowel obstruction|obstructive piece of his bowel]], which led to various complications, most seriously [[kidney failure]], necessitating [[dialysis]] treatment and ongoing hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/08/17/ric-flair-heath-update|title=Ric Flair Had Part of His Bowel Removed During Latest Health Scare|first=Justin|last=Barrasso|publisher=SI.com|date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from rehabilitation and allowed to return home on September 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0922/632433/impact-star-rips-promoter-for-alleged-sexism/|title=Impact Star Rips Promoter For Alleged Sexism, Ric Flair Returns Home, Mia Yim Added To MLW: One Shot - WrestlingInc.com|work=WrestlingInc.com|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real life feuds and backstage problems ==

=== Bret Hart ===
Flair engaged in an off-screen rivalry with [[Bret Hart]]. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview in which he said Flair "sucks" and described his workplace, WCW, as "minor league".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Oliver, Sean (director)|year=2014|title=Timeline: History of WCW - 93 - Told by Vader|medium=DVD|publisher=Kayfabe Commentaries|quote=1993 - October - Bret Hart buries Ric Flair and WCW - Bret Hart was on Toronto all-sports radio station 'The FAN' and buried WCW and Ric Flair during an interview, saying WCW is 'minor league' and Flair 'sucks'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Flair's autobiography, he accused Hart of over-exploiting the death of his brother [[Owen Hart|Owen]] and the controversy surrounding the [[Montreal Screwjob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=887C21B7-3048-52EA-1E34C39B8C6042BE|title=Flair Pulls No Punches in Book|author=Mike Mooneyham|date= July 4, 2004|accessdate=May 14, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224923/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=887C21B7-3048-52EA-1E34C39B8C6042BE|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|draw]] in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as "plain ridiculous" in a column written for the ''[[Calgary Sun]]''. Hart cited his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while alleging that Flair wrestled to near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers [[Mick Foley]] and [[Randy Savage]], both personal friends of Hart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/columns/news/brethartonflair.html|title=Bret Hart on Flair|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart went on to criticize Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart|title=Hitman: My real life in the cartoon world of wrestling|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2007|location=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=9780091932862|page=303 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart|title=Hitman: My real life in the cartoon world of wrestling|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2007|location=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=9780091932862|page=286 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have reconciled and are now friends.&lt;ref&gt;Flair, Ric; Bret Hart, ''WOOOOO! Nation with Ric Flair'', "Episode 3: Bret "The Hitman" Hart", [[CBS Local Media]], 2015-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shane Douglas ===
Flair also had a long running feud with [[Shane Douglas]], who would refer to him as "Dick Flair" and accuse him of sabotaging his push in the NWA/WCW after getting a solid push and a rub from his tag team partner Ricky Steamboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingBiosD/douglas_00aug23.html|title=The Franchise on Flair &amp; Russo|author=John F.

He called Douglas out as well as accused him of steroid abuse during a broadcast of the Internet radio show ''WCW Live!'' in which he said that he would meet him anytime and anywhere if he would "take the needle out of his ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sporttoday.org/2_531d38a3edf41d6c_1.htm|title=Roid Abuser Ric Flair's PKB on Shane Douglas.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mick Foley ===
Flair has also had problems with [[Mick Foley]]. In his 1999 autobiography ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|Have a Nice Day!]]'', Foley said that "Flair was every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it".&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. ''Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweat socks'' (p.2)&lt;/ref&gt; This was in reference to how poorly Foley thought he was booked during his WCW career when Flair was on the booking committee. Flair responded in his autobiography by writing: "I do not care how many thumbtacks Mick Foley has fallen on, how many ladders he's fallen off, how many continents he's supposedly bled on, he will always be known as a glorified stuntman".&lt;ref name=Flair2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Flair|first=Ric|year=2004|title=Ric Flair: to Be the Man|page=211|isbn=0-7434-9181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have reconciled and are now friends.&lt;ref&gt;Flair, Ric; Mick Foley, ''WOOOOO! Nation with Ric Flair'', "Episode 5: Hardcore Mick Foley and Ric Flair one on one!", [[CBS Local Media]], 2015-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hulk Hogan ===
In his book, Flair also touched on some real-life tension between himself and [[Hulk Hogan]] which largely stemmed from an incident that followed the conclusion of a tag team match between Flair and his son David and the team of [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Barry Windham]] at WCW's Souled Out pay-per-view on January 17, 1999, in Charleston, West Virginia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, Flair has stated that he and Hogan remained friends despite their differences.&lt;ref&gt;Flair, Ric; Hulk Hogan, WOOOOO!

=== Bruno Sammartino ===
Flair and wrestler [[Bruno Sammartino]] had a real-life disagreement over what reports call "the infamous backstage snub" where Flair claims that Sammartino refused to shake his hand at a live event.&lt;ref name=brunopwinsider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=29056|title=BRUNO SAMMARTINO SHOOTS HARD ON RIC FLAIR AND EXPLAINS WHY HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HIM AT ALL|publisher=pwinsider.com|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Flair claims Sammartino ignored him due to comments made in his book, stating Sammartino was "a Northeast star who couldn’t draw fans outside New York",&lt;ref name=brunopwinsider/&gt; Sammartino referred to Flair as a "liar" and stating: "No, I don't respect Ric Flair.

'''Richard Bissell Prosser''' (25 August 1838 – 18 March 1918) was a [[patent examiner]] and a biographical writer. He was the eldest son of [[Richard Prosser (engineer)|Richard Prosser]], the [[Birmingham]], [[England]], engineer and inventor. R. B. Prosser was educated at [[University College School]], London where he was a fellow pupil of [[Joseph Chamberlain]].

Richard Prosser was heavily involved with the introduction of the [[Patent Law Amendment Act 1852]], and his 700-volume library, combined with that of [[Bennet Woodcroft]],(1803-1879) formed the basis of the [[Patent Office Library]], which opened on 5 March 1854.

Richard Prosser died in 1854; in 1856 R. B. Prosser joined the [[Office of the Commissioners of Patents]], London, where he later rose to become Chief Examiner. He was forced to retire early, in 1888, because of partial blindness, but continued to take an active part in local government and church life in [[St Pancras, London]], where he lived. He was much involved in national [[Church of England]] organisations. He married Anne Ostell, daughter of William Ostell of Bloomsbury, London; she died in 1911. They had a daughter and three sons.

R. B. Prosser was greatly interested in technical history, and in particular the biographies of inventors. This was due to his work on [[patent]]s, where he needed to be able to assess the priority of them - a knowledge of patents history was vital for this. He wrote 58 lives for the [[Dictionary of National Biography]], and supplied much material for the [[New English Dictionary]]. Prosser also wrote ''Birmingham Inventors and Inventions'', 1881, in a limited edition of 50 copies. This was a cumulation of notes he had published earlier in the ''[[Birmingham Gazette]]''. A similar work on Manchester inventors was never finished. His 315 contributions  to 'St Pancras Notes and Queries' in the ''St. Pancras Guardian'' between 3 February 1897 and 2 January 1903 were later published in a book of 150 copies. He was a frequent contributor to [[Notes and Queries]], as well as to technical periodicals. Prosser had in mind to write a history of invention, written around the abstracts of British Patent Specifications, but the project never got further than the planning stage.

Prosser died, aged 79. His library was dispersed by auction, and his files of biographical notes were sold for about £50. They surfaced again in the 1970s, to be bought by the [[British Library]], Dept of Manuscripts, Add Ms 54,496 - 54,507. They comprise 24 volumes and cover over 1600 names.  More of Prosser's papers are in Birmingham and Manchester reference libraries, having been presented either by himself in his lifetime or by his family after his death. The on-line catalogue of the National Archives lists small collections of Prosser's papers for patentees in the South West of England, Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. These might be part of his history of inventions project, noted above.

Prosser was a pioneer of the study of technical history, and his published  biographies and manuscript records are an incomparable source for present-day researchers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1109">Known as the "Software Reliability Program Standard", '''SAE JA1002''' was published in January 2004 by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]. It is a standard that provides a framework for the management of [[software reliability]] within system reliability requirements. It is intended to serve the needs of industry organizations in meeting [[software]] product reliability objectives and can be employed as deliverables contacted between a customer and a supplier.

SAE JA1002 is based around the Software Reliability Plan and Software Reliability Case. The Software Reliability Case can be created or maintained to serve the needs of a support organization in sustaining reliability objectives and be used to supply the data needed by independent, regulatory, and/or third party certification bodies.

The '''''Seven Grievances''''' ([[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠨᠠᡩᠠᠨ&lt;br&gt;ᡴᠣᡵᠣ}} ''nadan koro''; {{zh|c=七大恨|p=Qī Dà Hèn}}) was a [[manifesto]] announced by [[Nurhaci]] on the Thirteenth day of the Fourth lunar month in the Third year of Tianming era ({{zh|c=天命}}; 7 May 1618&lt;ref&gt;http://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/&lt;/ref&gt;). It effectively declared [[war]] against the [[Ming dynasty]].

The seven grievances are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/History2732bye7940.html|title=Seven Grievances|publisher=culture-china.com| date=|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Ming killed [[Taksi|Nurhaci's father]] and [[Giocangga|grandfather]] without reason;
# The Ming suppressed [[Jianzhou Jurchens|Jianzhou]] and favored [[Yehe Nara|Yehe]] and Hada clans;
# The Ming violated agreement of territories with Nurhaci;
# The Ming sent troops to protect Yehe against Jianzhou;
# The Ming supported Yehe to break its promise to Nurhaci;
# The Ming forced Nurhaci to give up the lands in Chaihe, Sancha and Fuan;
# The Ming's official Shang Bozhi abused his power and rode roughshod over the people.

After the announcement of the ''Seven Grievances'', the attack on [[Battle of Fushun|Fushun]] started. Han defectors played a very important role in the Qing conquest of China.  Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were often given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] [[w:zh:李永芳|李永芳]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Walthall|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=To+win+the+support+and+cooperation+of+Ming+generals+in+Liaodong,+Nurhaci+gave+them+Aisin+Gioro+women+as+wives.+In+1618,+before+he+attacked+Fushun+city,+he+promised+the+Ming+general+defending+the+city+a+woman+from+the+Aisin+Gioro+clan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=O-ChToi7Jsn20gHW4ayvCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=To%20win%20the%20support%20and%20cooperation%20of%20Ming%20generals%20in%20Liaodong%2C%20Nurhaci%20gave%20them%20Aisin%20Gioro%20women%20as%20wives.%20In%201618%2C%20before%20he%20attacked%20Fushun%20city%2C%20he%20promised%20the%20Ming%20general%20defending%20the%20city%20a%20woman%20from%20the%20Aisin%20Gioro%20clan&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25444-2|pages=148–}}

The Manchus scored successive victories, the most famous{{By whom|date=July 2011}} of which was near the town of [[Sarhu]]. The Ming dynasty was wearied by a combination of internal strife and constant harassment by the Manchu.

On May 26, 1644, Beijing fell to a peasant rebel army led by [[Li Zicheng]]. During the turmoil, [[Chongzhen Emperor|the last Ming emperor]] hanged himself on [[Guilty Chinese Scholartree|a tree in the imperial garden]] outside the [[Forbidden City]]. The Manchus then allied with Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li Zicheng's short-lived [[Shun dynasty]], establishing the [[Qing dynasty]] rule in China.

'''''Shrouds of the Somme''''' is an artwork by British artist [[Rob Heard]] which commemorates the 72,396 servicemen from the [[British Commonwealth]] with no known grave, whose names are recorded at [[Thiepval Memorial]] as [[missing in action|missing]] [[presumed dead]] at the [[Battle of the Somme]].  It is estimated that more than three million men fought in the battle, and more than one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the [[List of battles by casualties|bloodiest battles]] in human history.  

The work comprises 72,396 small human figurines, each separately wrapped in a [[calico]] [[shroud]] which was cut and sewn by hand.  The full installation was laid out at the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] from 8 to 18 November 2018, over the centenary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] that ended the [[First World War]].

==Background==
Heard started the work after suffering injuries to his hands in a car accident in 2013 which prevented him continuing with his earlier artworks.  He was inspired by injured British servicemen returning from [[Afghanistan]], and the difficulty to envision the 19,240 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, on 1 July 1916.  The shrouded figures draw in part from the films of [[Ridley Scott]], and presents a tangible three dimensional representation of each dead soldier and of the scale of the casualties.  

Determined to make each figure an individual, each shroud covers a plastic figurine approximately {{convert|12|in}} long (approximately 1:6 scale); the figurines are jointed so each can take its own slightly different position.  The calico shrouds are cut by hand, wrapped around the figure, and then sewn up and tied on.  As he worked, Heard crossed off a name from the official list of the missing for each shrouded figure he completed, creating a relationship between that figure and a specific person.  Heard built a shed in his garden in Somerset to assemble and store the shrouded figures.  He received early financial support from songwriter [[Steve Knightley]], [[Exeter City Council]], and the [[Exeter Chiefs]] Foundation.

After completing and exhibiting 19,240 shrouded figures, Heard resolved to expand the work by adding another 60,000 figures to represent all 72,396 Commonwealth soldiers missing during the 5 months of the Battle of the Somme, from 1 July and 18 November 1916.  He aimed to complete the work for the centenary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War.  Heard's work was supported by a team including Shrouds of the Somme committee chairman Commodore Jake Moores, project director Mel Bradley, and (from June 2017) project patron [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]].  Completing the work took approximately 13,000 hours, working almost continuously on this project over the five years from 2013 to the [[First World War centenary|centenary of the end of the First World War]] in 2018, finishing only days before the completed work went on display in London.  Support was received from a number of organisations, including [[VolkerFitzpatrick]], [[DHL]], [[West Ham United F.C.]], [[Westfield Group]], [[Network Rail]], [[Transport for London]] and [[Waitrose]].

==Exhibition==
An assemblage of 19,240 shrouded figures was laid out by soldiers from the 6th battalion of [[The Rifles]] and exhibited in Exeter for the centenary of the Battle of the Somme in July 2016, attracting over 60,000 visitors.  The assemblage was then exhibited in Bristol for [[Remembrance Sunday]], in November 2016.   

The extended work was laid out as "The Trench" in Exeter in June 2018, with approaching 72,000 models stacked in {{cvt|2.3|m}} high wooden frames to create a replica trench about {{cvt|45|m}} long that the public could walk through.  The names of the missing were listed on the outside of the frames.

After displays in Salisbury, Exeter, Belfast, Bristol in the UK, and at [[Thiepval]] in France, the full installation was laid out at the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]], in [[Stratford, London|Stratford, East London]], in November 2018, with all 72,396 models placed on a lawn in strictly regimented rows by volunteers from the 1st battalion, [[Royal Anglian Regiment]].  The shrouds took three days to put in place, covering an area of {{cvt|4000|sqm}} on the South Park Lawn near the [[ArcelorMittal Orbit]].  It was described by the historian [[Dan Snow]] as "the most remarkable First World War commemoration you will ever see".

Displayed alongside the main installation was "Lost Lives", a separate display of 1,561 shrouds, one for each day of the First World War, with each shrouded figure accompanied by a cross listing the number of Commonwealth war casualties on that day.  Posters with copies of the official list of the missing were displayed nearby.  During the exhibition, volunteers recited names from the list.

The installation went on public display from Thursday 8 to Sunday 18 November, with free entry.  A memorial service was held on Sunday 11 November 2018, led by Reverend Canon [[Flora Winfield]].  The exhibition was visited by [[Anne, Princess Royal]] on Thursday 15 November. 

Donations were collected for [[SSAFA]] - the Armed Forces charity, and the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].  The models will be sold for £35 each, with proceeds also donated to those two charities.

Sting held 25 total championships throughout his career, including 21 between WCW and TNA.

== Early life ==
Borden was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]],&lt;ref name="SLAM"/&gt; and raised in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=sportsvibe&gt;[http://sportsvibe.co.uk/news/other/wrestling-legend-sting-on-how-it-all-began-and-turning-down-the-wwe/ Wrestling Legend Sting on How it all Began and Turning Down the WWE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219112834/http://sportsvibe.co.uk/news/other/wrestling-legend-sting-on-how-it-all-began-and-turning-down-the-wwe/ |date=December 19, 2014 }} Sportsvibe.co.uk. April 21, 2011; retrieved December 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He played competitive football and basketball in high school and later embarked on a career in [[bodybuilding]], once co-owning a [[Gold's Gym]] health club.&lt;ref name=SLAM/&gt; Borden had no interest in professional wrestling and no television access to it within his home community, but decided to pursue a career in the industry after being taken to an "incredible" [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) event in [[Los Angeles]] where he saw [[Hulk Hogan]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[The British Bulldogs]], [[André the Giant]] and others perform.&lt;ref name=sportsvibe/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Continental Wrestling Association (1985–1986) ===
Borden, originally wrestling under the ring name Flash, [[Tag team|teamed]] with [[The Ultimate Warrior|Jim "Justice" Hellwig]] as two members of Power Team USA in independent All-California Championship Wrestling. Power Team USA was a four-man unit also featuring Garland "Glory" Donahoe and Mark "Commando" Miller, plus manager Rick Bassman.&lt;ref&gt;PWI Centrefold: Sting, [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] May 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Hellwig and Borden later moved to the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), a wrestling company based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and became known as the Freedom Fighters.&lt;ref name=PWIWarrior&gt;PWI Centrefold: The Ultimate Warrior, [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] October 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were slow to respond to the lumbering hulks, so the team [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]].&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrestling Timeline: Sting|work=The Wrestler/Inside Wrestling|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=Volume 15, 2007|pages=66–71|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molinaro"&gt;Molinaro, page 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The Freedom Fighters left the CWA after an uneventful run, the highlight of which was an angle in which they broke the leg of veteran wrestler [[Phil Hickerson]].&lt;ref name=PWIWarrior /&gt;

=== Universal Wrestling Federation (1986–1987) ===
The duo surfaced in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF), an organization run by [[Bill Watts]] and based in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] where they were known as the [[Blade Runners]]. Borden changed his ring name from Flash to Sting, while Hellwig became known as Rock.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; They soon joined Hotstuff &amp; Hyatt International, a heel stable headed by [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|"Hot Stuff" Eddie Gilbert]] and [[Missy Hyatt]]. Together with "Russian" wrestler Kortsia Korchenko, the Blade Runners became henchmen in Gilbert's on-screen feud with Watts. Hellwig, who would later become The Ultimate Warrior in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE), left the promotion in mid-1986, leaving Sting without a partner. Sting won the [[UWF World Tag Team Championship]] twice with Gilbert in 1986 and a third time with [[Rick Steiner]] in 1987.

Following a match against [[Terry Taylor]] in mid-1987, Gilbert interfered on Taylor's behalf, costing Sting the match. Taylor and Gilbert ganged up on Sting until [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Gentleman Chris Adams]] came to Sting's aid. Adams cleared the ring and then asked Sting if he was with him or against him in his feud with Taylor and Gilbert. Sting turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] by declaring his allegiance to Adams.

Behind the scenes, Gilbert endorsed Borden by telling a [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|dirt sheet]] that Sting would be a megastar in the future. Later that year, Sting was tabbed to win the [[UWF Television Championship]], then held by Gilbert, until [[Jim Crockett]] of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) bought the company from Watts. Crockett's booker, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], decided to put the Television title on Taylor to set up a feud between Taylor and [[WCW World Television Championship|NWA Television Champion]] [[Nikita Koloff]] to [[Championship unification|unify]] the two titles. Rhodes used then-unknown [[Shane Douglas]] as the [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|transitional champion]] from Gilbert to Taylor because Rhodes did not want to diminish Sting's growing stardom with a brief title run.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling ===
==== Rise to stardom (1987–1989) ====
Sometime after Sting's arrival to the NWA in July 1987, Dusty Rhodes used the opening bout of Crockett's first foray into [[pay-per-view]], [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade '87]], to showcase the young superstar. Sting partnered with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael P.S. Hayes]] and [[Jimmy Garvin]] in a six-man tag team match against Gilbert, Steiner, and [[Larry Zbyszko]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=1094&amp;page=2|title=Card « NWA Starrcade 1987 - "Chi-Town Heat" « Events Database « CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|last=Kreikenbohm|first=Philip|website=www.cagematch.net|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ended in a 15-minute time-limit draw.

Having established himself as a rising star, Sting was one of the few UWF alumni to be [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|pushed]] in the NWA. At the inaugural [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions I|Clash of the Champions]] in March 1988, Sting challenged [[Ric Flair]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. The match ended in a draw after the 45-minute time limit expired and the ringside judges could not declare a winner.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molinaro, page 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Sting lost to Flair in several non-televised rematches following the Clash and, later that year, battled other members of Flair's stable, the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]]. Sting teamed with Koloff at [[The Great American Bash (1988)|The Great American Bash]] in July 1988 to challenge Horsemen [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]]; Blanchard and Anderson retained the titles when the match ended in a 20-minute time-limit draw.

Rhodes continued to [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|book]] Sting in title matches throughout the year against both [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Champion]] [[Barry Windham]] and NWA Television Champion [[Mike Rotunda]]. In the fall of 1988, Sting was attacked by [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]] and [[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]] of [[The Road Warriors]] after a televised match. Rhodes, as booker, identified Sting as the face who was most [[List of professional wrestling terms#O|over]] with the fans, despite knowing that turning the Road Warriors heel would be no easy task. Rhodes himself teamed with Sting to challenge the Road Warriors for the tag team championship at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade '88]] that December. Rhodes and Sting got the win by disqualification, allowing the Road Warriors to retain the titles.

Sting returned to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's [[Omni Coliseum|Omni]] on New Year's Day. He would also have his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), with his most notable match in AJPW against [[Dan Spivey]] on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as [[The Iron Sheik]]. In mid-1989, [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] challenged Sting at [[The Great American Bash (1989)|The Great American Bash]]. The match was booked with a classic, controversial [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dusty finish|Dusty finish]] even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|three-count]] and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a [[No Disqualification match]] against Sting at a live event in September by using a [[Blackjack (weapon)|blackjack]] to get the win and the title.

In the main event of that year's Great American Bash, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against [[Terry Funk]], who was a member of [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]]'s [[J-Tex Corporation]]. After Flair got the victory, he was attacked by Funk's stablemate, Muta. Sting came to the aid of his old rival Flair, and the two feuded with Muta and Funk for the rest of the summer and fall, culminating in a [[Domo de la Muerte|Thunderdome Cage match]] between the two teams, which Flair and Sting won, at [[Halloween Havoc 1989|Halloween Havoc '89]]. The alliance with Flair resulted in Sting joining the newly reformed and now-face Four Horsemen along with the Andersons, [[Arn Anderson|Arn]] and [[Ole Anderson|Ole]] (kayfabe cousins). Sting finished out the year by winning a four-man round-robin Iron Man tournament at [[Starrcade (1989)|Starrcade '89]]. In the final match of the night, Sting defeated Flair to accumulate the necessary points to win the tournament. The victory made Sting the number one contender for Flair's NWA World title, leading to tension within the Four Horsemen.

==== Feud with The Four Horsemen (1990–1991) ====
Sting was summarily dismissed from The Four Horsemen on February 6, 1990, at [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout|Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]] after refusing to relinquish his title shot against Flair, thus restarting their rivalry. Later that evening, Borden suffered a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimate]] knee injury while interfering in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cages|steel cage match]] featuring the Horsemen.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Borden's injury forced the bookers of [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), the dominant promotion in the NWA, to find a new opponent for Flair for the forthcoming [[Wrestlewar 1990|WrestleWar]] pay-per-view event.

[[Lex Luger]] was chosen to challenge Flair at WrestleWar. During the match between Flair and Luger, Sting came down to motivate Luger to come back and beat Flair. Before this Sting and Luger had been at odds. When Luger was close to winning Sting was attacked by Ole Anderson. Luger opted to save the already injured Sting and ended up losing the match by countout while assisting his friend. Behind the scenes, WCW officials had wanted Flair to drop the title to Luger at WrestleWar, but Flair refused, saying he had promised Borden he would hold the title until Borden could return to the ring. Despite the injury, Sting was still utilized on television and pay per views when necessary.

At the [[Capital Combat]] event in May, Sting was accosted by the Four Horsemen and thrown into a metal cage at ringside. In a promotional crossover, Sting was rescued by his buddy [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robocoparchive.com/info/cameo/wrestle.htm|title=Robocop – Or Should that be RoboCrap?|publisher=Robocoparchive.com|date=|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Borden's recovery, Sting finally defeated Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on July 7, 1990, at [[The Great American Bash (1990)|The Great American Bash]].&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Sting went on to feud with title contenders Flair and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. Vicious appeared to defeat Sting in a title match at the 1990 [[Halloween Havoc 1990|Halloween Havoc]], but the "Sting" that Vicious pinned was revealed to be an impostor played by Horseman [[Barry Windham]]. The real Sting appeared soon after and pinned Vicious to retain his title after the match was restarted.

During Sting's title run, a masked man known as [[The Black Scorpion (professional wrestling)|The Black Scorpion]] would taunt and attack Sting on many occasions. This feud culminated in a final showdown between Sting and The Black Scorpion at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade: Collision Course]] in December. The cage match ended with Sting pinning and unmasking the Scorpion, who turned out to be Flair in disguise.

==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1991–1993) ====
[[File:Sting.JPG|thumb|Sting in his surfer gimmick]]
Sting's first world championship reign ended January 11, 1991, when Flair defeated him in a rematch from Starrcade. In the same month, WCW seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance, in the process recognizing a [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] and a [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]. Sting then took part in what many consider to be the best match of 1991, teaming with Luger to face [[The Steiner Brothers]] at the [[SuperBrawl I]] pay-per-view for the world tag-team titles. The Steiners won by pinfall after Koloff, who had been feuding with Luger, interfered in the match by swinging a chain at Luger but hitting Sting instead. Consequently, Sting feuded with Koloff throughout the summer of 1991.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; In August 1991, Sting defeated [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] to win a tournament for the vacated [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Sting held the title for 86 days before losing it to [[Rick Rude]] at [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XVII|Clash of the Champions XVII]].

At [[Starrcade (1991)|Starrcade '91]], Sting won the first-ever [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)#Battlebowl|Battlebowl]] battle royal, for which he received a Battlebowl championship ring. Sting then became embroiled in a feud with the [[Dangerous Alliance]], headed by manager [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]]. The stable targeted Sting because he was the so-called "franchise" of WCW, and the Alliance vowed to destroy both Sting and the promotion he was the face of. At the same time, Sting was being targeted by Luger, who had once again turned heel and, as WCW Champion, viewed Sting as a threat. Sting engaged in many matches with Dangerous Alliance members, especially Rude, who was the group's biggest star. It was during this feud that Sting won the first of his six WCW World Heavyweight Championships, defeating Luger on February 29, 1992, at [[SuperBrawl II]].&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; The feud ended when Sting formed Sting's Squadron, consisting of allies [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Dustin Rhodes]], Windham, and Koloff, and defeated the Alliance (Rude, Austin, Arn Anderson, Zbyszko, and [[Bobby Eaton]]) in a [[WarGames match]] at [[Wrestlewar 1992|WrestleWar]] in May 1992. [[Dave Meltzer]] awarded the match his highest rating of five stars.

Near the end of Sting's battles with the Dangerous Alliance, the seeds were sown for what became arguably one of the most famous feuds of Sting's career. Sting defended his WCW World title on April 12, 1992, at [[Omni Coliseum|The Omni]] in [[Atlanta]] against the 450-pound [[Big Van Vader]]. During the match, Vader [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Corner slingshot splash|splashed]] Sting, cracking three of Sting's ribs and rupturing his spleen. Sting recovered and defended his title on July 12 against Vader at [[The Great American Bash (1992)|The Great American Bash]], dropping the belt to Big Van Vader after missing a Stinger Splash, hitting his head on the ringpost, and receiving a [[powerbomb]]. After beating [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] in a [[Falls Count Anywhere Match]] at [[Beach Blast 1992|Beach Blast]]&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. [[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks]] (p.223)&lt;/ref&gt; and WCW newcomer [[Jake Roberts]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Coal Miner's Glove match]] at [[Halloween Havoc 1992|Halloween Havoc]], Sting defeated Vader, who had lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in August, in the "King of Cable" tournament final at [[Starrcade 1992|Starrcade]].

The Sting-Vader feud continued into 1993, with Vader, who was again WCW World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Sting in a bloody [[Strap match]] at [[SuperBrawl III]]. Sting exacted revenge by beating Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on March 11 in [[London]], England, but lost it back to Vader six days later in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Sting then teamed with WCW newcomer [[Davey Boy Smith]] to beat the team of Vader and Vicious at [[Beach Blast 1993|Beach Blast]] in a match that was set up by a mini-movie in which an evil midget blew up Sting's boat. At the end of 1993, Sting was one of the first people to congratulate Flair, who had just returned from the World Wrestling Federation, after his WCW World Heavyweight Title victory over Vader at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]].

==== WCW International World Heavyweight Champion (1994–1995) ====
Sting feuded with Vader and Rude through the first half of 1994. Sting won the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship]] from Rude in April. Rude recaptured the title on May 1 at [[Wrestling Dontaku#1994|Wrestling Dontaku 1994]] in [[Japan]], but the decision was reversed because Rude had allegedly hit Sting with the title belt during the match; this was to cover for a real-life back injury Rude sustained in the match that forced Rude into retirement. Sting refused to have the title handed to him and instead defeated Vader for the vacant WCW International World Heavyweight Championship at [[Slamboree 1994|Slamboree]]. Soon afterward, Flair defeated Sting in a title unification match at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXVII|Clash of the Champions XXVII]]'', turning heel in the final moments of the match when [[Sherri Martel|Sensuous Sherri]] turned on Sting and took Flair's side. Sting spent the second half of 1994 and most of 1995 teaming with new arrival [[Hulk Hogan]] in his battles against [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]'s [[The Three Faces of Fear|Three Faces of Fear]] and its successor stable, [[The Dungeon of Doom]].

At [[The Great American Bash (1995)|The Great American Bash 1995]], Sting defeated [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]] to win another tournament for the WCW United States Championship. Sting defeated Meng in a rematch for the title at [[Bash at the Beach 1995]]. Sting was on the first ever ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' in a match where Flair defeated Sting by disqualification as a result of a [[Rub (professional wrestling)|run-in]] by Arn Anderson to attack Flair. At [[Fall Brawl 1995|Fall Brawl]], Sting teamed with Hogan, Luger, and [[Randy Savage]] to defeat the Dungeon of Doom, consisting of [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], [[Brutus Beefcake|Zodiac]], [[John Tenta|Shark]] and Meng, in the event's [[WarGames match]]. In October 1995, Flair convinced Sting to team with him in a match against Anderson and [[Brian Pillman]] at [[Halloween Havoc 1995|Halloween Havoc]]. Anderson and Pillman had attacked Flair earlier in the night, rendering Flair unable to come out for the first part of the match. Sting fended off his opponents until Flair emerged. Later in the match, Flair turned on Sting and reformed the Four Horsemen with Anderson and Pillman, later adding [[Chris Benoit]] to fill out the group.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;

Sting defeated Flair on a subsequent ''Nitro'' with the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Scorpion Deathlock]], refusing to let go until Luger persuaded him to do so. Sting defeated Flair again at the [[World War 3 1995|World War 3]] pay-per-view. Later in the night, Sting competed in the [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)#World War 3|World War 3 battle royal]] for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Savage. Sting's alliances with Hogan and Savage led the Horsemen to attack them as well. Sting's second U.S. title reign lasted until November 13, when he was defeated by [[Kensuke Sasaki]] in Japan. At [[Starrcade 1995|Starrcade]], Sting defeated Sasaki, representing [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], in a non-title match to win the World Cup of Wrestling for WCW. In the next match that night, Sting lost a [[Triple Threat match|Triangle match]] involving Flair and Luger; Flair won by countout to become number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair won from Savage in the next match.

==== Feud with the New World Order (1996–1998) ====
[[File:Nash and Sting at Nitro 1998.jpg|thumb|Sting (right) drastically changed his appearance in 1996 after the formation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] which included [[Kevin Nash]] (left)]]
Early in 1996, Sting's appearance started to change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing his blond [[flattop]] haircut, and he often wore black tights with a multi-colored [[scorpion]], although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful [[Body painting|face paint]]. Sting [[Sting and Lex Luger|teamed with his old friend Luger]], who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat [[Harlem Heat]] for the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on the January 22 edition of ''Nitro''. The team often retained the championship as a result of Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for [[Uncensored 1996|WCW Uncensored]] in March, Harlem Heat member [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against [[Big Show|The Giant]] at [[Slamboree 1996|Slamboree]] in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of ''Nitro''.

In the summer of 1996, Sting was the first to stand up to [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]]: [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]], who had recently competed in the WWF and whose alliances and agenda were unclear, had been infiltrating and causing chaos at WCW events. Sting teamed with Luger and Savage to defend WCW against Hall, Nash, and a mysterious third Outsider to be revealed at the [[Bash at the Beach (1996)|Bash at the Beach]]. Hall and Nash started the bout without their third partner, but the WCW's temporary three-on-two advantage was short-lived: Luger left the match after he was accidentally injured by a mistimed Stinger Splash. The two-on-two match continued while Hogan, who had been a fan favorite for nearly fifteen years, emerged at ringside. Hogan appeared ready to back up the WCW wrestlers until he attacked Savage with his [[leg drop]] finisher in one of wrestling's most famous [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|swerves]]. The match was ruled a no-contest, and Hall, Nash, and Hogan declared a [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|new world order]] in professional wrestling. The name stuck and Sting became one of WCW's stalwarts against the New World Order, or nWo for short.

As part of this, Sting and Luger went up to rivals and [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] members [[Ric Flair]] and [[Arn Anderson]] some time after Bash at the Beach and asked them to team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their differences for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at [[Fall Brawl 1996|Fall Brawl]] in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the ''Nitro'' prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by [[Jeff Farmer (wrestler)|Jeff Farmer]], attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of ''Nitro'' and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, "Is that good enough for you right there? Is that proof enough?" Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture and walked out of the match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on ''Nitro'', Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: 

{{quote|I want a chance to explain something that happened last Monday night at ''Nitro''. Last Monday night I was on an airplane flying from L.A. to Atlanta. When I got to Atlanta, I tuned in the TV to ''Nitro''. And I thought I was watching a rerun! It was a very convincing film. Often imitated, but never duplicated though! And what else did I see? I saw people, I saw wrestlers, I saw commentators, and I saw best friends DOUBT... the Stinger. That's right, doubted the Stinger! So I heard Lex Luger say 'I know where he lives, I know where he works out, I'm gonna go get him.' So I said to myself, I'll just go into seclusion. I'll wait and see what happens on [[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]], and I tuned in Saturday night, and what'd I see? More of the same... more DOUBT. Which brings me to Fall Brawl. I knew I had to get to Fall Brawl and get face to face with the Total Package to let him know that it wasn't me. And what I got out of that was, 'No Sting... I DON'T BELIEVE YOU STING!' Well, all I gotta say is I have been mediator, I have been babysitter for Lex Luger, and I've given him the benefit of the doubt about ''a thousand times'' in the last twelve months! And I've carried the WCW banner, and I have given my blood, my sweat, and my ''tears'' for WCW! So for all of those fans out there and all those wrestlers and people that never doubted the Stinger, I'll stand by you if you stand by me! But for all of the people, all of the commentators, all of the wrestlers, and all of the best friends who did doubt me, you can stick it! From now on I consider myself a free agent.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nwo original"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/n/nwo-original.html|title=nWo Original Profile|accessdate=2008-01-24|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nwopage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingencyclopedia.com/nwo/history.html|title=New World Order History|work=Wrestling Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107091544/http://www.wrestlingencyclopedia.com/nwo/history.html|archivedate=January 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wcwppv/fallbrawl96.html|title=Fall Brawl 1996 results|accessdate=2008-01-26|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Declaring he would be "popping in from time to time" afterwards, Sting threw the microphone down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, to take part in the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated [[Masahiro Chono]] in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by [[Shiro Koshinaka]]. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of ''Nitro'', Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling [[Jerry Lynn|Mr. JL]], Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]] inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, [[Ted DiBiase]] and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a "cheap imitation," before telling the nWo, "the ''real'' Sting may or may not be in your price range," and then concluded by saying "the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure".  With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on [[Microphone|mic]]) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a [[baseball bat]] as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white [[corpse paint]]. Sting's new [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was inspired by the 1994 film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''. In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on [[QVC]] Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from ''The Crow''. Sting maintains aspects of his "Crow" persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.

In a series of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was provoked enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon back as if he were going to assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a "blackballed" Randy Savage returned to WCW for the first time since [[Halloween Havoc (1996)|Halloween Havoc]] and aligned himself with Sting as a "free agent" as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President [[Eric Bischoff]], also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at [[SuperBrawl VII]] in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch [[Roddy Piper]] face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at [[Uncensored 1997|WCW Uncensored]] in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, [[Chicago Bulls]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Dennis Rodman]], Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical [[zip-line]]. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW.

In subsequent weeks, Sting frequently rappelled from the rafters or came up through the ring to attack unsuspecting nWo members, came to the aid of wrestlers once subjected to his loyalty test as they battled the nWo, and employed decoy "Stings" to play mind games with the nWo during the closing segments of ''Nitro''. Sting's appearances to fight the nWo at the end of almost every ''Nitro'' helped WCW keep and widen its [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] advantage over the WWF's [[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]] throughout the summer. On-screen [[Professional wrestling authority figures|WCW commissioner]] [[James J. Dillon]] tried many times to get Sting to return to wrestling by making contracts to fight various nWo members. Sting, however, did not accept any of the contracts, often tearing them up in Dillon's face. A confused Dillon then asked Sting who he wanted on one edition of ''Nitro'', and Sting went out to ringside, picked up a fan's sign, and pointed out one name on it: Hogan. Eventually Sting got his wish and he and Hogan finally met in December at [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade]] for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The finish of the match was supposed to echo the [[Montreal Screwjob]] finish that the WWF had used to double cross [[Bret Hart]] just one month earlier at their annual [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] event. [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]], the referee for the contest, was supposed to execute a fast count on Sting while Hart, whose signing with WCW was the linchpin for the Montreal Screwjob, would come out to protest the decision and, since he had already served as the guest referee for the match between [[Larry Zbyszko]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] earlier that evening, order the match to be restarted and Sting would emerge victorious by forcing Hogan to submit to the Scorpion Death Lock. However, Patrick did not do his part properly and instead counted the pin at normal speed, which added an unintentional level of controversy to the finish.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;

The next night on ''Nitro'', Hogan protested the decision claiming that Patrick's decision should have been considered final and a rematch was granted. The match ran over ''Nitro's'' allotted time slot and the finish was aired later in the week on the inaugural episode of ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]''. Similar to the Starrcade result, two different referees declared the two different men as the winner. Later that night, Dillon vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, forcing Sting to surrender the belt. Sting responded with his first words (on mic) since October 1996 when he told Dillon, "You've got no guts!" Sting turned to Hogan and said, "And you... You're a dead man!".

==== The Wolfpac (1998–1999) ====
[[File:Sting without makeup 1998.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Borden after a taping of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' in 1998]]
As 1998 began, the nWo began to splinter. Sting recaptured the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship in February at [[SuperBrawl VIII]] with the help of Savage, who was beginning to split from the nWo. Sting went on to successfully defend the title against the likes of Hall, Nash, and [[Diamond Dallas Page]] (DDP). Like Savage, Nash began to pull away from the Hogan-dominated nWo, and Nash helped Savage beat Sting for the championship at [[Spring Stampede 1998|Spring Stampede]] in April. Nash and Savage officially split from the original nWo on May 4, forming the face group nWo Wolfpac, while Hogan's heel faction became identified as nWo Hollywood. The two nWo factions vied for Sting's allegiance, with Sting's friends [[Big Show|The Giant]] joining nWo Hollywood and Luger joining nWo Wolfpac. Sting seemed to have joined nWo Hollywood when he appeared wearing a black and white nWo shirt, but he soon tore off the shirt to reveal the red and black of the nWo Wolfpac. Sting began wearing red and black face paint and tights as a member of nWo Wolfpac.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;

Sting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at [[Slamboree 1998|Slamboree]] in May when Hall turned on his teammate Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and the team was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at [[The Great American Bash (1998)|The Great American Bash]] in June to take control of the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and [[Konnan]] feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 ''Nitro''. Sting and Hart squared off at [[Halloween Havoc 1998|Halloween Havoc]], where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for several months.

Sting returned to ''Nitro'' in March 1999, sporting the black and white ''Crow''-inspired attire he debuted in 1996 and began to participate in more mic work. By this time, the nWo storyline had faded, and Sting was not aligned with any of its factions. Sting competed in the main event of April's [[Spring Stampede 1999|Spring Stampede]], a Four Corners match for the World Championship, against Hogan, DDP, and champion Flair. Savage served as special guest referee and delivered a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|diving elbow drop]] to help DDP win the match and the title.

==== Final world title reigns (1999–2000) ====
Sting defeated Page on the April 26 edition of ''Nitro'' to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the fifth time. Later that night, Sting defended the title in a four-way match featuring DDP, Goldberg, and a returning Nash. DDP pinned Nash, allowing DDP to win the title without directly beating Sting. Sting's 90-minute reign was only the second [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions|shortest WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign in WCW history]]. Sting lost to Rick Steiner in a [[Falls Count Anywhere match]] at [[The Great American Bash (1999)|The Great American Bash]] after he was attacked by Steiner's three pet dogs backstage and Steiner forced the referee to prematurely declare himself the victor, claiming his dogs had pinned Sting for him.

Over the next several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, Vicious, and Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the [[Bash at the Beach 1999|Bash at the Beach]] in July to take on Vicious and Savage of [[Team Madness]]. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan returned from injury on July 12 as a face to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of ''Nitro'' to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, Vicious and Rick Steiner for the next month.

Sting began to question Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in the weeks leading up to [[Fall Brawl 1999|Fall Brawl]]. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a [[baseball bat]] to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of [[The Road Warriors]]' heel turn in late 1988). At [[Halloween Havoc 1999|Halloween Havoc]], Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee [[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.

Sting entered the 32-man tournament that was set up to award the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated [[Brian Knobs]], Meng, and Luger to reach the semi-finals to be held at [[Mayhem (1999)|WCW Mayhem]]. At the November event, Sting lost to Hart, the eventual winner of the tournament. After the match, Sting shook hands with Hart in a sign of respect, turning face again. Sting sought revenge against Luger the next month at [[Starrcade (1999)|Starrcade]]. Sting won by disqualification when Luger and [[Miss Elizabeth|Elizabeth]] assaulted Sting with a steel chair and baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for some time. Sting ended his feud with Luger by defeating him in a [[Lumberjack match|Lumberjacks with Casts match]] at [[Uncensored 2000]] the following March.

==== Last feuds and contract expiration (2000–2002) ====
WCW officials [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]], in an attempt to save the fading company, [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] the storylines on April 10, 2000, and declared all titles vacant. At [[Spring Stampede 2000]] the following week, Sting advanced to the finals of the United States Championship tournament by defeating Booker T and [[Vampiro]] in the first two rounds. Vampiro cost Sting the championship in the finals against Scott Steiner, leading to an intense feud between Sting and Vampiro. Sting pinned Vampiro at [[Slamboree 2000]] in May, and Vampiro beat Sting in a [[Inferno match|Human Torch match]] at [[The Great American Bash (2000)|The Great American Bash]] the next month; for the climax of the match, Borden switched with a stuntman, who was set on fire and thrown off the top of the frame of the stage's entrance video screen. At [[Bash At The Beach 2000|Bash at the Beach 2000]], he returned wearing another Sting mask as men wearing cloaks and Sting masks carried him in a casket, and then he attacked Vampiro.

Sting went on to feud with [[Jeff Jarrett]] and then Scott Steiner. Steiner attacked and injured Sting in November 2000. Sting stayed off WCW programming until the final episode of ''Nitro'' on March 26, 2001. [[History of WCW#Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath|WCW had been purchased]] by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), and the final match in WCW history pitted Sting against his longtime rival Flair; the two had also competed on the very first edition of ''Nitro'' on September 4, 1995. Sting defeated Flair and the two embraced at the end of the contest.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;

After the WWF did not buy out Sting's contract with [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]], he rejected a buyout offer of 50 cents on the dollar from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Sullivan|title=WWE 50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Acs0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165|date=31 March 2014|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-241-00675-7|pages=165–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year).&lt;ref name="SLAM"/&gt; Borden then entered into contract negotiations with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.&lt;ref name="Peltz"/&gt;

=== World Wrestling All-Stars (2002–2003) ===
In 2002, after over a year and a half of hiatus, Borden toured Europe with the [[World Wrestling All-Stars]] (WWA) promotion throughout November and December. His first match in the WWA took place on November 28, 2002, in [[Dublin]], Ireland, where he reunited with Lex Luger to defeat [[Buff Bagwell]] and [[Jerry Tuite|Malice]]. At [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Retribution|The Retribution]] on December 6, 2002 in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], United Kingdom, Sting lost to Luger in a bout for the vacant [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Sting defeated Luger to claim the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, on December 13.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;

Sting embarked on a second tour with WWA in May 2003, successfully defending his championship against Rick Steiner, Shane Douglas, and [[Disco Inferno (wrestler)|Disco Inferno]]. The WWA held its final show, [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Reckoning|The Reckoning]], on May 25 in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship, unifying the two championships.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt;

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===
==== Sporadic appearances (2003–2004) ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sting book.jpg|thumb|200px|Sting's ''Moment of Truth''{{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 10 October 2017|PROD}}]] --&gt;
In 2003, Sting signed a contract committing him to four appearances with the [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) promotion. He debuted in TNA on the June 18 one year anniversary show, teaming with Jeff Jarrett to defeat [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Sean Waltman|Syxx Pac]].&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Following this, Borden engaged in a comprehensive series of sitdown interviews with [[Mike Tenay]], discussing his career and his [[faith]]. Sting returned to TNA on November 5, 2003, defeating Jarrett by disqualification in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On November 12, Sting teamed with A.J. Styles to defeat Jarrett and Lex Luger. He made his final TNA appearance of 2003 on December 17, defeating Jarrett in a non-title match. On March 24, 2004, Borden was interviewed once again by Mike Tenay as part of the [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] for his [[direct-to-video]] [[biographical film]], ''Sting: Moment of Truth'', and on March 31, he returned to the company for one night only as the special guest enforcer for the main-event, a four-way match between [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]], A.J. Styles, [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], and [[Ron Killings]], which Raven won.

==== Feud with Jeff Jarrett (2005–2006) ====
On December 11, 2005, at [[TNA Turning Point 2005|Turning Point]], as Jeff Jarrett stood in the ring celebrating his victory, the lights in the arena went out as images of a [[scorpion]]—Sting's symbol— appeared on the arena screens, along with the date "January 15, 2006". Spotlights then illuminated the ring, revealing a chair bearing Sting's signature [[trench coat]], boots, and a black baseball bat in the center of the ring.&lt;ref name="2005WrestleView"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2005/1134360328.shtml|title=Turning Point PPV results – 12/11/05 (Sting sends a message &amp; more)|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=December 11, 2005|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; His return to TNA was officially announced one minute after midnight on the January 1, 2006 episode of ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]''. On January 15 at [[Final Resolution 2006|Final Resolution]], Sting and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian Cage]] defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and [[Monty Brown]] in a tag team match after Sting pinned Jarrett following the [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]].&lt;ref name="StingTimeline" /&gt; His heavily promoted return was greeted with chants of "welcome back" and "you've still got it" by the [[Orlando, Florida]] audience.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;{{cite news|first=Hicks|last=Brady|title=2006: The year in wrestling|work=2007 Wrestling Almanac and book of facts|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=2007 Edition|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; TNA later revealed that Final Resolution was "by far the most-purchased TNA pay-per-view event in company history, breaking all previous numbers". On the January 28, 2006 episode of ''Impact!'', Sting made his [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] debut and first appearance on national television in almost five years, coming to the ring at the end of the show to make a "major announcement". Sting noted that he had never had a chance to properly say goodbye to his fans. He then announced that Final Resolution had been "his goodbye", before thanking the TNA management and the fans. Sting then dropped his bat, with a spotlight appearing over it, and left the ring, shaking hands with various TNA wrestlers on his way up the ramp.

With Sting gone, the storyline continued with Jeff Jarrett and [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] worrying that Sting had not actually retired and sending [[Alex Shelley]] to California to videotape Sting at home. Sting discovered Shelley filming, then walked up to Shelley's car and told him that he was going to show up at [[Destination X (2006)|Destination X]] and confront Jeff Jarrett as Steve Borden. Clad in "street clothes" and without face paint Borden returned on March 12 at Destination X, saving Christian Cage and Rhino as they were attacked by [[Planet Jarrett|Jarrett's Army]]. He placed Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock, but was attacked by the debuting [[Scott Steiner]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; In his first cable television match in five years, Sting defeated Eric Young on the April 13, 2006 episode of ''Impact!''. After being attacked by Jarrett, Steiner, and [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm]]), Sting was saved by A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino, who he announced as his teammates in his [[Lethal Lockdown]] match against Jarrett's Army. On April 23 at [[Lockdown (2006)|Lockdown]], "Sting's Warriors" (Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino) defeated Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted after Sting made Chris Harris tap out to the ''Scorpion Death Lock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/tna/lockdown.html#2006|title=Lockdown 2006|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Lockdown, Sting proceeded to seek out partners to help him defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner for good. After bringing out [[Lex Luger]], [[Buff Bagwell]], and [[Rick Steiner]] as options, he settled on [[Samoa Joe]]. On May 14 at [[Sacrifice 2006|Sacrifice]], Sting and Joe defeated Jarrett and Steiner after Joe pinned Jarrett with a Muscle Buster.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; Still having proven unsuccessful at putting Jarrett away, Sting defeated Scott Steiner by disqualification to earn a spot in the [[King of the Mountain match]] at [[Slammiversary (2006)|Slammiversary]] on June 18. Due to a confrontation with Christian Cage during the match, Sting was distracted, which allowed crooked referee [[Earl Hebner]] to knock over the ladder both were on, sending both men to the floor and allow Jarrett to pick up the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/tna/slam.html#2006|title=Slammiversary 2006|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16 at [[Victory Road (2006)|Victory Road]], a four-way number one contenders match was held for a shot at Jeff Jarrett for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. During the match, Jeff Jarrett, disguised as a cameraman, came into the ring with a bottle of gasoline and squirted it into Sting's eyes. Sting was taken by security into the back and as a result, taken out of the running for the number one contender match. As the match continued as a three-way, Sting returned to the ring with his head wrapped in bandages, performed the ''Scorpion Death Drop'' on Scott Steiner, and Sting pinned him to become number one contender. After the match, Sting had a confrontation with Christian Cage in the ring that ended with them shaking hands, and Cage showing respect for Sting. Sting received his title shot on August 13 at [[Hard Justice (2006)|Hard Justice]], but failed to capture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Jeff Jarrett after Christian Cage turned heel and hit Sting with Jarrett's guitar. On the following edition of ''Impact!'', Sting stated that he wanted a rematch with Jarrett at [[Bound for Glory (2006)|Bound for Glory]], TNA's biggest pay-per view of the year. Jarrett accepted the match, with the implication that Sting put his career on the line, a stipulation Sting accepted. Sting then retreated to train for what could have been his final match. Meanwhile, ''Impact!'' began showing videos of Sting going through a so-called transformation with many [[Bible|biblical]] references. On October 22, 2006, in the Title vs. Career match at the Bound for Glory PPV, Sting returned debuting his new look, a hybrid of his ''surfer,'' ''Crow,'' and ''[[nWo Wolfpac]]'' styles, looking much leaner physically. He went on to claim his second NWA World Heavyweight title when he made Jarrett submit to the ''Scorpion Deathlock'' marking the first major championship title Sting had won since 1999.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline" /&gt; With that victory, Sting became the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era, as well as the only person to ever win the title both before and after the inception of TNA. This would also go on to make Sting the longest superstar to recapture his second NWA title from 1990 to 2006 (16 years).

Sting lost the title to "The Monster" Abyss on November 19 at [[Genesis 2006|Genesis]] by disqualification after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into a stack of tables covered in barbed wire.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued as he tried to get in Abyss' head by telling him he was being used by his [[Satanism|satanic]] manager [[James Mitchell (manager)|James Mitchell]]. Abyss was visibly affected by this, but remained by Mitchell's side. Sting's former friend Christian Cage and his bodyguard [[Travis Tomko|Tomko]] were also thrown in the mix, with Cage claiming he knew a dark secret in Abyss' past. The three finally met in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10 at [[TNA Turning Point 2006|Turning Point]], where Abyss retained the title.&lt;ref name="StingTimeline"/&gt; After Turning Point, Sting continued to try to convince Abyss he was nothing but a machine for Mitchell, and he got so far into Abyss that Abyss grabbed Mitchell by the throat, almost [[chokeslam]]ming him on an edition of ''Impact!'', but ultimately convinced himself not to.

==== TNA World Heavyweight Champion (2007–2008) ====
[[File:Stingtna.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Sting at [[Lockdown (2007)|Lockdown in 2007]]]]
As 2007 came along, Sting continued his feud with Abyss while trying to recapture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On January 14 at [[Final Resolution 2007|Final Resolution]], Sting faced Abyss and Christian Cage in three-way elimination match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but failed regain the championship after he was eliminated last by Cage. On the January 24, 2007 edition of ''Impact!'', Sting revealed after going through [[public records]] that Abyss shot his own father three times in the back, sending him into a coma. During the ensuing brawl throughout the ''Impact!'' Zone between Sting and Abyss, James Mitchell burned Sting's face with a [[Fireball (wrestling)|fireball]], sending Sting to the hospital. Sting returned to defeat Abyss in a "Prison Yard" match on February 11 at [[Against All Odds 2007|Against All Odds]] and again in a "Last Rites" match on March 11 at [[Destination x 2007|Destination X]]. On the March 22 edition of ''Impact!'', Sting teamed with his enemy Abyss to face Christian Cage and A.J. Styles. During the match, Mitchell returned with a woman who Abyss recognized and Abyss left the match with Mitchell and the woman, leaving Sting alone to fight Cage and Styles. The following week on ''Impact!'', during a meeting between Sting and James Mitchell, it was revealed that the woman was Abyss' mother, and that she was the one who had actually shot Abyss' father, but Abyss took the blame to protect his mother. Later in the night, it was announced Abyss was added to the Lethal Lockdown match at [[Lockdown (2007)|Lockdown]] as part of Team Cage while Sting ended up joining Team Angle.

Due to his win, he was supposed to be facing Christian Cage for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at [[Sacrifice 2007|Sacrifice]], but the next week on ''Impact!'', [[Kurt Angle]] challenged Sting for his number one contendership.

It was announced via TNA mobile that Abyss had selected "Doomsday Chamber of Blood" match. Sting's team won, with Abyss pinning A.J.

On the August 30 edition of ''Impact!'', Sting defeated A.J.

Yet after only thirteen days, Sting and Angle lost the titles to [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam "Pacman" Jones]] and Ron "The Truth" Killings at [[No Surrender 2007|No Surrender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/09/10/4483932.html|title=No Surrender delivers on Angles and a new TV deal|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=September 10, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2012|work=Slam!

It was announced that Sting would face Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at [[Bound for Glory (2007)|Bound for Glory]]. The match was billed as return to his roots for Sting, who enjoyed enormous popularity and success in the Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling earlier in his career. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Sting overcame interference by both Karen Angle and Kevin Nash to defeat Angle and win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/10/15/4577676.html|title=Angle gets stung at Bound For Glory|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=October 15, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2012|work=Slam!

Angle was forced to Kevin Nash as his partner, while Sting's partner was a mystery until during the event where his partner was revealed to be Booker T. In the match, whoever scored the pinfall would win the TNA World Championship, which Angle won after pinning Sting to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name="PWTorchGenesis2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_23553.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA PPV report 11/11: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of live PPV|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=November 11, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the final TNA appearance of Sting in 2007 as he would take some time off to be with his family.

On the March 20 edition of ''Impact!'', after a brawl between members of both Team Cage and Team Tomko, a promo aired at the end of the show indicating that Sting would return the next week on the first-ever live ''Impact!'' episode. Sting then made his official return on March 27, announcing that he would be a part of Team Cage for the Lethal Lockdown match at [[Lockdown (2008)|Lockdown]]. Later on the show, he teamed with members of Team Cage (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]]) and defeated Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]]) in a 5-man tag team match. Morgan was added when James Storm attacked Sting with a glass bottle after the match. Sting, however, later gained revenge by defeating Storm when Morgan threw him his baseball bat. Morgan then ripped off his referee shirt and revealed a Team Cage shirt, thus becoming the fifth member. At Lockdown, Team Cage defeated Team Tomko when Rhino [[Spear (wrestling)|gored]] Storm to get the pinfall.&lt;ref name="SlamLD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/04/13/5275576.html|title=TNA Lockdown:Joe captures gold|first=Chris|last=Sokol|date=April 18, 2008| accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tag titles were vacated, Jim Cornette held a [[Deuces Wild Tournament|Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament]] to determine new champs. Four teams were already in the Sacrifice finals, while Cornette named eight wrestlers as the "Egotistical 8". Sting's partner was James Storm and on May 11 at [[Sacrifice (2008)|Sacrifice]], they came up short due their inability get along, and towards the end, Sting attacked Storm and walked out.&lt;ref name="PWTorch1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25556.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Sacrifice PPV report 5/11: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of live PPV|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=May 11, 2008|accessdate=2012-01-16|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sting was not seen after that except in an interview which talked about his career and his eventual retirement.

On July 13 at [[Victory Road (2008)|Victory Road]], Booker T faced Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Sting tried to talk sense into Joe, as he was brutally beating Booker T, and was potentially heading towards a disqualification.&lt;ref name="WOVR"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/5990/105/|title=TNA Victory Road PPV report|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|accessdate=2008-08-13| publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe rebuked him, and Sting struck him with his trademark black baseball bat.&lt;ref name="WOVR"/&gt; Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as ''Impact!'' went off the air, leading to a question of whether Sting had [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at [[Hard Justice (2008)|Hard Justice]], Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a [[Last Man Standing match]].&lt;ref name="TNAHJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/159/84|title=Hard Justice Pay-Per-View Results|accessdate=2008-08-11| publisher=TNAWrestling.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822184544/http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/159/84|archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sting later announced why he attacked Joe and Styles by saying that the younger generation needed to learn about respecting veterans like Angle, Booker, and himself. He declared that he wouldn't retire until he had accomplished this mission. This led to mixed fan reactions, and sparked a feud between him and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe, as well as [[Jeff Jarrett]] who arrived to aid Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles by giving them his guitar as Sting had done with his bat.

On the October 31 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Dixie Carter offered to lift the lifetime ban so Sting can get another World title opportunity again by entering him first in a Battle Royal Gauntlet match, which was won by Magnus as Sting attempted to eliminate Kazarian, and Magnus eliminated the both of them. Sting disbanded The Main Event Mafia after Aces &amp; Eights disbanded, and while other members began to chase their World Heavyweight Title dreams, Sting started a feud against [[Ethan Carter III]] and Dixie Carter after they began humiliating TNA Legends, like Curry Man and Earl Hebner by Carter. On the December 12 episode of Impact, Carter was confronted by Sting,  and was issued an option, either face Sting immediately, or enter the Feast or Fired match.

[[File:Sting Wrestlemania 31.jpg|thumb|Sting at WrestleMania 31]]
On November 23, during the main event of [[Survivor Series (2014)|Survivor Series]], Sting made his first-ever appearance in a WWE ring by attacking [[Triple H]] with a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]] and also costing Team [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|Authority]] the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_81932.shtml#.VHKSCIusUv4|title=Caldwell's WWE S.

Triple H challenged Sting to a face-to-face confrontation on the January 26 episode of ''Raw''. Sting accepted this challenge on the February 16 episode of ''Raw'' by sending a [[Heath Slater|Sting doppelganger]] into the ring to scare Triple H, after airing a vignette on the big screen accepting Triple H's challenge. Sting and Triple H had a confrontation at [[Fastlane (2015)|Fastlane]] on February 22. Following physicality between the two, Sting pointed to the [[WrestleMania 31]] sign with his baseball bat, issuing a challenge for the event that was accepted by Triple H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=Sting vs. Triple H|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/31/sting-triple-h-27137100|publisher=WWE|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the March 16 episode of ''Raw'', Sting made a surprise appearance and helped [[Randy Orton]] fight off the Authority.

Sting returned on the August 24 episode of ''Raw'', interrupting [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Seth Rollins]]'s statue unveiling ceremony by attacking Rollins before challenging Rollins for the title by raising the belt over his head. Triple H then announced on the WWE Network that Sting would face Rollins for the title at [[Night of Champions (2015)|Night of Champions]]. Sting appeared on the tron throughout the September 7 ''Raw'', defacing and ultimately destroying Rollins's statue by pushing it into a garbage truck. The following week, Sting defeated [[Big Show]] by disqualification in his debut ''Raw'' match, as a consequence of Rollins attacking Sting. [[John Cena]] then came to Sting's aid, which prompted [[Triple H]] to book a tag team contest involving the four wrestlers: Sting and Cena won after Sting made Rollins tap out to the Scorpion Deathlock. Sting suffered a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legit]] neck injury during his championship match against Rollins at [[Night of Champions (2015)|Night of Champions]], but was able to complete the bout in a losing effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/sting-interviewed-about-night-of-champions-injuries-27958909|title=Sting on his injury, his condition and whether or not that was his last match|last=Adkins|first=Greg|date=September 23, 2015|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=September 25, 2015|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925134424/http://www.wwe.com/inside/sting-interviewed-about-night-of-champions-injuries-27958909|archivedate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WWE Hall of Fame and retirement (2015–2016) ====
Sting said on the December 9 edition of [[Ric Flair]]'s ''WOOOOO! Nation'' podcast that he required surgery to correct [[cervical spinal stenosis]], and is "lucky that a [[Catastrophic injury|catastrophe]] didn't happen" in his match with Rollins at Night of Champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/daily-updates/daily-update-snukas-trial-date-set-sting-needs-neck-surgery-ufc-203331 |title=Snuka's trial date set, Sting needs neck surgery, UFC|date=December 9, 2015|website=Figure Four Weekly|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=December 11, 2015 |deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211092417/http://www.f4wonline.com/daily-updates/daily-update-snukas-trial-date-set-sting-needs-neck-surgery-ufc-203331|archivedate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on the January 11, 2016 episode of ''Raw'' that Sting would be the first member of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] Class of 2016. He was the second active WWE wrestler to be inducted – the first being his inductor, Ric Flair. Sting ultimately reneged on having surgery; on March 22, 2016 he explained that he felt "completely normal" and had none of the side effects associated with cervical spinal stenosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/article/sting-interview-retirement-exclusive?sf22959606=1|title=Exclusive interview: Sting on the Hall of Fame, his WWE experience and whether he has competed in his final match|last=Pappolla|first=Ryan|date=March 22, 2016|publisher=[[WWE]]|access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, during his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech, Sting announced his retirement from professional wrestling.&lt;ref name="retirement"/&gt; He appeared at [[WrestleMania 32]], alongside his fellow 2016 inductees, the following night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2016/04/03/powells-wrestlemania-32-live-review-undertaker-vs-shane-mcmahon-in-a-hell-in-a-cell-match-triple-h-vs-roman-reigns-for-the-wwe-championship-brock-lesnar-vs-dean-ambrose-in-a-street-fight-char/|title=Powell's WrestleMania 32 live review|last=Powell|first=Jason|date=April 3, 2016|publisher=ProWrestling.net|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Sting appeared on the [[WWE Network]] show ''Legends with [[John Layfield|JBL]]'' and talked about his career. He also stated that he has not undergone surgery, which would definitively end his career, and he still holds hope for a match with The Undertaker, claiming that such a match is his "unfinished business" in wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/411s-legends-with-jbl-sting-report/|title=411's Legends with JBL: Sting Report|date=August 19, 2016|last=Leighty Jr.|first=Robert|work=411MANIA|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawing ability===
Sting's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|drawing]] ability has been disputed.

Martin said that Sting never truly established himself as 'The Man'.&lt;ref name="martin16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerslamonline.co.uk/updates/222/Raw-Shane-Sting-Hall-Of-Fame-.htm |title=The Mail |last=Martin |first=Fin |date=March 9, 2016 |website=[[Power Slam]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |access-date=March 10, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311021516/http://www.powerslamonline.co.uk/updates/222/Raw-Shane-Sting-Hall-Of-Fame-.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resistance to signing with WWE ===
Prior to his signing with WWE, Sting was widely considered the greatest wrestler never to perform for the company.&lt;ref name="serafino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/10493/20140715/wrestling-legend-sting-will-pre-order-bonus-wwe-2k15.htm|title=Wrestling legend Sting will be a pre-order bonus in 'WWE 2K15'|last=Serafino|first=Jason|date=July 15, 2014|website=Tech Times|access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had "really good conversations" with the promotion during his career,&lt;ref name="ds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s216/wwe/news/a586447/sting-on-wwe-match-i-promise-you-it-will-be-showtime.html#~pdVe29uNxawu2t|title=Sting teases showtime at WWE match|date=July 25, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not appear there until 2014, at the age of 55.

The '''''Georgian Chronicles''''' is a conventional [[English language|English]] name for the principal compendium of medieval [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historical texts, natively known as '''''Kartlis Tskhovreba''''' ({{lang-ka|ქართლის ცხოვრება}}), literally "Life of Kartli", [[Kartli]] being a core region of ancient and medieval Georgia, known to the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] authors as [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]].

The chronicles are also known as '''''The Georgian Royal Annals''''', for they were essentially the official corpus of history of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nCFwaxMumWkC Studies in Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts]'', ''passim''. Peeters Publishers, {{ISBN|90-429-1318-5}}. Retrieved on 26 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toumanoff "&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]] (1963). ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History''. Washington, D.C.: [[Georgetown University Press]], ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronicles ==
The Chronicles consist of a series of distinct texts dating from the 9th to the 14th century. The dating of these works as well as the identification of their authors (e.g., [[Leonti Mroveli]] and [[Juansheriani]]) have been a subject of scholarly debates. Although many scholars in Georgia still propose an 11th-century dating for the first redaction of the corpus, the increasing number of modern experts has accepted Professor [[Cyril Toumanoff]]'s hypothesis that the earliest texts of ''Kartlis Tskhovreba'' were composed c. 800. The latest texts were added in the 14th century. A "canonized" version was edited by a special commission appointed and chaired by King [[Vakhtang VI of Kartli]] early in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;

During the 11th century, the first three works – the "History of the Kings and Patriarchs of the Georgians", the "History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali", and the "Martyrdom of Saint Archil" – already made up a first corpus which covered the Georgian history from the earliest times through the reign of [[Vakhtang I Gorgasali]] (r. 452–502/22) down to the death of Vakhtang's descendant [[Archil of Kakheti|Archil]] (786). In the middle of the 12th century, two texts were added: the "Chronicle of Kartli" – which records the Georgian history from the late 8th century through the reign of the first all-Georgian king [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] (r. 1008-1014) to the early regnal years of [[George II of Georgia|George II]] (r. 1072-1089) – and the "History of the King of Kings David" – which continues the story and focuses on the reign of [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] (r. 1089-1125).&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;

== Manuscripts ==

The extant Georgian manuscripts of ''Kartlis Tskhovreba'' are relatively late, with the earliest, the so-called ''Anaseuli'' or "[[Alexander I of Kakheti#Family|Queen Anna]]" codex, dating from the period of 1479-1495. Another major variant, ''Mariamiseuli'' or "[[Mariam Dadiani|Queen Mariam]]" codex, was copied in the years 1633-1645/1646. However, the surviving Georgian manuscripts are predated by the Chronicles' abridged [[Armenian language|Armenian]] adaptation known as "The History of Georgians" (''Patmut'iwn Vrats'''), most probably made in the 12th century, with its earliest extant manuscript being copied in the period of 1279-1311.&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;

A number of translations are available in French, Russian, English and German, but each one covers only a selected number of these texts.

== Authenticity ==

Some modern scholars, such as [[Ivane Javakhishvili]], have questioned the authenticity of the early components of "The Georgian Chronicles" and have called for extreme caution when working with them. Indeed, strict historical facts are frequently intermingled with mythical ones, making it sometimes difficult to discern true historiography and mythology. However, critical analyses against other sources, including the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] authors, and a series of recent archaeological studies have proved the trustworthiness of many of the Chronicles' accounts. These texts relate evidence not only for the history of Georgia, but also [[Armenia]] and the [[Caucasus]] in general, [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Khazars]], and the [[Turkish people|Turks]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt;

The Factbook is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the ''Factbook''{{'}}s widespread use as a reference.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{dubious|date=April 2018}} For example, [[Albania]] was until recently, described in the ''Factbook'' as 70% [[Muslim]], 20% [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and 10% [[Roman Catholic]], which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before [[World War II]]; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Another example is [[Singapore]], which the ''Factbook'' states has a [[total fertility rate]] of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html#14 Statistics Singapore – Latest Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105202002/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html |date=2014-11-05 }}. Singstat.gov.sg. Retrieved on 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This low and inaccurate value then gets cited in news articles which state that Singapore has the world's lowest fertility, or at least use the figure for its shock value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sapere |first=Aude |url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/what-happens-when-half-the-world-stops-making-babies/573/ |title=What Happens When Half The World Stops Making Babies |publisher=The Global Mail |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2013-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326141408/http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/what-happens-when-half-the-world-stops-making-babies/573/ |archivedate=2013-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/07d4c8a8-7e45-11e3-b409-00144feabdc0.html#slide0 |title=How Japan stood up to old age |publisher=The Financial Times |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another serious problem is that the Factbook never cites its sources, making verification of the information it presents difficult if not impossible.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In June 2009, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), relying on information obtained from the ''CIA World Factbook'', put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the [[West Bank]] and Israeli-annexed [[East Jerusalem]] at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, "I'm surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA ''World Factbook''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/01/127349281/cia-gets-the-numbers-wrong

'''Tom Jenkins''' (August 3, 1872 – June 19, 1957) was an [[United States|American]] catch wrestler who held the [[American Heavyweight Championship]] three times around the turn of the 20th century.  He later taught at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point (1905–1942) and from 1912 to 1943 he also taught wrestling and boxing at the New York Military Academy at Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York.

The British codenamed non-[[Morse code|Morse]] traffic [[Fish (cryptography)|"Fish"]], and that from this machine "Tunny".

Reading a Tunny message required firstly that the logical structure of the system was known, secondly that the periodically changed pattern of active cams on the wheels was derived, and thirdly that the starting positions of the scrambler wheels for this message—the [[Key (cryptography)|message key]]—was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logical structure of Tunny had been worked out by [[W. T. Tutte|William Tutte]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|1998|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; over several months ending in January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Good|1993|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deriving the message key was called "setting" at Bletchley Park, but it was the derivation of the cam patterns—which was known as "wheel breaking"—that was the target of Turingery. 

German operator errors in transmitting more than one message with the same key, producing a [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|"depth"]], allowed the derivation of that key. Turingery was applied to such a key stream to derive the cam settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006| p=381 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The SZ40 and SZ42==

The logical functioning of the Tunny system was worked out well before the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts saw one of the machines—which only happened in 1945, shortly before the allied victory in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Lorenz Cipher and how Bletchley Park broke it | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/fish.htm | accessdate = 21 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SZ machines were 12-wheel [[Rotor machine|rotor]] [[cipher]] machines which implemented a [[Gilbert Vernam#The Vernam cipher|Vernam]] [[stream cipher]]. They were attached in-line to standard Lorenz teleprinters. The message [[Character (computing)|characters]] were encoded in the [[bit|5-bit]] [[Baudot code#ITA2|International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2)]]. The output ciphertext characters were generated by combining a [[pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom]] character-by-character key stream with the input characters using the [[Exclusive or|"exclusive or (XOR)"]] function (symbolised by&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt;'''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt;).
::::: &lt;big&gt;[[Plaintext]] &lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; [[Key (cryptography)|Key]] = [[Ciphertext]]&lt;/big&gt;

Similarly, for deciphering, the ciphertext was combined with the same key to give the plaintext.
::::: &lt;big&gt; [[Ciphertext]] &lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; [[Key (cryptography)|Key]] = [[Plaintext]] &lt;/big&gt;

This produces the essential reciprocity to allow the same machine with the same settings to be used for both enciphering and deciphering.

Each of the five bits of the key for each character was generated by the relevant wheels in two parts of the machine. These were termed the [[Chi (letter)|''chi'']] (&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;) wheels, and the [[Psi (letter)|''psi'']] (&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) wheels. The ''chi'' wheels all moved on one position for each character. The ''psi'' wheels also all moved together, but not after each character. Their movement was controlled by the two [[Mu (letter)|''mu'']] (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) or "motor" wheels.&lt;ref name = "GRoT11B7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|p=7}} in ''German Tunny''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The key stream generated by the SZ machines thus had a ''chi'' component and a ''psi'' component that were combined together with the XOR function. So, the key that was combined with the plaintext for enciphering—or with the ciphertext for deciphering—can be represented as follows.&lt;ref name = "GRoT11B7" /&gt;

::::: &lt;big&gt; Key = ''Chi''-Key &lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; ''Psi''-Key &lt;/big&gt;

Symbolically: 

::::: &lt;big&gt; K = &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

The twelve wheels each had a series of cams (or "pins") around them. These cams could be set in a raised or lowered position. In the raised position they generated a "mark" '&lt;big&gt; '''x''' &lt;/big&gt;' ('''1''' in binary), in the lowered position they generated a "space" '&lt;big&gt; '''•''' &lt;/big&gt;' ('''0''' in binary). The number of cams on each wheel equalled the number of impulses needed to cause them to complete a full rotation. It should be noted that these numbers are all [[Coprime|co-prime]] with each other, giving the longest possible time before the pattern repeated. With a total of 501 cams this equals 2&lt;sup&gt;501&lt;/sup&gt; which is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;, an astronomically large number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the five impulses are considered independently, the numbers are much more manageable. The [[Multiplication|product]] of the rotation period of any pair of ''chi'' wheels gives numbers between 41×31=1271 and 26×23=598.

==Differencing==
Cryptanalysis often involves finding patterns of some sort that provide a way into eliminating a range of key possibilities. At Bletchley Park the XOR combination of the values of two adjacent letters in the key or the ciphertext was called the difference (symbolised by the Greek letter ''delta'' 'Δ') because XOR is the same as [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2 subtraction (without "borrow")—and, incidentally, modulo 2 addition (without "carry"). So, for the characters in the key(K), the difference ΔK was obtained as follows, where &lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt; indicates the succeeding character:

::::: &lt;big&gt; ΔK = K&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

(Similarly with the plaintext, the ciphertext, and the two components of the key.)

The relationship amongst them applies when they are differenced. For example, as well as: 

::::: &lt;big&gt; K = &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

It is the case that:
::::: &lt;big&gt; ΔK = Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; Δ&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

If the plaintext is represented by P and the cipertext by Z, the following also hold true:

::::: &lt;big&gt; ΔZ = ΔP &lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; Δ&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

And:
::::: &lt;big&gt; ΔP = ΔZ &lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; Δ&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt; 

The reason that differencing provided a way into Tunny was that, although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the ''chi'' element of the key had been removed. This is because, where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the ''psi'' wheels did not move on, the differenced ''psi'' character (Δ&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) would be the null character ('''•••••''' or 00000), or, in Bletchley Park terminology, '&lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt; '. When XOR-ed with any character, this null character has no effect, so in these circumstances, Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; = ΔK. Repeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent, both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Singh | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Singh | title = The Black Chamber | url = http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/hintsandtips.html | accessdate = 28 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figures-shift and letters-shift characters&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Newman|Newman]] ''c''. 1944 p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; as their loss in an ordinary telegraph message could lead to [[gibberish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|p = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote the General Report on Tunny:&lt;blockquote&gt;Turingery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called ΔΚ, could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key. This Δ principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.&lt;ref name="GRoTTuringery"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bit-level differencing===
As well as applying differencing to the full 5-bit characters of the [[ITA2]] code, it was also applied to the individual impulses (bits). So, for the first impulse, that was enciphered by wheels &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, differenced at one: 
::::: &lt;big&gt; ΔK&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/big&gt;&lt;&gt;
And for the second impulse:
::::: &lt;big&gt; ΔK&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:190%;"&gt; '''&amp;oplus;''' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/big&gt;
And so on. 

It is also worth noting that the periodicity of the ''chi'' and ''psi'' wheels for each impulse (41 and 43 respectively for the first one) is reflected in its pattern of ΔK. However, given that the ''psi'' wheels did not advance for every input character, as did the ''chi'' wheels, it was not simply a repetition of the pattern every 41 × 43 = 1763 characters for ΔK&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but a more complex sequence.

==Turing's method==
In July 1942 Turing spent a few weeks in the Research Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|2006|pp=359, 360}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had become interested in the problem of breaking Tunny from the keys that had been obtained from [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depths]].&lt;ref name="Copeland2006P380"/&gt; In July, he developed the method of deriving the cam settings from a length of key.&lt;ref name="GRoTTuringery"/&gt; It involved an [[Iteration|iterative]], almost trial-and-error, process. It relied on the fact that when the differenced ''psi'' character is the null character ('''•••••''' or 00000),&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt;, then XOR-ing this with any other character does not change it. Thus the delta key character gives the character of the five ''chi'' wheels (i.e. Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ΔK).

Given that the delta ''psi'' character was the null character half of the time on average, an assumption that ΔK&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; had a 50% chance of being correct. The process started by treating a particular ΔK character as being the Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; for that position. The resulting putative bit pattern of &lt;big&gt; '''x''' &lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt; '''•''' &lt;/big&gt; for each ''chi'' wheel, was recorded on a sheet of paper that contained as many columns as there were characters in the key, and five rows representing the five impulses of the Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;. Given the knowledge from Tutte's work, of the periodicity of each of the wheels, this allowed the propagation of these values at the appropriate positions in the rest of the key. 

A set of five sheets, one for each of the ''chi'' wheels, was also prepared. These contained a set of columns corresponding in number to the cams for the appropriate ''chi'' wheel, and were referred to as a 'cage'. So the &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cage had 29 such columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=385}} which reproduces a &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cage from the General Report on Tunny&lt;/ref&gt; Successive 'guesses' of Δ&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; values then produced further putative cam state values. These might either agree or disagree with previous assumptions, and a count of agreements and disagreements was made on these sheets. Where disagreements substantially outweighed agreements, the assumption was made that the Δ&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; character was not the null character &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt;, so the relevant assumption was discounted. Progressively, all the cam settings of the ''chi'' wheels were deduced, and from them the ''psi'' and motor wheel cam settings.

As experience of the method developed, improvements were made that allowed it to be used with much shorter lengths of key than the original 500 or so characters.&lt;ref name="GRoTTuringery"/&gt;

'''Ultimate Guitar''', also known as '''Ultimate-Guitar.com''' or simply '''UG''', is the largest guitarist community website including guitar and bass guitar [[tablature]], [[chord sheet]]s, reviews of music and equipment, interviews with notable musicians, online written and video lessons, and [[Internet forum|forums]]. It was started on October 9, 1998 by Eugeny Naidenov, a student of the economic faculty of [[Kaliningrad State University]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/about/|title=About|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|publisher=|access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
UG has over 12,000,000 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/|title=UG Community @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|publisher=|access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a strong community of forum users who frequent the site. The website is regulated by an administrator and moderators which are privileged members who can edit and delete other users comments. Moderators are users that are rewarded for being particularly helpful and knowledgeable in a specific subject and are responsible for moderating forums that focus on the subject they specialize in. Inappropriate words used to be censored by a computer that searched for and replaced undesired words posted within the community, until September 1, 2015, when censorship of curse and swear words was lifted on the website. Community members may also create guitar lessons, and have their approved works published on the website and read by its users. Reviews of albums, DVDs, or gear and news articles can also be submitted by members.

Like the tabs, the lessons and column are also rated by users, which attributes towards UG Points (or rather number of contributions), your UG score also increases, or decreases as the members rate your contribution.

Although UG encourages participation, they also have a strict guideline and set of rules that all UG users must follow. Members must be over the age of 13 to use the services offered by the site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/about/tos.htm/ |title="Terms of Use", ''Ultimate-Guitar.com'' |accessdate=2017-09-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005000117/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/about/tos.htm/ |archivedate=5 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and only one account is allowed to be made per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/about/help.htm#hdicmu/|title=FAQs about account|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|publisher=|access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong media is also prohibited from use on the site.

Some members of the community have collaborated with other fellow users to develop musical projects via the website's forums and some of these community projects have been released as [[compilation albums]]. One of the most notable of these recent projects was the "Blues &amp; Jazz Album II", which featured fourteen original tracks submitted by a number of community members, released for digital download with all profits going to [[Tipitina's Foundation]]. The project's community page can be found here, and the digital download is available on iTunes. There have been several other collaborative albums made by community members that are available for free download within the forums, including two electronic albums, a rock album and an acoustic album.

==The Pit==
The Pit is the part of the site where the registered UGers can discuss multiple topics, including those that do not necessarily have to do with guitar or even music, including political, religious and topical issues. Although The Pit is a miscellaneous section, all standards are upheld.

==Profiles==
{{Advert section|date=February 2017}}
On August 12, 2007, the Ultimate Guitar site launched "UG Profiles". This added another feature to UG that other tablature sites do not feature. UG Profiles can be used for networking, advertising gear, and bands in a similar way to other sites such as [[MySpace]]; unlike other networking sites, UG Profiles are focused on those who share the interest of guitar, or to a lesser extent, bass. Users are able to add profiles for each of their bands, upload pictures of themselves, as well as gear, display their "guitar skills", join groups of interest, and add other users to their friends list. At one time the site featured MP3 functionality, allowing users to upload their own recordings to their profiles, however that feature was disabled as of September 1, 2014 due to lack of use and legal liability in the case of copyright violations.

==Relationships with music publishers and songwriters==
In late 2004–05, after taborama and [[mxtabs]].net began closing due to legal threats from the [[Music Publishers' Association|Music Publishers Association of America]], UG saw a surge of new users flock to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/technology/21ecom.html|title=Now the Music Industry Wants Guitarists to Stop Sharing|date=21 August 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UG was not affected by the MPA legal actions, since UG has license agreements with thousands of publishers, including Sony, EMI, Peermusic, Alfred, Hal Leonard, Faber and Music Sales, through which the songwriters receive compensation for the display of the tabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/article/blog/licensing|title=Why songs are licensed?|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|publisher=|access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2010, Ultimate Guitar entered a licensing agreement with [[Harry Fox Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harryfox.com/public/userfiles/file/PressReleases/HFAUltimateGuitar_20100406_Final.pdf |title="The Harry Fox Agency, Inc. and Ultimate Guitar Enter Licensing Arrangement for Lyrics and Tablature", ''HarryFox.com'' |accessdate=2017-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051743/http://www.harryfox.com/public/userfiles/file/PressReleases/HFAUltimateGuitar_20100406_Final.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement included rights for lyrics display, title search and tablature display with download and print capabilities. HFA's over 44,000 represented publishers have the opportunity to opt into the licensing arrangement with UG.

==Tablature==

Tabs may be requested in the Tab Talk forum.

Tabs can be voted from 1 star (the worst) to 5 stars (the best), and comments can be made about the tab. Tabs of entire albums can also be submitted.

Files such as basic guitar tabs and bass tabs can be read from an Internet browser, or copied and viewed off-line in a text editor in [[ASCII]] format. [[Guitar Pro]] and [[Power Tab]] files are run through programs that can play the tablature. These files can be saved and opened on the user's computer.

Tabs are searchable by artist, album, or song name.&lt;ref&gt;for example: {{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/red_hot_chili_peppers_tabs.htm|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Chords &amp; Tabs|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|publisher=|access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11816">[[Image:ViennaDioscoridesFolio483vBirds.jpg|thumb|250px|A gallery of birds from folio 483v of the Vienna Dioscorides]]

The '''Vienna Dioscurides''' or '''Vienna Dioscorides''' is an early 6th-century [[Byzantine]] Greek [[illuminated manuscript]] of ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς in the original [[Greek language|Greek]]) by [[Dioscorides]] in [[Greek uncial|uncial script]]. It is an important and rare example of a [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] scientific text.  The 491 [[vellum]] [[Folio (printing)|folios]] measure 37 by 30&amp;nbsp;cm and contain more than 400 pictures of animals and plants, most done in a naturalistic style. In addition to the text by Dioscorides, the manuscript has appended to it the ''Carmen de herbis'' attributed to [[Rufus of Ephesus|Rufus]], a paraphrase of an ornithological treatise by a certain Dionysius, usually identified with [[Dionysius of Philadelphia]], and a paraphrase of [[Nicander]]'s treatise on the treatment of snake bites.

The manuscript was created in about 515 AD in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's capital, [[Constantinople]], for a resident byzantine imperial princess, [[Anicia Juliana]], the daughter of [[Olybrius|Anicius Olybrius]], who had been one of the last of the Western Roman Emperors. The manuscript is accordingly now called the '''''Juliana Anicia Codex''''' by scholars.&lt;ref name=Janick2012&gt;[https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/pdfs/ch5203.pdf The 1500th Anniversary (512-2012) of the Juliana Anicia Codex: An Illustrated Dioscoridean Recension. Jules Janick and Kim E. Hummer. Chronica horticulturae. 52(3) 2012 pp.&amp;nbsp;9-15]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was created as a luxury copy, in later centuries it was used daily as a textbook in the imperial hospital of [[Constantinople]], and a medieval note records that a Greek nurse there, named Nathanael, had it rebound in 1406.&lt;ref&gt;Mazal, Otto. "Der Wiener Dioscurides" vol. 1, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After residing in Constantinople for just over a thousand years, the text passed to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna in the 1500s, a century after the city fell to the Ottomans.

Throughout the Byzantine period the manuscript was used as the original for copies of the work that were given to foreign leaders, including the Arabic edition of [[Abd al-Rahman III]] of Spain for the creation of which the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]] sent a Greek copy and a translator.&lt;ref&gt;Mazal, Otto. "Der Wiener Dioscurides" vol. 2, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; A note recording the name of one Michael of the [[Varangian Guard]] is also found in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Mazal, Otto. "Der Wiener Dioscurides" vol. 1, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was restored and a table of contents and extensive [[scholia]] added in Byzantine [[Greek minuscule]], by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarchal]] notary [[John Chortasmenos]] in 1406.&lt;ref name = Janick&gt;Janick, Jules, and John Stolarczyk. "Ancient Greek illustrated Dioscoridean herbals: origins and impact of the Juliana Anicia Codex and the Codex Neopolitanus." Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca 40.1 (2012): 09.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1400s it was used to create the [[Pope Alexander VII]] Dioscorides, now in the [[Vatican Library]], by the monks of [[Bogdan Saray|St. John the Baptist Greek orthodox monastery]] in Constantinople. After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 a subsequent owner handwrote each plant's name in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref name = Janick /&gt;&lt;ref name=nsa&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tiltman, John H.|date=Summer 1967|title=The Voynich Manuscript: "The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World"|volume=XII|number=3|publisher=NSA Technical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript, still in [[Istanbul]] a century after the fall of the city, was purchased from [[Moses Hamon]], the Arabic-speaking, Jewish physician to sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], by the Flemish diplomat [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], who was in the employ of Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[Austrian Habsburgs]]. The manuscript is now held in the  [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]] in [[Vienna]], where it is identified as the '''''[[Codex Vindobonensis]]''' med. gr. 1.''"  The manuscript was inscribed on [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[Memory of the World Programme]] Register in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title= Vienna Dioscurides |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22639&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2009-02-12 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations==
The manuscript has 383 extant full-page illustrations of plants out of the original 435 illustrations.  The illustrations fall into two groups.  There are those that faithfully follow earlier classical models and present a quite naturalistic illustration of each plant.  There are also other illustrations that are more abstract.  The majority of the illustrations were painted in a naturalistic style so as to aid a pharmacologist in the recognition of each plant.  However, it is believed that these illustrations were made as copies of an earlier herbal and were not drawn from nature.
[[Image:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|thumb|left|240px|European Bramble]]
In addition to the illustrations of the text, the manuscript contains several [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]]s in the form of a series of full-page miniatures.  Of special note is the [[dedication miniature]] portrait of Anicia Juliana on folio 6 verso. (See [[:Image:ViennaDioscoridesFolio6vDonorPortrait.jpg|here]].)  The manuscript was presented to Anicia out of gratitude for her funding the construction of a church in the suburbs of [[Constantinople]].  This portrait is the oldest extant dedication portrait.  The portrait has Anicia seated in a ceremonial pose distributing alms.  She is flanked by personifications of [[Magnanimity]] and [[Prudence]].  At her feet, another personification, labeled "Gratitude of the Arts", kneels.  A [[putto]] holds a dedication copy up to Anicia.  Anicia and her attendants are enclosed within an eight-point star within a circle all formed of intertwined rope. Within the outer spandrels of the star are [[putti]], done in [[grisaille]], working as masons and carpenters.  This miniature is an altogether original creation and, with the inclusion of the personifications and the putti, shows the endurance of the classical tradition in Constantinople, despite the fact that Anicia herself was a pious Christian.

The series of frontispieces in the manuscript begins with two full-page miniatures, each having a group of seven noted [[pharmacologist]]s.  In the second picture (folio 3 verso, see [[:Image:ViennaDioscoridesFolio3v7Physicians.jpg|here]]), the most prominent and only one sitting on a chair is [[Galen]].  He is flanked by three pairs of other physicians, seated on stones or the ground.  Closest to Galen are [[Crateuas (physician)|Crateuas]] and [[Dioscurides]].  The second pair are [[Apollonius (physician)|Apollonius Mys]] and [[Nicander]]. Farthest from Galen are [[Andreas (physician)|Andreas]] and [[Rufus of Ephesus|Rufus]].  Each of the figures is a self-contained portrait and was probably modeled on authors' portraits from the various authors' treatises.  The seven figures are contained within an elaborate decorated frame.  The background is solid gold, which places the figures in an abstract space.  This is the earliest known manuscript to use a solid gold background.
[[Image:ViennaDioscoridesFolio3v7Physicians.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Folio 3v, seven physicians]]
Following the two miniatures of seven pharmacologists, there are two author portraits.  In the second portrait (see [[:Image:ViennaDioscoridesAuthorPortrait.jpg|here]]), Dioscurides sits writing in a codex on his lap.  He is shown in profile, which corresponds to the portrait in the previous miniature.  It is possible that there was a tradition based on Dioscurides' life portrait that the images are based on.  In front of Dioscurides is an artist, seated at a lower level, painting an illustration of the [[Mandrake (plant)|mandrake]] root.  He is painting from nature.  The mandrake root he is looking at is held by the personification of [[Epinoia]] (the power of thought).  There is architectural background consisting of a colonnade with a central niche.

The paraphrase of the treatise on [[bird]]s by Dionysius is in three books.  The first two books have illustrations of the birds inserted into the text columns without frame or background (for example, see [[:Image:ViennaDioscoridesBirds.jpg|here]]). The third book has 24 birds arranged in a grid on a full-page miniature (see illustration above).  The birds portrayed throughout the treatise are of high artistic merit and are faithful to nature in form and color. Most of the birds are easily identifiable.  Some of the birds contained in the full-page miniature in the third book are not described in the text of the paraphrase.  It is probable that these illustrations are based on the illustrations from an older, different treatise, possibly that of [[Alexander of Myndus]].  This manuscript, however, is the oldest surviving illustrated treatise on birds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5143">The '''Weissman score''' is an efficiency [[software metric|metric]] for [[lossless compression]] applications, which was developed for fictional use. It compares both required time and [[Data compression ratio|compression ratio]] of measured applications, with those of a ''de facto'' standard according to the [[data type]]. It was developed by [[Tsachy Weissman]], a professor at [[Stanford University]], and [[Vinith Misra]], a graduate student, at the request of producers for HBO's television series ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'', about a fictional tech start-up.&lt;ref name="ficmetric"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Perry|first=Tekla|title=A Fictional Compression Metric Moves Into the Real World|date=July 28, 2014|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/software/a-madefortv-compression-metric-moves-to-the-real-world|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Tekla|title=A Made-For-TV Compression Algorithm|date=July 25, 2014|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/software/a-madefortv-compression-algorithm|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandberg|first=Elise|title=HBO's 'Silicon Valley' Tech Advisor on Realism, Possible Elon Musk Cameo|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbos-silicon-valley-tech-advisor-695513|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 12, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jurgensen|first1=John|last2=Rusli|first2=Evelyn M.|title=There's a New Geek in Town: HBO's 'Silicon Valley'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303987004579479244213599118|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=April 3, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula is the following; where ''r'' is the [[Data compression ratio|compression ratio]], ''T'' is the time required to compress, the overlined ones are the same metrics for a standard compressor, and alpha is a scaling constant.&lt;ref name="ficmetric"/&gt;
&lt;math display="block"&gt;W = \alpha {r \over \overline{r}} {\log{\overline{T}} \over \log{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

Weissman score was used in Dropbox Tech Blog to explain real-world work on lossless compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/|title=Lossless compression with Brotli in Rust for a bit of Pied Piper on the backend|website=Dropbox Tech Blog|language=en|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

==Limitations==
Although the value is relative to the standards against which it is compared, the [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to measure the times changes the score (see examples 1 and 2), and the multiplier also can't have a numeric value of 1 or less, because the logarithm of 1 is 0 (examples 3 and 4), and the logarithm of any value less than 1 is negative (examples 5 and 6); that would result in scores of value 0 (even with changes), undefined, or negative (even if better than positive).

==Plot==
''Who the Hell is Juliette?'' begins with Yuliet Ortega saying that her name on the [[intertitle|title card]], Juliette Ortega, is misspelled and demanding that it is corrected. The director immediately complies and the card is corrected to Yuliet Ortega. Ortega is a 16-year-old girl who is being taken care of by her grandmother. Her mother committed [[suicide]], while her father left his family and went to the United States. Ortega became a [[jineterismo|jinetera]] to support herself.

During the shooting of a music video, Ortega meets 23-year-old Fabiola Quiroz who is a Mexican [[model (person)|model]]. Both Quiroz and Ortega have been abandoned by their fathers and are deeply scarred by what has happened.

Director Carlos Marcovich organizes a reunion for Ortega and her father, who lives in [[New Jersey]].

Finally, to save Ortega from [[street prostitution]], Fabiola Quiroz helps her arrange a modeling [[interview]].

[[Salma Hayek]] and [[Francesco Clemente]] make guest appearances in the documentary.&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ted |last=Shen |title=Who the Hell Is Juliette? |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/index.html/movies/capsules/17330_WHO_THE_HELL_IS_JULIETTE |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=200 |accessdate=7 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5irAVB9Tm |archivedate=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the film the "artiest home movie ever made" and was critical about how the [[subtitles]] appeared and disappeared too quickly to be easily read.&lt;ref name="D'Angelo"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=D'Angelo |title=Video Review: Who the Hell is Juliette?  |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274874,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=1999-03-19 |accessdate=2006-08-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipp4bPih |archivedate=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called the film "a great example of what happens when a film maker follows a subject that intrigues him rather than a pre-set program".&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt;

===Awards===
The documentary received two [[Ariel Award]]s.&lt;ref name="McClanahan"&gt;{{cite news |first=Erik |last=McClanahan |title=Brotherly love: A conversation with "Rudo y Cursi" director Carlos Cuarón |url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/article/2009/06/01/brotherly-love-conversation-carlos-cuaron.html |work=[[Twin Cities Daily Planet]] |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2006-08-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipqlB3qt |archivedate=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1998 [[Sundance Film Festival]], it received the Latin American Cinema Award.&lt;ref name="Maslin"&gt;{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |title=Various Guises of Misery in Sundance Winners |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/movies/various-guises-of-misery-in-sundance-winners.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1998-01-26 |accessdate=2006-08-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JDty75WM |archivedate=2013-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
