The '''Amica Temple of Radiance''' is a [[new religious movement]] begun in 1959 in [[Los Angeles]] by [[Roland Hunt]] and [[Dorothy Bailey]] based on the teachings of [[Ivah Bergh Whitten]].

Whitten had been as a child diagnosed with a disease considered incurable which she claims had been cured by her "color awareness". She began to teach her system, with her first course published in 1932.

The Temple continues and expands on Whitten's teachings. These teachings include that each color is an aspect of existence, and individually ruled by a master. By coming to understand which color ray an individual was born under, that individual can discern their proper work and place in life. She also taught that each color ray has a different healing potential.

The Temple currently offers lessons in "color awareness" to students across the country in centers located in [[California]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

The current leader of Washington Temple is Paola Hugh.

The earliest contact documented to date, between Armenians and the Bábí-Bahá’í religion began on an unfortunate note in the banishments and execution of the [[Báb]],&lt;ref name="Aqasi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Quinn|first= Sholeh A. |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= Aqasi, Haji Mirza ('Abbas Iravani) |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=37%3Abiography&amp;id=45%3Aaqasi-haji-mirza-abbas-iravani-&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Founder of the Bábí Faith, viewed by Bahá'ís as a precursor religion, but ended courageously to the credit of the Armenian officer. In that same year the teachings of the new religion were taken to Armenia.&lt;ref name="azer2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Balci |first=Bayram |last2=Jafarov |first2=Azer |title=The Baha’is of the Caucasus: From Russian Tolerance to Soviet Repression {2/3} |newspaper=Caucaz.com |pages= |date=2007-02-21 |url=http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815004340/http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |archivedate=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is necessary to determine the details. Decades later, during the time of Soviet repression of religion, Bahá’ís in Armenia were isolated from Bahá’ís elsewhere.&lt;ref name="wob"&gt;{{cite book | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition | date = 1936-03-11 | location = Haifa, Palestine | pages = 64–67 | url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-34.html#pg64| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, by 1963, Bahá’í communities had been identified&lt;ref name="bachai"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Monakhova | first = Elena | title = From Islam to Feminism via Baha'i Faith | magazine = Women Plus… | volume=2000 | issue=03 | pages = | year = 2000 | url = http://www.owl.ru/eng/womplus/2000/bachai.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Yerevan]] and [[Artez]] and communication re-established.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite web| last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies | work = Research notes | publisher = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation  | format = | doi =| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the time of [[Perestroika]], when increasing freedoms were allowed, there were enough Bahá’ís in some cities that Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] could be formed in those Bahá’í communities in 1991.&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmadi |first=Dr. |title=Major events of the Century of Light |work=homepage for an online course on the book “Century of Light” |publisher=Association for Bahá’í Studies in Southern Africa |year=2003 |url=http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/light/time-line-bahai.htm |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517111900/http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/light/time-line-bahai.htm |archivedate=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian Bahá’ís were able to elect their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1995.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;
In such a situation, where religious observance had been a criminal activity, a religious census is problematic.  Operation World, published in 2001, approximated the number of Bahá’ís in Armenia at 1400.&lt;ref name ="oper-w"&gt;{{cite web

Three years later, Bahá’ís counted only about 200.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web

==Early period==
Contact between Armenia and the Bahá'í Faith begins with the history of the interactions between [[Haji Mirza Aqasi]] and [[Mírzá `Abbás Núrí]], followed by three successive banishments of the [[Báb]] by order of Aqasi and a trial as an apostate. For acts such as these Aqasi was termed "the Antichrist of the Bábí Revelation" by [[Shoghi Effendi]]&lt;ref name="Aqasi"/&gt; When younger, Aqasi fell from favor for a few years from 1821 as a result of repercussions from rivalry between [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s elder brothers in the Court of the Shah but later when Aqasi was Prime Minister he instigated several actions against Bahá'u'lláh's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | first = Rob | last = Stauffer | title = History of the House of Baha'u'llah in Tihran, Iran | version = | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | date = | url =http://bahai-library.com/stauffer_history_house_bahaullah | format = | accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Aqasi fell from power the movement against the Báb he had fostered resulted in the plans to execute him. It was Armenian soldiers who took part in the first attempt of the [[Execution of the Báb]]. According to the report of the execution, written to [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, by [[Sir Justin Shiel]], [[Queen Victoria]]'s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran on July 22, 1850, records: "When the smoke and dust cleared away after the volley, Báb was not to be seen, and the populace proclaimed that he had ascended to the skies. The balls had broken the ropes by which he was bound…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Ferraby, John  |year = 1975 |title = All Things Made New: A Comprehensive Outline of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Bahá'í Distribution Service  |isbn = 81-86953-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly, the Báb and his young companion were found and brought out for execution. The Armenian troops refused to fire, and a Muslim firing squad was assembled and ordered to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Báb, Forerunner of Bahá'u'lláh | work = Bahá'í Topics | publisher = Bahá'í  International Community | year = 2009 | url = http://info.bahai.org/the-bab-forerunner.html | doi = | accessdate = 2009-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422184604/http://info.bahai.org/the-bab-forerunner.html| archivedate= 22 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1850 onwards small groups of Bábís spread across the [[Caucasus]] including Armenia.&lt;ref name="azer2"/&gt;

By the time the effects of the [[October Revolution]] began to spread across the Russian Empire transforming it into the [[Soviet Union]], Bahá'ís had spread through much of Soviet territory.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Baha'i Faith History in Azerbaijan |work= |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan |url=http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml |doi= |accessdate=2008-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219032306/http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the Soviet [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|policy of religious oppression]], the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and any properties were nationalized. By 1938 most communities across the Soviet Union had lost contact with the Bahá'ís elsewhere.&lt;ref name="wob"/&gt; In 1953 Bahá'ís started to move to the [[Soviet Republics]] in Asia, after the head of the religion at the time, [[Shoghi Effendi]], initiated a plan called the [[Ten Year Crusade]]. At the culmination of this plan, in 1963, various centers were restored in the region including Armenia,&lt;ref name="bachai"/&gt; and at the time there was a Bahá'í community not only in [[Yerevan]] but also in [[Artez]].&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;

==Modern community==
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Momen  | first = Moojan |authorlink= Moojan Momen  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url = http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen|authorlink= Moojan Momen  |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. When  [[Perestroika]] allowed an atmosphere in which the Bahá'ís began to meet and organize again, the first Local Spiritual Assemblies of Armenia formed in 1991.&lt;ref name="century"/&gt; After being part of the regional national assembly with Russia since 1992, Armenian Bahá'ís elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1995&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; with [[Hand of the Cause]], [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] representing the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref name="rid95"&gt;{{cite web | last = Universal House of Justice | first =  | authorlink = Universal House of Justice | title =   Ridván 1995 | work = Ridván Messages | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | year = 1995 | url =http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ridvan_1995 | accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a history of contributing to societies in which the Bahá'ís are located, there are laws proposed in the Armenian legislature in 2009 proposing to circumscribe religious activities: one proposes that those who organise campaigns to spread their faith would face up to two years' imprisonment, while those who simply engage in spreading their faith would face up to one year's imprisonment or a fine of more than eight years' minimum wages while the other proposes that gaining legal status would require 1,000 adult members and other restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1272 |title=ARMENIA: A "serious setback to the development of a modern, progressive and liberal Armenia" |first=Felix |last=Corley |publisher=Forum 18 News Service |date= 2009-03-24 |accessdate=2009-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090609200934/http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1272| archivedate= 9 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1251 |title=ARMENIA: Two years' imprisonment for organising sharing of faith? |first=Felix |last=Corley |publisher=Forum 18 News Service |date= 2009-02-09 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian daily newspaper, [[Golos Armenii]], wrote in 1995, 'It seems that in our society there is a group of absolutely defenceless people, who can be constantly beaten and terrorised.' Later in the report it stated, 'In other words, we are dealing with a case of pre-planned and widespread assault on (various religions including the Bahá'ís).'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Update on the Repression of Religious Freedom in Armenia| volume=03 | issue=01 | newspaper = [[ISKCON Communications Journal]] | pages = | date = July 1995 | url =http://content.iskcon.org/icj/3_1/ice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
There is no reliable system in place for compiling accurate census data, but the Bahá'ís claim about 200 members&lt;ref name="free"/&gt; but as of 2001 [[Operation World]] estimated about 1,400 adherents (0.04% of population),&lt;ref name ="oper-w"/&gt; which are mostly in [[Yerevan]].&lt;ref name="free"/&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 1,100 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-history==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mentioning the need for the message of the religion to visit the Latin American countries `Abdu'l-Bahá continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All the above countries have importance, but especially the Republic of Panama, wherein the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans come together through the [[Panama Canal]]. It is a center for travel and passage from America to other continents of the world, and in the future it will gain most great importance.....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html | pages = 31–32 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Martha Root]]'s first trip was from July to November 1919, and included Panama on the return leg of the trip up the west coast of South America.&lt;ref name="yang"/&gt;

Following the Tablets and about the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá's passing in 1921, a few other Bahá'ís began moving to, or at least visiting, Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

==Early phase==
{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.

It was in 1939&lt;ref name="Rhodenbaugh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodenbaugh |first=Molly Marie |title=The Ngöbe Baha'is of Panama |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]] |date=August 1999 |url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |others=MA Thesis in Anthropology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213017/http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;-1940 when the first [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] began to settle in Panama.&lt;ref name="communidad"/&gt; The first Local Spiritual Assembly of Panama, in Panama City, was elected in 1946, and helped host the first All-American Teaching Conference.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; One Bahá'í from this early period was Mabel Adelle Sneider (converted in 1946), who was a nurse at [[Gorgas Hospital]] for 30 years and then pioneered to the [[Gilbert Islands]] for many years.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = Table of Contents and pp. 705–7, 723–5 | nopp = yes | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/693-719.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, American Baha'i Alfred Osborne converted the first indigenous believer, a [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] from Playa Chico.&lt;ref name="Rhodenbaugh"/&gt;

In January 1947 Panama City hosted the first congress of the northern Latin Americas to build a new consciousness of unity among the Bahá'ís of Central America, Mexico and the West Indies to focus energies for the election of a regional national assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Panama Conference Demonstrates Unity |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1947 | issue = 192 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members were Josi Antonio Bonilla, Marcia Steward, Natalia Chávez, Gerardo Vega, and Oscar Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin America has Arisen with a Will|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1947 | issue = 186 |pages=14–15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | issue = 493 | page =2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953.

Shoghi Effendi then called for two international conventions to be held at April 1951; one was held in Panama City for the purpose of electing a regional National Spiritual Assembly&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; over the Central area of [[Mexico]] and the [[West Indies]] whose headquarters was in Panama and which was witnessed by representatives of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States in the persons of [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]] and [[Horace Holley (1887-1960)|Horace Holly]].&lt;ref name="holly"&gt;{{cite web | last = Jackson Armstrong-Ingram | first = R. | title = Horace Hotchkiss Holley  | work = Draft for "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/armstrong-ingram_encyclopedia_horace_holley | accessdate = 2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 1953, Bahá'í Local Assemblies in Panama City and [[Colón, Panama|Colón]] had a community center.&lt;ref name="vahid0"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_statistics_1844-1950 | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = Bahá'í Faith, The: 1844&amp;ndash;1950 | location = Wilmette, Illinois | publisher =  Bahá'í Publishing Committee | year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable Bahá'í from this early phase was Cecilia King Blake, who on October 20, 1957 converted to the Bahá'í Faith and [[pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneered]] to [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/720-748.html]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Bahá'ís in Panama have embarked on a number of projects. The Panamanian government noted the activities of the Bahá'ís and released a variety of [[philately]] products starting in 1983 and again in 1992 - a stamp and several [[Postal stationery|stationaries]]&lt;ref name="philately1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philately2"/&gt; and Panamanian Bahá'ís became active in a number of issues among the poor regions of Panama - notably [[Panamá]] and [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]]/[[Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca|Ngöbe-Buglé]] districts as well as among indigenous peoples.

In Panama's remote indigenous villages (some requiring three hours by bus, three hours by boat, and then three hours on foot, a trip made twice a week) Bahá'í volunteers run ten primary schools where the government does not provide access to a school. Later a [[FUNDESCU]]&lt;ref&gt;FUNDESCU is different from [[FUNDAEC]] though there are many similarities. FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bahá'í consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized [[urbanization]] for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bahá'í consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but it failed from differences. {{Cite journal|last=Rhodenbaugh |first=Molly Marie |title=The Ngöbe Baha'is of Panama |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]] |date=August 1999 |url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |pages=119–123 |others=MA Thesis in Anthropology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213017/http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stipend of $50 per month was made available for 13 teachers and the MInistry of Education added funds for a 14th. As subsistence farmers, the villagers have no money or food to offer. Instead they take turns providing firewood for an outdoor kitchen or build small wood-framed shelters with corrugated zinc panels and a narrow wooden platform for a bed. The teachers and administrators do not seek to convert the students. Some of the villagers are Bahá'ís, some are Catholics, some Evangelicals, and some follow the native [[Mama Tata]] religion. In all, about half the students are Bahá'ís (about 150). Nevertheless, there is a strong moral component to the program including a weekly class on "Virtues and Values." Over the years, some training for the teachers has been provided but many have not finished the twelfth grade including some women who have faced difficulties getting even that much education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is a diverse and widespread religion founded by Bahá'u'lláh in the 19th century in Iran. Bahá'í sources usually estimate the worldwide Bahá'í population to be above 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worldwide Community |author=Bahá'í International Community | publisher = Bahá'í International Community |year = 2006 |accessdate =31 May 2006 |url= http://www.bahai.org/dir/worldwide| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060613035122/http://bahai.org/dir/worldwide| archivedate= 13 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most encyclopedias and similar sources estimate between 5 and 6 million Bahá'ís in the world in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="britannica_stats"&gt;{{cite web |title=Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-2002 |work=Enyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica |year = 2002 |accessdate =31 May 2006 |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/table?tocId=9394911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Major Religions of the World Ranked by Number of Adherents |author= adherents.com | publisher = adherents.com |year = 2002 |accessdate =28 August 2005 |url= http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Baha'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized, hierarchical community, but the Bahá'í population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity.&lt;ref name="britannica_stats"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Denis | last = MacEoin |chapter = Baha'i Faith |editor=Hinnells, John R. |title=The New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions: Second Edition|publisher=[[Penguin books|Penguin]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-14-051480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Bahá'í statistics]].

==South America==

The Bahá'í Faith was introduced into South America in 1919 when [[Martha Root]] made an extended trip to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. She introduced the Bahá'í Faith to [[Esperantists]] and Theosophical groups and visited local newspapers to ask them to publish articles about the Bahá'í Faith. The first Bahá'í permanently resident in South America was [[Leonora Armstrong]], who arrived in Brazil in 1921. The first Seven Year Plan (1937–44), an international plan organized by then head of the Bahá'í Faith, Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America (that is, settling at least one Bahá'í or converting at least one native). In 1950, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South America was first elected, and then in 1957 this Assembly was split into two – basically northern/eastern South America with the Republics of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in Lima, Peru and one of the western/southern South America with the Republics of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844–1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953–1963 | publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1963  | location = Haifa, Israel | pages = 22, 46 | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963, most countries in South America had their own [[National Spiritual Assembly]].

===Developments===
Among the more significant developments across South and Central America for the religion has been the building of the last continental [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Chile, a program of developing [[Bahá'í radio]] stations in several countries, relationships with [[Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans|indigenous populations]], development programs like [[FUNDAEC]], and the [[Ruhi institute]] process began in Colombia.

====House of Worship in Chile====
{{main|Bahá'í House of Worship}}

In late 2002, the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Chile|Bahá'ís of Chile]] and the [[Universal House of Justice]], the international governing body of the Bahá'ís, announced a competition for the design of the first Bahá'í House of Worship for South America, to be built near [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] ({{coord|33.476423|S|70.511649|W|display=inline}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=33°28'35.1"S 70°30'41.9"W - Google Maps|trans-title=|periodical=google.de|publisher=|url=https://www.google.de/maps/place/33%C2%B028'35.1%22S+70%C2%B030'41.9%22W/@-33.476423,-70.513843,651m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d-33.476423!4d-70.511649|format=|accessdate=2017-04-27|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the general decision to have the first temple of South America was set since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Foundation |work=The Chilean Temple Initiative |publisher=The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States |year=2007 |url=http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/54/57/ |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725164058/http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/54/57/ |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The selected design was designed by [[Siamak Hariri]] of Toronto, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Scott | first = Alec | title = Higher Power - Toronto architect Siamak Hariri ascends to architectural greatness | work = Arts - Art &amp; Design | publisher =  CBC.ca |date = 2006-07-13 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/hariri.html | accessdate = 2008-03-03| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223095335/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/hariri.html| archivedate= 23 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fabrication of components began in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fabrication begins on components for Baha'i temple in South America | publisher =  BWNS | date = 2007-02-19 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/505 | accessdate = 2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was inaugurated in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Religion der Bahai - Neues "Haus der Andacht" in Chile|trans-title=|periodical=deutschlandfunk.de|publisher=|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/die-religion-der-bahai-neues-haus-der-andacht-in-chile.886.de.html?dram:article_id=368870|format=|accessdate=2017-04-27|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sides are composed of translucent panels of [[alabaster]] and cast glass.

====Bahá'í radio====
{{main|Bahá'í radio}}
Since the 1960s there has been interest in mass media to promote and support development projects. This was followed by a view that the service of the community of the religion was through the participation of the community and spread of information. At a series of [[UNESCO]] conferences Bahá'ís consulted and the consensus of opinion lead to advancing the issues until in 1978 a conference was held in Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Kurt"&gt;{{Cite book
  | last = Hein
  | first = Kurt John

  | url = http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=159
  | isbn = 0-85398-272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that conference researchers summarized developments along these lines and noted challenges such projects faced and a few ways such projects failed while also noting that village radio stations seemed to be a nice fit because of the necessary quality of communication in a society. The Bahá'í Radio project in [[Ecuador]] served as a means to study the process of the two trends by setting up a community radio station of the community for the community - and may have been the first such project in all Latin America aimed at serving the ''campesinos'' as its primary purpose with development oriented programming.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; It mixed national music forms with public service features (lost and found, messages to individuals, official communications, but looking to develop more.) The project was studied through faculty from [[Northwestern University]] from 1980–1982, and briefly in 1983, and reviewed Bahá'í Radio projects in Peru and Bolivia as well and resulted in a PhD by Kurt John Hein in 1985 following which he took up service at [[WLGI]] Radio Bahá'í.

Since 1977, Bahá'ís have established several radio stations worldwide, particularly in South America. Programmes broadcast may include local news, music, topics related to  socio-economic and community development, educational programmes focusing on [[indigenous language]] and culture, and Bahá'í introductory and deepening material.&lt;ref name="Smith-siyah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= radio; radio stations|year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indigenous peoples====
{{main|Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans}}

The Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans has a history reaching back to the lifetime of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the head of the religion near the turn of the 20th century and has multiplied its relationships across the Americas. Individuals have joined the religion and institutions have been founded to serve Native Americans and have Native Americans serve on Bahá'í institutions.

By 1963 Bahá'í sources claim members of some 83 tribes of Native Americans had joined the religion.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844–1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953–1963 | publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1963  | location = Haifa, Israel | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} Among the Central and South American indigenous there are substantial populations of native Bahá'ís.  An informal summary of the [[Wayuu]] ( a tribe living in [[La Guajira Desert]]) community in 1971 showed about 1000 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =  Mass Teaching is the only way to tell the people in time|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1971 | number = 483 | page =23| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest population of Bahá'ís in South America is in [[Demographics of Bolivia|Bolivia]], a country whose population is estimated to be 55%–70% indigenous and 30%–42% [[Mestizo]], with a Bahá'í population estimated at 206,000 in 2005 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]].&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between North American and South American Indian populations have been fostered by North American Indians. The idea for a ''Trail of Light'' occurred during preparations for the first Bahá'í Native Council in 1978. Another inspiration for the Trail of Light was the concept of promulgating the religion among the indigenous peoples in the [[Pacific Rim]] that was described by the [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rahmátu'llah Muhájir]] in 1978. The Trail of Light, also known as ''Camino del Sol'', was defined as a process whereby native Bahá'ís engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples. The first ''Trail of Light'' traveling trip by 22 members of the religion occurred spontaneously immediately after the council.&lt;ref name="BN594"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Trail of Light' Native American teaching effort follows North American Baha'i Native Council |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1980 | number = 594|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=6–7 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Alaska - A Baha'i community grows, matures |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1981 | number = 607 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–6 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 the Trail of Light project began its work in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Train of Light' completes successful visit|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1985 | number = 656 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–3 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=11&amp;page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FUNDAEC====
{{main|FUNDAEC}}

'''FUNDAEC''', the acronym in Spanish for “The Foundation for the Application and Teaching of the Sciences”, is a non-profit, [[non-governmental organization]] that focuses on training and development in the rural areas of [[Colombia]] and other countries in [[Latin America]]. It was created in 1974 in Colombia by a group of scientists and professionals led by [[Farzam Arbab]] then a visiting professor to the [[University of Valle]] in 1970. In 1974 FUNDAEC was initiated as a Colombian NGO based on Bahá'í consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s which developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized [[urbanization]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rhodenbaugh |first=Molly Marie |title=The Ngöbe Baha'is of Panama |type=MA Thesis in Anthropology |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]] |date=August 1999 |url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |pages=119–123 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213017/http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gustav Correa, director of FUNDAEC in 2002, it was originally inspired by a quotation from [[Bahá'u'lláh]] - "Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.' He says that 'education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom'.&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baha'i-inspired educational system for the poor of the world honored by the Club of Budapest | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | location = Frankfurt, Germany  | publisher = Bahá’í International Community | date = 22 December 2002 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/185 | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founding ideals included not seeing the people as masses of undernourished people, overwhelmed by problems and needs-housing, employment, sanitation, education, but instead to consider the participants of its programs as irreplaceable resources in a self-sustaining process of change.&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Arbab | first = Farzam | first2 = Gustavo | last2 = Correa| first3 = Francia | last3 = de Valcarcel | title = FUNDAEC: Its Principles and its Activities | publisher = CELATER, Cali, Colombia | year = 1988 | url = http://www.fundaec.org/en/institution/celater_doc.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; FUNDAEC was officially instituted as a private development foundation based in [[Cali]], and has developed a number of development projects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Historical Overview | work = Official Website of FUNDAEC | publisher = FUNDAEC | url =http://www.fundaec.org/en/historical/history2.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; centered around a goal that rural populations should not only benefit from higher education, but should also actively participate in creating and generating knowledge and technologies, to improve their quality of life and standard of living FUNDAEC sought to dispel the image of the poor farmer whose life must be planned and managed by more privileged members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rural Community-based System for University-level Education |publisher=International Development Research Centre |date=March 13, 1998 |url=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-26929-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |accessdate=2010-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519092300/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-26929-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ruhi institute====
{{main|Ruhi institute}}

The Ruhi Institute is an educational institution, operating under the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Statement of purpose and methods| work = Official Website of the Ruhi Institute | publisher = The Ruhi Foundation | year = 2008 | url = http://www.ruhi.org/institute/index.php | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general idea of an '''institute''' in Bahá'í terms originates with the beginning of the ''Nine Year Plan'' (starting in 1964) designated by the [[Universal House of Justice]]. The ''institute'' or ''training institute'' was especially for countries where large-scale expansion was taking place to meet the needs of the thousands who were entering the religion. At that time, the emphasis was on acquiring a physical facility to which group after group of newly enrolled believers would be invited to attend deepening courses. Over the years, in conjunction with these institutes as well as independent of them, a number of courses—referred to, for example, as weekend institutes, five-day institutes, and nine-day institutes— were developed for the purpose of promulgating the ''fundamental verities'' of the religion and how to serve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper | vauthors = ((Universal House of Justice)), ((Department of the Secretariat)) | authorlink = Universal House of Justice | title = Extracts From Messages Written By The Universal House Of Justice On The Four Year Plan Related To Training Institutes | booktitle =  | page = 1 | publisher = The Bahá'í Community of Guelph | date = December 1998 | location =  | url = http://cluster9.org/heading.php?body=docs_body.htm&amp;head=docs_head.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-12 | journal =  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725181347/http://cluster9.org/heading.php?body=docs_body.htm&amp;head=docs_head.htm | archive-date = 25 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding the program of courses developed first in Colombia has been adopted for work around the world and across age groups and studied in a variety of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Closson| first =Rosemary B. |author2=Sylvia Kaye| title =Understanding the Bahá'í Ruhi Institute: A Global Faith-Based Adult Education Process | journal = Adult Learning  | volume =18 | issue =9 | pages =9–11 | date =Jan 1, 2007 | url =http://alx.sagepub.com/content/18/1-2/9 | doi =10.1177/104515950701800103 | accessdate = July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortensen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Z.

====Brazil====

{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Brazil}}

The Bahá'í Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] first visiting the country that year,&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; and the first Bahá'í [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928. There followed a period of growth with the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] from the United States finding national Brazilian converts and in 1961 an independent national Bahá'í community was formed. During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bahá'í community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bahá'í community in the country have continued to multiply. The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'') estimated some 42211 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;

====Chile====
{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Chile}}
The Bahá'í Faith was first mentioned Chile in Bahá'í sources as early as 1916, with [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] visiting as early as 1919 but the community wasn't founded in Chile until 1940 with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] from the United States finding national Chilean converts and achieved an independent national community in 1963. In 2002 this community was picked for the establishment of the first [[Bahá'í House of Worship#Santiago, Chile|Bahá'í Temple]] of South America which the community is still prosecuting.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt;

The permanent Chilean Bahá'í community dates from the arrival of Marcia Stewart Atwater, born in 1904 in [[Pasadena, California]], who arrived in Chile on 7 December 1940.&lt;ref name="steward"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Janet | last = Ruhe-Schoen | title = An Enchantment of the Heart – A Portrait of Marcia Steward, Knight of Bahá’u’lláh, First Bahá’í Pioneer to Chile and the Marshall Islands | work = The Chilean Temple Initiative | year = 2007 | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States | url = http://www.chilean-temple.org/images/stories/Early%20Baha/%27is/an_enchantment_of_the_heart.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Chilean to accept the Bahá'í Faith was 12-year-old Paul Bravo, which was followed by his family becoming Bahá'ís. Then in 1943, Chile's first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected. Following the election of the Regional Bahá'í Spiritual Assembly of South America in 1950, Chile established its independent Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1961.

Early Buddhism appears to have been silent concerning homosexual relations.&lt;ref name="James William Coleman 2002, page 146"/&gt;

According to the [[Pāli Canon]] &amp; [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]] (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is no saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct,&lt;ref name="cunda kammaraputta sutta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta|trans-title=To Cunda the Silversmith|others=Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|publisher=Access to Insight|year=1997|id=[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.176|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html| accessdate = 2011-03-14|quote=Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.

This is clear, sound advice and seems to suggest that sexual misconduct is that which would disrupt existing family or love relationships. This is consonant with the general Buddhist principle that that which causes suffering for oneself or others is unethical behaviour. ("Unskillful behaviour" would be closer to the original.) There is no good reason to assume that '''''homosexual relations which do not violate this principle''''' should be treated differently. }}

Some later traditions feature restrictions on non-vaginal sex (some Buddhist texts mention non-vaginal sex as sexual misconduct, including men having sex with men or [[Pandaka|paṇḍaka]]) though some buddhist monks interpret such texts as being about forced sex.&lt;ref name="harvey 2000 421"&gt;{{cite book| last = harvey | first = peter | title = An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780511800801 | pages=421-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coerced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra"/&gt; This non-vaginal sex view is not based on what Buddha said, but from some later scriptures such as the [[Abhidharma]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thubten Chodron|title=Dealing  With  Life’s  Issues|url=https://thubtenchodron.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dealing-With-Lifes-Issues.pdf|quote=The Pali scriptures make no mention of homosexuality being unwise sexual conduct. For monastics, all sexual intercourse is a root downfall. It doesn't specify the gender of one's partner. Vasubandhu, a teacher who came several centuries after the Buddha, discouraged homosexuality. He wrote: "Personally speaking, I think what's most important is the motivation behind how we use our sexuality. In other words, if people use their sexuality unkindly or unwisely, it doesn't matter if it is directed to someone of their own sex or the opposite sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=José Ignacio Cabezón|title=Thinking through Texts: Toward a Critical Buddhist Theology of Sexuality|url=http://info-buddhism.com/Buddhism-Sexuality-Cabezon.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|quote=Now the obvious historical question then becomes this: If the early doctrine of sexual misconduct is so simple and elegant, when and why did it get so complex and restrictive – that is, when do we find the transition to “organ/orifice mode”? The answer to the “when” question is simple. We don’t find any examples of the more elaborate formulation of sexual misconduct before the third century CE.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Buddhist monks, the [[Vinaya]] (code of monastic discipline) bans all sexual activity, but does so in purely physiological terms, making no moral distinctions among the many possible forms of intercourse it lists.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Haggerty, ''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia''. Taylor and Francis 2000, pages 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Buddhists there is a wide diversity of opinion about homosexuality. Buddhism teaches that sensual enjoyment and desire in general, and sexual pleasure in particular, are hindrances to [[Bodhi|enlightenment]], and inferior to the kinds of pleasure (see, e.g. [[pīti]], a [[Pāli]] word often translated as "rapture") that are integral to the practice of [[jhāna]]. However, most Buddhists do not only pursue skill in meditation or aim for enlightenment. For most, the goal is a pleasant life and, after death, a pleasant rebirth. For these Buddhists, enjoying sensual pleasures in a non-harmful way is normative.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Buddhist texts==

===Early texts===
[[Image:Buddha portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is often portrayed as an [[Asexuality|asexual]] figure, such as in this painting from a monastery in [[Laos]].]]

Within the earliest monastic texts such as the [[Vinaya]] ([[circa|c.]] 4th century BCE), male monks are explicitly forbidden from having sexual relations with any of the [[Third gender|four genders]]: male, female, ''ubhatovyanjañaka'' and ''paṇḍaka''; various meanings of these words are given below. Later, the Buddha allowed the ordination of women, forbade ordination to these other types of people, with exceptions to a few particular types of paṇḍaka.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Pandakavatthu section of the Mahavagga. 1:61, 68, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha's proscriptions against certain types of people joining the monastic sangha (ordained community) are often understood to reflect his concern with upholding the public image of the sangha as virtuous; in some cases, this is explicitly stated. Social acceptability was vital for the sangha, as it could not survive without material support from lay society.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2000, page 390"&gt;Peter Harvey, ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics''. Cambridge University Press, 2000, page 390. Quoting Sponberg 1992, 13–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ubhatovyanjañakas====
The word ''ubhatovyanjañaka'' is usually thought to describe people who have both male and female sexual characteristics: [[hermaphrodites]]&lt;ref&gt;The Pali Text Society Pali-English Dictionary defines ubhatobyanjanaka as "Having the characteristics of both sexes, hermaphrodite". Rhys Davids, T. W. &amp; William Stede (eds.), ''Pali-English Dictionary,'' Oriental Books Reprint Corporation, New Delhi, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[intersex]]). In the Vinaya, it is said that ''ubhatovyanjañaka'' should not be ordained, on account of the possibility that they would entice a fellow monk or nun into having sex.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, op cit, pages 412–413; the bad can be found at Vin. I.89; Vin. II.271.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paṇḍakas====
The ''paṇḍaka'' is a complex category that is variously defined in different Buddhist texts. In the earliest texts, the word seems to refer to a socially stigmatized class of promiscuous, passive, probably transvestite men, who were possibly prostitutes with other males.&lt;ref name="Harvey, Peter 2000 p.416"&gt;Harvey, Peter (2000). ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues'', Cambridge press. p.416. {{ISBN|978-0-521-55640-8}}, {{ISBN|0-521-55640-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, in Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism, page 683.&lt;/ref&gt; Paisarn Likhitpreechakul argue that these men are grouped together as special types of those suffering impotence due to seminal absence/deficiency rather than gender roles.&lt;ref name=Semen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paisarn Likhitpreechakul|first1=Paisarn|title=Semen, Viagra and Pandaka: Ancient Endocrinology and Modern Day Discrimination|journal=Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=3|url=http://jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paṇḍaka are categorized with others who are also excluded from ordination; either those with physical abnormalities such as [[deaf]]ness or [[dwarfism]], or those who have committed crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Vinaya: Mahavagga, 1:71, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Story of the Prohibition of the Ordination of Pandaka" from the Vinaya explains that the ban is a response to the example of a monk with an insatiable desire to be sexually penetrated by men, who requested and received this from some animal handlers, who then in turn related the incident to the wider community and brought disgrace upon the sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Vinaya, Vol. 4, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, pages 415f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Lotus Sutra]], it mentioned [[Bodhisattva]] shouldn't go near Paṇḍaka,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotus Sutra]]: Leon Hurvitz, trans., ''Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1976), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotus Sutra]]:If he enters the house of another person, he should not engage in talk with the young girls, unmarried women or widows. Nor should he go near the five types of unmanly men or have any close dealings with them.&lt;/ref&gt; as like what monk rules said in Vinaya. The [[Milinda Panha]], mentions Paṇḍaka as being sexually imperfect.&lt;ref name="Milinda Panha, 100 BC. p. 310"&gt;[[Milinda Panha]], 100 BC. p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milinda Panha]]: There are nine kinds of people, Nâgasena, who let out a secret that has been talked over with them, and treasure it not up in their hearts. And who are the nine? The lustful man reveals it in obedience to some lust, the ill-tempered man in consequence of some ill-will, the deluded man under some mistake. The timid man reveals it through fear, and the man greedy for gain to get something out of it. A woman reveals it through infirmity, a drunkard in his eagerness for drink, a eunuch (Paṇḍaka) because of his imperfection, and a child through fickleness.&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBTQ+ people in later traditions===
Some modern commentators interpret the word ''ubhatovyanjañaka'' as including those who are not physical [[intersex]], but display behavioral and psychological characteristics of both sexes, such as a woman who is attracted to other women.&lt;ref&gt;Bunmi Methangkun, head of the traditionalist Abhidhamma Foundation in Thailand, describes two types of hermaphrodites, namely, female (Pali: itthi-ubhatobyan janaka) and male (Pali: purisa-ubhatobyanjanaka). According to Bunmi, an itthi-ubhatobyanjanaka is physically female, including having normal female genitals, but when physically attracted to another woman, "her previously female mind disappears and changes instead into the mind of a man, and at the same time male genitals appear while her female genitals disappear and she is able to have sexual intercourse with that woman." (Bunmi Methangkun, Khon Pen Kathoey Dai Yang-rai (How Can People Be Kathoeys?), Abhidhamma Foundation, Bangkok, 2529 (1986).)&lt;/ref&gt; 5th-century Buddhist writer [[Buddhaghosa]] describes ''ubhatobyanjanaka'' as people with the body of one sex but the "power", or gender of the other. Leonard Zwilling argues that in this account Buddhaghosa does not in fact describe "hermaphroditism" but rather bisexuality or homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Zwilling, Leonard (1992). "Homosexuality As Seen In Indian Buddhist Texts", in Cabezon, Jose Ignacio, Ed., ''Buddhism, Sexuality &amp; Gender'', State University of New York. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Gyatso pointed out that Zwilling destroys his own argument that pandakas are homosexuals when he writes, "The Vinaya, in fact, goes so far as to distinguish sexual activity between normative males from sexual relations between a socially normative male and a pandaka."&lt;ref name=Gyatso&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Gyatso|editor=Karen Derris; Natalie Gummer|title=Defining Buddhism(s): A Reader（One plus one makes three: buddhist gender, monasticism, and the law of the non-excluded middle）|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134937325|url=https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=D7bsCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT26&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;pg=PT250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=It should be noted that neither pandaka or ma ning are code words for homosexuality as such, as some have argued, and in any event same-sex sex is not singled out as distinct from other kinds of proscribed sexual activity in the Vinaya....It seems that people who desire conventional homosexual sex, whatever that might be, can be ordained and can stay ordained as long as they do not actually have sex. Exactly the same would be true for people with heterosexual desire. Zwilling destroys his own argument that pandakas are homosexuals when he writes, "The Vinaya, in fact, goes so far as to distinguish sexual activity between normative males from sexual relations between a socially normative male and a pandaka."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other texts, the term ''paṇḍaka'' can include those born sexually indeterminate or with no sex, [[eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s, those whose impotence changes every half month, males who gain sexual potency by absorbing other men's semen, or spying on other people   having sex. It sometimes includes males or females with any sexual dysfunction, such as impotence or irregular [[menstrual cycle]]s. The common element seems to be those whose sexuality is either limited physiologically, or those who are sexually impotent. Together these impotence types are almost always portrayed negatively as a pariah class, especially in the earliest texts. In modern contexts, paṇḍaka is sometimes wrongly interpreted to include [[lesbian]]s, [[gay]] men, and [[transgender]] and intersex people,&lt;ref&gt;Zwilling, Leonard (1992). "Homosexuality As Seen In Indian Buddhist Texts", in Cabezon, Jose Ignacio, Ed., ''Buddhism, Sexuality &amp; Gender'', State University of New York. Pp. 203–214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Semen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gyatso/&gt; although in ancient times, a man who sexually penetrated another man or a paṇḍaka was not himself considered a paṇḍaka.&lt;ref name="Harvey, Peter 2000 p.416"/&gt;

Some texts of the [[Abhidharma]] state that a paṇḍaka cannot achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime, but must wait for reincarnation as a man or woman. [[Ananda]] — Buddha's cousin and disciple — was said to be a paṇḍaka in one of his many previous lives, as was the Buddhist nun [[Isidāsī]] (from the [[Therigatha]]). In both cases birth as a paṇḍaka was a result of poor [[karma]], and the idea that being a paṇḍaka stems from bad behaviour in a previous life is common in Buddhist literature.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Pravrajyantaraya Sutra, or the 7th century Ta-ch'eng tsao-hsiang kung-te sutra. In the latter, a man "with the lusts and desires of a woman, [who] enjoys being treated as a woman by other men" despised other men or enjoyed dressing as a woman in a previous life.&lt;/ref&gt; Asanga and Vasubandhu discussed if a pandaka was able to be enlightened or not.

In the [[Samantapasadika]], a work of the 5th century CE [[Theravada|Theravadin]] commentator and scholar [[Buddhaghosa]]'s, paṇḍaka are described as being filled with defiling passions (''ussanakilesa''), unquenchable lusts (''avapasantaparilaha'') and are dominated by their libido (''parilahavegabhibhuta''). The 4th century mahayana Buddhist writers [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Asanga]] contend that the paṇḍaka has no discipline for spiritual practice, due to their defiling passions of both male and female sexes. They lack the moral fortitude to counter these passions because they lack modesty and shame. Incapable of showing restraint, such a being is abandoned by their parents and lacking such ties are unable to hold strong views. Asanga, like Vasubandhu, refuse the pandaka recognition as a layman on the grounds that such persons are unfit to associate with or serve the Sangha. Asanga, however, considers them capable to practice the path of a layman individually if they so desire, but without receiving recognition as a layman or being introduced in the sangha. A position similar to Asanga view was also featured in the [[Lotus Sutra]], where sangha members were advised to avoid the paṇḍaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hurvitz | first = Leon | title = Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma(The Lotus Sutra) | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0231148955 | page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddha's proscriptions against certain types of people joining the monastic [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] (ordained community) are often understood to reflect his concern with upholding the public image of the sangha as virtuous. [[Peter Jackson (academic)|Peter Jackson]], scholar of sexual politics and Buddhism in Thailand, speculates that the Buddha was initially reluctant to allow women to join the sangha for this reason. Jackson explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Buddhism, the middle path, has always been concerned with the maintenance of social order and since the Buddha's time the sangha has never claimed to provide a universal vehicle for the spiritual liberation of all individuals in society, explicitly excluding those who are considered to reflect badly on the monkhood in terms of prevailing social norms and attitudes.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2000, page 390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson, Peter A. 1998"&gt;Jackson, Peter A. (1998). "Male Homosexuality and Transgenderism in the Thai Buddhist Tradition". In ''Queer Dharma: Voices of Gay Buddhists'', edited by Winston Leyland.  San Francisco : Gay Sunshine Press. {{ISBN|0-940567-22-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social acceptability was vital for the sangha, as it could not survive without material support from lay society.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2000, page 390"/&gt;

Several theravada Buddhist texts state that the members of the paṇḍaka are excluded from a variety of Buddhist practices (in addition to ordination):

* acting as preceptors in ordination ceremonies&lt;ref name="mahavagga"&gt;Mahavagga 1.69, 38.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* making donations to begging monks&lt;ref name="mahavagga"/&gt;
* meditating and&lt;ref&gt;Ref from Gyatso (2003): For example, Visuddhimagga 5.40–42 (translated in Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa, The Path of Purification, trans. Bhikkhu Nyanamoli, 2 vols. [Berkeley: Shambhala, 1976]) avers that both hermaphrodites and pandakas are among those who cannot develop kasina concentration, of indeed any kind of meditation at all, due to their defilement and bad kamma. Abhidharmakosabhasya 4.43 also asserts that neither pandakas or sandahas are subject to any of the three disciplines (from verse 13: those of monasticism, meditation, and the pure path), nor indeed the absence thereof.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ability to understand the [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="Milinda Panha, 100 BC. p. 310"/&gt;

Classical mahayana scholars like [[Shantideva]] and [[Aśvaghoṣa]] considered non-vagina sex to be sexual misconduct. Shantideva based his views on quotes from the Saddharma-smrtyupasthana Sutra.&lt;ref name="harvey 2000 421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newland p.220"&gt;Cutler/Newland ''The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightnment'' p.220&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mizuno Kōgen's study, Saddharma-smrtyupasthana Sutra is related to Ghoṣa's Abhidharmāmṛtarasaśāstra, and is compiled by [[Sarvastivada]] (possibly from someone related to Ghoṣa after the 2nd century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=水野弘元 (Mizuno Kōgen)|title=佛敎文獻硏究|year=2003|page=49-51|url=https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=XTMCprlsolUC&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Four [['Sarvastivada Abhidharma]] ([[Prakaranapada]], [[Mahavibhasa]], Saṃyuktābhidharmahṛdaya, and Abhidharmāmṛtarasaśāstra) said that there are forty [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|Mental factors]] (caitasika)....and only in the Saddharma-smrtyupasthana Sutra, there are the same forty Mental factors corresponding with Abhidharmāmṛtarasaśāstra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom (Sanskrit: Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra), the [[Madhyamaka]] scholar [[Nagarjuna]] mentioned the non-vagina sex restriction as based on coerced action toward one's own spouse.&lt;ref name="coerced"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huifeng|title=Re: Gay Marriage: What Would Buddha Do?|url=http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?t=380&amp;start=20#p15496|website=Dharma Wheel|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra"&gt;《Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom》（Sanskrit: Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra; 中文: 大智度論）卷13：非道之處，則非女根，女心不樂，強以非理，故名邪婬。（The wrong orifice is not through the female organ, the lady does not like this, and so forcing it [upon her] is inappropriate, therefore it is said to be "sexual misconduct）&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, later texts, particularly [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] writings, occasionally value paṇḍaka positively for their "middleness" and balance. The paṇḍaka in these Tibetan works is translated with the term ''ma ning'' — "genderless" or "without genitals".&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Nitin (2005). Exotic India Art.

==Tibetan Buddhism==
[[Gampopa]] (12th century), one of the main early masters of the [[Kagyu]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, followed the Indian Buddhist tradition, starting with the 3rd-century Hinayana texts of [[Vasubandhu]], that [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]], whether with a man or a woman, are violations of the third precept regarding inappropriate sexual behavior. [[Longchenpa]], the 13th-century founder of the [[Nyingma]] school, citing the 3rd-century Mahayana texts of the Indian master [[Asanga]], elaborated that inappropriate sexual behavior also include the hands among inappropriate parts of the body for sexual activity. In the same way, Gelug predecessor [[Je Tsongkhapa]] also adheres to such rules in his studies.&lt;ref name="Newland p.220"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Chariot: A Treatise on the Great Perfection'' by [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1363), chapter 5. Text online: [http://www.buddhistinformation.com/tibetan/greatchariot5-1.htm 1], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/chariot.htm 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent Tibetan masters from all five schools of Tibetan Buddhism accept all these specifications as delineated in the earlier Indian Buddhist texts.

The late [[Thubten Yeshe|Lama Thubten Yeshe]], a [[Gelugpa]] Lama and founder of the [[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition]], indicated that he did not consider homosexuality to be sexual misconduct. He stated: "My own view, man stay with man, female stay with female, I don’t consider it good or bad. This is my opinion. It’s just no big deal, no big deal, that’s all." &lt;ref&gt;''Kopan Course no. 14 (1981): Lama Yeshe Lecture and Q&amp;A'' by [[Thubten Yeshe]], Text online: [http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=245&amp;chid=1653].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|The current Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso, follows the traditional Tibetan Buddhist assertion that inappropriate sexual behaviour includes lesbian and gay sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse with one's own monogamous partner, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation.&lt;ref name=REFDonLattin&gt;"Even with your wife, using one's mouth or the other hole is sexual misconduct. Using one's hand, that is sexual misconduct". (Dalai Lama, at a meeting with lesbian and gay Buddhists, June 11, 1997).

If you both agree, then I think I would say 'if two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay'."&lt;ref&gt;OUT Magazine February/March 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his 1996 book ''Beyond Dogma'', he states, "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact."&lt;ref name=REFDonLattin/&gt;&lt;ref name=REFDennisConkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=REFJackNichols/&gt;

In this discussion, it should be understood that the controversial topic is inappropriate sexual conduct for a Buddhist practitioner, as the Dalai Lama has repeatedly "voiced his support for the full recognition of human rights for all people, regardless of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name=REFDennisConkin/&gt; He explained in 1997:&lt;ref name=REFWTNN08-27-1997&gt;See full transcript of interview: [http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1997&amp;m=8&amp;p=27-2_5 ''On Homosexuality and Sex in General''], World Tibet Network News, Wednesday, August 27, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; "It's part of what we Buddhists call bad sexual conduct.

He cited the Indian Buddhist texts of [[Vasubandhu]], [[Asanga]], and [[Ashvaghosha]] as his sources concerning what constitutes inappropriate sexual behavior.

Four years earlier, he had been unsure if a mutually agreeable non-abusive same sex relationship would be acceptable within the general principles of Buddhism. However, he had difficulty imagining the mechanics of homosexual sex, saying that nature had arranged male and female organs "in such a manner that is very suitable... Same-sex organs cannot manage well."&lt;ref name=REFWTNN07-01-1993&gt;World Tibet Network News. Thursday, July 1, 1993.

He thinks that this is the type of issue that would need to be discussed by a council of Buddhist elders from all Buddhist traditions. Only such a council could amend issues concerning Vinaya and ethics. The Dalai Lama also recommends the issue of the equality of women, particularly in monastic rituals and ceremonies, to be reconsidered and revised.&lt;ref name="Issues in Buddhist sexual ethics"&gt;Study Buddhism [http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/path-to-enlightenment/karma-rebirth/buddhist-sexual-ethics-main-issues Buddhist Sexual Ethics: Main Issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Ernst Schäfer]] during his [[1938–39 German expedition to Tibet]] in his account of Tibetan homosexuality he describes the various positions taken by older lamas with younger boys and then goes on to explain how homosexuality played an  important role in the higher politics of Tibet. There are pages of careful observation of  Himalayan people engaged in a variety of intimate acts.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levenda, ''Unholy alliance: a history of Nazi involvement with the occult'', 2nd edition, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, 423 p., p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, in an interview with Alice Thompson, he stated: "They want me to condone homosexuality. But I am a Buddhist and, for a Buddhist, a relationship between two men is wrong. Some sexual conduct in marriage is also wrong," speaking regarding masturbation and oral sex. He also said that "If an individual has no faith, that is a different matter... If two men really love each other and are not religious, then that is OK by me." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guru to the world|url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1999&amp;m=5&amp;p=25_1|publisher=World Tibet Network News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', [[Tashi Wangdi]], representative to the Dalai Lama, further elaborated his perspective on these views.  If a person was to engage in homosexuality, "a person would not be considered as following ''all'' the precepts of Buddhist principles. People don’t follow all the principles. Very few people can claim they follow all the principles. For instance, telling a lie. In any religion, if you ask if telling a lie is a sin — say Christian — they will say yes. But you find very few people who don’t at some point tell a lie. Homosexuality is one act, but you can’t say [a person who is homosexual is] not a Buddhist. Or someone who tells a lie is not a Buddhist. Or someone who kills an insect is not a Buddhist, because there’s a strong injunction against that."&lt;ref name=REFTashiWangdi&gt;[[n:Dalai Lama's representative talks about China, Tibet, Shugden and the next Dalai Lama|Interview with Tashi Wangdi]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada Buddhism==
In Thailand, traditional accounts propose that "homosexuality arises as a [[Karma|karmic]] consequence of violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct. These karmic accounts describe homosexuality as a congenital condition which cannot be altered, at least in a homosexual person's current lifetime, and have been linked with calls for compassion and understanding from the non-homosexual populace."&lt;ref name="jackson95"&gt;Jackson, Peter (1995). ''Thai Buddhist accounts of male homosexuality and AIDS in the 1980s''. The Australian Journal of Anthropology, Vol.6 No.3, Pp.140–153. December 1995. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/anth.htm Text online]&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent Thai Buddhist accounts (from the late 1980s) have "described homosexuality as a wilful violation of "natural" (hetero)sexual conduct resulting from lack of ethical control over sexual impulses."&lt;ref name="jackson95"/&gt; [[Peter Jackson (academic)|Peter Jackson]], an Australian scholar of sexual politics and Buddhism in Thailand, writes that these positions represent "two broad schools of thought on homosexuality [which] are current among contemporary Thai Buddhist writers, one accepting, the other unaccepting. The key factor differentiating the divergent stances is the author's conceptualisation of the origin of homosexuality; those who, taking a liberal stance, maintain that it is a condition which is outside the conscious control of homosexual men and women and has its origins in past misdeeds, whereas those who maintain that homosexuality is a wilful violation of ethical and natural principles takes an antagonistic position."

Peter Jackson argues that AIDS in the 1980s brought about a shift of perception in Thailand regarding [[kathoey]]s, "placing homosexuality rather than gender at the focus of the concept", which was associated with "a shift in Buddhist attitudes from relative tolerance of homosexuality to condemnation."&lt;ref name="jackson95"/&gt;

In 1989, the supreme governing body of the Thai sangha affirmed that "gays" (here translated from Thai ''kathoey'') are prohibited from being ordained.&lt;ref&gt;Khamhuno. 1989 (B.E. 2532).

==Japanese Buddhism==
{{see also|Homosexuality in Japan#Monastic same-sex love}}
Several writers have noted the strong historical tradition of open bisexuality and homosexuality among male Buddhist institutions in Japan. When the [[Tendai]] priest [[Genshin]] harshly criticised homosexuality as immoral, others mistook his criticism as having been because the acolyte wasn't one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, Gary (1995). ''Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan''. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faure, Bernard (1998). ''The Red Thread: Buddhist approaches to sexuality'' p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chigo Monogatari'', "acolyte stories" of love between monks and their ''chigo'' were popular, and such relationships appear to have been commonplace, alongside sex with women. In the 15th century, maverick [[Zen]] monk [[Ikkyu Sojun]] (1394–1481) wrote, "follow the rule of celibacy and you are no more than an ass." Later, "exhausted with homosexual pleasures", he took a wife.

Western Christian travellers to Japan from the 16th century have noted (with distaste) the prevalence and acceptance of forms of homosexuality among Japanese Buddhists&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, C.R. ''The Christian Century in Japan 1549–1650''. University of Californian Press, Berkeley, 1951. p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;—[[Jesuit]] priest Francis Cabral wrote in 1596 that "abominations of the flesh" and "vicious habits" were "regarded in Japan as quite honourable; men of standing entrust their sons to the [[Bhikkhu|bonzes]] to be instructed in such things, and at the same time to serve their lust".&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan, D. (1985). ''The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci'', Faber and Faber, London. p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

A 17th-century Japanese Buddhist scholar, [[Kitamura Kigin]], wrote that Buddha advocated homosexuality over heterosexuality for priests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been the nature of men's hearts to take pleasure in a beautiful woman since the age of male and female gods, but to become intoxicated by the blossom of a handsome youth... would seem to be both wrong and unusual.  Nevertheless, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] preached that &lt;nowiki&gt;[Mount]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Imose&lt;ref&gt;Mount Imose is traditionally associated with [[heterosexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a place to be avoided and the priests of the law entered this Way&lt;ref&gt;Wakashudo, "the Way of Youth", i.e. homosexuality&lt;/ref&gt; as an outlet for their feelings, since their hearts were, after all, made of neither stone nor wood.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gordon Schalow, trans. 1996, Kitamura Kigin, "Wild Azaleas" (Iwatsutsuji) in ''Partings at Dawn, an Anthology of Japanese Gay Literature'', San Francisco, Gay Sunshine Press p. 103. {{ISBN|0-940567-18-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like water that plunges from the peak of Tsukubane to form the deep pools of the Minano River, this love has surpassed in depth the love between women and men in these latter days.  It plagues the heart not only of courtier and aristocrat but also of brave warriors.  Even the mountain dwellers who cut brush for fuel have learned to take pleasure in the shade of young saplings." — [[Wild Azaleas]] (1676)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A later Popular Japanese legend attributed the introduction of monastic homosexuality to Japan to Shingon founder [[Kukai]], although scholars now dismiss the veracity of this assertion, pointing out his strict adherence to the Vinaya.&lt;ref name="Schalow, Paul Gordon p. 215"&gt;Schalow, Paul Gordon. "Kukai and the Tradition of Male Love in Japanese Buddhism," in Cabezon, Jose Ignacio, Ed., ''Buddhism, Sexuality &amp; Gender,'' State University of New York. p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the legend served to "affirm same sex relation between men and boys in 17th century Japan."&lt;ref name="Schalow, Paul Gordon p. 215"/&gt;

==Chinese Buddhism==

About Buddhism and [[homosexuality in China]], scholar A. L. De Silva writes, "Generally the attitude has been one of tolerance. [[Matteo Ricci]], the [[Jesuit]] missionary who lived in China for 27 years from 1583, expressed horror at the open and tolerant attitude that the Chinese took to homosexuality and naturally enough saw this as proof of the degeneracy of Chinese society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/homosexu.htm|title=Homosexuality and Theravada Buddhism|accessdate=2010-04-18|publisher=BuddhaNet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline}}

Venerable [[Hsing Yun]], one of the premier figures in contemporary [[Chinese Buddhism]], has stated that Buddhism should never teach intolerance toward homosexuality, and that people should expand their minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaybookreviews.info/review/2532/807|title=International Gay &amp; Lesbian Review: Buddhism Pure and Simple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Marriage is an institution that reflects the values of the society that supports it. If the people of a society no longer believe that it is important to be married, then there is no reason why they cannot change the institution of marriage. Marriage is a custom. Customs can always be changed. We can find the same core point in this question as we have in others — the ultimate truth of the matter is that individuals can and should decide for themselves what is right. As long as they are not violating others or breaking the laws of the society in which they are living, then they are free to do what they believe is right. It is not for me or anyone else to tell them that they must get married if they want to live together. That is their choice and their choice alone.

The same analysis can be applied to homosexuality. People often ask me what I think about homosexuality. They wonder, is it right, is it wrong? The answer is, it is neither right nor wrong. It is just something that people do. If people are not harming each other, their private lives are their own business; we should be tolerant of them and not reject them.

However, it will still take some time for the world to fully accept homosexuality. All of us must learn to tolerate the behavior of others. Just as we hope to expand our minds to include all of the universe, so we should also seek to expand our minds to include all of the many forms of human behavior.

Tolerance is a form of generosity and it is a form of wisdom. There is nothing anywhere in the Dharma that should ever lead anyone to become intolerant. Our goal as Buddhists is to learn to accept all kinds of people and to help all kinds of people discover the wisdom of the teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha.|Hsing Yun, ''Buddhism Pure and Simple'', pp. 137–138}}

Hsing Yun is a best-selling author throughout the [[Sinophone|Sinosphere]], as well as an advocate of [[Humanistic Buddhism]], an approach to reform Chinese Buddhism to match the needs of contemporary laypeople. As such, his views may not be wholly reflective of the older Buddhist views in China. However, at an earlier point (1998), he is quoted as remarking that "according to Buddhism, any emotional involvement, whether homosexual or heterosexual, is a form of attachment ... and, therefore, is a source of suffering," and when the topic of homosexuality in particular came up "the master spoke more strongly, calling homosexuality a perverted view (''xiejian'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Stuart|title=Establishing a Pure Land On Earth|date=2004|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an older view in opposition to homosexuality is given by the traditional master, [[Hsuan Hua]], an important figure for Buddhism in both China and the [[United States]]. Master Hsuan Hua stated that homosexuality "plants the seeds that lead to rebirth in the lower realms of existence".&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles: ''The Faces of Buddhism in America'', page 255. University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary on the [[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]], he described homosexuality as behavior caused by confusion, as the product of sexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;Hua, Hsuan: ''The Sutra in Forty-Two Sections Spoken by Buddha'', page 221. Buddhist Text Translation Society, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism in the West==
[[Image:Soeng Hyang.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soeng Hyang]], current head master of the [[Kwan Um School of Zen]]]]
In contrast to Buddhism in Asia, modern [[Buddhism in the West|Buddhism in the Western world]] is typically associated with a concern for [[social equality]]—partly as a result of its largely [[middle-class]] intellectual membership base, and its philosophical roots in [[freethought]] and [[secular humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James William (2002). ''The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-515241-7}}. See chapter 2, "Sex, Power, and Conflict." [http://www.thezensite.com/ZenBookReviews/The_New_Buddhism.html Review online].&lt;/ref&gt; When applying Buddhist philosophy to the question of homosexuality, western Buddhists often emphasize the importance the Buddha placed on tolerance, compassion, and seeking answers within one's self.  They stress these overarching values rather than examining specific passages or texts. As a result, western Buddhism is often relatively gay-friendly, especially since the 1990s.  As interpretation of what is [[sexual misconduct]] is an individual decision and not subject to judgment by any central authority, a view of accepting all peoples, but rejecting certain types of sexual acts is more predominant.  LGBT people such as [[Issan Dorsey]], [[Caitriona Reed]], [[Pat Enkyo O'Hara]] and [[Soeng Hyang]] have been ordained as Buddhist monastics and clergy.

However, this interpretation of sexual misconduct is only applicable to lay Buddhists or Japanese Buddhism's secular married priests.  It is a mistake to assume that it would be applied to monastics at all.  In traditional forms of Japanese Buddhism nuns are not allowed sex partners. Neither Theravada or Mahayana traditions of Vinaya traditional Buddhism allow same gender monastics same sex partners.  They must be celibate no matter what their sexual orientation or they cannot be considered monks or nuns in monastic Buddhism. Sexuality is not a factor in determination of a qualification of a candidate in full ordination in those traditions that follow traditional Vinaya Buddhism as set forth by the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Monastic Code 1 and Monastic Code 2 by Thannissaro Bhikkhu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;buddhafolk.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;—Ven Hong Yang, Bhikshuni 21:16, 9 September 2012 (UTC)

An interesting position comes from the western scholar [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]], {{quote|The texts in Buddhist traditions have been written from the point of view of a heterosexual male. We need to explore the intention of the teachings on sexual misconduct, which ultimately is to eliminate attachment, obsessive desire and dissatisfaction. If a heterosexual male finds no bounds to these disturbing emotions, he might have sex with someone else's partner, as well as other men. We can apply the same logic and explore what constitutes boundless attachment and dissatisfaction for homosexual and bisexual males or females. For example, having sex with somebody else's partner and so on could be destructive for these types of person as well".&lt;ref name="Issues in Buddhist sexual ethics"/&gt;}}

Another Buddhist organization founded in the West, [[Juniper Foundation]], wrote an article ''A Buddhist Vote for Same Sex Marriage'' demonstrating how Buddhist thinking embraces same-sex marriage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The heart of Buddhist thought is its insight philosophy, which uses critical inquiry to challenge dogma and to reveal how seemingly fixed ideas are more arbitrary than we might think. Applying this philosophy, we see that social customs are not fixed laws but evolving conventions that serve a purpose in a particular culture and time. Marriage is one of these conventions. It is not a rigid law but a social custom that evolves.&lt;ref&gt;Juniper Foundation [http://www.juniperpath.org/articles/D3EE18/A%20Buddhist%20Vote%20for%20Same-Sex%20Marriage "A Buddhist Vote for Same Sex Marriage"] 10-06-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 2012, the [[Australia]]n branch of Buddhism voiced its support for same-sex marriage in a hearing of the Australian Parliament that sought to gather views on whether to legalize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/2012/04/19/buddhists-come-out-for-equality/75906 |title=Buddhists come out for equality |publisher=Starobserver.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Catholic Church in [[Liechtenstein]]''' is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

Around three quarters of the population is Catholic.  Prior to 1997, the [[principality]] was part of the Swiss [[Diocese of Chur]].  In 1997, the [[Archdiocese of Vaduz]] was created, covering the whole of the principality.  The first and to date only archbishop is [[Wolfgang Haas]].

'''''Credo quia absurdum''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "I believe because it is [[absurdism|absurd]]", originally misattributed to [[Tertullian]] in his ''[[De Carne Christi]]''. The original phrase was "It is certain because it is unfitting" in an [[Marcion|anti-Marcionite]] context, however, through [[Early Modern Era|early modern]], [[Protestant]] and [[Enlightenment]] rhetoric against Catholicism and religion more broadly, was changed to "I believe because it is absurd" for a personally religious context.

== History of the Phrase ==

===Origins===

The original phrase, before being transmuted through [[Enlightenment]] rhetoric to its modern form "I believe because it is absurd", appeared in [[Tertullian]]'s work ''[[De Carne Christi]]'' (''ca.'' 203-206), read by scholars as "I believe because it is unfitting". The context is a defense of the tenets of orthodox Christianity against [[docetism]]:

{{quote|et mortuus est dei filius: [prorsus] credibile est, quia ineptum est. 
et sepultus resurrexit: certum est, quia impossibile.

and the Son of God died, it is [utterly] credible, because it is unfitting;

and he was buried and rose again; it is certain, because it is impossible.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;Harrison, Peter. "“I Believe Because it is Absurd”: The Enlightenment Invention of Tertullian's Credo." Church History 86.2 (2017): 339-364&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

The consensus of Tertullian scholars is that the reading "I believe because it is absurd" sharply diverges from Tertullian's own thoughts, given his placed priority on reasoned argument and rationality in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Vianney Décarie, “Le Paradoxe de Tertullien,” Vigiliae Christianae 15, no. 1 (1961): 23–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Timothy David. ''Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study.'' Oxford University
Press, 1985, esp. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Sider, “Credo quia absurdum?,” Classical World 73, no. 7 (1980): 417–419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justo L. González, “Athens and Jerusalem Revisited: Reason and Authority in Tertullian,” Church History, 43, no. 1 (1974): 17–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Guerra, “Polemical Christianity: Tertullian’s Search for Certitude,” The Second Century 8, no. 2 (1991): 109–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osborn&gt;Osborn, Eric. ''Tertullian: First Theologian of the West.'' Cambridge University Press, 1997, esp. 28, 48–64&lt;/ref&gt; In the same work, Tertullian later writes "But here again, I must have some reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De carne Christi 10, in Evans, Tertullian’s Treatise on the Incarnation, 38: “Et hic itaque causas requiro.”&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, he writes that the new Christian “should believe nothing but that nothing should be rashly believed.”&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Adversus Marcionem 5.1, in Tertullian: Adversus Marcionem, ed. and trans. Ernest Evans (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972), 509: “Qui nihil interim credam, nisi nihil temere credendum.”&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars note further examples of where Tertullian acts by following a method of reasoned argument.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Eric. Tertullian, first theologian of the West. Cambridge University Press, 2003, 34&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the phrase may relate to 1 Corinthians 1:17-31, where something foolish to a human may be a member of God's wisdom,&lt;ref&gt;Götz, Ignacio L. Faith, humor, and paradox. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, 25-27&lt;/ref&gt; or Tertullian may be repeating an idea rehearsed in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]], where Aristotle argues that something is more credibly true if it is an incredible claim, on the reason that it would have not been made up if it were truly so incredible to the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Rhetoric 2.23, 1400a6–8, in Complete Works of Aristotle, trans. W. Rhys Roberts, ed. Jonathan Barnes (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2), 2:2231; James Moffatt, “Aristotle and Tertullian,” Journal of Theological Studies 17, no. 66 (1916): 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Osborn]] concludes that “the classic formula ''credo quia absurdum'' (even when corrected to ''quia ineptum'') does not represent the thought of Tertullian."&lt;ref name=osborn /&gt; (But note: the definition of Latin ''ineptus'' also includes silly, senseless, absurd, and inept.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ineptus See Wictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transmission into the Early Modern Era and Modern Use ===

No notice was given to this maxim throughout the classical and medieval periods,&lt;ref&gt;Pearse, Roger. Witnesses to the Influence of Tertullian. (or, Who had read what?) [http://www.tertullian.org/witnesses/witnesses.htm Link]&lt;/ref&gt; however, the maxim first began to receive attention and then undergo change during the early modern era. In 1521, the humanist scholar [[Beatus Rhenanus]] produced an edition of Tertullian's ''De carne Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;Beatus Rhenanus, ed., Tertullianus Quintus Septiuius Florens Opera (Basel, 1521)&lt;/ref&gt; The only French translation of this work to appear in the 17th century was [[Louis Giry]]'s 1661 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Giry, trans., De la Chair de Jésus-Christ, et de la Résurrection de la chair, ouvrages de Tertullien (Paris, 1661).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], the first time that the maxim was quoted was in [[Thomas Browne]]'s highly influential religious classic [[Religio Medici]] (The Religion of a Doctor), ensuring that the maxim received a wide audience at this time, and Browne also shifted the context of the phrase from Tertullian's discourse against [[Marcion]] to personal faith, and shifted the phrase from its original "''It is certain'', because it is impossible" to "''I believe'', because it is impossible."&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; Many of Browne's contemporaries criticized him and Tertullian for this maxim, including [[Henry More]], [[Edward Stillingfleet]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[John Locke]]. As [[Protestant]] anti-Catholic polemic and rhetoric grew, many writers began associating certain Catholic doctrines (and later broadly to Christianity itself by some other writers), especially [[Transubstantiation]], with this maxim. The maxim was then brought to a French audience through [[Pierre Bayle]]'s highly influential 1697 [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]], which catalogued controversies of philosophical and religious nature as well as historical events and persons related to them.&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; Then, [[Voltaire]], in his anonymously published [[Le Dîner du comte de Boulainvillier]] (1767), took the maxim to the next step and shifted the phrase from "I believe ''because it is impossible''" to "I believe ''because it is absurd''", and Voltaire also attributed it to [[Augustine]] instead of Tertullian, a much more central figure in Christian history.&lt;ref&gt;[Voltaire], Le Dîner du comte de Boulainvilliers par Mr. St. Hyacinte (Amsterdam, 1767), 18: “C’est pourtant ce ridicule que St. Augustin a trouvé divin; il disoit, je le crois parce que cela est absurd, je le crois parce que cela est impossible.” (It is, however, this very ridicule that Augustine thought divine. He said: I believe because it is absurd, I believe because it is impossible).&lt;/ref&gt; The maxim would continue to be attributed to Augustine until [[Gaston de Flotte]] noted the original Latin and misattribution by Voltaire, however, the rhetorical appeal of the maxim was great enough that it continued to be widely used, even into the present day,&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt; including being used by figures like [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Max Weber]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Jerry Coyne]] and even [[Simon Blackburn]]'s ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Peter. [https://bigthink.com/aeon-ideas/i-believe-because-it-is-absurd-christianitys-first-meme 'I believe because it is absurd': Christianity's first meme.] 12 April, 2018, Accessed on November 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon. ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Oxford University Press, 1996, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later Commentary ===

The phrase does not express the [[Catholic Faith]], as explained by [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: "The Catholic Tradition, from the outset, rejected the so-called “fideism”, which is the desire to believe against reason. ''Credo quia absurdum'' (I believe because it is absurd) is not a formula that interprets the Catholic faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20121121_en.html General Audience of Pope Benedict XVI, November 21, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is thus sometimes associated with the doctrine of [[fideism]], that is, "a system of philosophy or an attitude of mind, which, denying the power of unaided human reason to reach certitude, affirms that the fundamental act of human knowledge consists in an act of faith, and the supreme criterion of certitude is authority."(''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06068b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used, though often in different interpretations, by some [[existentialism|existentialists]].

The phrase inspired a celebrated ''[[bon mot]]'' by [[H.L. Mencken]]: "Tertullian is credited with the motto ''Credo quia absurdum''—'I believe because it is impossible'. Needless to say, he began life as a lawyer." It has also been adopted as the motto for The Ancient and Honorable Order of [[E Clampus Vitus]] in modern times, and was used as an example of zen in [[D. T. Suzuki]]'s book, Introduction to Zen Buddhism (which was based on essays he wrote in 1914):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A noted Christian Father of the early Middle Ages once exclaimed: "O poor Aristotle! Thou who has discovered for the heretics the art of dialectics, the art of building up and destroying, the art of discussing all things and accomplishing nothing!" So much ado about nothing, indeed! See how philosophers of all ages contradict one another after spending all their logical acumen and analytical ingenuity on the so-called problems of science and knowledge. No wonder the same old wise man, wanting to put a stop once for all to all such profitless discussions, has boldly thrown the following bomb right into the midst of those sand-builders: "Certum est quia impossible est"; or, more logically, ''Credo quia absurdum est''. I believe because it is irrational; is this not an unqualified confirmation of Zen?"&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T. ''Essays in Zen Buddhism.'' 1958. [https://ia801600.us.archive.org/23/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.104054/2015.104054.Essays-In-Zen-Buddhism-first-Series.pdf Link to book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Adverse effects==
A mild overdose of dronabinol presents drowsiness, dry mouth, [[euphoria]], and [[tachycardia]]; whereas a severe overdose presents [[lethargy]], slurred speech, decreased motor coordination, and [[postural hypotension]].&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Health Packaging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dronabinol capsule (American Health Packaging) |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=68b4168b-5782-4e68-a25a-5b4e4408dbce |publisher=US National Library of Medicine |access-date=12 January 2014|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 13, 1986, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) issued a Final Rule and Statement of Policy authorizing the "rescheduling of synthetic dronabinol in [[sesame oil]] and encapsulated in soft [[gelatin]] capsules from Schedule I to Schedule II" (DEA 51 FR 17476-78). This permitted medical use of Marinol, albeit with the severe restrictions associated with Schedule II status.&lt;ref&gt;51 Fed. Reg. 17476 (1986), Tuesday, May 13, 1986, pages 17476-17478&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, refills of Marinol prescriptions were not permitted. At its 10th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]], in accordance with article 2, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], decided that Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to as Δ⁹-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention. This released Marinol from the restrictions imposed by Article 7 of the Convention (See also [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

An article published in the April–June 1998 issue of the [[Journal of Psychoactive Drugs]] found that "Healthcare professionals have detected no indication of scrip-chasing or doctor-shopping among the patients for whom they have prescribed dronabinol". The authors state that Marinol has a low potential for abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid9692381"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calhoun SR, Galloway GP, Smith DE | title = Abuse potential of dronabinol (Marinol) | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–96 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9692381 | doi = 10.1080/02791072.1998.10399689 }}{{Better source|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Marinol was rescheduled from Schedule II to III of the [[Controlled Substances Act]], reflecting a finding that THC had a potential for abuse less than that of [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]]. This rescheduling constituted part of the argument for a 2002 petition for [[removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act]], in which petitioner [[Jon Gettman]] noted, "Cannabis is a natural source of dronabinol (THC), the ingredient of Marinol, a Schedule III drug. There are no grounds to schedule cannabis in a more restrictive schedule than Marinol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugscience.org/PDF/Petition_Final_2002.pdf |title=Petition to Reschedule Cannabis (Marijuana) |date=9 October 2002 |publisher=[[Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis]]}}{{Better source|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its 33rd meeting, in 2003, the [[World Health Organization]] Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring THC to [[Amphetamine-type stimulants|Schedule IV]] of the Convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/right_committee/en/index.html |title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aizpurua-Olaizola O, Soydaner U, Öztürk E, Schibano D, Simsir Y, Navarro P, Etxebarria N, Usobiaga A | title = Evolution of the Cannabinoid and Terpene Content during the Growth of Cannabis sativa Plants from Different Chemotypes | journal = Journal of Natural Products | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 324–31 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26836472 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b00949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), thought to be the major [[anticonvulsant]] that helps people with [[multiple sclerosis]];&lt;ref name="pmid6269680"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pickens JT | title = Sedative activity of cannabis in relation to its delta'-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol content | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 649–56 | date = April 1981 | pmid = 6269680 | pmc = 2071638 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1981.tb09145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cannabichromene]] (CBC), an [[anti-inflammatory]] which may contribute to the [[Analgesic|pain-killing]] effect of cannabis.&lt;ref name=Burns2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns TL, Ineck JR | title = Cannabinoid analgesia as a potential new therapeutic option in the treatment of chronic pain | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 251–60 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16449552 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1G217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes over one hour for Marinol to reach full systemic effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{DailyMed|41006|MARINOL (dronabinol) capsule}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to seconds or minutes for [[Cannabis smoking|smoked]] or [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporized]] cannabis.&lt;ref name="mckim"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim |first=William A |title=Drugs and Behavior: An Introduction to Behavioral Pharmacology |edition=5th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |page=400 |isbn=0-13-048118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Kleiman]], director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine."&lt;ref name="Respectable Reefer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/11/respectable-reefer|title=Respectable Reefer|last=Greenberg|first=Gary|date=1 November 2005|access-date=8 April 2010|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Many people using Marinol have said that Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, and it has been speculated that this disparity can be explained by the moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the cannabis plant such as [[nabiximols]] are being developed.

'''Drstivāda''' is a legendary lost text in the [[Jain]] religion.  It is the last of the 12 [[Jain agamas|Jain āgamas]] as per [[Svetambara|Śvetámbara]] tradition, said to be promulgated by [[Mahavira|Māhavīra]] himself and composed by [[Ganadhara]] [[Sudharmaswami]]. Drstivāda, translated as “Disputation about views”, was said to contain the entire knowledge of the Fourteen [[Purvas]] or prior knowledge that is now considered to be totally lost, in part because the tradition holds that the Drstivāda itself is also completely lost. However, its contents have been referred and explained in Nandi and ''Samavāyānga Sūtra''. 

==Subject Matter of the Agama==
Dristivāda was divided into five parts :-
#Parikarma 
#Sūtra 
#Pūrvanayoga 
#Purvgata 
#Chūlikā

Parikarma contained Jaina calculatory science and the Sutra included discussions about creeds and doctrines. Purvagata contained fourteen subdivisions and contained discussions about [[Jain philosophy|Jaina doctrines and principles]]. As the name suggests, [[Purvas]] contain the knowledge prior to [[Mahavira]] which was preserved only in oral form. Pūrvanayoga contained Puranic narratives, religious biographies as well as illustrative tales.

'''Earl J. Doherty''' (born 1941)&lt;ref&gt;[http://errol.oclc.org/laf/nb2002-34656.html Library of Congress authority file], accessed April 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian author of ''The Jesus Puzzle'' (1999), ''Challenging the Verdict'' (2001), and ''Jesus: Neither God Nor Man'' (2009). Doherty argues for a version of the [[Christ myth theory]], the thesis that Jesus did not exist as a historical figure. Doherty says that Paul thought of Jesus as a spiritual being executed in a spiritual realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bart |last=Ehrman |title=Did Jesus Exist? |year=2012 |pages=252–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Doherty has stated he has a [[bachelor's degree]] in Ancient History and Classical Languages,&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus, Neither God nor Man'', 2009, Preface p. ix: "I will end here on a personal note that was lacking in the original book [1999, reprint 2005]. My formal education consisted of a B.A. with Distinction in Ancient History and Classical Languages, (Greek and Latin, the former being essential in any research into the New Testament). Unfortunately, I was forced to suspend my M.A. program due to health reasons and did not return."&lt;/ref&gt; but no completed advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus, Neither God nor Man'', 2009, Preface p. ix: "Unfortunately, I was forced to suspend my M.A. program due to health reasons and did not return."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D |authorlink=Bart Ehrman |title=Did Jesus Exist?

==Writings==
Doherty was introduced to the idea of a mythical origin of Jesus by, among other things, the work of [[George Albert Wells|G. A. Wells]], who has authored a number of books arguing a moderate form of the "Christ myth" theory.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 1999, Doherty's book ''The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ?'' was published by [[Canadian Humanist Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? |last=Doherty |first=Earl |location=Ottawa |publisher=Age of Reason Publications |year=2005 |origyear=1999 |isbn=0-9689259-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He self-published a 2005 re-release of ''The Jesus Puzzle'' under his own imprint, Age of Reason Publications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ageofreason.org/CTVExcerptsIntro.htm Age of Reason Publications website]&lt;/ref&gt; along with two other books. ''Challenging the Verdict'' (2001) is a critique of ''The Case for Christ'', a book of [[Christian apologetics]] by author [[Lee Strobel]]. ''Jesus: Neither God Nor Man - The Case for a Mythical Jesus'' (2009) is a revised and expanded version of ''The Jesus Puzzle''.  In 2012, Doherty published ''The End of an Illusion: How [[Bart Ehrman]]'s'' "Did Jesus Exist?" ''Has Laid the Case for an Historical Jesus to Rest.''

Doherty asserts that Christianity began with a belief in a spiritual, mythical figure, that the Gospels are essentially allegory and fiction, and that no single identifiable person named Jesus lay at the root of the Galilean preaching tradition." Doherty argues in ''The Jesus Puzzle'' (2005) and ''Jesus: Neither God nor Man—The Case for a Mythical Jesus'' (2009) that Jesus originated as a myth derived from [[Middle Platonism]] with some influence from [[Merkabah#Ma'asei Merkavah|Jewish mysticism]], and that belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century.

According to Doherty, none of the major Christian apologists before 180 AD, except for [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] and [[Aristides of Athens]], included an account of a historical Jesus in their defenses of Christianity. Instead Doherty suggests that the early Christian writers describe a Christian movement grounded in Platonic philosophy and Hellenistic Judaism, reaching the worship of a monotheistic Jewish god and what he calls a "logos-type Son". Doherty further argues that [[Theophilus of Antioch]] (c. 163–182), [[Athenagoras of Athens]] (c. 133–190), [[Tatian]] the Assyrian (c. 120–180), and [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] (writing around 150–270) offer no indication that they believed in a historical figure crucified and resurrected, and that the name Jesus does not appear in any of them.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Earl. "The Jesus Puzzle", ''Journal of Higher Criticism'', volume 4, issue 2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Jesus Puzzle''===
Doherty has used the title "The Jesus Puzzle" for four different works. 

* In Fall 1997, the ''[[Journal of Higher Criticism]]'' published his article, "The Jesus Puzzle: Pieces in a Puzzle of Christian Origins."&lt;ref name="JP-PPCO"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Jesus Puzzle: Pieces in a Puzzle of Christian Origins |last=Doherty |first=Earl |journal=[[Journal of Higher Criticism]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1997 |url=http://jesuspuzzle.org/jhcjp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Around the same time he created a website under the same title, in which he developed the material which he was later to publish in book form.  His method was to publish a fairly crude first draft, and then omit material that proved untenable, while retaining the general direction of argument.  The site continued to be used for additional commentary and responses to reviews and criticisms of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jesuspuzzle.org |title=The Jesus Puzzle: Was There No Historical Jesus? |last=Doherty |first=Earl |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* His non-fiction book ''The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ?'' was published two years later.
* He also used the title for a novel which he provided for download on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Jesus Puzzle: A Novel About the Greatest Question of Our Time |last=Doherty |first=Earl |year=1999 |url=http://jesuspuzzle.org/novel.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all four of these works, Doherty presents views on the origins of [[Christianity]], specifically promoting the view that [[Jesus]] is a [[Christ myth theory|mythical]] figure rather than a historical person. Doherty argues that [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and other writers of the earliest existing proto-Christian [[Gnostic]] documents did not believe in Jesus as a person who incarnated on [[Earth]] in a historical setting. Rather, they believed in Jesus as a heavenly being who suffered his sacrificial death in the lower spheres of heaven in the hands of the demon spirits, and was subsequently resurrected by [[God]]. This Christ myth was not based on a tradition reaching back to a historical Jesus, but on the [[Old Testament]] [[exegesis]] in the context of [[Jewish]]-[[Hellenistic]] religious [[syncretism]] heavily influenced by [[Middle Platonism]], and what the authors believed to be mystical visions of a risen Jesus.

Doherty says that the Jesus myth was given a historical setting only by the second generation of Christians, somewhere between the 1st and 2nd century. He further says that even the author of the [[Gospel of Mark]] probably did not consider his gospel to be a literal work of history, but an allegorical [[midrash]]ic composition based on the [[Old Testament]] [[Bible prophecy|prophecies]]. In the widely supported [[two-source hypothesis]], the story of Mark was later fused with a separate tradition of anonymous sayings embodied in the [[Q document]] into the other gospels. According to Doherty, the Q-authors may have regarded themselves as "spokespersons for the Wisdom of God," with Jesus being the [[Wisdom (personification)|embodiment of this Wisdom]].&lt;ref name="JP-PPCO"/&gt; In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus. Doherty denies any historical value of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], and refers to works by John Knox, Joseph B. Tyson, J.C. O'Neill, [[Burton L. Mack]] and [[Richard Pervo]] in dating Acts into the 2nd century and regarding it as largely based on legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doherty |first=Earl |url=http://jesuspuzzle.org/newadvert.htm |title=Jesus: Neither God nor Man |page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Doherty self-published a revised edition of his book, with a new title of ''Jesus: Neither God nor Man'', expanded by incorporating the rebuttals to criticisms received since 1999 and accumulated on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doherty |first=Earl |url=http://jesuspuzzle.org/newadvert.htm |title=Jesus: Neither God nor Man}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Among authors sympathetic to the view that Jesus never existed, Doherty's work has received mixed reactions. ''The Jesus Puzzle'' has received favorable reviews from fellow mythicists [[Robert M. Price]] and [[Richard Carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/jesuspuzzle.shtml |title=Did Jesus Exist?

George Albert Wells, who now argues a more moderate form of the Christ myth and who rejects Doherty's view that the mythical Jesus of Paul did not also descend to Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. A. |last=Wells |authorlink=George Albert Wells |date=September 1999 |title=Earliest Christianity |journal=New Humanist |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=13&amp;ndash;18 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/g_a_wells/earliest.html |accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; has nonetheless described ''The Jesus Puzzle'' as an "important book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G. A. |last=Wells |year=2004 |title=Can We Trust the New Testament? |page=202 |publisher=Open Court |location=Peru, Illinois |isbn=0-8126-9567-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[R. Joseph Hoffmann]] considers that there are "reasons for scholars to hold" the view that Jesus never existed, but considers Doherty "A 'disciple' of Wells" who "has rehashed many of the former’s views in ''The Jesus Puzzle'' (Age of Reason Publications, 2005) which is qualitatively and academically far inferior to anything so far written on the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. Joseph |last=Hoffmann |authorlink=R.

Joseph Hoffmann |publisher=Prometheus |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=1-59102-370-X |pages=15, 39 n. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doherty has responded that his work owes very little to Wells.&lt;ref&gt;http://jesuspuzzle.org/JesusProject.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers who do not necessarily support the hypothesis that Jesus did not exist have found merit in some of Doherty's arguments. [[Hector Avalos]] has written that "''The Jesus Puzzle'' outlines a plausible theory for a completely mythical Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hector |last=Avalos |authorlink=Hector Avalos |year=2007 |title=The End of Biblical Studies |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-59102-536-8 |pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Ehrman]], an expert on [[textual criticism]] of the NT and [[Early Christianity]], has dismissed ''Jesus, Neither God nor Man'' as "filled with so many unguarded and undocumented statements and claims, and so many misstatements of fact, that it would take a 2,400-page book to deal with all the problems... Not a single early Christian source supports Doherty's claim that Paul and those before him thought of Jesus as a spiritual, not a human being, who was executed in the spiritual, not the earthly realm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bart |last=Ehrman |title=Did Jesus Exist? |year=2012 |pages=252–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book criticizing the Christ myth theory, New Testament scholar [[Maurice Casey]] describes Doherty as "perhaps the most influential of all the mythicists",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Casey |authorlink=Maurice Casey |title=Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=London |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-56759-224-8 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one who is unable to understand the ancient texts he uses in his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Casey |authorlink=Maurice Casey |title=Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=London |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-56759-224-8 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scientology]], the '''tone scale''' or '''emotional tone scale''' is a characterization of human behavior. It is based on the idea that some people appear to be more lively and alive than other people and this increased liveliness is orderly. Scientology Founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] spelled the idea out saying, "just draw a horizontal line on the page.  Put the people who are less alive on the bottom and the people who are more alive on the top."

In his 1951 book ''[[Science of Survival]]'', Hubbard expanded the idea into many increments. The idea states that a "tone" has many manifestations including appearance, chronic emotion, the way the person handles other people, how well the person can pass on a communication given to them, and other characteristics.

== Details of the scale ==
{{See|Scientology terminology}}{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}
Hubbard devised the "Tone Scale" in 1951 as a tool for auditors in Scientology. Scientologists believe it intends to classify people in a range or scale according to how spiritually alive and how dead a person is, both personally and in their relationships with others. It prescribes [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] procedures to use with a person depending where they are on the scale.

Hubbard expanded on the idea and created 59 increments which he numbered from −40 (total failure) to +40 (serenity of beingness). Hubbard's full scale appears on the right. According to Scientologists, a person chronically focused on death and destruction is at the low end of the tone scale, while a person focused on creativity is at the high end of the scale.

A noteworthy mechanism of the scale involves a person as they approach and react to [[pain]]. As a person approaches pain, they allegedly become more antagonistic and less cheerful. It is purported by Hubbard that after receiving pain, they will be angry about it, and then, if the pain persists, can become more overwhelmed by it, progressing down through fear, grief, apathy, into failure, etc. Auditing allegedly reverses this path. Scientologists aim to be at the higher levels of the tone scale and believe that Scientology auditing will move them to a higher average level on the tone scale.

While a person can rationally be any place on the tone scale due to circumstances, Scientologists argue that one should not, under normal circumstances, be stuck any particular place on the scale. Also, in Scientology one can be at various places on the tone scale in different areas of life, such as being chronically "high on" oneself and chronically "down on" people or one's partner. Such discrepancy is allegedly an indication of a problem.

The ultimate goal of Scientology is claimed to be "a free being". By Scientology's definition, a free being can be, but does not have to be, any place on the scale. A free being does not have to avoid certain areas of the scale, although one could as a matter of choice or taste.

Allegedly, the lower a person is on the scale, the more complex and solid their problems are and the more effort it takes to make even a little positive and real long-term gain for that person. Thus, spotting a person low on the scale allows one to make a decision regarding how careful or involved one should become in dealing with that person.

According to author [[Lawrence Wright]], Scientology's theory on the highest levels of the tone scale is “characterized by [[monogamy]], [[Faithfulness|constancy]], a pleasurable attitude toward sex, and an intense interest in children.” Hubbard claims however, that sexual desire is sublimed into “pure creative thought,” superseding the desire to procreate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence Wright |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants==

In addition to the original Tone Scale and the later, expanded one, there is also an "Emotional Tone Scale" and a "Reality Spotting by E-Meter" scale that lists expected [[E-meter]] reactions when encountering each portion of the Tone Scale. These, and other related scales and charts, are found in Hubbard's book ''Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The term '''eulogia''' (ευλογία), Greek for "a blessing", has been applied in ecclesiastical usage to "a blessed object". It was occasionally used in early times to signify the [[Holy Eucharist]], and in this sense is especially frequent in the writings of [[St. Cyril of Alexandria]]. The origin of this use is doubtless to be found in the words of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] (1 Corinthians 10:16); ''to poterion tes eulogias ho eulogoumen''. But the more general use is for such objects as [[bread]], [[wine]] etc., which it was customary to distribute after the celebration of the [[Divine Mysteries]]. Bread so blessed, we learn from [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (De pecat. merit., ii, 26), was customarily distributed in his time to [[catechumens]], and he even gives it the name of [[Sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church|sacramentum]], as having received the formal blessing of the Church: "''Quod acceperunt catechumeni, quamvis non sit corpus Christi, sanctum tamen est, et sanctius quam cibi quibus alimur, quoniam sacramentum est''" (What the [[catechumens]] receive, though it is not the Body of Christ, is holy — holier, indeed, than our ordinary food, since it is a sacramentum). For the extension of this custom in later ages, see [[Antidoron]]; [[Sacramental bread]].

The word eulogia has a special use in connection with [[monastic]] life. In the [[Benedictine Rule]] monks are forbidden to receive "''litteras, eulogias, vel quaelibet munuscula''" without the [[abbot]]'s leave. Here the word may be used in the sense of blessed bread only, but it seems to have a wider signification, and to designate any kind of present. There was a custom in [[monasteries]] of distributing in the [[refectories]], after Mass, the eulogiae of bread blessed at the Mass.

'''Firekeeper''' or '''flametender''' describes a specific [[ceremonies|ceremonial]] role, common in the religious practices of a variety of cultures. A firekeeper or flametender tends the sacred fire in the manner specific to the [[religion|religious traditions]] of that culture.

==Overview==
In many ancient civilizations the open flame has served as both a central spiritual or religious symbol, as well as played a central role in basic human survival. Similarly, those entrusted with tending this flame often held a sacral role in the culture. This role continues in some traditional cultures into the present day. 

A sacred fire is often a place for the offering of prayers, herbs, food, and sacrifices of artwork. An eternal or perpetual flame provides hot coals for the kindling of other fires in the community. A sacred fire is usually kept separate from any cooking fire, and may be placed in or near a ceremonial enclosure.  

In the past world of no matches, and no easy ways of making fire under wet conditions, it was necessary for someone to always be present to keep the flames or red coals burning for long periods of time.

'''''From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan: Letters to the Homeland''''' ([[History of the Russian language|Pre-reform Russian]]: «Изъ пеще́ръ и де́брей Индоста́на: пи́сьма на ро́дину»; [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]] ''Iz peshcher i debrei Indostana: pis'ma na rodinu'') is a literary work by the founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky had been naming her work "my ''Russian Letters'' from [[India]]."{{sfn|Barker|1925|p=153}}}} She published it under the pen name Radda Bai in serial installments (letters) from 1879 to 1886 in Moscow in the periodicals ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti|Moskovskiya Vedomosti]]'' and ''[[The Russian Messenger|Russkiy Vestnik]],'' edited by [[Mikhail Katkov]].{{sfnm|Cranston|1993|1p=56|Сенкевич|2012|2p=336}} The first part of these letters was published in a single volume in 1883 as an appendix to the journal ''Russkiy Vestnik.''{{sfn|Britannica|1911}}{{refn|group=note|[[Mikhail Katkov|Editor's]] note: "These letters, belonging to the pen of our countrywoman, were printed at different times in the ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti|Moskovskiya Vedomosti]]'' over the signature of ''Radda-Bai'' and will be continued in the ''Russkiy Vestnik.''{{sfn|Радда-Бай|1883|p=3}}}} The second part of the letters was published in 1884–1886.{{sfn|Словарь|1892|p=313}} The series obviously was never finished as it broke off rather suddenly.{{refn|group=note|Continuation of the series was not found: see, the end of the last letter.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1975|p=660}}}}

== Literary expert's opinion ==
The Russian literary critic [[:ru:Венгерова, Зинаида Афанасьевна|Zinaida Vengerova]] noted that this Blavatsky's book has "somewhat a mystical coloring" due to numerous stories and the author's arguments about the secret wisdom of the Hindus, which does not detract from its literary significance. The close acquaintance of the writer with the Indian sights allows her to be very entertaining to talk about the "most diverse aspects of the life" in modern and ancient India. Simply, "but very artistically," she describes the covering India from immemorial times magnificent buildings, on which the past millenniums had no influence.{{sfn|Словарь|1892|p=313}} 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Especially she is being occupied a mysterious [[sect]] of [[Rāja yoga|raj-yogis]], the holy sages, who, through the special exertion of their spiritual forces, something like a long spiritual gymnastics, reach the ability to perform undoubted [[Paranormal|miracles]]: so, Blavatsky's personally acquaintance raj-yogi Gulab-Singh{{refn|group=note|"In ''Caves and Jungles'' [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|HPB]] describes, under the name Gulab-Singh, a figure who corresponds in most details to her descriptions elsewhere of [[Mahatma]] [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]."{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alexander Senkevich|Senkevich]] wrote that in this book Blavatsky introduced under the pseudonym of Gulab-Lal-Singh her [[mahatma|Masters]] Morya and [[Kuthumi]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=79}}}} had been answering the questions which Blavatsky was demanding only mentally, had been disappearing and appearing completely unexpectedly for everyone, had been opening to them in the mountains the mysterious entrances through which they were entering the marvelous underground temples, etc."{{sfn|Словарь|1892|p=315}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky wrote to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]]: "It is like my ''Russian Letters'' from India, where while describing a fictitious journey or tour through India with Thornton's ''Gazeteer'' as my guide, I yet give there true ''facts'' and true personages only bringing in together within three or four months time, facts and events scattered all throughout years as some of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master's]] [[Paranormal|phenomena]]."{{sfnm|Barker|1925|1p=153|Cranston|1993|2p=56}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. 11}} Nevertheless Neff noted that "colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] wrote in the margins of his copy of ''From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan'' the words: 'The Master has been not seen.'"{{sfn|Neff|2013|p=67}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Indologist's comments ==
[[Alexander Senkevich|Senkevich]] wrote that these essays by Blavatsky had a "stunning success" in Russia. He stated that Blavatsky demonstrates in this work an enviable erudition and liveliness of the mind. In a sense, her book is a country-specific encyclopaedia, which and "to this day has not lost its scientific value."{{refn|group=note|Senkevich claimed that in the book, for example, correctly described the tree serpents, or the shrubby snakes, abundantly found in the jungles of [[Bengal]]: "As soon as the head of a man comes under the branch which shelters this 'enemy of mankind,' the snake, coiling its tail around the branch, dives full length into space and strikes the man on his ''forehead.''"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1975|1p=57|Сенкевич|2012|2p=338}}}} The author's desire to disclose India "from within," through people with whom she was throwed by her fate, gives the book, in comparison with the usual travel essays, a "special, completely new character of the psychological document reflecting many facets of the Indian spiritual world, the specificity of the life of traditional Indian society." The book gives also an objective assessment of the English colonial rule, all the more important because it contains the condemnation of the Englishmen living in India, despite the "truthful, depressing descriptions of atrocities" against them by the participants the [[1857 sepoy uprising|Sepoy uprising (1857–1859)]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|pp=423–424}}

According to Senkevich, Blavatsky expresses her indignation at the English colonial orders, contempt for the pleasures and amusements of the British officials and the Anglo-Indians, who served them, "in a sarcastic and vitriolic manner," and the reader, empathizing with her "violent emotions, willy-nilly takes her side." She took into account the stereotypes of the average Russian reader's thinking, his "phobias, geopolitical views and cultural predilections."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=337}} Here is one example of her emotional reasoning on the subject of the English suspiciousness and jealousy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This national characteristic of the English to shout: 'Help, they are killing us!' when nobody even thinks of touching them, is disgusting… But if this trait is notable even in England, how much more so is it in India? Here suspicion has become a monomania. Anglo-Indians see Russian spies even in their own shoes, and this drives them to madness… They watch every new arrival from one province to another, even should he be an Englishman. People have been deprived not only of every weapon, but of all knives and axes. The peasant can hardly chop his wood, or protect himself from a tiger. But the English are still afraid. It is true that here there are but 60,000 of them, while the native population numbers 245 million. And their system which they took over from successful animal-tamers, is good only until the animal senses his tamer is fearful in his turn… Then his hour has come! At all events, such a manifestation of chronic fear merely admits a recognition of one's own weakness."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1975|1pp=13–14|Сенкевич|2012|2p=337}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
Vera Johnston, the first translator of the work, wrote that author's manuscript "was often incorrect; often obscure." The Russian editors, though they did their best to transfer faithfully the Indian names and places, "often produced, through their ignorance of Oriental tongues, forms which are strange, and sometimes unrecognizable."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1892|p=iii}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The proof-sheets were never corrected by the author, who was then in India; and, in consequence, it has been impossible to restore all the local and personal names to their proper form. A similar difficulty has arisen with reference to quotations and cited authorities, all of which have gone through a double process of refraction: first into Russian, then into English."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1892|p=iv}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Vsevolod Solovyov|Solovyov]] noted that Blavatsky was in her lifetime very troubled that the English should not know contents of the book, "as she wrote for Russian readers, and was not sparing of ridicule and censure against the Anglo-Indian Government and its representatives."{{sfn|Solovyoff|1895|pp=263, 264}} He claimed also that the reader of the book must look on it as "romance and fancy, and must on no account take on trust the facts and statements" given by Blavatsky because "most bitter disenchantment awaits the too trustful reader."{{sfn|Solovyoff|1895|p=264}} [[Howard Murphet|Murphet]] wrote that Blavatsky's work is "a highly imaginative concoction of fact-and-fiction, written in a style that established her literary reputation with Russian editors."{{sfn|Murphet|1975}}

According to Senkevich, in the 1870s and 1880s, a lot of materials appeared in Russian magazines and newspapers, the keynote being the "idea of a Russian war campaign to India." The writer's fame of Blavatsky has been created in the "wake of this propaganda hype."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=359}}

== Interesting facts ==
* [[Sergei Witte|Count Witte]] has remembered: "She [his cousin Helena Blavatsky] had, no doubt, a literary talent. The Moscow editor, Katkov, famous in the annals of Russian journalism, spoke to me in the highest terms of praise about her literary gifts, as evidenced in the tales entitled ''From the Jungles of Hindustan,'' which she contributed to his magazine, ''The Russian Messenger.''"{{sfn|Witte|1921}}
* To solve problem of transcription and transliteration of some theosophical terms when working on a new translation into Russian of ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' the translator Bazyukin applied the method used by Blavatsky in her book ''From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan.''{{sfn|Базюкин|2012}}
* The translator Zaytsev used "wherever possible" in his translation into Russian of ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' "for maintaining the accuracy of the transfer of ideas" some fragments of the book ''From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan'' (see, the translator's note).{{sfn|Блаватская|2005|loc=Гл.

A '''hagiography''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|æ|ɡ|i|ˈ|ɒ|ɡ|r|ə|f|i}}; {{ety|gre|''[[wikt:ἅγιος|ἅγιος]]'', hagios|holy||''[[wikt:-γραφία|-γραφία]]'', -graphia|writing}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED | hagiography}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a biography of a [[saint]] or an [[ecclesiastical]] leader. The term ''hagiography'' may be used to refer to the biography of a saint or highly developed spiritual being in any of the world's spiritual traditions.

Christian hagiographies focus on the lives, and notably the [[miracle]]s,  ascribed to men and women [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Roman Catholic church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]], and the [[Church of the East]]. Other religious traditions such as [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Augustine (2012), ''Buddhist Hagiography in Early Japan'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415646291}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lorenzen]] (2006), ''Who Invented Hinduism?'', Yoda Press, {{ISBN|978-8190227261}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;120–121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]] also create and maintain hagiographical texts (such as the Sikh [[Janamsakhis]]) concerning saints, gurus and other individuals believed to be imbued with sacred power.

Hagiographic works, especially those of the [[Middle Ages]], can incorporate a record of institutional and [[local history]], and evidence of popular [[cult (religious practice)|cults]], customs, and [[tradition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2008). ''Archive and manuscripts: contents and use: using the sources'' (3rd ed.). Aberystwyth, UK: Department of Information Studies, Aberystwyth University. p. 5.20. {{ISBN|978-1-906214-15-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when referring to modern, non-ecclesiastical works, the term [[wikt:hagiography|''hagiography'']] is often used as a [[pejorative]] reference to [[biography|biographies]] and [[historian|histories]] whose authors are perceived to be uncritical of or reverential to their subject.

== Christian ==

=== Development ===
Hagiography constituted an important [[literary genre]] in the [[early Christian church]], providing some informational history along with the more inspirational stories and [[legend]]s. A hagiographic account of an individual saint can consist of a biography (''vita''), a description of the saint's deeds or miracles, an account of the saint's martyrdom (''passio''), or be a combination of these.

The genre of lives of the saints first came into being in the [[Roman Empire]] as legends about [[Christian]] [[martyr]]s were recorded. The dates of their deaths formed the basis of [[martyrology|martyrologies]]. In the 4th century, there were three main types of catalogs of lives of the saints:
*annual calendar catalogue, or ''[[menaion]]'' (in [[Greek language|Greek]], {{lang|grc|μηναῖον}}, ''menaion'' means "monthly" ([[Adjective|adj]], [[Grammatical gender|neut]]), lit. "lunar"), biographies of the saints to be read at [[sermon]]s;
*''[[synaxarion]]'' ("something that collects"; Greek {{lang|grc|συναξάριον}}, from {{lang|grc|σύναξις}}, ''synaxis'' i.e. "gathering", "collection", "compilation"), or a short version of lives of the saints, arranged by dates;
*''[[paterikon]]'' ("that of the Fathers"; Greek {{lang|grc|πατερικόν}}; in Greek and Latin, ''pater'' means "father"), or biography of the specific saints, chosen by the catalog compiler.

In [[Western Europe]] hagiography was one of the more important vehicles for the study of inspirational history during the [[Middle Ages]]. The ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacob de Voragine]] compiled a great deal of medieval hagiographic material, with a strong emphasis on miracle tales. Lives were often written to promote the cult of local or national states, and in particular to develop pilgrimages to visit [[relic]]s. The bronze [[Gniezno Doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]] in Poland are the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] doors in Europe to feature the life of a saint. The life of Saint [[Adalbert of Prague]], who is buried in the cathedral, is shown in 18 scenes, probably based on a lost illuminated copy of one of his Lives.

The [[Bollandists|Bollandist]] Society continues the study, academic assembly, appraisal and publication of materials relating to the lives of Christian saints. (See ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]''.)

=== Medieval England ===
Many of the important hagiographical texts composed in medieval England were written in the vernacular dialect [[Anglo-Norman literature#Hagiography|Anglo-Norman]]. With the introduction of [[Latin]] literature into England in the 7th and 8th centuries the genre of the life of the saint grew increasingly popular. When one contrasts it to the popular heroic poem, such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', one finds that they share certain common features. In ''Beowulf'', the titular character battles against [[Grendel]] and [[Grendel's mother|his mother]], while the saint, such as [[Athanasius]]' [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] (one of the original sources for the hagiographic motif) or the character of [[Guthlac]], battles against figures no less substantial in a spiritual sense. Both genres then focus on the hero-warrior figure, but with the distinction that the saint is of a spiritual sort.

Imitation of the life of Christ was then the benchmark against which saints were measured, and imitation of the lives of saints was the benchmark against which the general population measured itself. In [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[mediaeval|medieval]] England, hagiography became a literary genre par excellence for the teaching of a largely illiterate audience. Hagiography provided priests and theologians with classical handbooks in a form that allowed them the rhetorical tools necessary to present their faith through the example of the saints' lives.

Of all the English hagiographers no one was more prolific nor so aware of the importance of the genre as Abbot [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]. His work ''Lives of the Saints''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Lives of the Saints |author=Ælfric of Eynsham |authorlink=Ælfric of Eynsham |access-date=1 December 2018 |url= http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Cotton_MS_Julius_E_VIIa}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains set of sermons on saints' days, formerly observed by the English Church. The text comprises two prefaces, one in Latin and one in [[Old English language|Old English]], and 39 lives beginning on December 25 with the nativity of [[Christ]] and ending with three texts to which no saints' days are attached. The text spans the entire year and describes the lives of many saints, both English and continental, and hearkens back to some of the earliest saints of the early church.

There are two known instances where saint's lives were adapted into vernacular [[play (theatre)|plays]] in Britain. These are the [[Cornish language|Cornish-language]] works ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]'' and ''[[Beunans Ke]]'', about the lives of Saints [[Meriasek]] and [[Saint Kea|Kea]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|last= Koch|first= John T. |year= 2006|publisher= ABC-CLIO|location= |isbn= 1-85109-440-7|page= |pages= 203–205|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Celtic+Culture#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Ireland ===
[[File:National Library of Ireland MS G10 p24.jpg|right|thumb|Calendar entries for January 1st and 2nd of the [[Martyrology of Oengus]].]]
Ireland is notable in its rich hagiographical tradition, and for the large amount of material which was produced during the Middle Ages. Irish hagiographers wrote primarily in Latin while some of the later saint's lives were written in the hagiographer's native vernacular [[Irish language|Irish]]. Of particular note are the lives of [[St. Patrick]], [[Columba|St. Columba (Latin)/Colm (Irish)]] and [[Brigit of Kildare|St. Brigit/Brigid]]—Ireland's three patron saints.  Additionally, several Irish calendars relating to the [[Calendar of saints|feastdays]] of [[Christian saints]] (sometimes called [[martyrology|martyrologies]] or [[martyrology|feastologies]]) contained abbreviated synopses of saint's lives, which were compiled from many different sources.  Notable examples include the [[Martyrology of Tallaght]] and the [[Félire Óengusso]]. Such hagiographical calendars were important in establishing lists of native Irish saints, in imitation of continental calendars.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
[[File:Hagiasophia-christ.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Greek Orthodox visual hagiography. This is one of the best known surviving Byzantine mosaics in [[Hagia Sophia]] – [[Christ Pantocrator]] flanked by the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]] made in the 12th century.]]

In the 10th century, a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[monk]] [[Simeon Metaphrastes]] was the first one to change the genre of lives of the saints into something different, giving it a moralizing and [[panegyric]]al character. His catalog of lives of the saints became the standard for all of the [[Western world|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] hagiographers, who would create relative biographies and images of the ideal saints by gradually departing from the real facts of their lives. Over the years, the genre of lives of the saints had absorbed a number of narrative plots and poetic images (often, of pre-Christian origin, such as [[dragon]] fighting etc.), mediaeval [[parable]]s, short stories and [[anecdote]]s.

The genre of lives of the saints was introduced in the Slavic world in the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the late 9th and early 10th century, where the first original hagiographies were produced on [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]], [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Saint Naum|Naum of Preslav]]. Eventually the Bulgarians brought this genre to [[Kievan Rus']] together with [[writing]] and also in [[translation]]s from the Greek language. In the 11th century, the [[Rus' people|Rus']] began to compile the original life stories of the first Rus'ian saints, e.g. [[Boris and Gleb]], Theodosius Pechersky etc. In the 16th century, [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Macarius]] expanded the list of the Rus'ian saints and supervised the compiling process of their life stories. They would all be compiled in the so-called ''Velikiye chet'yi-minei'' catalog (Великие Четьи-Минеи, or [[Great Menaion Reader]]), consisting of 12 [[volume]]s in accordance with each month of the year. They were revised and expanded by St. [[Dimitry of Rostov]] in 1684–1705.

Today, the works in the genre of lives of the saints represent a valuable historical source and reflection of different social ideas, world outlook and [[aesthetic]] [[concept]]s of the past.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
Traditional [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] hagiography in [[Ge'ez language]] is known as the ''Gadl'' (Saint's Life). They are, in addition of the [[Axumite inscriptions]] and the [[Ethiopian Royal Chronicles]], among the most important [[Ethiopian Empire|Medieval Ethiopian]] written sources. However, their historical accuracy is in question. They were created by the disciples of the saints. Some were written a long time after the death of a saint, but others were written not long after the saint's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.linkethiopia.org/guide-to-ethiopia/the-pankhurst-history-library/lives-of-ethiopian-saints/|title=Lives of Ethiopian Saints|website=Link Ethiopia|accessdate=4 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305040611/http://web.linkethiopia.org/guide-to-ethiopia/the-pankhurst-history-library/lives-of-ethiopian-saints/|archivedate=5 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic ==
Hagiography in Islam began in the [[Arabic Language|Arabic language]] with biographical writing about the Prophet [[Muhammad]] in the eighth century CE, a tradition known as ''[[sīra]]''. From about the tenth century CE, however, a genre generally known as ''[[Manaqib|manāqib]]'' also emerged, which comprised biographies of the [[Imam|imams]] (''madhāhib'') who founded different schools of Islamic thought (''[[madhhab]]'') about ''[[Sharia|shariʿa]]'', and of [[List of Sufi saints|Ṣūfī saints]]. Over time, hagiography about Ṣūfīs and their miracles came to predominate in the genre of ''manāqib''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ch. Pellat, “Manāḳib”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs, 2nd edn, 12 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1960–2005), {{DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_0660}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise influenced by early Islamic [[Hadith studies|research into hadiths]] and other biographical information about the Prophet, Persian scholars began writing [[Persian hagiography]], again mainly of Sūfī saints, in the eleventh century CE.

The Islamicisation of the Turkish regions led to the development of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] biographies of saints, beginning in the thirteenth century CE and gaining pace around the sixteenth. Production remained dynamic and kept pace with scholarly developments in historical biographical writing until 1925, when [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (d. 1938) placed an interdiction on Ṣūfī brotherhoods. As Turkey relaxed legal restrictions on Islamic practice in the 1950s and the 1980s, Ṣūfīs returned to publishing hagiography, a trend with continues in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Alexandre Papas, “Hagiography, Persian and Turkish”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', ed. by Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, and Everett Rowson (Leiden: Brill, 2007-), {{DOI|10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_23914}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Avraham Haggiag Pagani''' (25 April 1944 in [[Tripoli]] &amp;ndash; 16 August 1988 in [[Palm Springs, California]]) was an Italian artist and musician.

Pagani was born in a Jewish family in [[Libya]] when it was an Italian Colonial Administration. He spent his childhood and adolescence between Italy, Germany and France. This nonstop wandering about different cultures drove him to seek out a personal language that would enable him to express himself non-verbally, and he started drawing. 

In 1964 Pagani, at the age of twenty, had his first exhibition at the Pierre Picard Gallery in [[Cannes]], where he exhibited  a group of Indian-ink drawings and engravings. The French poet Jean Rousselot wrote an enthusiastic review in ''Planete'', describing Pagani as a "Twenty-years-old Visionary". Among his first Italian collectors were Giorgio Soavi, [[Federico Fellini]], Bernardino Zapponi and the [[Olivetti]] Collection. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to contribute a series of drawings for the [[Planète (review)|Planète]] review edited by [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]], becoming one of the youngest exponents of the [[Fantastic Realism]]. In 1965 Pagani illustrated ''Fantarca'' by Giuseppe Berto for [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], and ''Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley for the Club des Amis du Livre.

Parallel to art, Pagani pursued an interest in music. His first Italian album was released in 1967. In 1969, the day after Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] coup d'état, the Libyan police broke into Pagani's family's house in Tripoli. A hundred and fifty canvases and drawings were destroyed. His first French album, chronicling those events, was released in 1970. Pagani designed the covers of his records, and the stage designs of his shows.

In 1971, Pagani had a solo exhibition at the [[Théâtre de la Ville]] in [[Paris]] called ''Concerto d'Italie'' where he did a performance inside his drawings projected on a large screen by Laser Graphics Group. This was the first [[Diaporama]] exhibition staged in Europe.  Less interested in a single technique than in investigating the correlation among all the techniques he was to try out, Pagani declared that "Engraving on stone, or vinyl, is the same thing. It is more important to establish one' s mental and emotional territory with all available means". 

In 1973 Pagani used documentary footage made available by the Italian Television Corporation to produce and direct a 27-minute movie-pamphlet entitled ''Venise, amore mio'' which Unesco defined as "the best vehicle of information on the dangers besetting Venice and its lagoon". French Television broadcast it twice, on Antenne 2.

In 1975, Pagani composed the music and designed the stage set for ''Megalopolis'' a total-opera based on ''Medioevo Prossimo Venturo'' (The near future middleages) with a libretto by Roberto Vacca. In order to represent the congestion and collapse of the Energy Systems as described by the Italian futurologist, Pagani proceeded to clone on thousands of images of modern civilization using the first two Rank Xerox colour duplicators installed in France and in Italy. The "xerographies" assembled on large plates were photographed, projected and animated in ''Multimage'' shows on giant screens. ''Megalopolis'' was selected by the French Ministry of Culture for the re-opening of the Palais de Chaillot at the [[Trocadéro|Trocadero]]. It was subsequently staged at [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in Spoleto. In 1976 it received the ''Grand Prize of Academy Charles Cros''.

In 1977 Pagani experimented with abstraction, mostly with a video-synthetizers devised by the French electronics engineer Marcel Dupouy. Despite his keen interest in technology, Pagani never refrained from using paper, pencils, paints and brushes. Influenced by [[Arte povera]], he started working with discarded materials he would collect from beaches and in dumps across Europe. His sculptures, mostly made of old shoes, were exhibited at Centro internazionale di Brera, [[Milan]] and Palazzo dei Diamanti, [[Ferrara]].

Pagani died of [[leukaemia]], aged 44 in [[Palm Springs]].
Pagani is buried in Tel Aviv Kyriat Shaul cemetery.

==Organization==
The society's objective is to work to raise awareness on how a secular and non-religious segment of Singapore's population has contributed to the progress of Singapore as a nation and a member of the global community, and that a rational, non-dogmatic approach to social issues ought not be taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanist.org.sg/component/content/article/71-general-information/143-hss-introduction |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225002110/http://www.humanist.org.sg/component/content/article/71-general-information/143-hss-introduction |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 25, 2012 |title=General Information |publisher=Humanist.org.sg |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from their work towards maintaining a secular space in society, the Society hold events relating to Humanism, critical thinking and provide a social space for like-minded people to hold discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Asia Republic (新亚共和网) |url=http://newasiarepublic.com/?p=21672 |title=The Wake of Reason: Enter the Humanist Society in Singapore |publisher=Newasiarepublic.com |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125055634/http://newasiarepublic.com/?p=21672 |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Events include talks by prominent Humanists, professionals in the sciences, forums and social get-togethers.

The 3 main celebratory events of the year are Humanist of the Year Award, Darwin Day and the Winter Solstice. Most of their events are opened to both members and non-members.

The society is also linked to other non-religious networks in Southeast Asia, being listed on the Southeast Asian Atheists website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sea-atheists.org/singapore/ Singapore « SEA-Atheists.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2008, the Singapore Humanism Meetup was formed as a social network of secular humanists, atheists and agnostics. They had been meeting regularly to discuss current social issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/2010/02/shm-in-news-again.html Singapore Humanism Meetup: SHM reported under 'hot' section&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The network, which uses a website to organize social gatherings, has over 500 members registered online, meeting in various locations over town to hold workshops, talks and book clubs. In 2009, the network also held the first [[Darwin Day]] in Singapore to celebrate the 200th birthday of [[Charles Darwin]].

In October 2010, the Humanist Society of Singapore became the first humanist group to be gazetted as a society. Many pioneer members of the society met at gatherings organised by the Singapore Humanism Meetup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanist.org.sg/index.php/latest-news/59-carving-out-a-space-for-the-non-religious-here Carving Out a Space for the Non-Religious Here&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Humanist Society organised its first Humanist of the Year award. The award was given to Singaporean author [[Catherine Lim]].

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556&amp;ndash;1605) holds a religious assembly in the (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605.]]
The '''Ibādat Khāna''' (''House of Worship'') was a meeting house built in 1575 CE by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556&amp;ndash;1605) at  [[Fatehpur Sikri]] to gather spiritual leaders of different religious grounds so as to conduct a  discussion on the teachings of the respective religious leaders.&lt;ref name="sen2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Akbar built the Ibādat Khāna as a debating house.{{Clarify|date=March 2015}} He encouraged [[Hindu]]s, [[Roman Catholic]]s, Zoroastrians, Jains and even [[Cārvāka|atheists]] to participate.  Religious leaders and philosophers from around this diverse empire, as well as those passing through, were invited to Akbar's Thursday evening discussions. Akbar's spiritual inclinations were roused to a large extent by the example of Sulaiman Kirani, a past ruler of Bengal, who was said to spend nights in the company of over a hundred ratiocinating spiritual men. Akbar also wanted to sharpen his theological grasp because he had been told of the imminent arrival to his court of Mirza Sulaiman of Badakshan, a [[Sufism|Sufi]] with a predilection for spiritual debates.&lt;ref name="House of worship"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Vincent A.|title=Akbar's "House of Worship", or Ibadat-Khana|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25209315?uid=3738752&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101639944233|publisher=JSTOR|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith of the Divine===
By the late 1580s CE, Akbar began an attempt to reconcile the differences of all religions by creating a new faith, the [[Din-i-Ilahi]] ("Faith of the Divine"), which incorporated both [[pantheism|pantheistic]] versions of Islamic [[Sufism]] (most notably [[Ibn Arabi]]'s doctrine of ''[[Wahdat al wajood]]'' or Unity of Existence) and ''[[bhakti]]'' or devotional movements of Hinduism. Even some elements of [[Christianity]] (like crosses), [[Zoroastrianism]] (fire ceremonies) and [[Jainism]] were amalgamated in the new religion. Akbar was greatly influenced by the teachings of Jain [[Acharya]]s [[Hir Vijay Suri]] and [[Jin Chandra Suri]] and gave up non-[[vegetarian]] food because of their influence. He declared ''Amari'' or non-killing of animals on the holy days of Jains like [[Paryushan]] and [[Mahavir Jayanti]]. He rolled back the [[Jizya]] tax from Jain pilgrimage places like Palitana.

This faith, however, was not for the masses. In fact, the only "converts" to this new religion were the upper nobility of Akbar's court. Historians have so far been able to identify only 18 members of this new religion.

[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''Akbar’s Dream'' lauds the Ibādat Khāna, ascribing tolerance and humanity to his "Divine Faith", while implicitly criticising the intolerance of 19th century British Protestant Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telelib.com/words/authors/T/TennysonAlfred/verse/deathofoenone/akbarsdreamnotes.html Notes to Akbar’s Dream], from The Death of Œnone, and Other Poems by Alfred Tennyson (1892).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rodolfo Acquaviva diskutiert mit dem Großmogul.jpg|thumb|A painting depicting the scenes of the Ibādat Khāna.]]

==Discovery of Ibadat Khana==
Different archaeologists and historians had different thoughts on the location of Ibadat Khana. Saeed Ahmed Mararavi, followed by Athar Abbas Rizvi and Vincent Flynn suggested that the mound between Jama Masjid and Jodha Bai's Mahal is the site of Ibadat Khana. However, they had no tangible proof to support their argument. In early 1980s, [[KK Muhammed]] working under Prof. R. C. Gaur of [[Aligarh Muslim University]] excavated the mound and found the steps, platforms and boundary wall, which matched the painting of Ibadat Khana from Akbar's period.

'''John Paulk''' (born April 13, 1963) is a gay man who, from 1998 to 2003, was an advocate of the [[ex-gay]] movement and [[conversion therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150912072552/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/life-as-ex-ex-gay-paulk-108090?paginate=false&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Paulk disavowed his belief in gay reparative therapy and issued a formal apology for his role as an advocate of the movement.

He founded and led the ministry [[Love Won Out]], which was launched by the organization [[Focus on the Family]]. From 1998 to 2003, he was chairman of the board of [[Exodus (organization)|Exodus International North America]]. His 1998 [[autobiography]] ''Not Afraid to Change'' addressed his sexuality and attempts to change his [[Homosexuality|same-sex]] desires. Later that year, after it was revealed that Paulk attended a [[gay bar]], both organizations disciplined him, but he remained with Focus on the Family until 2003. He resigned as Exodus board chairman but continued his elected position until his term was completed. In 2005, Paulk opened a catering business in Portland, Oregon.

By 2013 he had divorced his wife [[Anne Paulk]] and no longer supported the ex-gay movement or efforts to attempt to change individuals' sexual orientation&lt;ref name="PQ Monthly"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pqmonthly.com/is-john-paulk-ready-to-renounce-his-ex-gay-gospel-2/13867|title=
Is John Paulk ready to renounce his ex-gay gospel?|accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaleem|first=Jaweed, and Lisa Shapiro|title=Ex-Gay Christian Groups Will Continue After Exodus As Religious LGBT Support Grows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/21/ex-gay-christian-exodus-lgbt_n_3475024.html|work=The Huffington Post, June 21, 2013|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
A native of the [[Columbus, Ohio]], Paulk attended Fort Hayes High School for the Performing Arts and [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]], where he majored in music/voice. During the late 1980s, Paulk managed Cocolat, a [[San Francisco]] patisserie owned by [[Alice Medrich]].&lt;ref name="Mezzaluna"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mezzaluna.biz/chef.php |title=Mezzaluna - The Chef |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605182243/http://www.mezzaluna.biz/chef.php |archivedate=2008-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulk claimed that he overcame his homosexuality following his conversion to [[Christianity]], through a combination of counseling, groups, prayer, and his relationship with God. He identified himself as a [[heterosexual]]. Paulk's wife, [[Anne Paulk|Anne]], also identified as ex-gay. John Paulk co-wrote the books ''Not Afraid to Change'' with Tony Marko and ''Love Won Out'' with [[Anne Paulk]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulk, John, (Marko, Tony) ''Not Afraid to Change: The Remarkable Story of How One Man Overcame Homosexuality'' Winepress Publishing, {{ISBN|1-57921-097-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulk, John, (Paulk, Anne) ''Love Won Out: How God's Love Helped 2 People Leave Homosexuality and Find Each Other'' Focus on the Family Pub, {{ISBN|1-56179-783-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Paulk became involved with [[Focus on the Family]], where he was manager of the organization's Homosexuality and Gender Division.&lt;ref name="ads-renew"&gt;Archives, The Washington Post, "Ads Renew Ex-gay Debate", by Alan Cooperman, 21 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1995, Paulk was elected Chairman of the board of Exodus International North America for a three-year term. He was subsequently re-elected to a second three-year term in 1998. As an employee of Focus on the Family, Paulk toured the United States, speaking of his conversions at [[Love Won Out]] conferences. Paulk and his wife became the faces promoting Exodus ministries in major daily newspaper full page ads. The couple appeared on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' (August 1998), when the publication covered Exodus and the [[ex-gay movement]]. That year, [[Christian right]] groups including the [[Family Research Council]] and the [[American Family Association]] spent $600,000 on advertising promoting conversion therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/how-christians-turned-against-gay-conversion-therapy/390570/|title=How Christians Turned Against Gay Conversion Therapy|author=Jonathan Merritt|date=15 Apr 2015|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ex-ex-gay-pride-249282|title=Ex-Ex-Gay Pride|work=Newsweek|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulk left "ex-gay" ministry work in 2003 and moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], with his wife and family. The couple started a [[catering]] business in 2005, and he appeared regularly in [[cooking]] segments on Portland television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mezzaluna.biz/aboutus.php |title=Mezzaluna - About Us |publisher=Mezzaluna.biz |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912105128/http://www.mezzaluna.biz/aboutus.php |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mezzaluna.biz/chef.php |title=Mezzaluna - The Chef |publisher=Mezzaluna.biz |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812191450/http://www.mezzaluna.biz/chef.php |archivedate=2010-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Paulk appeared on the [[Food Network]] program ''[[Cutthroat Kitchen]]'', hosted by [[Alton Brown]]. Paulk came in second place,.

==Washington, D.C. incident==
On September 19, 2000 while on a speaking tour, Paulk was seen sitting inside at the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[gay bar]] Mr. P's. A patron recognized him and contacted [[Wayne Besen]] of the [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[Truth Wins Out]], and other gay political action organizations.  When Besen arrived at the bar 40 minutes later and confronted Paulk, Paulk denied that he was John Paulk, instead insisting he was "John Clint". Upon exiting the bar, Paulk's picture was taken as evidence that he had been in the bar. When confronted by Besen about the incident and the photographs, Paulk admitted being in the bar, but stated that he didn't know that it was a gay bar, and he had simply stopped in for a moment to use the restroom. However, eyewitnesses reported that Paulk stayed for more than an hour, flirted with other men, and—when questioned about his sexuality—said that he was gay.&lt;ref name="besen"&gt;Besen, Wayne, ''[[Anything But Straight]]'' Harrington Park Press, {{ISBN|1-56023-445-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Voice, "Ex-gay Leader Confronted In Gay Bar", by Joel Lawson, 21 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulk was called back to Focus on the Family headquarters and questioned by [[James Dobson]]. At first, Paulk reportedly avoided giving a direct answer about the incident; however, he later confessed that he had been in the bar for the purpose of finding connection with other men. Paulk reduced his activities for six months and then resumed his position as manager of the Homosexuality and Gender Division of Focus on the Family.

An Exodus press release soon followed:&lt;ref&gt;Southern Voice, "Chairman Disciplined For Gay Bar Visit"&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|John's actions represent a serious lapse in sound judgment. His decision to enter a gay establishment for any reason opens him up to all kinds of speculation by both other Exodus leaders and also the gay community.}}

The incident received national headlines in newspapers and news magazines. Paulk remained in his position as manager of the Homosexuality and Gender Department until choosing to leave that position in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"Rejecting Gay Feelings, Some Strive To Change" (Letter to the editor of the Columbus Dispatch), by Alan Chambers (President, Exodus International), June 23, 2006, retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/733/262/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207152409/http://exodus.to/content/view/733/262/ |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }} on December 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal apology==
In April 2013, Paulk disavowed his belief in gay reparative therapy, announcing that —while he remains a devout Christian— he also identifies as a gay (not "formerly gay") man and believes that reparative therapy is both futile and harmful. He announced that his marriage was ending and he issued a formal apology for his role as an advocate of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jonathan Eybeschütz''' (also '''Eibeschutz''' or '''Eibeschitz'''; 1690 in [[Kraków]] – 1764 in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]), was a [[Talmud]]ist, [[halacha|Halachist]], [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]], holding positions as [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|Dayan]] of [[Prague]], and later as Rabbi of the "Three Communities": [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Wandsbek]]. With [[Jacob Emden]], he is well known as a [[protagonist]] in the [[Jacob Emden#Sabbatean controversy|Emden–Eybeschütz Controversy]].

==Biography==
Eybeschütz's father was the [[rabbi]] in [[Ivančice]] ({{lang-de|Eibenschütz}}, sometimes ''Eibeschutz''), [[Habsburg Moravia]]. Eybeschütz was a child prodigy in [[Talmud]]; on his father's death, he studied in the [[yeshiva]] of [[Meir Eisenstadt]] in [[Prostějov]] (Prossnitz), and then later in [[Zlín Region|Holešov]] (Holleschau). He also lived in [[Vienna]] for a short time. He married Elkele Spira, daughter of Rabbi [[Isaac Spira]], and they lived in [[Hamburg]] for two years with [[Mordecai ha-Kohen]], Elkele's maternal grandfather. Among their descendents are the illustrious management thinker [[Peter Drucker]] and Margarethe Kelsen, the wife of [[Hans Kelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univie.ac.at/kelsen/family/Bondi_Mordechai_Schewa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Eybeschütz settled in [[Prague]] in 1700 and became [[rosh yeshiva|head]] of the [[yeshivah]] and a famous preacher. The people of [[Prague]] held Eybeschütz in high esteem and he was considered second there only to [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|Dayan]] [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]].

In Prague, Eybeschütz received permission to print the Talmud—but with the omission of all passages [[Christianity and Judaism|contradicting the principles of Christianity]] in consultation with [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|Dayan]] David Oppenheim. Legends and rumors seeking to discredit the event said that he did this without the consultation of the Rabbis of Prague, and they revoked the printing license.

Already in Prague 1724, he was suspected of being a [[Sabbatean]]. He even got up on [[Yom Kippur]] to denounce the Sabbatean movement, but he remained suspected.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Arie Perlmutter, R.Yehonatan Aibeshits ve-yahaso el ha-Shabtaut : hakirot hadashot 'al yesod ketav ha-yad shel s.va-avo ha-yom el ha-'ayin&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, In 1736, Eybeschutz was only appointed [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]] of Prague and not chief rabbi. He became rabbi of [[Metz]] in 1741. In 1750, he was elected rabbi of the "Three Communities:" [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Wandsbek]].

He was "an acknowledged genius" in at least three separate areas of Jewish religious creativity: [[Talmud]] and Jewish law ([[halakhah]]); homiletics ([[midrash|derush]]) and popular preaching; and [[Kabbalah]]. "He was a man of erudition, but he owed his fame chiefly to his personality. Few men of the period so profoundly impressed their mark on [[Jew]]ish life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/EUD_FAT/EYBESCHUTZ_JONATHAN_1690_1764_.html]&lt;/ref&gt; His granddaughter was the Breslau poet and intellectual {{Interlanguage link multi|Lucie Domeier|de}}, born Esther Gad.

==Sabbatian controversy==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Template:Kabbalah]] --&gt;
Eybeschütz again became suspected of harboring secret Sabbatean beliefs because of a dispute that arose concerning the [[amulet]]s which he was suspected of issuing. It was alleged that these amulets recognized the Messianic claims of [[Sabbatai Zevi]].Once the controversy started when Emden found serious connections between the Kabbalistic and homiletic writings of Eybeschutz with those of the known Sabbatean [[Judah Leib Prossnitz]], whom Eybeschütz knew from his days in Prossnitz.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Arie Perlmutter, R.Yehonatan Aibeshits ve-yahaso el ha-Shabtaut : hakirot hadashot 'al yesod ketav ha-yad shel s.va-avo ha-yom el ha-'ayin&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] accused him of [[heresy]]. The majority of the rabbis in Poland, Moravia, and Bohemia, as well as the leaders of the Three Communities supported Eybeschütz: the accusation was "utterly incredible"—in 1725, Eybeschütz was among the Prague rabbis who excommunicated the [[Sabbatean]]s. Others suggest that the Rabbis issued this ruling because they feared the repercussions if their leading figure, Eybeschütz, was found to be a Sabbatean. Recent evidence has produced the actual amulets and their alleged connection to Sabbatean amulets.&lt;ref&gt;Sid Leiman/Simon Schwarzfuchs, New Evidence on the Emden-Eybeschütz Controversy. The Amulets from Metz, in: Revue des Etudes Juives 165 (2006),&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1752, the controversy between Emden and Eybeschütz raged. In December of that year, the Hamburg government banned any more discussion of the amulets, the [[Senate of Hamburg]] suspended Eybeschütz, and many members of that congregation demanded that he should submit his case to rabbinical authorities. At this point he was defended by Carl Anton, a convert to Christianity, but a former disciple of Eybeschütz. "Kurze Nachricht von dem Falschen Messias Sabbathai Zebhi," etc. (Wolfenbüttel, 1752).

The controversy was a momentous incident in [[Jewish history]] of the period—involving both [[Yechezkel Landau]] and the [[Vilna Gaon]]—and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in Sabbatai current even in some Orthodox circles. 

In 1760, the quarrel broke out once more when some [[Shabbatean]] elements were discovered among the students of Eybeschütz' [[yeshivah]].
At the same time his younger son, [[Wolf Jonas Eybeschutz]], presented himself as a Shabbatean prophet, and was close to several [[Jacob Frank|Frankists]], with the result that the yeshivah was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe.  Wolf Jonas Eybeschütz - An "Enlightened" Sabbatean in Transylvania.   In: Studia Judaica, 6 (1997) 7-26&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacob Katz]], Jonathan Eybeschütz's grandson was rumored to be [[Baron Thomas von Schoenfeld]], an apostate Jew who inherited his grandfather's collection of Sabbatean kabbalistic works. He eventually left the Sabbatean movement and founded a Masonic lodge called the [[Asiatische Bruder]], one of four [[Illuminati]] lodges in Vienna. After his uncle's death on August 10, 1791, he was offered the leadership of the Frankist movement which he refused. Katz disputes this claim however, saying that [[Baron Thomas von Schoenfeld]] was a member of the Dobruschka family of Brьnn and was in no way related, either by blood or marriage, to Eybeschutz. According to Gershom Scholem, the ideology of the [[Asiatic Brethren]] mixed [[Kabbalistic]] and [[Sabbatean]] ideas jumbled together with Christian theosophic doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Katz |title=Jews and Freemasons in Europe 1723–1939 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-674-47480-5 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DddNAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Eybeschutz's descendents is the Yiddish novelist and Holocaust survivor [[Chava Rosenfarb]] (1923–2011).{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Works==
Thirty of his works in the area of [[Halakha]] (Jewish law) have been published. In addition, several of his works on homiletics, teaching methodology, and Kabbalah are currently in print.  Only one of his works was published in his lifetime. The posthumous printing of so many of his works is testimony to his influence on his contemporaries through his oral teachings and his personality.  It is claimed that he also published numerous Sabbatean works anonymously.

Rabbi Eybeschutz also wrote ''Luchoth Edut'' (Tablets of Testimony), in which he describes the whole dispute and attempts to refute the charges against him. It includes also the letters of recommendation which he had received from leading rabbis who came to his defense. In January 2014, Maggid Books, a division of [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] published "Derash Yehonatan: Around the Year with Rav Yehonatan Eybeshitz" by Rabbi Shalom Hammer. This work is one of the first English translations of Rabbi Eybeshutz's writings.

'''Jordan Hill Roman Temple''' is a [[Romano-Celtic temple]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman]] ruin situated on [[Jordan Hill, Dorset|Jordan Hill]] above [[Bowleaze Cove]] in the eastern suburbs of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] in [[Dorset]], England. Original amateur excavations on the site in 1843, by J. Medhurst, were followed by a series of excavations in the 20th century&lt;ref name="PastScape"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=452622&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=jordan%20hill%20roman%20temple&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |title=PastScape - Jordan Hill Roman Temple |publisher=PastScape (English Heritage) |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the site was in operation between {{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;69–79}} to the late 4th century.

In the 20th century the site became the property of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and is currently in the guardianship of [[English Heritage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8953">{{Muhammad}}

Very few texts in [[Judaism]] refer to or take note of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. Those that do, generally reject Muhammad's proclamation of receiving divine revelations from [[God]] and label him instead as a [[false prophet]].

==Background==
In Judaism, prophets were seen as having attained the highest degree of holiness, scholarship, and closeness to God and set the standards for human perfection. The [[Talmud]] reports that there were more than a million prophets, but most of the prophets conveyed messages that were intended solely for their own generation and were not reported in [[Scripture]]. The Talmud reports that there were prophets among the [[gentile]]s (most notably [[Balaam]], whose story is told in ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]'' 22, and [[Job (Bible)|Job]], who is considered a non-Jew by most rabbinical opinions). The prophet [[Jonah]] was sent on a mission to speak to the gentiles of the city of [[Nineveh]].

==References to Muhammad==

In the Middle Ages, it was common for [[Jews|Jewish]] writers to describe Muhammad as ''ha-meshuggah'' ("the [[madman]]"), a term of contempt frequently used in the Bible for those who believe themselves to be prophets.&lt;ref name="Stillman1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman A. Stillman|title=The Jews of Arab lands: a history and source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=26 December 2011|year=1979|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=978-0-8276-0198-7|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M8o6UZ37ppUC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism By Ibn Warraq Page 255]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vjFNPT52XjUC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History page 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporaries===
In the 7th century and during the life of Muhammad himself, many Jewish leaders and individual Jews made public their views on him or those who followed, especially but not limited if it concerned their communities. Among others, the old sage and man of letters [[Abu 'Afak]] from the Ubaeda tribe who wrote a poem which would be indicted by Muhammad himself, as warranting the capital sentence by [[assassination]]. The extant of it was preserved in Islamic biography and it may have been less severe,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Long have I lived but never have I seen
An assembly or collection of people
More faithful to their undertaking
And their allies when called upon
Than the sons of Qayla when they assembled,
Men who overthrew mountains and never submitted.
A rider who came to them split them in two
(saying) "Permitted", "Forbidden", of all sorts of things.
Had you believed in glory or kingship
You would have followed [[Rulers of Saba and Himyar|Tubba]].

The apostle [Muhammad] said, "Who will deal with this rascal for me?"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Maimonides===
[[Maimonides]] referred to Muhammad as a [[false prophet]] and an [[insane]] man. In his ''[[Epistle to Yemen]]'' he wrote "After [Jesus] arose the Madman who emulated his precursor [Jesus], since he paved the way for him. But he added the further objective of procuring rule and submission [''talb al-mulk''; pursuit of sovereignty] and he invented what was well known [Islam]."&lt;ref name=Roth1994p218&gt;Norman Roth. ''Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict'', [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 1994, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his authoritative work of law the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12), Maimonides indicated that nevertheless Muhammad was part of God's plan of preparing the world for the coming of the [[Jewish Messianism|Jewish Messiah]]: "All those words of Jesus of Nazareth and of this Ishmaelite [i.e., Muhammad] who arose after him are only to make straight the path for the messianic king and to prepare the whole world to serve the Lord together. As it is said: 'For then I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech so that all of them shall call on the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord' (Zephaniah 3:9)."&lt;ref name=Rudin128-129&gt;[[A. James Rudin]]. ''Christians &amp; Jews Faith to Faith: Tragic History, Promising Present, Fragile Future'', Jewish Lights Publishing, 2010, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natan'el al-Fayyumi===
[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], a prominent 12th-century [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] rabbi and theologian, and the founder of what is sometimes called "[[Jewish philosophy#Nethan'el al-Fayyumi|Jewish Ismailism]]", wrote in his philosophical treatise ''Bustan al-Uqul'' ("Garden of Wisdom") that God sends prophets to establish religions for other nations, which do not have to conform to the precepts of the Jewish Torah. Nethanel explicitly considered Muhammad a true prophet, who was sent from Heaven with a particular message that applies to the Arabs, but not to the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bustan al-Ukul, by Nathanael ibn al-Fayyumi,'' edited and translated by David Levine, Columbia University Oriental Studies Vol. VI, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gan ha-Sekhalim'', ed. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1984), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al-Fayymi's explicit acceptance of Muhammad's prophecy was rare and virtually unknown until recent times beyond his native [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation,'' by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter,  T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-08161-3}}, p. 137 ''Netanel's work was virtually unknown beyond his native Yemen until modern times, so had little influence on later Jewish thought.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midrash===
The [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] [[Midrash]] ''Secrets (Nistarot) of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai'', compares Muhammad, "a prophet sent to [[Ishmael]] according to God's will", to the Jewish [[Jewish eschatology|Messiah]]. According to this text, ascribed to the famous 1st-century sage and mystic [[Simeon bar Yochai]], and apparently written at the beginning of the Muslim conquest or in the 8th century,&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Jerusalem: The Early Muslim Period'', by Joshua Prawer and Haggai Ben-Shammai, NYU Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0814766392}}, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's role as a prophet includes redeeming the Jews from the Christian ("Roman" or "Edomite") oppression and playing a positive role in the messianic process.&lt;ref&gt;''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation,'' by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter,  T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-08161-3}}, p. 133 ''"Nistarot" places the Muslim conquests in an eschatological context, and implies that Muhammad had a positive role to play in the messianic process.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obscure and indirect references===
One Yemenite Jewish document, found in the [[Cairo Genizah]], suggests that many Jews had not only accepted Muhammad as a prophet, but even desecrated [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] in order to join Muhammad in his struggle. However, some historians suggest that this document, called ''Dhimmat an-nabi Muhammad'' (Muhammad’s Writ of Protection), has been fabricated by Yemenite Jews for the purpose of self-defence.&lt;ref&gt;Yakov Rabkin [http://www.cismor.jp/en/publication/jismor/documents/JISMOR5en_Rabkin.pdf "Perspectives on the Muslim Other in Jewish Tradition"] (126&amp;nbsp;KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of stories from the Islamic tradition about Muhammad entered mainstream Jewish thought incidentally, due to the great cultural convergence in Islamic Spain from the 9th to 12th centuries, known as the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden Age]] of [[Sephardim|Spanish Jewry]]. For example, Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]], one of the early [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] mystics, wrote that one pious man (''hasid'') taught that the internal struggle against the evil inclination is greater than external battle, quoting [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]'s popular treatise ''[[Chovot HaLevavot]].'' In the [[Judeo-Arabic]] original version of that book, Bahya Ibn Paquda refers to both external and internal battle as [[jihad]] and the "pious man" about whom the story is originally told is Muhammad, though the author does not mention his source by name.&lt;ref&gt;''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart,'' by Diana Lobel, University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|0-8122-3953-9}}, p. ix "How does a perennially popular manual of Jewish piety come to be quoting Islamic traditions about the Prophet Muhammad? Muslim Spain of the tenth through twelfth century, known as the "Golden Age" of Hispano-Jewish poetry and letters, is a time of great convergence and cultural creativity."&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was [[List of past presumed highest mountains|assumed to be the highest mountain in the world]], but calculations based on various readings and measurements made by the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] of India in 1849 came to the conclusion that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, was the highest.

Kangchenjunga was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by [[Joe Brown (climber)|Joe Brown]] and [[George Band]], who were part of a British [[exploration|expedition]]. They stopped short of the summit in accordance with the promise given to the [[Chogyal]] that the top of the mountain would remain intact. Every climber or climbing group that has reached the summit has followed this tradition.&lt;ref name=Kapadia2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Kapadia, H. |year=2001 |title=Across Peaks and Passes in Darjeeling and Sikkim |publisher=Indus Publishing Company |location=New Delhi |isbn=8173871264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of this expedition included [[John Angelo Jackson]] and Tom Mackinon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Perrin, J. |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/01/guardianobituaries.sport |year=2005 |title= Obituary: John Jackson.

==Names==
''Kangchenjunga'' is the official spelling adopted by [[Douglas Freshfield]], [[Alexander Mitchell Kellas]], and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] that gives the best indication of the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] pronunciation. Freshfield referred to the spelling used by the Indian Government since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Freshfield1903"/&gt; There are a number of alternative spellings including ''Kangchendzönga'', ''Khangchendzonga'', and ''Kanchenjunga''.&lt;ref&gt;Denjongpa, A. B. (2002). Kangchendzönga: Secular and Buddhist perceptions of the mountain deity of Sikkim among the Lhopos. Bulletin of Tibetology 38 (2002): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirash, N. (1982).

The brothers [[Hermann Schlagintweit|Hermann]], [[Adolf Schlagintweit|Adolf]] and [[Robert Schlagintweit]] explained the local name Kanchinjínga ({{bo|t=གངས་ཆེན་མཛོད་ལྔ་|w=gangs chen mdzod lnga}}; {{lang-sip|ཁང་ཅེན་ཛོཾག་}}; {{lang|ne|कञ्चनजङ्घा}}; {{lang-hi|कंचनजंघा}}), meaning "the five treasures of the high snow" referring to its five peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/handle/2160/12733/Seeing_Kangchenjunga.pdf|title = Introduction: Seeing Kangchenjunga|date = |access-date = 24 January 2016|website = |publisher = Aberystwyth University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikkimese pronunciation  {{IPA|[k̀ʱɐŋt͡ɕʰẽd͡zø̃ŋɐ]|pron}} originates from the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] word combining ''gangs'' {{IPA|/k̀ʱɐŋ/}} meaning "snow, ice"; ''chen'' {{IPA|/t͡ɕʰẽ/}} meaning "great"; ''mdzod'' {{IPA|/d͡zø/}} meaning "treasure" and ''lnga'' {{IPA|/̃ŋɐ/}} meaning "five". 

Local Lhopo people believe that the treasures are hidden but reveal to the devout when the world is in peril; the treasures comprise [[salt]], [[gold]], [[turquoise]] and [[precious stones]], sacred scriptures, invincible armor or ammunition, grain and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, C. S. (2014). Hidden land and changing landscape: Narratives about Mount Khangchendzonga among the Lepcha and the Lhopo. Journal of the Irish Society for the Academic Study of Religions 1(1): 66–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kangchenjunga's name in the [[Limbu language]] is ''Senjelungma'' or ''Seseylungma'', and is believed to be an [[Dwelling|abode]] of the [[divinity|omnipotent goddess]] [[Yuma Sammang]].&lt;ref&gt;Subba, J. R. (2009). Mythology of the People of Sikkim. Gyan Publishing House, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Panorama Kangchenjunga from Darjeeling.jpg|936px|Panorama of the Kangchenjunga massif from Tiger Hill, Darjeeling|80%}}
The ''Kangchenjunga Himal'' section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and India, and encompasses 16 peaks over {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the north, it is limited by the [[Lhonak River|Lhonak Chu]], Goma Chu and [[Jongsong Peak|Jongsang La]], and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and [[Tamur River|Tamur]].&lt;ref name="Carter1985"/&gt; Kanchenjunga rises about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about {{convert|125|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-south-east of [[Mount Everest]] as the crow flies. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the {{convert|3000|-|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Singalila Ridge]] that separates Sikkim from Nepal and northern [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref name=Dhar2000&gt;Dhar, O.

The main ridge of the massif runs from north-north-east to south-south-west and forms a watershed to several rivers.&lt;ref name=Smythe/&gt; Together with ridges running roughly from east to west they form a giant cross.&lt;ref name="Freshfield1903"/&gt; These ridges contain a host of peaks between {{convert|6000|and|8586|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

== Climbing routes ==
[[File:Kanchenjunga-north.jpg|thumb|Kanchenjunga-north from base camp in Nepal]]
There are four climbing routes to reach the summit of Kangchenjunga, three of which are in Nepal from the southwest, northwest and northeast, and one from northeastern Sikkim in India. To date, the northeastern route from Sikkim has been successfully used only three times. The Indian government has banned expeditions to Kanchenjunga, and therefore this route has been closed since 2000.&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/13/lukeharding|title=Climbers banned from sacred peak|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2000 |work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reconnaissances and attempts===
* Between April 1848 and February 1849, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] explored parts of northern Sikkim and eastern Nepal, mainly to collect plants and study the distribution of Himalayan flora. He was based in Darjeeling, and made repeated excursions in the river valleys and into the foothills of Kangchenjunga up to an altitude of {{convert|15620|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hooker, J. D. |year=1854 |title=Himalayan journals; or, Notes of a naturalist in Bengal, the Sikkim and Nepal Himalayas, the Khasia Mountains, &amp;c. |url=https://archive.org/stream/himalayanjournal0335hook#page/n9/mode/2up |publisher=John Murray, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In spring 1855, the German explorer [[Hermann Schlagintweit]] travelled to Darjeeling but was not allowed to proceed further north due to the [[Nepalese-Tibetan War]]. In May, he explored the [[Singalila Ridge]] up to the peak of [[Tonglu, West Bengal|Tonglo]] for a meteorological survey.&lt;ref name=Schlagintweit1871&gt;{{cite book |author=Schlagintweit, H. v.  |year=1871 |url=https://archive.org/stream/reiseninindienu02sakgoog#page/n255/mode/2up |chapter=Die Singhalila Kette zwischen Sikkim und Nepal |title=Reisen in Indien und Hochasien.

* In 1879, [[Sarat Chandra Das]] and Lama Ugyen-gyatso crossed into Tibet west of "Kanchanjinga" via eastern Nepal and the [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]] en route to [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]]. They returned along the same route in 1881.&lt;ref name=Das1902&gt;Das, S. C. (1902). [https://archive.org/stream/journeytolhasace00dass#page/n9/mode/2up ''A Journey to Lhasa and central Tibet'']. E. P. Dutton &amp; Company, New York, John Murray, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1883, a party of [[William Woodman Graham]] together with two [[Swiss people|Swiss]] mountaineers climbed in the area of Kangchenjunga. They were the first who ascended [[Kabru]] within {{convert|30|-|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the summit. They crossed the Kang La pass, and climbed a peak of nearly {{convert|19000|ft|m|abbr=on}} from which they examined Jannu. They concluded it was too late in the year for an attempt and returned once again to Darjeeling.&lt;ref name=Blaser2009&gt;Blaser, W. and G. Hughes (2009). [http://www.himalaya-info.org/Kabru%20Alpine%20Journal%202010.pdf ''Kabru 1883. A Reassessment'']. The Alpine Journal 114: 219–228.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between October 1885 and January 1886, Rinzin Namgyal surveyed the unexplored north and west sides of Kangchenjunga. He was the first native surveyor to map the circuit of Kangchenjunga and provided sketches of each side of the peak and the adjoining valleys. He also defined the frontiers of Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim in this area.&lt;ref name=Ward2001&gt;Ward, M. (2001). [http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_2001_files/AJ%202001%20191-196%20Ward%20Kangchenjunga.pdf ''Early Exploration of Kangchenjunga and South Tibet by the pundits Rinzin Namgyal, Sarat Chandra Das and Lama Ugyen Gyatso'']. The Alpine Journal 106: 191–196.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1899, British mountaineer Douglas Freshfield set out with his party comprising the Italian photographer [[Vittorio Sella]]. They were the first mountaineers to examine the lower and upper ramparts, and the great western face of Kangchenjunga, rising from the Kangchenjunga Glacier.&lt;ref name="Freshfield1903"/&gt;
* In 1905, a party headed by [[Aleister Crowley]] made the [[1905 Kanchenjunga Expedition|first attempt at climbing the mountain]]. Aleister Crowley had been part of the team attempting the 1902 ascent of [[K2]]. The team reached an estimated altitude of {{convert|6500|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the southwest side of the mountain before turning back. The exact height reached is somewhat unclear; Crowley stated that on 31 August, "We were certainly over {{convert|21000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and possibly over {{convert|22000|ft|m|abbr=on}}", when the team was forced to retreat to Camp 5 by the risk of avalanche. On 1 September, they evidently went further; some members of the team, Reymond, Pache and Salama, "got over the bad patch" that had forced them to return to Camp 5 the day before, and progressed "out of sight and hearing" before returning to Crowley and the men with packs, who could not cross the dangerous section unassisted with their burdens. It is not clear how far Reymond, Pache and Salama had ascended&amp;nbsp;– but in summarizing, Crowley ventured "We had reached a height of approximately {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}." Attempting a "mutinous" late-in-the-day descent from Camp 5 to Camp 4, climber Alexis Pache (who earlier that day had been one of three to ascend possibly higher than any before), and three local porters, were killed in an avalanche. Despite the insistence of one of the men that "The demon of Kangchenjunga was propitiated with the sacrifice", Crowley decided enough was enough and that it was inappropriate to continue.&lt;ref name="crowley52"&gt;Crowley, A.; Symonds, J.; Grant, K. (1989). ''The confessions of Aleister Crowley: an autobiography'' [http://hermetic.com/crowley/confessions/chapter52.html Chapter 52] Arkana, London&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1907, two [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]]s set about climbing ''Jongri'' via the Kabru glacier to the south, an approach apparently rejected by Graham's party. Progress was very slow, partly because of problems with supplies and porters, and presumably also lack of fitness and acclimatisation. However, from a high camp at about {{convert|22600|ft|m|abbr=on}} they were eventually able to reach a point {{convert|50|or|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.&lt;ref name=Blaser2009/&gt;
* In 1929, the [[German people|German]] [[Paul Bauer (mountaineer)|Paul Bauer]] led an expedition team that reached {{convert|7400|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day [[storm]].&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;Bauer, P. (1955). ''Kangchenjunga Challenge''. William Kimber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 1929, the American E. F. Farmer left Darjeeling with native porters, crossed the Kang La into Nepal and climbed up towards the ''Talung Saddle''. When his porters refused to go any further, he climbed alone further upwards through drifting mists but did not return.&lt;ref name=Smythe/&gt;
* In 1930, [[Günter Dyhrenfurth]] led an international expedition comprising the German Uli Wieland, [[Austrian people|Austria]]n Erwin Schneider and [[English people|English]]man [[Frank Smythe]] who attempted to climb Kangchenjunga. They failed due to poor weather and snow conditions.&lt;ref name=Smythe/&gt;
* In 1931, Paul Bauer led a second German expedition team who attempted the northeast spur before being turned back by bad weather, illnesses, and deaths. The team retreated after climbing only a little higher than the 1929 attempt.&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt;
* In 1954, John Kempe led a party comprising J. W. Tucker, S. R. Jackson, G. C. Lewis, T. H. Braham and medical officer Dr. D. S. Mathews. They explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the south-west face of Kangchenjunga.&lt;ref&gt;Braham, T. H. (1955–56). [http://www.himalayanclub.org/journal/kangchenjunga-reconnaissance-1954/ ''Kangchenjunga Reconnaissance, 1954'']. The Himalayan Journal Volume 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Braham, T. H. (1996).

===First ascent===
[[File:Kangchenjunga Sign Board.jpg|thumb|A sign board on the last traversable road to Kangchenjunga]]
[[File:1990 reunion of the Kangchenjunga climbers.jpg|left|thumb|First ascent reunion of 1990– front (left to right): Neil Mather, [[John Angelo Jackson]], [[Charles Evans (mountaineer)|Charles Evans]] and [[Joe Brown (climber)|Joe Brown]] and rear (left to right): Tony Streather, [[Norman Hardie]], [[George Band]] and Professor John Clegg.]]
In 1955, [[Joe Brown (climber)|Joe Brown]] and [[George Band (climber)|George Band]] made the first ascent on 25 May, followed by [[Norman Hardie]] and [[Tony Streather]] on 26 May. The full team also included John Clegg (team doctor), [[Charles Evans (mountaineer)|Charles Evans]] (team leader), [[John Angelo Jackson]], Neil Mather, and Tom Mackinnon.

The ascent proved that [[Aleister Crowley]]'s 1905 route (also investigated by the 1954 reconnaissance) was viable. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}} high. The main feature of this face is the "Great Shelf", a large sloping plateau at around {{convert|7500|m|ft|-2}}, covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, [[glacier]], and one [[icefall]]; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May.&lt;ref name=Evans1956&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Evans, C.| author2 = Band, G.| title = Kangchenjunga Climbed| journal = The Geographical Journal | year = 1956 | volume = 122 | number = 1 | pages = 1–12 | doi=10.2307/1791469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The [[Goecha La]] trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous [[Zemu Glacier]]. The film [[Singalila in the Himalaya]] is journey around Kangchenjunga.

==In myth==
[[File:Five Treasures of Snow.jpg|thumb|Five Treasures of Snow]]
The area around Kangchenjunga is said to be home to a mountain deity, called ''Dzö-nga''&lt;ref&gt;Anna Belikci Denjongpa, ''[http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_2002_02_01.pdf Kangchendzönga: Secular and Buddhist perceptions of the mountain deity of Sikkim among the Lhopos]''&lt;/ref&gt; or "Kangchenjunga Demon", a type of [[yeti]] or [[rakshasa]]. A British geological expedition in 1925 spotted a bipedal creature which they asked the locals about, who referred to it as the "Kangchenjunga Demon".&lt;ref name=myfoxdfw/&gt;

For generations, there have been legends recounted by the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Mount Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the [[Lepcha people]], and those of the [[Buddhism in Tibet|Tibetan Buddhist]] cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as [[Beyul]] Demoshong. In 1962 a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong. The story of this expedition is recounted in the 2011 book ''A Step Away from Paradise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Step Away from Paradise|last=Shor|first=Thomas|publisher=City Lion Press|year=2017|isbn=9780999291894|location=USA|pages=|asin=B006TR0Y7W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[File:Kangchenjunga East Face from Zemu Glacier.jpg|thumb|East face of Kangchenjunga, from near the [[Zemu Glacier]], Sikkim]]
* In the [[Swallows and Amazons series|''Swallows and Amazons'' series]] of books by [[Arthur Ransome]], a high mountain (unnamed in the books, but clearly based on the [[Old Man of Coniston]] in the English [[Lake District]]) is given the name "Kanchenjunga"&lt;!-- note: Ransome spelled it without the first "g" --&gt; by the children when they climb it in 1931.
* In ''[[The Epic of Mount Everest]]'', first published in 1926, Sir [[Francis Younghusband]]: " For natural beauty Darjiling ([[Darjeeling]]) is surely unsurpassed in the world. From all countries travellers come there to see the famous view of Kangchenjunga, {{convert|28150|ft|m}} in height, and only {{convert|40|mi|km}} distant. Darjiling (Darjeeling) itself is {{convert|7000|ft|m}} above sea-level and is set in a forest of oaks, magnolia, [[rhododendron]]s, laurels and sycamores. And through these forests the observer looks down the steep mountain-sides to the Rangeet River only {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above sea-level, and then up and up through tier after tier of forest-clad ranges, each bathed in a haze of deeper and deeper purple, till the line of snow is reached; and then still up to the summit of Kangchenjunga, now so pure and ethereal we can scarcely believe it is part of the solid earth on which we stand; and so high it seems part of the very sky itself."
* In 1999, official [[James Bond]] author [[Raymond Benson]] published ''[[High Time to Kill]]''. In this story, a [[microdot]] containing a secret formula for aviation technology is stolen by a society called the Union. During their escape, their plane crashes on the slopes of Kangchenjunga and James Bond becomes part of a climbing expedition in order to retrieve the formula.
* ''[[The Inheritance of Loss]]'' by [[Kiran Desai]], which won the 2006 [[Man Booker Prize]], is set partly in [[Kalimpong]], a [[hill station]] situated near Kangchenjunga.
*In ''[[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]]'' by [[Yoshiki Tanaka]], which won the [[Seiun Award]] for "Best Novel of the Year" in 1988 and was adapted into an [[anime]] series by [[Kitty Films]], the capital and holiest temple of the Terraist Cult is on Earth beneath the rubble of Kangchenjunga.
*[[Michelle Paver]]'s 2016 ghost story ''Thin Air'' concerns a fictional expedition to climb Kangchenjunga in 1935, and an earlier (also fictional) expedition in 1906.
* The book ''Round Kangchenjunga – A Narrative of Mountain Travel and Exploration'' by [[Douglas Freshfield]] gives a complete account of his travel around Kangchenjunga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="624">'''King Shava''' was the adopted father of [[Bahuka]], as mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]]. 

He had multiple wives and mistresses, and according to folktale he had 1301 children.  He married his youngest wife after she was rejected by his son Bahuka.  He loved his youngest queen the most because they both had similar low, gruffy voices.  In some accounts they spoke with the same voice.
He stood eight feet tall and had multi-colored hair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3312">The Roman Catholic Church in [[Angola]] is composed of a Latin hierarchy only, which comprises three [[ecclesiastical province]]s, each headed by a Metropolitan Archbishop, and a total of fifteen [[suffragan]] dioceses.
 
Although exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the [[Holy See]]), the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of São Tomé and Príncipe|Diocese of São Tomé and Príncipe]], an Atlantic island country which shares a Portuguese colonial history (and linguistic legacy)with Angola, is part of the transnational [[Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé]], while neither has a national [[Episcopal Conference]].

Neither country has an Eastern Catholic or pre-diocesan jurisdiction.

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Angola (in national capital [[Luanda]]) as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level), into which is also vested the Apostolic Nunciature to São Tomé and Príncipe.

== Periodicals by circulation ==
The list of Adventist periodicals by circulation may give some indication of notability, but this criterion alone does not measure the impact of a magazine, and gift subscriptions and other freely distributed magazines might be expected to have an inflated circulation. As an example, one may assume that academic journals have more influence than their lower circulations suggest.

Items here are also listed by location below. Many older issues of these periodicals can be viewed online at the [http://www.adventistarchives.org/DocArchives.asp Adventist Archives]

{{Bahá'í texts sidebar}}

'''''Lawh-i-Anta'l-Kafi''''' or the '''''Long Healing Prayer''''' is a prayer written in Arabic by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the [[Bahá'u'lláh#`Akká|'Akká period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/rg/rg.leiden.html Writings of Bahá'u'lláh - Part Two: The Leiden List of Bahá'u'lláh's Tablets.]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorized English translation was done in 1980 by Habib Taherzadeh and a Committee at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]].

The main part of the prayer consists of numerous rhythmic invocations of [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]], each ending with the phrase ''"Thou the Sufficing, Thou the Healing, Thou the Abiding, O Thou Abiding One."''&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author = Hatcher, J.S. |year = 1997 |title = The Ocean of His Words: A Reader's Guide to the Art of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-259-7 |pages = 145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer ends with a supplication for healing and protection, and includes the phrase ''"protect the bearer of this blessed Tablet, and whoso reciteth it, and whoso cometh upon it, and whoso passeth around the house wherein it is. Heal Thou, then, by it every sick, diseased and poor one"'', which gives this prayer its [[talisman]]ic nature.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= talismans |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Norwegian composer [[Lasse Thoresen]] composed a piece of choral music for the Bergen International Music Festival in May 1996, in which the ''Long Healing Prayer'' was sung, first in the original Arabic and then in English.&lt;ref&gt;Bahai.org. ''[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-6-2-8.html Profiles: Lasse Thoresen, Norway]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Bahá'í healing prayers==
Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other healing prayers, including a prayer for women, one for infants, and  a well-known short prayer starting with the phrase ''"Thy Name is my healing"'', which is part of Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Lawh-i-Tibb]]'' (''Tablet to a Physician'').&lt;ref name="smith-tibb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Medicine, Tablet of |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">'''Mazdaznan''' is a [[Zoroastrianism|neo-Zoroastrian]] religion which held that the Earth should be restored to a garden where humanity can cooperate and converse with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religions of the World, Second Edition: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1-59884-204-3|page=1841|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C&amp;lpg=PA1841&amp;dq=Mazdaznan&amp;pg=PA1841#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|chapter=Mazdaznan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded at the end of the 19th century by [[Otoman Zar-Adusht Ha'nish]], born Otto Hanisch, the religion was a revival of 6th century [[Mazdakism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spencer|first=Colin|title=The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism|year=1996|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover, NH|isbn=978-0-87451-760-6|page=313|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIjZo-cvifAC&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;ots=1Z2rmfMiAT&amp;dq=Mazdaznanism&amp;pg=PA313#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents maintained [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diets and practiced breathing exercises. Concerned with the nature of thought, emotion and behavior, Mazdaznan taught that the practical aspects of personal health could be achieved through conscious breathing, "Gah-Llama". The word ''Mazdaznan'' is said to derive from the [[Persian language|Persian]] "Mazda" and "Znan", and is supposed to mean "master thought".&lt;ref name=furness&gt;{{cite book | last = Furness | first = Raymond | title = Zarathustra's Children: A Study of a Lost Generation of German Writers | publisher = Boydell &amp; Brewer | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-57113-057-8| page = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==

Although the movement originally consisted of public lectures and group exercise, popular demand made a book called ''The Power of Breath'' available. This book propelled Mazdaznan into being promoted as a dietary (vegetarian) movement with breathing, vowel and glandular exercises for physical, spiritual and mental development.

Its lack of lasting popularity can be attributed to the fact that besides emphasizing the importance of the individual decision, it proclaims personal responsibility for one's own fortune. Its success as a word of mouth movement that spawned similar groups can be attributed to its "tried and true" traditions of the way different physical postures and ways of breathing produce predictable and controllable mental states, which today recognized as a basic aspect of behavior in [[Behaviorism]], introduced by [[B.F. Skinner]].

The context of its relationship to Judeo-Christian and other religions can be deduced from its emphasis upon three historical characters: Ainyahita, [[Zarathustra]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jehoshua]]. Ainyahita, daughter of the divinely created couple (may be related to [[Anahita]]), lived 9000 years ago and is supposed to be the origin of the white [[Aryan]] race, which includes the Jews and therefore [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The traditional God character of most religions has its Mazdaznan  component in "Gah-Llama" which is referred to as "intelligence," and "In the air you breathe." ''The Power of Breath'' discusses Gah-Llama in breathing exercises, where the main goal is self-control and mastery of your body through, effectively, "breathing intelligently" and breathing "intelligence" or "Gah-Llama". It is in all respects a non-theistic tradition, in that all words for the unknown are recognized as linguistic and semantic peculiarities, with no rules except for suggestions for health, which are accompanied with a note that you know what's best for yourself.

== Movement ==
The first centers were established in Chicago in 1890 and New York in 1902. Since 1917, Hanisch settled mainly in  [[Los Angeles]], California. Several scholars brought his teachings to other countries.

In Europe, Mazdaznan was spread by the former Californian farmers David and Frieda Ammann beginning in about 1907. David Ammann was expelled from [[Leipzig, Germany]] in 1914 due to the publication of the book ''Inner Studies''. The main centre for Mazdaznan in Europe was the ''Lebensschule'' at [[Herrliberg]] near [[Zurich]]. One of the most famous European followers of the movement was the [[abstract painting|abstract painter]] [[Johannes Itten]], who taught at the [[Bauhaus]], who insisted on shaven heads, crimson robes and [[colonic irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Forgács| first = Éva | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Bauhaus Idea and Bauhaus Politics | publisher = [[Central European University Press]] | year = 1995 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-85866-012-2| page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cimino|first1=Eric|title=Student Life at the Bauhaus, 1919-1933|date=2003|publisher=M.A. Thesis, UMass-Boston, Chapter 3 ("Mysticism at the Bauhaus")|url=https://www.academia.edu/27783104/Student_Life_at_the_Bauhaus_1919-1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Gloria Gasque, a wealthy follower of the movement, went to [[Bombay]] intending to restore the "true" message of [[Zoroaster]] to the [[Parsi people|Parsis]]. Though met with hostility, she remained there for a number of years before she returned to the United States.

The [[Nazi]]s proscribed Mazdaznan from 1935, a ban that remained in Germany until 1946. Today the movement has several thousand German followers.

In 1980 Mazdaznan's headquarters moved to [[Encinitas, California]], and in 2001 the last manager of the headquarters disappeared and the organized movement ceased to exist in the US, though it is possible that there are still isolated followers or practitioners in the US.

In 2007, the movement was revived in Canada by Peter deBoer.

'''Melshanthi''' is the chief priest who performs day to day poojas in the [[Sabarimala]] [[Ayyappan]] temple.

The Thantris come from a specific family called the Thazhamon family. The [[Tantris]] of this family reside at [[Thazhamon Madom]]. This madom is in Chengannur of central [[Kerala]]. Apart from Sabarimala, the family presides over the poojas at [[Aryankavu]], [[Achankoil]] and [[Kulathupuzha]]. The Padi Pooja, Udayasthamana Pooja and Kalasa Poojas cannot be conducted unless the Thantri is present during the ceremony.

==Mode of selection==
The term of Melshanthi lasts for one year from mid October to the next mid October. The [[Devosom board]] {{Dead link|date = September 2013}}publishes notifications in the end of July or the first of August in leading newspapers for applications from eminent priests, well versed in Vedas and experienced in mantra and tantra. Those who have served already a term as Melshanthi cannot reapply.

The applicants are short listed by a preliminary interview by the members of the Devasom board. Out of the short listed candidates, one is selected by Lord's grace by a method which is just like a lucky dip. In this process the names of each shortlisted candidate is written on a piece of paper and folded and deposited in a pot. Another ten pieces of paper are taken and on one paper the word 'Melshanthi' is written and the remaining 9 papers are folded blank and dropped in another pot.

Both the pots are taken inside the shrine by Tantri and offered a special pooja. Later a child is made to take the papers from both the pots one by one. The child takes a paper each from both the pots. When a name and a blank paper match the candidate is rejected. When a name and the word 'melshanthi' matches the candidate is selected. This is the way a Melshanthi is selected for the poojas.

The '''moderator of the General Assembly''' is the [[Chair (official)|chairperson]] of a [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]], the highest court of a [[presbyterian]] or [[Reformed churches|reformed]] church. [[Kirk session]]s and [[presbytery (church polity)|presbyteries]] may also style the chairperson as moderator.

Presbyterian churches are ordered by a [[presbyterian polity]], including a hierarchy of councils or courts of elders, from the local church (kirk) Session through presbyteries (and perhaps synods) to a General Assembly.

The moderator presides over the meeting of the court, much as a [[convener]] presides over the meeting of a church committee.  The moderator is thus the chairperson, and is understood to be a member of the court acting ''[[primus inter pares]]''.  The moderator calls and constitutes meetings, presides at them, and closes them in prayer.  The moderator has a casting, but not a deliberative vote.  During a meeting, the title ''moderator'' is used by all other members of the court as a form of address, but this may not be continued outside the meetings.  Thus this convention expresses deference to the authority of the court rather than an honour for the moderator as an individual.

Many moderators act as ambassadors for their general assembly when it is not sitting, and visit many of the local churches in their denomination.

[[Image:Snowdrop Galanthus elwesii.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galanthus|Snowdrop]], perhaps the herb ''moly'']]
'''Moly''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|μῶλυ}}, {{IPA-el|môly|}}) is a magical herb mentioned in book 10 of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: Homer, ''Odyssey'', x. 302–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Greek Myth==
In the story the Odyssey, [[Hermes]] gave this herb to [[Odysseus]] to protect him from [[Circe]]'s wizardry when he went to her home to rescue his friends.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} These friends came together with him from the island Aiolos after they escaped from the Laestrigonians. 

According to the ''"New History"'' of [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] (according to [[Photius]]) the plant mentioned by Homer grew from the blood of the [[Gigas (mythology)|Giant]]  killed on [[Circe]]'s island, by [[Helios]] ally of Circe. In this description the flower was white, and a derivation of the name was given, from the "hard" (Greek ''malos'') combat with the Giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HELIUS : Greek Titan god of the sun | url = http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Homer also describes Moly by saying "The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call it Moly, Dangerous for a mortal man to pluck from the soil, but not for the deathless gods. All lies within their power".{{sfn|Homer|Butler|1898|loc=Book X}}

==Assignment to a real species==
There has been much controversy as to the identification. Philippe Champault decides in favour of the ''[[Peganum harmala]]'' (of the order Rutaceae),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: ''Phéniciens et Grecs en Italie d'après l'Odyssée'' (1906), pp.&amp;nbsp;504 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the Syrian or African rue (Greek {{lang|grc|πἠγανον}}), from the husks of which the vegetable alkaloid [[harmaline]] is extracted. The flowers are white with green stripes. Victor Bérard relying partly on a Semitic root,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: Victor Bérard ''Les Phéniciens et l'Odyssee'', ii. 288 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; prefers the ''[[Atriplex halimus]]'' (''atriplex'', a Latin form of Greek {{lang|grc|ἀτράφαξυς}}, and {{lang|grc|ἅλιμος}}, marine), order Chenopodiaceae, a herb or low shrub common on the south European coasts. These identifications are noticed by R. M. Henry,&lt;ref name=Chisholm-Henry&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: R. M. Henry ''Class. Rev.'' (Dec. 1906), p.&amp;nbsp;434.&lt;/ref&gt; who illustrates the Homeric account by passages in the Paris and Leiden [[magical papyri]], and argues that moly is probably a magical name, derived perhaps from Phoenician or Egyptian sources, for a plant which cannot be certainly identified. He shows that the "difficulty of pulling up" the plant is not a merely physical one, but rather connected with the peculiar powers claimed by magicians.&lt;ref name=Chisholm-Henry/&gt; 

Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to [[anticholinergic]] intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andreas Plaitakis &amp; Roger C. Duvoisin |title=Homer's moly identified as ''Galanthus nivalis'' L.: physiologic antidote to stramonium poisoning |journal=[[Clinical Neuropharmacology]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=1983 |pmid=6342763 |doi=10.1097/00002826-198303000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include [[amnesia]], [[hallucinations]], and [[delusions]] - this description of "moly" fits the [[snowdrop]], a [[flower]] of the region that contains [[galantamine]], which is an [[anticholinesterase]] and can therefore counteract anticholinergics.

==In other works==
*In [[Tennyson]]'s ''[[The Lotos-Eaters]]'', the moly is coupled with the [[amaranth]] ("propt on beds of amaranth and moly").{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}
*[[Carl Linnaeus]] referenced the mythical plant with ''[[Allium moly]]'', the scientific name for golden garlic, though the perianth of this species is yellow, not white.

{{Islam and iman}}

'''Muʾmin''' ({{lang-ar|مؤمن}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Islam]]ic term, frequently referenced in the [[Quran]], that literally means "believer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Mu'min|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=371|work=QTafsir.com|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and denotes a person who has complete submission to the Will of [[Allah]] and has faith firmly established in his heart, i.e. a "faithful Muslim". The term('''Mu'mina''') مومينه                                                                                                             is used to identify a female that has a higher degree of faith in Islam.

== In the Quran ==
The Quran states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;:([[An-Nisa]] {{cite quran|4|136|s=ns|b=n}}) O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him), and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-136/ Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 136 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This verse addresses the believers, exhorting them to believe, implying multiple stages of belief.

== Difference between Muslim and Mu'min / Mu'mina ==
In Islamic theology, there exists a significant difference between a [[Muslim]] and a Mu'min. A Muslim is a person who has come under the arena of Islam and believes its doctrines. A Mumin is a Muslim with higher degree of belief, with his/her heart having the fear of [[God in Islam|God]] and always abiding by the teachings of [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. I. Laliwala|title=Islamic Philosophy of Religion: Synthesis of Science Religion and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2Wz4HEoOgYC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=Mu'min%20believer&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=Mu'min%20believer&amp;f=false|isbn=8176254762|page=143-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;Thus, every Mumin is a Muslim but not every Muslim is a Mu'min.

The following verse makes a distinction between a Muslim and a '''believer''':
&lt;blockquote&gt;([[Al-Hujurat]] {{cite quran|49|14|s=ns|b=n}}) ''The Arabs of the desert say, "We believe." (tu/'''min'''oo) Say thou: Ye believe not; but rather say, "We profess Islam;" (a'''slam'''na) for the faith ([[Iman (concept)|al-'''iman'''u]]) hath not yet found its way into your hearts. But if ye obey God and His Apostle, He will not allow you to lose any of your actions, for God is Forgiving, Merciful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-49/verse-14/ The Holy Qu'ran, Al-Hujurat 49:014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Asuka period|Nara period|Historic Sites of Nara Prefecture}}
Nara Prefecture region is considered one of the oldest regions in Japan, having been in existence for thousands of years. The current form of Nara Prefecture was officially created in 1887 when it became independent of [[Osaka Prefecture]].

Historically, Nara Prefecture was also known as [[Yamato Province|Yamato-no-kuni]] or Yamato Province.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, "Yamato" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 1046|page=1046}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Up to Nara Period===
From the third century to the fourth century, a poorly documented political force existed at the foot of [[Mount Miwa]], east of Nara Basin.  It sought unification of most parts in Japan. Since the historical beginning of Japan, [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] was its political center.

Ancient capitals of Japan were built on the land of Nara, namely [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka-kyō]], [[Fujiwara-kyō]] (694–710)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/en/list/29/J84604/p/2/item/14924?sort=publish_date%253Ar|title=藤原宮大極殿院の調査(飛鳥藤原第182次)|last=奈良文化財研究所|first=|date=2014-11-08|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heijō-kyō]] (most of 710–784).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/291|title=出土品に見る奈良のやきものと暮らし|last=奈良市埋蔵文化財調査センター|first=|date=2009-11-02|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital cities of Fujiwara and Heijō are believed to have been modeled after Chinese capitals at the time, incorporating grid layout patterns. The royal court also established relations with [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and then [[Tang dynasty]] China and sent students to the Middle Kingdom to learn high civilization. By 7th century, Nara accepted the many immigrants including refugees of [[Baekje]] who had escaped from war disturbances of the southern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The first high civilization with royal patronage of [[Buddhism]] flourished in today's Nara city (710–784 AD).

===Nara in the Heian period===
[[File:Kofukuji12st5s3200.jpg|thumb|right|Kōfuku-ji]]

In 784, [[Emperor Kanmu]] decided to relocate the capital to [[Nagaoka-kyō]] in [[Yamashiro Province]], followed by another move in 794 to [[Heian-kyō]],  marking the start of the [[Heian period]]. The temples in Nara remained powerful beyond the move of political capital, thus giving Nara a synonym of "Nanto" (meaning "South Capital") as opposed to Heian-kyō, situated in the north. Close to the end of Heian period, [[Taira no Shigehira]], a son of [[Taira no Kiyomori]], was ordered by his father to depress the power of various parties, mainly [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Tōdai-ji]], who were backing up an opposition group headed by [[Prince Mochihito]]. The movement led to a collision between the [[Taira clan|Taira]] and the Nara temples in 1180. This clash eventually led to [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Tōdai-ji]] being set on fire, resulting in vast destruction of architectural heritage.

===Medieval Nara===
[[File:Kouyou of Yoshinoyama.JPG|thumb|right|The red autumn leaves in Yoshino]]

At the rise of the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] to its ruling seat and the opening of [[Kamakura shogunate]], Nara enjoyed the support of [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] toward restoration. [[Kōfuku-ji]], being the "home temple" to the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] since its foundation, not only regained the power it had before but became a ''de facto'' regional chief of Yamato Province. With the reconstruction of [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Tōdai-ji]], a town was growing again near the two temples.

The [[Nanboku-chō period]], starting in 1336, brought more instability to Nara. As [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] chose [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]] as his base, a power struggle arose in Kōfuku-ji with a group supporting the South and another siding the North court. Likewise, local clans were split into two. Kōfuku-ji recovered its control over the province for a short time at the surrender of the South Court in 1392, while the internal power game of the temple itself opened a way for the local samurai clans to spring up and fight with each other, gradually acquiring their own territories, thus diminishing the influence of Kōfuku-ji overall.

===The Sengoku and Edo periods to present===
[[File:Koriyama Castle Nara-b.jpg|thumb|The restored turret of [[Kōriyama Castle (Nara Prefecture)|Kōriyama Castle]]]]

Later, the whole province of Yamato got drawn into the confusion of the [[Sengoku period]]. Tōdai-ji was once again set on fire in 1567, when [[Matsunaga Hisahide]], who was later appointed by [[Oda Nobunaga]] to the lord of Yamato Province, fought for supremacy against his former master [[Miyoshi clan|Miyoshi family]]. Followed by short appointments of [[Tsutsui Junkei]] and [[Toyotomi Hidenaga]] by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] to the lord, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] ultimately ruled the city of Nara directly, and most parts of Yamato province with a few feudal lords allocated at [[Yamatokōriyama|Kōriyama]], [[Takatori, Nara|Takatori]] and other places. With industry and commerce developing in the 18th century, the economy of the province was incorporated into prosperous [[Osaka]], the commercial capital of Japan at the time.

The economic dependency to Osaka even characterizes today's Nara Prefecture, for many inhabitants commute to Osaka to work or study there.

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Nara Prefecture Ja.svg|thumb|Map of Nara Prefecture{{brk}}{{legend0|#EAB|City}} {{legend0|#ED9|Town}} {{legend0|#BFE|Village}}]]

Nara Prefecture is part of the [[Kansai]], or Kinki, region of Japan, and is located in the middle of the [[Kii Peninsula]] on the western half of [[Honshu]]. Nara Prefecture is landlocked. It is bordered to the west by [[Wakayama Prefecture]] and [[Osaka Prefecture]]; on the north by [[Kyoto Prefecture]] and on the east by [[Mie Prefecture]].

Nara Prefecture is 78.5&amp;nbsp;km from east to west and 103.6&amp;nbsp;km from north to south.

Most of the prefecture is covered by mountains and forests, leaving an inhabitable area of only 851&amp;nbsp;km². The ratio of inhabitable area to total area is 23%, ranked 43rd among the 47 prefectures in Japan.&lt;ref name="100indices"&gt;{{cite web|title=奈良県統計情報 "100の指標" ("100 Indices of Nara" by Nara Statistics Division, Nara Prefecture)|language=Japanese|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/index.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nara Prefecture is bisected by the [[Japan Median Tectonic Line]] (MTL) running through its territory east to west, along the [[Kinokawa River|Yoshino River]]. On the northern side of the MTL is the so-called Inner Zone, where active [[Geologic fault|faults]] running north to south are still shaping the landscape. The Ikoma Mountains in the northwest form the border with Osaka Prefecture. The Nara Basin, which lies to the east of these mountains, contains the highest concentration of population in Nara Prefecture. Further east are the Kasagi Mountains, which separate the Basin from the Yamato Highlands.

South of the MTL is the Outer Zone, comprising the Kii Mountains, which occupy about 60% of the land area of the prefecture. The Ōmine Range is in the center of the Kii Mountains, running north to south, with steep valleys on both sides. The tallest mountain in Nara Prefecture, and indeed in the Kansai region, is [[Mount Hakkyō]]. To the west, separating Nara Prefecture from Wakayama Prefecture, is the Obako Range, with peaks around 1,300 metres. To the east, bordering Mie Prefecture, is the Daikō Range, including [[Odaigahara-san|Mount Ōdaigahara]]. This mountainous region is also home to a [[World Heritage Site]], the [[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]]".

About 17% of the total land area of the prefecture is designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|National Park]] land, comprising the [[Yoshino-Kumano National Park]], [[Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen Quasi-National Park|Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen]], [[Kōya-Ryūjin Quasi-National Park|Kōya-Ryūjin]], [[Murō-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park|Murō-Akame-Aoyama]], and [[Yamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park|Yamato-Aogaki]] Quasi-National Parks; and the [[Tsukigase-Kōnoyama Prefectural Natural Park|Tsukigase-Kōnoyama]], [[Yata Prefectural Natural Park|Yata]], and [[Yoshinogawa-Tsuboro Prefectural Natural Park|Yoshinogawa-Tsuboro]] Prefectural Natural Parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Tanzan jinja05s3200.jpg|thumb|[[Tanzan Shrine]] in autumn]]

In the Nara Basin, the climate has inland characteristics, as represented in the bigger temperature variance within the same day, and the difference of summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average about 3 to 5°C, and 25 – 28°C in the summer with highest reaching close to 35°C.  There is not a single year over the last decade (since 1990, up to 2007) with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.

The climate in the rest of the prefecture are mountainous, and especially in the south, with below −5°C being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall ranges as much as 3000 to 5000&amp;nbsp;mm, which is among the heaviest in Japan.

Spring and fall are temperate. The mountainous region of [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]] has been popular both historically and presently for its [[cherry]] blossoms in the spring. In the fall, the southern mountains are equally striking with the changing of the [[oak]] trees.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

According to the 2005 Census of Japan, Nara Prefecture has a population of 1,421,310, which is a decrease of 1.5%, since the year 2000.&lt;ref name="censusnara"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Census 2005|language=Japanese|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/chousa_shoukai/h17kokusei/index.html |accessdate = 2007-04-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415201002/http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/chousa_shoukai/h17kokusei/index.html |archivedate = April 15, 2008}} (Including official amendment of March 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline continued in 2006, with another decrease of 4,987 people compared to 2005. This includes a natural decrease from previous year of 288 people (11,404 births minus 11,692 deaths) and a decrease due to net domestic migration of 4,627 people outbound from the prefecture, and a decrease of 72 registered foreigners. Net domestic migration has turned into a continuous outbound trend since 1998. The largest destinations of migration in 2005 were the prefectures of Kyoto, Tokyo, and Hyōgo, with respectively a net of 1,130,982 and 451 people moving over. The largest inbound migration was from [[Niigata Prefecture]], contributing to a net increase of 39 people. 13.7% of its population were reported as under 15, 65.9% between 15 and 64, and 20.4% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 52.5% of the population.&lt;ref name="popnara"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Statistics of Nara Prefecture 2006|language=Japanese|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/group/jinkou/jinkou.htm |accessdate= 2007-04-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118064416/http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/group/jinkou/jinkou.htm |archivedate = January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, the average density of the prefecture is 387 people per km². By districts,&lt;ref&gt;Defined by Nara Prefecture for the convenience of statistical analysis. See [http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro-e/toukei/zu1.html "Population of each district"] for 2005 figures.&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called Yamato flat inland plain holds as much as about 90% of total population within the approximately 23% size of area in the north-west, including the Nara
Basin, representing a density of 1,531 people per km². To the contrast, the combined district [[Gojō, Nara|Gojō]] and [[Yoshino District, Nara|Yoshino District]] occupies almost 64% of the land, while only 6% of people lives there, resulting in a density of 39 people km².

Nara prefecture had the highest rate in Japan of people commuting outbound for work, at 30.9% in 2000. A similar tendency is seen in prefectures such as [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], and [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]], all three of them having over 20% of people commuting for other prefectures.&lt;ref name="100indices"/&gt;

==Politics==
* A governor and members of prefectural assembly is elected by citizens in accordance with the [[Local Autonomy Law]].
* As of 2007, there are 44 seats in the Nara Prefectural Assembly, voted through 16 electoral blocks.
* There was a clear tendency seen through the results of Lower House election in 2005, that the younger generation executes its voting right much less compared to the older. Only 48.8% of citizens age 20–29 voted, whereas all older generations (grouped by decades) votes more than its younger, reaching the highest voting rate of 86.3% at ages 60–69. The only exception was the 72.1% voting right executed by citizens of 70 or older. The overall average of the prefecture who voted was yet higher, at 70.3%, than that of nationwide average, 67.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''tōhyō ritsu no sui'i'' (投票率の推移 Evolution in voting rate, Nara Prefecture|language=Japanese|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/senkan/contents/tohyoritsu.htm |accessdate = 2007-04-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612055657/http://www.pref.nara.jp/senkan/contents/tohyoritsu.htm |archivedate = June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Nara brush.jpg|thumb|A huge Nara calligraphy brush]]

The 2004 total gross prefecture product (GPP) for Nara was ¥3.8 trillion, an 0.1% growth over previous year. The per capita income was ¥2.6 million, which is a 1.3% decrease from previous year. The 2004 total gross prefecture product (GPP) for Nara was ¥3.8 trillion, an 0.1% growth over previous year. Manufacturing has the biggest share in the GPP of Nara with 20.2% of share, followed by services (19.1%) and real estates (16.3%). The share of agriculture including forestry and fishery was a mere 1.0%, only above mining, which is quasi-inexistent in Nara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/group/kikaku/kenmin.htm |title=奈良県民経済計算 (''Nara kenmin keizai keisan'' Nara Prefectural Economy) |accessdate=2007-03-28 |date=April 9, 2002 |work=Nara Prefecture |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314160140/http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/group/kikaku/kenmin.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 14, 2007}} English page with much less details are available [http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro-e/toukei/index.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tourism is treated by the prefectural government as one of the most important features of Nara, because of its natural environment and historical significance.
* Nara is famed for its [[persimmon|Kaki persimmon]]. [[Strawberry]] and tea are some other popular products of the prefecture, while rice and vegetables, including spinach, tomato, eggplants, and others are the dominant in terms of amount of production.
* Nara is a center for the production of instruments used in conducting traditional Japanese artforms.  Brush and ink (''sumi'') are the best known products from Nara for [[calligraphy]].  Wooden or bamboo instruments, especially from Takayama area (in Ikoma city) are famous products for [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]].
* [[Goldfish]] from [[Yamatokōriyama]] in Nara have been a traditional aquacultural product since the 18th century.
* Due to its rich history, Nara is also the location of many archeological digs, with many famous ones being located in the [[Villages of Japan|village]] of [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]].

==Culture==
[[File:NaraTodaijiStatue0214.jpg|thumb|Statue at Tōdai-ji]]
The culture of Nara is tied to the Kansai region in which it is located. However, like each of the other prefectures of Kansai, Nara has unique aspects to its culture, parts of which stem from its long history dating back to the Nara period.

===Dialect===
There are large differences in dialect between the north/central region of the prefecture, where Nara city is located, and the Okunoya district in the south. The north/central dialect is close to Osaka's dialect, whilst Okunoya's dialect favours a Tokyo-style accent. The lengthening of vowels sounds in the Okunoya dialect is not seen in other dialects of the [[Kinki region]], making it a special feature.

===Food culture===
Foods particular to Nara Prefecture include:
*[[Kasuzuke|Narazuke]], a method of pickling vegetables
*Miwa [[sōmen]], a type of wheat noodle
*[[Chagayu]], a [[rice congee|rice porridge]] made with green tea
*[[Kakinoha zushi]], sushi wrapped in [[persimmon]] leaves
*[[Meharizushi]], rice balls wrapped in pickled ''[[Brassica juncea|takana]]'' leaves

==Tourism==
Many [[Jinja (shrine)|jinja]] (Shinto shrines), Buddhist temples, and [[kofun]] exist in Nara Prefecture, making it is a centre for tourism. Moreover, many [[world heritage]] sites, such as the temple [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kasuga Shrine]], exist in the capital city of Nara.  &lt;!--Although there is also world heritage always open, there is world heritage which is temporarily exhibited by a limited time offer. The festival (matsuri) in connection with a temple and its area is performed.--&gt; &lt;!--I commented out two sentences that need to be rewritten.  I can't figure out if the second (festival) sentence is related to the first (limited time) here or not.  Either way, they may be more appropriate for the travel wiki than the encyclopedia--&gt;

'''''Nelumbo nucifera''''', also known as '''Indian lotus''', '''sacred lotus''', '''bean of India''', '''Egyptian bean''' or simply '''lotus''', is one of two [[extant taxon|extant]] species of aquatic plant in the [[Family (Biology)|family]] [[Nelumbonaceae]]. It is often colloquially called a water lily. Under favorable circumstances the seeds of this aquatic perennial may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300&amp;nbsp;years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.89.2.236 | title = Long-living lotus: Germination and soil  -irradiation of centuries-old fruits, and cultivation, growth, and phenotypic abnormalities of offspring | year = 2002 | last1 = Shen-Miller | first1 = J. | last2 = Schopf | first2 = J.

It has a very wide native distribution, ranging from central and northern [[India]] (at altitudes up to {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} in the southern [[Himalaya]]s&lt;ref name=Mukherjee2010&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Pulok K.

==Classification==
{{See also|Nelumbo}}
The lotus is often confused with the water lilies (''[[Nymphaea]]'', in particular ''[[Nymphaea caerulea]]'' "blue lotus"). In fact, several older systems, such as the [[Bentham &amp; Hooker system]] (which is widely used in the [[Indian subcontinent]]) refer to the lotus by its old synonym of ''Nymphaea nelumbo''. This is, however, taxonomically incorrect. Far from being in the same family, ''Nymphaea'' and ''Nelumbo'' are members of different orders ([[Nymphaeales]] and [[Proteales]], respectively).

While all modern [[plant taxonomy]] systems agree that this species belongs in the genus ''[[Nelumbo]]'', the systems disagree as to which family ''Nelumbo'' should be placed in, or whether the genus should belong in its own unique family and order.  According to the [[APG IV]] system, ''N. nucifera'', ''[[Nelumbo lutea|N. lutea]]'', and their extinct relatives in Proteales with the [[Proteaceae|protea flowers]]&lt;ref name=APGIV&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|year=2016|title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG IV|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=181|issue=1|pages=1–20|issn=0024-4074|doi=10.1111/boj.12385}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to genetic comparisons.  Older systems, such as the [[Cronquist system]], place ''N. nucifera'' and its relatives in the order Nymphaeles based on anatomical similarities.&lt;ref name=cronquist&gt;[http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/newgate/cron1ang.htm Texas A and M University Bioinformatics Working Group : Cronquist System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botany==
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera1romainguy.jpg|200px|thumb|Lotus plant|alt=|left]] [[File:Lotus flower core - carpellary receptacle 09.jpg|thumb|[[Carpel]]lary [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] of Lotus]]
The roots of ''lotus'' are planted in the soil of the pond or river bottom, while the leaves float on top of the water surface or are held well above it. The flowers are usually found on thick stems rising several centimeters above the leaves. The plant normally grows up to a height of about 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a horizontal spread of up to 3&amp;nbsp;meters, but some unverified reports place the height as high as over 5&amp;nbsp;meters. The leaves may be as large as 60&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, while the showy flowers can be up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.

Researchers report that the lotus has the remarkable ability to [[Thermogenic plants|regulate]] the [[temperature]] of its [[flower]]s to within a narrow range just as humans and other [[warmblooded]] animals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Yoon, Carol Kaesuk|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E4D7113CF932A35753C1A960958260 |title=Heat of Lotus Attracts Insects And Scientists |publisher=New York Times |date=1996-10-01 |accessdate=2012-11-14|newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger S. Seymour and Paul Schultze-Motel, physiologists at the [[University of Adelaide]] in [[Australia]], found that lotus flowers blooming in the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]]s maintained a temperature of {{convert|30|–|35|°C|°F}}, even when the air temperature dropped to {{convert|10|°C|°F}}. They suspect the flowers may be doing this to attract [[Ectotherm|coldblooded]] [[insect]] [[pollinators]]. Studies published in the journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences]]'' were in 1996 and 1998 important contributions in the field of [[thermoregulation]], heat-producing, in plants. Two other species known to be able to regulate their temperature include ''[[Symplocarpus foetidus]]'' and ''[[Philodendron selloum]]''.

An individual lotus can live for over a thousand years and has the rare ability to [[Suspended animation|revive]] into activity after [[Stasis (medicine)|stasis]]. In 1994, a seed from a sacred lotus, dated at roughly 1,300 years old ± 270 years, was successfully [[germinated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2445863|author=Shen-Miller |year=1995|last2=Mudgett|first2=M.

An ≈1300-yr-old lotus fruit, recovered from an originally cultivated but now dry lakebed in northeastern China, is the oldest germinated and directly 14C-dated fruit known. In 1996, we traveled to the dry lake at Xipaozi Village, China, the source of the old viable fruits. |journal=[[American Journal of Botany]] |year=2002 |pmid=21669732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Sacred Lotus is only distantly related to ''Nymphaea caerulea'', but possesses similar chemistry.  Both ''[[Nymphaea caerulea]]'' and ''Nelumbo nucifera'' contain the alkaloids [[nuciferine]] and [[aporphine]].

The [[genome]] of the sacred lotus was sequenced in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ming | first1 = Ray | last2 = VanBuren | first2 = Robert | last3 = Liu | first3 = Yanling | last4 = Yang | first4 = Mei | last5 = Han | first5 = Yuepeng | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Genome of the long-living sacred lotus (''Nelumbo nucifera'' Gaertn.) | url = | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 5| page = R41 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r41 | pmid = 23663246 | pmc = 4053705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sacred Lotus Genome Sequence Enlightens Scientists |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130510180252.htm |newspaper=Science Daily |date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists sequence genome of 'sacred lotus,' which likely holds anti-aging secrets |author=Wolpert, Stuart |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/scientists-sequence-genome-of-245577.aspx |newspaper=UCLA Newsroom |date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
The Sacred Lotus grows in water up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. The minimum water depth should not be lower than {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. In colder climates such a low water level, which heats up more quickly, is helpful for better growth and [[flower]]ing.

First step of the cultivation is to [[plough]] the dry field. One round of [[manure]] is applied after ten days, before flooding the field. To support a quick initial growth, the water level is hold relatively low&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and is increased when plants grow. Then a maximum of approximately 4000 rhizome pieces per [[hectare]] (10000 per acre)&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; are used to plant directly into the [[mud]] {{convert|10–15|cm|abbr=on}} below the [[Topsoil|soil surface]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Root crops|last=E.)|first=Kay, D.

=== Harvest ===
[[File:LotusBud0048a.jpg|200px|thumb|Lotus bud]]
[[File:A budding lotus flower.jpg|200px|thumb| Lotus bud in advanced stage of bloom]]

The [[stolon]] is ready to harvest two to three months after planting. It must be harvested before the flowering. Harvesting the stolon is done by manual labour, too. For this step, the field is not drained. By pulling and shaking the young leaves in the shallow water, the stolon is pulled out of the water.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Three months after planting, the first [[Leaf|leaves]] and flowers can be harvested. Flowers can be picked every two days during summer and every three days during the colder season. Four months after planting, the production of flowers has its climax. The harvest of flowers is usually done by hand during three to four months.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Seeds and seed pods can be harvested when they turn black four to eight months after planting. After [[Food drying|sun drying]] for two to three days, they are processed by mechanical tools to separate seed coats and embryos.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The rhizomes mature to a suitable stage for eating in approximately six to nine months.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Early varieties are harvested in July until September and late varieties from October until March, after the ponds or fields are drained.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of herbs &amp; their uses|last=Deni.|first=Bown,|date=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|others=Herb Society of America.|isbn=978-0789401847|edition=1st American|location=London|oclc=32166152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large, [[starch]] rich rhizomes are easy to dig out of the drained soil.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In small scale production, they are harvested by hand using fork like tools.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Japan and on bigger farms the manual labour harvesting is fully replaced by machines.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Varieties and cultivars ===
Lotus [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] have been classified according to their use into three types: [[rhizome]] lotus, seed lotus and flower lotus. Varieties that show more than one of these characteristics are classified by the strongest feature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Regarding production area in [[China]], rhizome lotus has the largest area with {{convert|200000|ha|abbr=on}}, followed by seed lotus with {{convert|20000|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=H. B.|date=2009-05-01|title=Cultivation of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. ssp. nucifera) and its utilization in China|journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution|language=en|volume=56|issue=3|pages=323–330|doi=10.1007/s10722-008-9366-2|issn=0925-9864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rhizome lotus ====
Rhizome lotus cultivars produce higher yield of and better quality rhizomes than seed and flower lotus. Furthermore, this group grows the tallest and produces no or very few flowers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

[[Cultivar]]s can be classified by harvest time or by the depth of rhizomes into these types:
* Pre-mature (early) cultivars are harvested before the end of July, serotinous (late) cultivars from September on and mid-serotinous or mid-matutinal cultivars are in between these harvest times. Using pre-mature cultivars, rhizomes can be harvested earlier and therefore be sold for a higher price.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Ad littoral, deep, and intermediate cultivars are distinguished according to the depth in which the rhizomes grow underground. Adlittoral cultivars range from {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} depth and are often pre-mature. They develop faster due to higher temperature in surface soil layers. When harvested in July, adlittorals have higher yields than deeper growing cultivars, but not necessarily when harvested in September. Rhizomes of adlittoral cultivars are crisp and good for [[frying]] purposes. Deep cultivars grow more than {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} deep. They are often serotinous and can harvest high yield. Their rhizomes are [[starch]]-rich.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
The main popular ''Nelumbo nucifera'' cultivars in China are Elian 1, Elian 4, Elian 5, 9217, Xin 1 and 00–01. Average yield of these cultivars is 7.5–15 t/ha (3.3-6.7 tons/acre) of harvest in July and 30–45 t/ha (13-20 tons/acre) of harvest in September.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Australia, the cultivar grown for the fresh rhizome market is Quangdong and in Japan the common rhizome cultivars are Tenno and Bitchu.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Seed lotus ====
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera5.jpg|200px|thumb|''Nelumbo nucifera'' seed head]]
The characteristics of seed lotus cultivars are a large number of [[Gynoecium|carpels]] and seed sets as well as large seeds with better nutritional properties. Roots of these varieties are thin, fibrous and do not form good rhizomes.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The main popular cultivars for seed production in China are Cunsanlian, Xianglian 1, Zilian 2, Jianlian, Ganlian 62 and Taikong 36. Average yield of these cultivars in China is 1.05–1.9 t/ha (0.5–0.8 tons/acre) of dry seeds and weight of thousand seeds between {{convert|1020|to|1800|g|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Green Jade and Vietnam-Red are recommended cultivars for seed production in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Flower lotus ====
Flower lotus cultivars are used exclusively for [[Ornamental plant|ornamental purpose]], produce a large number of flowers and the lowest plant height.

&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Seed production of flower lotus is poor regarding yield and quality. Flower types differ in the number of [[petal]]s (single petals, double petals or multi-petals) and their colours range from single colour in white, yellow, pink, red to bi-colour, most often of white petals with pink tip or highlights.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Farming ===
About 70% of  lotus for the human consumption is produced in China. In 2005, the cultivation area in China was estimated at {{convert|300000|ha}}.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A majority of lotus production takes place in managed farming systems in ponds or flooded fields like [[rice]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The most widely used system is [[crop rotation]] with rice and [[vegetable]]s. This system is applicable if the [[propagule]] (small piece of rhizome) can be planted early in the year. The rhizomes are harvested in July, after which rice can be planted into the same field.  Rice is then harvested in October. From November until March, the field stays either free, or a [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] vegetable such as cabbage or spinach, is planted. Alternatively, the vegetable can also be planted after the [[harvest]] of lotus.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Another alternative way is to not harvest the lotus [[rhizome]], although it is ripe. A terricolous vegetable is planted between the rhizomes into the [[Drainage|drained field]]. The rhizomes are then harvested next March.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A third way is to plant lotus in ponds or fields and raise aquatic animals such as [[fish]], [[shrimp]] or [[crab]] in the same field.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A more efficient use of the water for both, the [[aquatic animal]] and the lotus production, has been identified with this planting pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assessing lotus for wastewater bioremediation|date=2009|publisher=Rural Industries Research and Development Corp|others=Seymour, Evizel., Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (Australia)|isbn=978-1741518887|location=Canberra|oclc=682913738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human consumption ===
==== Rhizome consumption ====
[[File:Lotus root.jpg|thumb|Lotus [[rhizomes]]|alt=|left]]
[[File:JaRenkonLotus11R.jpg|thumb|Boiled, sliced lotus roots used in various Asian cuisines]]The rhizomes of lotus are called ''ǒu'' ([[wikt:藕|藕]]) in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], ''ngau'' in [[Cantonese]],  ''yeongeun'' (연근) in [[Korean language|Korean]], ''renkon'' ([[:Ja:レンコン|レンコン]], [[:Ja:蓮根|蓮根]]) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]],  ''thambou'' in [[Meitei language|Meitei]], ''kamal kakri'' in [[Hindi]], "Behh" in Sindhi and ''Nelum Ala'' (නෙළුම් අල) in [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]].

They are consumed as a vegetable in Asian countries, extensively in China and Japan: sold whole or in cut pieces, fresh, frozen, or canned. They are fried or cooked mostly in soups, soaked in syrup or [[Pickling|pickled]] in vinegar (with sugar, chili and garlic).&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;YU, Xin, et al. "Progress in the Research on Post-harvest Physiology and Storage Techniques of Nelumbo nucifera gaertn [J]."&amp;nbsp;''Guangzhou Food Science and Technology''&amp;nbsp;3 (2002): 019.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Tian, N., et al. "Isolation and preparation of flavonoids from the leaves of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn by preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography."&amp;nbsp;''Se pu= Chinese journal of chromatography''&amp;nbsp;25.1 (2007): 88-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Lotus rhizomes have a crunchy texture with sweet-tangy flavours and are a classic dish at many banquets where they are deep-fried, stir-fried, or stuffed with meats or preserved fruits.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Salads with [[prawn]]s, [[sesame oil]] or [[coriander]] leaves are also popular. Unfortunately, fresh lotus root slices are limited by a fast browning rate.&lt;ref&gt;X. Su, Y. Jiang, Y. Li, W. Lin. Effects of 4-hexylresorcinol (4-HR) on browning and quality of fresh-cut lotus. Food Science, 24 (2003), pp. 142-145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.A.&amp;nbsp;Rojas-Graüa,&amp;nbsp;M.S.&amp;nbsp;Tapiab,&amp;nbsp;O.&amp;nbsp;Martín-Bellosoa.

LWT Food Science and Technology,&amp;nbsp;41&amp;nbsp;(2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;139-147&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lotus root tea]] is consumed in [[Korea]].

Japan is one of the primary users of the rhizomes, representing about 1% of all vegetables consumed. Japan grows its own lotus but still must import 18,000 tons of lotus rhizome each year, of which China provides 15,000 tons yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, T., and Nohara, S. 1989. Growth and life span of the leaves of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. in lake Kasumigaura, Japan. Aquatic botany, 36(1): 87-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhizomes contain high amounts of [[starch]] (31.2%) without characteristic taste or odor. The texture is comparable to a raw potato.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee PK.&amp;nbsp;et al.&amp;nbsp;Isolation, estimation and characterization of starch from rhizomes of&amp;nbsp;Nelumbo nuciferaGaertn (Fam.

==== Pip consumption ====
[[Lotus pip tea]] is consumed in Korea.

==== Seed  consumption ====
[[File:Lotus fruit seeds.jpg|thumb|Fresh lotus seeds ready to eat]]Fresh lotus seeds ({{zh|s=[[wikt:鲜|鲜]] [[wikt:莲子|莲子]]|t=[[wikt:鮮|鮮]] [[wikt:蓮子|蓮子]]|p=xiān liánzĭ|cy=sīn lìhnjí}}) are nutritious but also vulnerable to [[Food contaminant|microbial contamination]], especially fungal infections. Therefore, mostly dry lotus seed-based products are found on the market. Traditional sun baking combining with charcoal processing dries the seeds but results in loss of nutrients. [[Freeze-drying|Freeze-dried]] lotus seeds have a longer [[shelf life]] and maintain original nutrients&amp;nbsp;, while no differences in flavour is found after rehydration compared to fresh lotus seeds.&lt;ref&gt;He J, Cheng W, Chen X, Wen S, Zhang G, Xiong G, Ye L, Chen Y (2006) Study on the vacuum sublimation freezing-drying of lotus seeds. Hubei Agric Sci 45:240–244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tian Y, Zhang Y, Zeng S, Zheng Y, Chen F, Guo Z, Lin Y, Zheng B (2012b) Optimization of microwave vacuum drying of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) seeds by response surface methodology. Food Sci Technol Int 18:477–488&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry stored lotus seeds are sensitive to moisture and [[Mold|mold infestation]]; researchers continue to explore new ways to preserve fresh lotus seeds&amp;nbsp;for example [[radiation]] processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhat|first1=R|last2=Sridhar|first2=KR|last3=Karim|first3=AA|last4=Young|first4=CC|last5=Arun|first5=AB|year=2009|title=Influence of c-radiation on the nutritional and functional qualities of lotus seed flour|url=|journal=J Agric Food Chem|volume=57|issue=20|pages=9524–9531|doi=10.1021/jf902287e|pmid=19778060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lotus seeds can be processed into [[Mooncake|moon cake]], lotus seed noodles and food in forms of [[Lotus seed paste|paste]], fermented milk, rice wine, ice cream, popcorn (phool makhana) and others, with lotus seeds as the main raw material. Fresh lotus seed wine has thirst quenching, spleen healing and anti-diarrheal advantages after drinking.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; [[Lotus seed tea]] is consumed in Korea, and [[lotus embryo tea]] is consumed in [[China]] and [[Vietnam]].

There is still much potential for research and development, mainly reflected in the extraction, separation and purification of lotus seed nutrients and bioactive compounds.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Stem  consumption ====
Young lotus [[Plant stem|stems]] are used as a salad ingredient in [[Vietnamese cuisine]].

In South Indian states, the lotus stem is sliced, marinated with salt to dry, and the dried slices are fried and used as a side dish. In Kerala (in Malayalam "താമര") and Tamil Nadu, this end product is called " Thamara Vathal".

==== Leaf consumption ====
In [[Korea]], [[Lotus tea#lotus leaf tea|lotus leaf tea]] (연잎차 ''yeonipcha'') is made from the leaves of the lotus.

==== Flower consumption ====
[[File:Yeonkkot-cha.jpg|thumb|[[Lotus flower tea]]]]
In [[Korea]], [[lotus flower tea]] (연꽃차 ''yeonkkotcha'') is made from the dried petals of the white lotus.

The [[stamen]]s can be dried and made into a fragrant [[herbal tea]] ({{zh|t=[[wikt:蓮花|蓮花]] [[wikt:茶|茶]]|p=liánhuā cha|cy=lìhnfāa chah}}), or used to impart a scent to [[tea]] leaves (particularly in [[Vietnam]]). This [[Vietnamese lotus tea]] is called ''trà sen'', ''chè sen'', or ''chè ướp sen''.

==== Risks of consumption ====
The petals, leaves and [[rhizome]] can also all be eaten raw, but there is a risk of parasite transmission (e.g., ''[[Fasciolopsis buski]]''): it is therefore recommended that they be cooked before eating.

=== Use in water treatment ===

This suppresses [[algae]] growth in ''N. nucifera'' aquatic systems and thus, the oxygen content is up to 20% higher than in other aquatic plant systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to intense agricultural practices, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are major problems in aquatic systems. ''N. nucifera'' is able to assimilate a higher content of phosphorus than aquatic plants currently used for water remediation (such as [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]]). It also assimilates nitrogen ("[[denitrification]]") and creates a habitat for bacterial growth in the water body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through [[rhizofiltration]] heavy metals – including arsenic, copper and cadmium – can be removed efficiently from the water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The results observed are impressive showing 96% of copper and 85% cadmium metals removed after a seven-day [[incubation period]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Virendra Mishra|date=2009|title=Accumulation of Cadmium and Copper from Aqueous Solutions using Indian Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera)|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|volume=38|issue=2|pages=110–112|doi=10.1579/0044-7447-38.2.110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of heavy metals doesn't show morphological symptoms of metal toxicity;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; however, the rhizome quality for human consumption needs further study.

=== Commercialization limit through storage restrictions ===
Currently most rhizomes are consumed fresh and it is not common to store them due to their poor [[shelf life]] performance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.B. Guo|date=2009|title=Cultivation of Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. spp. nucifera) and ist utilization in China|url=|journal=Genet Resour Crop Evol|volume=56|issue=3|pages=323–330|via=|doi=10.1007/s10722-008-9366-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limits export possibilities for low-income production countries in Asia. Rhizomes quickly lose water, oxidation occurs and nutrient composition changes within a short time after harvest. Optimal storage temperatures range between {{convert|5|to|8|C}}.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are three different approaches to storing rhizomes. By stacking the rhizomes, they are storable and remain fresh for about three weeks. Special stacking with silver sand{{clarify|date=April 2018}} and soil results in five to six layers that prevent water loss, thus the rhizome stays fresh for up to two months.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However the method is not suitable for commercialization but rather for home use. Hydrogen sulfide [[fumigation]] reduces enzymatic browning and therefore ensures rhizome quality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Dipping the rhizomes in a salt solution prevents oxidation and bacterial reproduction, which allows storage for up to five months and a greater export ability. This treatment is related to high cost and inefficient cleaning process before eating the rhizomes{{clarify|date=April 2018}}.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Use in bioengineering ===
''Nelumbo nucifera'' contains some thermal-stable proteins that might be useful in protein [[Bio-engineering|bio engineering]] processes. The proteins are characterized by seed longevity used for cell protection and repair under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen-Miller|first=J.|last2=Lindner|first2=Petra|last3=Xie|first3=Yongming|last4=Villa|first4=Sarah|last5=Wooding|first5=Kerry|last6=Clarke|first6=Steven G.|last7=Loo|first7=Rachel R.

===Other uses===
[[Image:IMG lotus-thread.JPG|thumb|Lotus thread is used to weave a special robe for the Buddha at [[Inle lake]], [[Myanmar]].]]The distinctive dried seed heads, which resemble the spouts of [[watering can]]s, are widely sold throughout the world for decorative purposes and for dried [[Floristry|flower arranging]].

In Asia, the petals are sometimes used for garnish, while the large leaves are used as a wrap for food, not frequently eaten (for example, as a wrapper for ''[[zongzi]]'').

A unique fabric from the lotus plant fibers is produced only at [[Inle lake]], [[Myanmar]] and in [[Siem Reap]] ([[Cambodia]]) is used for weaving special robes for [[Buddha]] images called ''kya thingahn'' (lotus robe).

Lotus rhizomes and seeds and their processing by-products are widely consumed in Asia, Americas, and Oceania for high content of physiologically [[active substance]]s.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Especially in [[China]], [[lotus seed]]s are popular with a cultural history going back about 3000 years.

==== Rhizomes ====
The rhizomes are {{convert|60–14|cm|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|0.5–2.5|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, yellowish white to yellowish brown, smooth and with [[Plant stem|nodes]] and [[internodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee PK.&amp;nbsp;''et al.''&amp;nbsp;Pharmacognostical profiles of rhizomes of&amp;nbsp;''Nelumbo nucifera''&amp;nbsp;Gaertn.&amp;nbsp;''Ancient Sci Life''&amp;nbsp;1998;&amp;nbsp;'''17''':&amp;nbsp;273–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lotus root is used to add seasoning to food. Lotus root is a moderate calorie root vegetable (100 g of root-stem provides about 74 calories) and is composed of several [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s, and [[nutrient]]s:  83.80% water, 0.11% fat, 1.56% reducing sugar, 0.41% sucrose, 2.70% crude protein, 9.25% starch, 0.80% fiber, 0.10% ash and 0.06% calcium.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Mukherjee PK et al.

==== Seeds ====
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera 004.JPG|150px|thumb|Developing lotus fruit|alt=|left]]
Lotus seeds are mostly oval or spherical, with sizes varying according to varieties. They are generally 1.2–1.8&amp;nbsp;cm long, with diameter ranging from 0.8 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 1.1–1.4 g. After lotus seeds have been decorticated and peeled, they are edible and rich in nutrients, and can be dried for storage. Their nutritional values can differ due to culture environments and varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = J | last2 = Zhang | first2 = G | year = 2010 | title = The yield and chemical composition of lotus seed on different culture conditions | url = | journal = Hubei J TCM | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 75–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only do these seeds contain [[protein]]s of high quality and are rich in variety of [[essential amino acid]]s including high contents of [[albumin]] (42%) and [[globulin]] (27%), they also contain unsaturated fatty acids, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[Calcium metabolism|calcium]], [[Human iron metabolism|iron]], [[Zinc metabolism|zinc]], phosphorus and other trace elements.&lt;ref&gt;Shad MA, Nawaz H, Siddique F, Zahra J, Mushtaq A (2013) Nutritional and functional characterization of seed kernel of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera): application of response surface methodology.

J Beijing Norm Univ (Nat Sci) 34:532–537&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide water-soluble polysaccharides, alkaloids, flavonoids, superoxide dismutase and other bioactive components.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng B, Zheng J, Zeng C (2004) Study on three functional components of Chinese main lotus seed varieties. Acta Nutr Sin 26:158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Lotus seed also contain particularly large amounts of vitamins, including [[Vitamin B1|VB1]], [[Riboflavin|VB2]], [[Vitamin B6|VB6]] and [[Vitamin E]].&lt;ref&gt;Zheng B, Zheng J, Zeng S (2003) Analysis of the nutritional composition in Chinese main lotus seed varieties.

Food Chem 105:540–547&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional components (polyphenols, protein, polysaccharides) in ''N. nucifera'' seeds can help combatting high [[Hypertension|blood pressure]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[gallstone]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wu C, Xia Y, Tang X (2013) Optimization of fermentation process for lotus rice-wine production by response surface methodology. Mod Food Sci Technol 29:1675–1679&lt;/ref&gt; Lotus seed's water-soluble polysaccharides have also been shown to promote [[lymphocyte]] transformation and enhance the [[Immune system|immune function]].&lt;ref&gt;Sung J, Sung J, Shin H (2011) Cytoprotective effects of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner) seed extracts on oxidative damaged mouse embryonic fibroblast cell. Food Sci Biotechnol 20:1533–1537&lt;/ref&gt;

After lotus [[Germination|seed germination]], crude protein and fat levels in the endosperm significantly increase. It is therefore an important method to enhance its nutritional quality.&lt;ref&gt;Xia Y (2012) Effect of germination on chemical and functional properties of lotus seeds.

==Cultural and Religious significance==
{{Main article|Padma (attribute)}}
===Hinduism===
[[Image:Lotus, a typical Hindu temple motive, in red sandstone, Qutb complex.jpg|thumb|right|240px|An Indian lotus motive on a Hindu temple. ''Nelumbo nucifera'' is also the [[Floral emblem#India|national flower]] of India.]]
[[Image:Ravi Varma-Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|Hindu goddess [[Lakshmi]] holding and standing on a lotus.]]
[[Image:Vishnu.jpg|thumb|[[Vishnu]] holding the lotus, also sitting on it and wearing a lotus-bud crown.]]
''Nelumbo nucifera'' is the species of lotus sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nelumbo nucifera (sacred lotus) |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/nelumbo-nucifera-sacred-lotus |publisher=Kew |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] revere it with the divinities [[Vishnu]] and [[Lakshmi]] often portrayed on a pink lotus in iconography. In the representation of Vishnu as [[Vishnu|Padmanabha]] (Lotus navel), a lotus issues from his navel with [[Brahma]] on it. The goddess [[Saraswati]] is portrayed on a white-colored lotus. The lotus is the symbol of what is divine or immortality in humanity, and is also a symbol of divine perfection. The lotus is the attribute of sun and fire gods. It symbolizes the realization of inner potential and in Tantric and Yogic traditions the lotus symbolizes the potential of an individual to harness the flow of energy moving through the chakras ( often depicted as wheel like lotuses) flowering as the thousand -petaled lotus of enlightenment at the top of the skull. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tresidder|first1=Jack|title=THe Hutchinson Dictionary of Symbols|date=1997|publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1-85986-059-5|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used as an example of divine beauty, Vishnu is often described as the "Lotus-Eyed One". Its unfolding petals suggest the expansion of the soul. The growth of its pure beauty from the mud of its origin holds a benign spiritual promise. In [[Hindu iconography]], other deities, like [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] and [[Ganesha]] are often depicted with lotus flowers as their seats.

The lotus plant is cited extensively within [[Puranic]] and [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, for example:
{{Quote|One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus is untouched by water.|[[Bhagavad Gita]] 5.10:}}
===Chinese religions===
In [[Chinese culture]], [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholar [[Zhou Dunyi]] wrote:

{{quote|I love the lotus because while growing from mud, it is unstained.}}
{{quote|{{zh|予獨愛蓮之出淤泥而不染。}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.qq.com/zt/2005/ailianshuo/|title=周敦颐：《爱莲说》|publisher=Book.qq.com|date=|accessdate=2012-11-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425063153/http://book.qq.com/zt/2005/ailianshuo/|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The lotus is also representative of [[Macau]], and [[Flag of Macau|its flag]] features said flower.
===Buddhism===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Ho dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Many [[deities]] of [[Eastern religions|Asian religions]] are depicted as seated on a lotus flower. In [[Buddhist symbolism]], the lotus represents purity of the [[Three Vajras|body, speech and mind]], as if floating above the murky waters of material attachment and physical desire. According to legend{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[Gautama Buddha]] was born with the ability to walk with lotus flowers blooming everywhere he stepped. In Tibet, Padmasambhava, the Lotus-Born, is considered the Second Buddha, having brought Buddhism to that country by conquering or converting local deities.

===Jainism===
The founders ([[tirthankaras]]) of Jainism are potrayed to be seated or standing on lotus blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mahavidya.ca/2016/04/22/the-sacred-lotus-symbol/&lt;/ref&gt;The Jain tirthankara [[Padmaprabha]] is also represented by the symbol of lotus.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmaprabha&lt;/ref&gt;Padmaprabha means ‘bright as a red lotus’ in Sanskrit.It is said in Śvetāmbara sources that his mother had a fancy for a couch of red lotuses – padma – while he was in her womb.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/jina/padmaprabha.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;"Under the lotus plants it lies,
hidden among the reeds in the marsh".&lt;/poem&gt;}}
The lotus is mentioned in the Bible is Job 40: 21 – 22 when God speaks to [[Job]].The Bible information on the lotus plant is : it grows in marshes and streams and the plant grows large enough to cover and conceal the [[behemoth]].

In Christianity, the [[St. Thomas Cross]] features a lotus being at the base of the cross.

===Bahá'í===
Drawing in turn on these beliefs, the international [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community adopted this symbolism in the design of the [[Lotus Temple]] in [[New Delhi]], India.
===Cultural===
In the classical written and oral literature of many Asian cultures the lotus is present in figurative form, representing elegance, beauty, perfection, purity and grace, being often used in poems and songs as an [[allegory]] for ideal feminine attributes. In [[Sanskrit]] the word lotus (''padma'' पद्म) has many [[synonym]]s.

Since the lotus thrives on water, ''ja'' (denoting birth) is added to synonyms of water to derive some synonyms for the lotus, like ''rajiv'',  ''ambuja'' (ambu= water + ja=born of), ''neerja'' (neera=water + ja= born of), ''pankaj'', ''pankaja'', ''kamal'', ''kamala'', ''kunala'', ''aravind'', ''arvind'', ''nalin'',''nalini'' and ''saroja''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitarau.com/indian_baby_names/All/Lotus Indian baby names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202030255/http://www.pitarau.com/indian_baby_names/All/Lotus |date=2010-12-02 }}. pitarau.com&lt;/ref&gt; and names derived from the lotus, like ''padmavati'' (possessing lotuses) or ''padmini'' (full of lotuses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/nmc/ind2.php Sanskrit-based names]. behindthename.com&lt;/ref&gt; These names and derived versions are often used to name girls, and to a lesser extent boys, in [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]], as well as in many other nations influenced by Indic culture, like [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].


The lotus flower is also the state flower of several Indian states, including [[Karnataka]], [[Haryana]], and [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mayaflowers.com/blog/andhra-pradesh-haryana-and-karnataka-state-flowers/ State Flower of Haryana, Karnataka] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410130626/https://www.mayaflowers.com/blog/andhra-pradesh-haryana-and-karnataka-state-flowers/ |date=10 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lechatbotte4.jpg|upright=2|thumb|[[Puss in Boots]] before the ogre. One of the platters on the table serves human babies (illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]]).]]

An '''ogre''' ([[grammatical gender|feminine]]: "'''ogress'''") is a legendary monster usually depicted as a large, hideous, man-like being that eats ordinary [[human]] beings, especially infants and children. Ogres frequently feature in [[mythology]], [[folklore]], and [[fiction]] throughout the world. They appear in many classic works of [[literature]], and are most often associated in [[fairy tales]] and legend with a taste for infants.

In mythology, ogres are often depicted as inhumanly large and tall and having a disproportionately large head, abundant hair, unusually colored skin, a voracious appetite, and a strong body. Ogres are closely linked with giants and with human cannibals in mythology. In both folklore and fiction, giants are often given ogrish traits (such as the giants in "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]" and "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]", the Giant Despair in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and the [[jötnar]] of [[Norse mythology]]); while ogres may be given giantish traits.

Further examples of famous folktales featuring ogres include "[[Puss in Boots]]" and "[[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]]"; while the most famous ogres in modern fiction are the eponymous main character [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and his wife [[Princess Fiona|Fiona]] from the animated comedy film series of the [[Shrek|same name]]. Other characters and monsters sometimes comparable to or described as ogres in trait include the titular husband in "[[Bluebeard]]", the Beast from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', [[Humbaba]] from the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', [[Grendel]] from ''[[Beowulf]]'', the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the related cyclops in the tales of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], and the [[oni]] of Japanese folklore.

[[File:Le Chat face à l'ogre.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Puss in Boots]] before the ogre (illustrated by [[Walter Crane]]).]]

The word ''ogre'' is of [[French language|French]] origin, originally derived from the Etruscan god Orcus, who fed on human flesh. Its earliest attestation is in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' late 12th-century verse romance [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|''Perceval, li contes del graal'']], which contains the lines:
{{quotation|
''Et s'est escrit que il ert ancore&lt;br /&gt;
''que toz li reaumes de Logres,&lt;br /&gt;
''qui jadis fu la terre as ogres,&lt;br /&gt;
''ert destruite par cele lance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"And it is written that he will come again,&lt;br /&gt;
to all the realms of [[Logres]],&lt;br /&gt;
known as the land of ogres,&lt;br /&gt;
and destroy them with that lance."}}
The ''ogres'' in this rhyme may refer to the ogres who were, in the [[pseudohistorical]] work ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], the inhabitants of Britain prior to human settlement. The Italian author [[Giambattista Basile]] (1575–1632) used the related Neapolitan word ''uerco'', or in standard Italian, ''orco'' in some of his tales. This word is documented&lt;ref&gt;[http://vocabolario.biblio.cribecu.sns.it/cgi-bin/Vocabolario/search_context?rimando=1&amp;pattern=ORCO.&amp;tag_n=ENTRY&amp;attr_n=ID&amp;attr_v=W288 Vocabolario Degli Accademici Della Crusca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013191225/http://vocabolario.biblio.cribecu.sns.it/cgi-bin/Vocabolario/search_context?rimando=1&amp;pattern=ORCO.&amp;tag_n=ENTRY&amp;attr_n=ID&amp;attr_v=W288 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in earlier Italian works ([[Italian literature#Imitators|Fazio degli Uberti]], 14th century; [[Luigi Pulci]], 15th century; [[Ludovico Ariosto]], 15th–16th centuries) and has even older cognates with the Latin ''[[orcus (mythology)|orcus]]'' and the Old English ''orcnēas'' found in [[Beowulf]] lines 112–113, which inspired [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Orc#Early modern usage|Orc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~beowulf/main.html |title=Beowulf |publisher=Humanities.mcmaster.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these words may derive from a shared Indo-European mythological concept (as Tolkien himself speculated, as cited by [[Tom Shippey]], ''The Road to Middle-earth'', 45). The Dictionary of the Academy of France alternatively states that the name is derived from the word ''Hongrois'', which means [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], as of western cultures referred to Hungarians as a kind of monstrosity.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire de l'Académie française (1932–35)&lt;/ref&gt; Ogre could possibly also derive{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} from the biblical [[Og]], last of the giants (or from the Greek river god [[Oeagrus|Oiagros]], father of [[Orpheus]]).

The word ''ogre'' came into wider usage in the works of [[Charles Perrault]] (1628–1703) or [[Madame d'Aulnoy|Marie-Catherine Jumelle de Berneville, Comtesse d' Aulnoy]] (1650–1705), both of whom were French authors. The first appearance of the word ''ogre'' in Perrault's work occurred in his ''Histoires ou Contes du temps Passé'' (1696). It later appeared in several of his other fairy tales, many of which were based on the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tales of Basile. The first example of a female ogre being referred to as an ''ogress'' is found in his version of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', where it is spelled ''ogresse.'' [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] first employed the word ''ogre'' in her story ''[[The Bee and the Orange Tree|L'Orangier et l'Abeille]]'' (1698), and was the first to use the word ''ogree'' to refer to the creature's offspring.

== Ogres in popular culture ==
{{Pop culture|date=March 2018}}
* Ogres appear as antagonists in the 2018 video game ''[[God of War (2018)|God of War]]'', despite not being traditionally associated with Norse mythology. 
* Ogres exist as a major faction in ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'' and its successor ''[[Warhammer: Age of Sigmar]]'' as well as in ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', except they're named Ogryns.
*[[Shrek (character) |Shrek]] is the eponymous ogre protagonist in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'']] series of comedy films. Shrek engages in typical ogre behaviors like washing in mud and eating insects, but otherwise isn't monstrous, and only feigns nastiness and claims to eat people as a way to deter trespassers in his [[swamp]], which is the backbone of the first movie's plot. This is only due to years of being mistreated by humans simply for the fact he is an ogre and not because he did anything. Ogres in the Shrek series are portrayed as having about the same intelligence levels as humans and are not much different than humans aside from appearance and rather disgusting habits.
* An ogre named Mulgarath is the main antagonist in ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', wherein the [[shapeshifting]] ability from the Puss in Boots story is shared by all ogres.
* Ogres are units for the [[Orc]] faction in ''[[Warlords Battlecry]]'' video games.
* Ogres are a barbaric race in the ''[[Warcraft]]'' franchise. One of its main characters, Rexxar, is a half-[[orc]]/half-ogre.
* Ogres are enemies in ''[[The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]''.
* Ogres make an appearance as [[shock troops]] and [[pillagers]] from Mount Gundabad in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.
* [[Ogre (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Ogres]] are a race in the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]].
* Ogres are the monsters in ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' issue #2 story "Ogre's Castle".

'''Paul Charles Joseph Bourget''' ({{IPA-fr|buʁʒɛ|lang}}; 2 September 1852{{snd}}25 December 1935) was a French [[novelist]]&lt;ref&gt;Delille, Edward (1892). "M. Paul Bourget," ''Fortnightly Review'', Vol. 67, pp. 655–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bazin, René (1926).

"Paul Bourget, Critique et Romancier," ''Mercure de France'', Vol. 265, pp. 230–54.&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1235|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Paul Bourget was born in [[Amiens]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] ''[[département of France|département]]'' of [[Picardy]], France. His father, a professor of [[mathematics]], was later appointed to a post in the college at [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where Bourget received his early education. He afterwards studied at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] and at the [[École des Hautes Études]].

Between 1872 and 1873, he produced a volume of verse, ''Au Bord de la Mer'', which was followed by others, the last, ''Les Aveux'', appearing in 1882. Meanwhile, he was making a name in literary [[journalism]] and in 1883 he published ''Essais de Psychologie Contemporaine'', studies of eminent writers first printed in the ''Nouvelle Revue'', and now brought together. In 1884 Bourget paid a long visit to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], where he wrote his first published story (''L'Irréparable''). ''Cruelle Enigme'' followed in 1885; then ''André Cornelis'' (1886) and ''Mensonges'' (1887) - inspired by [[Octave Mirbeau]]'s life - were received with much favour.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Bourget, Paul Charles Joseph|volume=4|pages=331–332}} This cites:
* Constantin Lecigne, ''L'Évolution Morale et Religieuse de M. Paul Bourget'' (1903).
* Jules Sargeret, [https://archive.org/stream/lesgrandsconver00sage#page/n9/mode/2up ''Les Grands Convertis''] (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourget, who had abandoned Catholicism in 1867, began a gradual return to it in 1889, fully converting only in 1901. In 1893, in an interview he gave in America, he spoke about his changed views: "For many years I, like most young men in modern cities, was content to drift along in [[agnosticism]], but I was brought to my senses at last by the growing realization that...the life of a man who simply said 'I don't know, and not knowing I do the thing that pleases me,' was not only empty in itself and full of disappointment and suffering, but was a positive influence for evil upon the lives of others." On the other hand, "those men and women who follow the teachings of the church are in a great measure protected from the moral disasters which...almost invariably follow when men and women allow themselves to be guided and swayed by their senses, passions and weaknesses."&lt;ref name ="PB in NY"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat18930821&amp;id=pwUbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e0gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6935,2791058 "Paul Bourget in New York"], ''The Pittsburg Press'', August 21, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the themes of his novel ''Le Disciple'' (1889), which he wrote, as he says in his American interview, just after abandoning his "drifting and comfortable belief in agnosticism". It is the story of philosopher Adrien Sixte, whose advocacy of [[materialism]] and [[positivism]] wields a terrible influence over an admiring but unstable student, Robert Geslon, whose actions, in turn, lead to the tragic death of a young woman.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Anger. [http://www.seattlecatholic.com/article_20041018.html "Faith and Fiction"], ''Seattle Catholic'', 18 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Disciple'' caused a stir in France and became a bestseller. Exemplifying the novelist's graver side, it was one of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s favourite books.&lt;ref name="PB in NY"/&gt; [[John Cowper Powys]] listed ''Le Disciple'' at number 33 in his ''One Hundred Best Books''.&lt;ref&gt;Powys, John Cowper (1916).

[[File:Paul Bourget young.jpg|thumb|left|Bourget early in his career.]]''Études et portraits'', first published in 1888, contains impressions of Bourget's stay in England and Ireland&amp;mdash;especially reminiscences of the months which he spent at [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] and in 1891 ''Sensations d'Italie'', notes of a tour in that country, revealed a fresh phase of his powers; and ''Outre-Mer'' (1895), a book in two volumes, is his critical journal of a visit to the United States in 1893. Also in 1891 appeared the novel ''Coeur de Femme'', and ''Nouveaux Pastels'', "types" of the characters of men, the sequel to a similar gallery of female types (''Pastels'', 1890). His later novels include ''La Terre Promise'' (1892); ''Cosmopolis'' (1892), a [[psychological novel]], with [[Rome]] as a background; ''Une Idylle tragique'' (1896); ''La Duchesse bleue'' (1897); ''Le Fantôme'' (1901); ''Les Deux Sœurs'' (1905); and some volumes of shorter stories&amp;mdash;''Complications Sentimentales'' (1896), the powerful ''Drames de famille'' (1898), and ''Un Homme d'Affaires'' (1900). ''L'Etape'' (1902) was a study of the inability of a family raised too rapidly from the peasant class to adapt itself to new conditions. This powerful study of contemporary manners was followed by ''Un Divorce'' (1904), a defence of the [[Roman Catholic]] position that [[divorce]] is a violation of [[natural law]]s. He was admitted to the [[Académie française]] in 1894, and in 1895 was promoted to be an officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]], having received the decoration of the order ten years before.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Several new novels were to follow, including ''La Vie Passe'' (1910), ''Le Sens de la Mort'' (1915), ''Lazarine'' (1917), ''Némésis'' (1918), and ''Laurence Albani'' (1920), as well as three volumes of short stories and plays, ''La Barricade'' (1910) and ''Le Tribun'' (1912). Two other plays, ''Un Cas de Conscience'' (1910) and ''La Crise'' (1912) were written by him in collaboration with others. A volume of critical studies appeared in 1912, and another set of travel sketches, ''Le Démon du Midi'', in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1922|inline=1 |title=Bourget, Paul |volume=30 |page=486 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri30chisrich#page/486/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caricature of Paul Bourget.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of Paul Bourget, by Dessins de Rouveyre, 1907.]]
On 16 March 1914, he was present in the offices of the newspaper, ''Le Figaro'' when the newspaper's editor, his friend [[Gaston Calmette]] was shot and killed by [[Henriette Caillaux]] the wife of a former Prime Minister of France. Her subsequent trial caused an enormous scandal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hypocrisy of Justice in the Belle Epoque | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | author=Martin,  Benjamin F. | year=1984|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourget died on Christmas Day 1935, aged 83, in [[Paris]].

==Literary significance and criticism==
[[File:Études et portraits.tif|thumb|''Études et portraits'', 1889]]

As a writer of verse Bourget's poems, which were collected in two volumes (1885&amp;ndash;1887), throw light upon his mature method and the later products of his art. It was in criticism that he excelled. Notable are the ''Sensations d'Italie'' (1891), and the various psychological studies.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Bourget's reputation as a novelist is assured in some academic and intellectual circles but while they were widely popular in his time, his novels have long been largely forgotten by the general reading public.  Impressed by the art of Henry Beyle ([[Stendhal]]), he struck out on a new course at a moment when the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school was the vogue in French fiction.  With Bourget, observation was mainly directed to the human character. At first his purpose seemed to be purely artistic, but when ''Le Disciple'' appeared, in 1889, the preface to that story revealed his moral enthusiasm. After that, he varied between his earlier and his later manner, but his work in general was more seriously conceived. He painted the intricate emotions of women, whether wronged, erring or actually vicious; and he described the ideas, passions and failures of the young men of France.

One of his poems was the inspiration for an [[art song]] by [[Claude Debussy]] titled [[Beau Soir]].
Other settings by Debussy of poems by Bourget include 'Romance' and 'Les Cloches'.

'''Pedro Marieluz Garcés''' (or '''Peter Marielux''') (born in 1780 in [[Tarma]]/Peru, died on 23 September 1825 in [[Callao]]/Peru) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religiososcamilosperu.org/300/pdf/04.pdf |title=Religiosos Camilos : Necrologio del Convento de la Buenamuerte (1709 - 2009) |publisher=Reliosocamilosperu.org |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203095648/http://www.religiososcamilosperu.org/300/pdf/04.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Roman [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]] who died as a [[martyr]] of the [[Seal of the Confessional and the Catholic Church|Seal of the Confessional]].

As a young man, Pedro Marieluz Garcés entered the order of the [[Camillians]] and was [[Holy orders|ordained]] a priest in 1805.

Later he became a military chaplain with the troops of the Spanish Royal Governor, [[José Ramón Rodil y Campillo|Ramón Rodil]]. During the siege of the fortress Real Felipe in the city of [[Callao]] after the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], there was a conspiracy made against Rodil by some of the Royal soldiers. The plot was discovered and Rodil sentenced the conspirators to death. They were allowed to [[Confession (religion)#Roman Catholicism|confess]] to Father Marieluz before being shot. After the execution of the plotters, Rodil is said to have doubted whether he had convicted all members of the plot and, thinking that the executed ones would have revealed everything in confession to Father Marieluz, he tried to force the confessor to disclose to him what he had heard under the holy seal by threatening him to be shot likewise, if he would not obey. But Father Marieluz remained steadfast and thus died a [[martyr]] in the evening of 23 September 1825, as his legend tells us.

'''Religious liberalism''' is a conception of [[religion]] (or of a particular religion) which emphasizes personal and group [[liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=144}}: "[...] when people talk about 'religious liberalism,' they are normally referring to a commitment to a certain kind of conception of what religion is and, accordingly, of how religious attitudes, institutions, and communities should be developed or reshaped so as to accommodate and promote particular forms of personal and group freedom."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=159}}: "[...] religious liberalism came to be so concerned with respect for reason, reasonableness, and rationality [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attitude towards one's own religion (as opposed to [[criticism of religion]] from a [[secular]] position, and as opposed to criticism of a religion other than one's own) which contrasts with a traditionalist or [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] approach, and it is directly opposed by trends of [[religious fundamentalism]]. It is related to [[religious liberty]], which is the tolerance of different religious beliefs and practices, but not all promoters of religious liberty are in favor of religious liberalism, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=143–144}}: "However, given the way in which terminology has evolved, we must be careful not to assume too close an association between 'religious liberty' and 'religious liberalism.' Many people who think that religious liberty is basically a good thing that ought to be promoted do not wish to be regarded as advocates of religious liberalism; some of them even feel that many of those who call themselves 'religious liberals' are enemies of religious liberty, or at least end up undermining religious liberty in the process of promoting their own special brand of 'liberal religion.' [...] One notable problem here is that, when liberalism is considered in relation to religion, one may be thinking primarily of a certain 'liberal' conception of religion itself (in contrast with, say, orthodox, conservative, traditionalist, or fundamentalist conceptions) or one may be thinking more of a 'liberal' political view of the value of religious liberty. But, when people talk about 'religious liberalism,' they are usually thinking of the former more than the latter, although they may uncritically assume that the two necessarily accompany one another."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
"Liberalism" in the context of religious liberalism conveys the sense of [[classical liberalism]] as it developed in the [[Enlightenment era]], which forms the starting point of both religious and political liberalism; but religious liberalism does not necessarily coincide with all meanings of "liberalism" in [[political philosophy]]. For example, an [[Empirical research|empirical]] attempt to show a link between religious liberalism and political liberalism proved inconclusive in a 1973 study in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stellway |first=Richard J. |date=Summer 1973 |title=The correspondence between religious orientation and socio‐political liberalism and conservatism |journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=430–439 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb00871.x |jstor=4105689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term "liberal" in the context of religious philosophy appeared as early as the mid-19th century&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; and became established by the first part of the 20th century; for example, in 1936, philosophy professor and [[Disciples of Christ]] minister Edward Scribner Ames wrote in his article "Liberalism in Religion":&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ames |first=Edward Scribner |date=July 1936 |title=Liberalism in religion |journal=[[International Journal of Ethics]] |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=429–443 |doi=10.1086/intejethi.46.4.2989282 |jstor=2989282 |url=https://digitalcommons.acu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&amp;context=crs_books}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The term "liberalism" seems to be developing a religious usage which gives it growing significance. It is more sharply contrasted with fundamentalism, and signifies a far deeper meaning than modernism. Fundamentalism describes a relatively uncritical attitude. In it custom, traditionalism, and authoritarianism are dominant. [...] There is no doubt that the loss of the traditional faith has left many people confused and rudderless, and they are finding that there is no adequate satisfaction in mere excitement or in flight from their finer ideals. They crave a sense of deeper meaning and direction for their life. Religious liberalism, not as a cult but as an attitude and method, turns to the living realities in the actual tasks of building more significant individual and collective human life.}}

Religious traditionalists, who reject the idea that tenets of modernity should have any impact on religious tradition, challenge the concept of religious liberalism. Secularists, who reject the idea that implementation of rationalistic or critical thought leaves any room for religion altogether, likewise dispute religious liberalism.

"[[Liberal Christianity]]" is an umbrella term for the developments in Christian theology and culture since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century. It has become mostly mainstream within the major [[Christian denominations]] in the [[Western world]], but is opposed by a movement of [[Christian fundamentalism]] which developed in response to these trends, and also contrasts with conservative forms of Christianity outside the Western world and outside the reach of Enlightenment philosophy and modernism, mostly within [[Eastern Christianity]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in particular has a long tradition of controversy regarding questions of religious liberalism. Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] (1801–1890), for example, was seen{{by whom|date=October 2015}} as moderately liberal by 19th-century standards because he was critical of [[papal infallibility]], but he explicitly opposed "liberalism in religion" because he argued it would lead to complete [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism in religion is the doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion, but that one creed is as good as another…", JH Newman 'Biglietto Speech' http://www.newmanreader.org/works/addresses/file2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican Christian apologist [[C. S. Lewis]] voiced a similar view in the 20th century, arguing that "theology of the liberal type" amounted to a complete re-invention of Christianity and a rejection of Christianity as understood by its own founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |authorlink=C. S. Lewis |date=1988 |title=The essential C.S. Lewis |location=New York |publisher=[[Collier Books]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7YYhHvuNNzIC&amp;pg=PA353 353] |isbn=0020195508 |oclc=17840856 |quote=All theology of the liberal type involves at some point—and often involves throughout—the claim that the real behavior and purpose and teaching of Christ came very rapidly to be misunderstood and misrepresented by his followers, and has been recovered or exhumed only by modern scholars.}} (From an essay titled "Modern theology and biblical criticism" written in 1959.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the development of liberal theology in Christianity, German-Jewish religious reformers began to incorporate [[critical thought]] and humanist ideas into [[Judaism]] from the early 19th century. This resulted in the creation of various non-Orthodox denominations, from the moderately liberal [[Conservative Judaism]] to very liberal [[Reform Judaism]]. The moderate wing of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], especially [[Open Orthodoxy]], espouses a similar approach.

While Christianity and Judaism in the Western world have had to deal with [[modernity]] since its emergence in the 18th century—or even since the [[Renaissance]] and its consequences of [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]]&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt;—[[Islam]] (along with Jewish and Christian traditions in the [[Middle East]]) was not immediately affected by modernity and Enlightenment philosophy. Examples of [[liberal movements within Islam]] are [[Progressive British Muslims]] (formed following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London terrorist attacks]], defunct by 2012), [[British Muslims for Secular Democracy]] (formed 2006), or [[Muslims for Progressive Values]] (formed 2007).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Similarly, [[Eastern religions]] were not immediately affected by liberalism and Enlightenment philosophy, and have partly undertaken reform movements only after contact with Western philosophy in the 19th or 20th centuries. Thus [[Hindu reform movements]] emerged in British India in the 19th century. [[Buddhist modernism]] (or "New Buddhism") arose in its Japanese form as a reaction to the [[Meiji Restoration]], and was again transformed outside of Japan in the 20th century, notably giving rise to modern [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMahan |first=David L. |date=2008 |title=The making of Buddhist modernism |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780195183276 |oclc=216938497 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183276.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Havnevik |editor1-first=Hanna |editor2-last=Hüsken |editor2-first=Ute |editor3-last=Teeuwen |editor3-first=Mark |editor4-last=Tikhonov |editor4-first=Vladimir |editor5-last=Wellens |editor5-first=Koen |date=2017 |title=Buddhist modernities: re-inventing tradition in the globalizing modern world |series=Routledge studies in religion |volume=54 |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781138687844 |oclc=970042282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberal religion in Unitarianism==
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
The term '''liberal religion''' has been used by [[Unitarianism|Unitarian Christians]]&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;For example: {{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=George Edward |authorlink=George Edward Ellis |date=November 1856 |title=Relations of reason and faith |journal=The Christian Examiner and Religious Miscellany |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=412–456 (444–445, 450) |location=Boston |publisher=Crosby, Nichols, and Company for the [[American Unitarian Association]] |oclc=6122907 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4g3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA412 |quote=The first of all the requisites in such a religion is that it shall be Liberal. We ''mention'' this condition even before that of Truth, because a religion that is not liberal cannot be true. The devout and intelligent demand a liberal religion, a religion large, free, generous, comprehensive in its lessons, a religion expansive in its spirit, lofty in its views, and with a sweep of blessings as wide as the range of man's necessities and sins. This is what is meant by a Liberal Religion, or Liberal views of religion, or Liberal Christianity. [...] Thoughtful, earnest, and devout minds now demand a liberal religion. Liberal in the honest, pure, and noble sense of that word. Not liberal in the sense of license, recklessness, or indifference; not in making a scoff of holy restraints and solemn mysteries. Not liberal as the worldling or the fool uses the word, for overthrowing all distinctions, and reducing life to a revel or a riot. [...] Such a faith cannot afford to raise an issue with reason on a single point, so far as their road on the highway of truth will allow them to keep company together. When they part for faith to advance beyond reason, they must part in perfect harmony.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Unitarian Universalist]]s&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Robert |date=1995 |chapter=The church green: ecology and the future |editor1-last=O'Neal |editor1-first=Dan |editor2-last=Wesley |editor2-first=Alice Blair |editor3-last=Ford |editor3-first=James Ishmael |editor3-link=James Ishmael Ford |title=The transient and permanent in liberal religion: reflections from the UUMA Convocation on Ministry |location=Boston |publisher=Skinner House Books |pages=195–206 (195) |isbn=1558963308 |oclc=35280453 |quote=Does liberal religion have a future? If we answer in the affirmative, can we begin to imagine the outlines of liberal religion in the next century? What will the Unitarian Universalist movement look like in the decade of the 2090s?}} ''Cf.'' {{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Robert L'H. |date=Spring 1976 |title=The religious value system of Unitarian Universalists |journal=[[Review of Religious Research]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=189–208 |doi=10.2307/3510610 |jstor=3510610 |quote=The repetition of the distinctive pattern in both higher and lower ranking of both terminal and instrumental values leads one to a firmer basis for sensing a distinctive Unitarian Universalist pattern of religiousness. It is, perhaps, more accurately defined as a pattern of liberal religion which further research may disclose is typical, for example, of such groups as Reform Judaism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to their own brand of religious liberalism, although the term has also been used by non-Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;For example, on [[Quakerism]] as liberal religion: {{cite book |editor1-last=Dandelion |editor1-first=Pink |editor2-last=Collins |editor2-first=Peter |date=2008 |title=The Quaker condition: the sociology of a liberal religion |location=Newcastle |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=18 |isbn=9781847185655 |oclc=227278348 |quote=This is the first book of its kind and is intended to be the beginning, rather than the final word. It adds considerably to the study of Quakerism but also to the study of Liberal religion per se.}} And on [[Islam]] as liberal religion: {{cite journal |last=Foody |first=Kathleen |date=October 2016 |title=Pedagogical projects: teaching liberal religion after 9/11 |journal=The Muslim World |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=719–739 |doi=10.1111/muwo.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Journal of Liberal Religion'' was published by the Unitarian Ministerial Union, [[Meadville Theological School]], and Universalist Ministerial Association from 1939 to 1949, and was edited by [[James Luther Adams]], an influential Unitarian theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of Liberal Religion |website=worldcat.org |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/4714979 |oclc=4714979 |accessdate=2017-11-20}} Published from 1939 to 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, a new version of the journal was published in an online format from 1999 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of Liberal Religion |url=http://www.meadville.edu/page.php?page=71 |website=meadville.edu |issn=1527-9324 |accessdate=2017-11-22}} Published from 1999 to 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rot op met je religie''''' (English: ''To Hell With Your Religion'') is a 2017 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television series by the [[Evangelische Omroep]], presented by Kefah Allush.

== Setting and purpose ==
In this [[Reality television|reality show]], four [[religion|religious people]] (two [[Christianity|Christians]], a [[Islam|Muslim]] and a [[Judaism|Jew]]) and two [[atheism|atheists]] live together in the same house in [[Haarlem]], and discuss and debate their religious beliefs, practices and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7LJvru7g4U |title=De Nieuwe Maan - Rot op met je religie |work=De Nieuwe Maan |publisher=[[Omroep NTR|NTR]] |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features mutual [[criticism of religion]] as well as [[interfaith dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/rot-op-met-je-religie/ |title=Rot op met je religie |author=Thimo den Hartog |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants also travel across the Netherlands to visit [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], an [[abortion clinic]] and a [[Dhabihah|halal]] [[slaughterhouse]] amongst other places, and cook together despite their widely varying ethical views on food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/rtv/26697584/__EO__Rot_op_met_je_geloof__.html |title=EO: Rot op met je geloof |author=Marcel Frost |work=[[De Telegraaf]] |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/de-ultieme-religiestress-test-in-rot-op-met-je-religie-op-npo2/ |title=De ultieme religiestress-test in ‘Rot op met je religie’ op NPO2 |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |date=6 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EO hopes the programme will show what 'religious stress'&lt;ref&gt;The neologism ''religiestress'' ("religious stress") was coined in 2012 by Dutch theologian Tom Mikkers, who works for the EO.&lt;/ref&gt; does to the candidates, and what effect this has on their beliefs. Just before the first episode was broadcast, the EO published a survey about religious stress amongst Dutch citizens, which showed amongst other things that 93% of the population is in favour of [[freedom of speech]], and 82% supports [[freedom of religion]], but almost half think that [[secularism|religion should not be professed in public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rd.nl/kerk-religie/eo-nederlanders-ervaren-dilemma-s-rond-religie-1.1365904 |title=EO: Nederlanders ervaren dilemma’s rond religie |work=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]] |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the EO made similar programmes about [[refugee]]s (''Rot op naar je eigen land'', "Piss Off To Your Own Country", 2015) and [[environmental issue]]s (''[[Rot op met je milieu]]'', "Get Lost With Your Environment", 2016).&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/televisie/een-hoop-pleuris-en-religiestress-in-rot-op-met-je-religie~a4450288/ |title=Een hoop pleuris en religiestress in 'Rot op met je religie' |author=Gidi Heesakkers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Stichting KijkOnderzoek, a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings tracking]] service, reported that about 531,000 people watched the first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nieuwwij.nl/nieuws/ruim-half-miljoen-kijkers-rot-op-religie/ |title=Ruim half miljoen kijkers voor 'Rot op met je religie' |work=NieuwWij.nl |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', the EO used the programme to deliberately fan the flames of religious stress, and by their selection of participants created an unfair representation of the various worldviews: "The [[casting]] wants us to primarily look for reasonableness amongst the four religious participants (...). Even the two non-believers clash occasionally, because one is [[veganism|vegan]] and the other finds that to be politically correct bullshit. In short: in the first episode, the religious stress isn't quite fairly distributed yet between the followers of [[God]] and those who reject the existence of the fairytale character of god."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/01/17/de-eo-stookt-de-religiestress-nog-op-6246021-a1541592 |title=De EO stookt de religiestress verder op |author=Hans Beerekamp |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three episodes, ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', too, concluded that "the EO does everything within their power to let all hell break loose. There is no live and let live." Just like in the previous ''Rot op'' series, the programme would primarily be "about confrontation, heated discussions and perhaps a vain hope of reconciliation." It noted that the most fierce nonbeliever, Floris, "is portrayed the least sympathetic by the montage so far." On the preview of the fourth episode, in which Safeer shows his unease when meeting a [[Islam and homosexuality|gay Muslim]], the newspaper's reviewer (referencing [[Genesis 1:4]]) commented: "Someone saw the announcement, and saw it was not good. ''Stress!''"
&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"/&gt;

A critic from ThePostOnline disagreed with the ''Volkskrant'''s criticism of the montage: "By definition, media select that which is appetising." On the contrary, 'sensational television' is interesting, especially to discover who 'understands the art of living and tolerance best'. In his opinion, the atheist and vegan Floris, "whose raised voice against his religious fellow man may go into Dutch television history as legendary", drawing the comparison to the late politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], finishes last in this regard, followed by the imam Safeer, whilst sympathy for the atheist Bryan is growing throughout the series, and the Jewish Sheila has had the audience's sympathy from the beginning. Furthermore, the EO allegedly lacked a sense of humour, and the idea of 'let it be' would only rarely feature in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.tpo.nl/2017/01/19/rot-op-religie-minder-minder-minder-veganisten/ |title=Rot op met je religie: Minder, minder, minder veganisten |author=Peter Olsthoorn |work=ThePostOnline |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sapinda Relationship.png|Any person belonging to the yellow area will be a "''sapinda''" of the "Subject"|400px|thumb|right]]
'''Sapinda''' is a term used in context of [[cousin marriage]]s in [[Hinduism]].

==Legal explanation==

"''Sapinda'' relationship" with reference to any person extends as far as the third generation (inclusive) in the [[Line of ancestry|line of ascent]] through the mother, and the fifth (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father, the line being traced upwards in each case from the person concerned, who is to be counted as the first generation.

Two persons are said to be "''sapindas''" of each other if one is a [[Lineal descendant|lineal ascendant]] of the other within the limits of "''sapinda''" relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of "''sapinda''" relationship with reference to each of them.

==Example==
For example, if the [[bride]] is the offspring of any person within five generations (inclusive) on the [[Bridegroom|groom's]] father's side and three generations (inclusive) on the groom's mother's side, or vice versa, they will be referred to as "''sapindas''" of each other. In these cases, the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] of 1955 bars marriage between two Hindus of this nature.

==Conditions for a Hindu marriage==

Section 5 of the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] of 1955 laid down conditions for a [[Hindu marriage]]. A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:-
''
:''(i) neither party has a [[spouse]] living at the time of the marriage;

:''(ii) neither party is an [[idiot]] or a [[lunatic]] at the time of the marriage;

:''(iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty one years and the bride the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage;

:''(iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;

:''(v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two

&lt;!-- 
The below sixth condition was removed.
(vi) where the bride has not completed the age of eighteen years, the consent of her [[Legal guardian|guardian]] in marriage, if any, has been obtained for the marriage.
--&gt;
Out of the five above conditions, this article refers to the condition stated under section 5(v), which states that if the Hindu bride and the Hindu groom are "''sapindas''" of each other, the marriage between the two cannot be solemnized by law and will be legally void.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5661">{{Traditional African religion}}
[[Traditional African religions]] have shared notable relationships with other religions, cultures, and traditions.

Throughout the history, they are often noted for having one of the oldest presence in the world, and also applauded for its tolerance with other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Religious Plurality in Africa: Essays in Honour of John S. Mbiti|page = 67|publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]]|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Africa Since 1935|author = Ali AlʼAmin Mazrui, Christophe Wondji|page = 502|year = 1993|publisher = University of California Press|isbn = 9780435948146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hinduism ==

Like [[Hinduism]], the traditional African religion recognizes the presence of one supreme deity as well as the existence of God in multiple aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A Tribute to Hinduism: Thoughts and Wisdom Spanning Continents and Time about India and Her Culture|author = Sushama Londhe|page = 79|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Igbo_mythology|Igbo]] doctrine of [[reincarnation]] and connection to the spiritual mortal identity of the culture, themes about spiritual instrumentality based on the traditional Igobo beliefs and practices with the Hindu mantra, specifically the doctrine in the creative power of the spoken word are identical.&lt;ref&gt;"Gendering Global Transformations: Gender, Culture, Race, and Identity", p. 114, by Chima J. Korieh, Philomina E Okeke-Ihejirika, publisher = Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{further|Afro-American religion}}
God is esteemed by both African religion and [[Christianity]] as both the very ground being, and the necessary of life, and any form of being or existence, such as the creation itself. Anthropology is the basic starting place for both religions, human beings are the temporal mirrors and mediators (imago Dei) of God in the feature world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = African religion, philosophy, and Christianity in Logos-Christ: common ground revisited|author = Emmanuel K. Twesigye|page = 9|publisher = Peter Lang Publishing|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian idea of church has similarities with African traditional life in which brotherhood and the extended family play a central role. The Church is the Christian family, in which all are accompanied to one another through belief and baptism in [[Jesus Christ]]. The Church also combines those who have died and those who still live. This is parallel view to the African view of the family of both the living and the omitted.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to African Religion", by John S. Mbiti, p. 190 publisher = Heinemann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ezVqxxxqgC&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==

African traditional religion is also regarded to have influenced [[Islam]], but despite this African customs were simply rejected by the Muslims. Muslim missionaries in Africa have often used violence as a means of conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to African Religions|page=328|author=Elias Kifon Bongmba|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also notable that before the expansion of Islam, [[human sacrifice]]s were common in [[Egypt]], Egyptians conducted to sacrifice female to River Nile, every year when it was flooded. The flood would remain until a young female was thrown into it as a sacrifice. During the reign of Caliph [[Umar|Umar bin al-Khattab]], Amr bin al-Aas, the governor of Egypt, wrote to Umar askin his direction for such activity. There is a story that Umar answered by writing a note to be thrown into the Nile river instead of sacrificing a female to it. The note enclosed verses from the Qur'an and a command from Umar asking the Nile to flow fluently in the name of Allah without causing any damage to inhabitants. When the note was thrown into the Nile, the flood dissolved. After that they won't sacrifice human.&lt;ref&gt;p. 329 - 330 by Elias Kifon Bongmba&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, even after the suppression of African traditional religion, the religion has its notable traces in northern Africa. Followers of African religion in Muslim dominated areas can be found, adhering their beliefs, rituals, magic, medicines. Generally they have adopted the [[Islam and clothing|Muslim way of dressing]] but in matter of deeper subjects such as life, birth, marriage, death, they remain the followers of African religion.&lt;ref&gt;"An Introduction to African Religion (2nd Edition)", by John S. Mbiti, p. 191 publisher = East African Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==

Relations of African religion with [[Buddhism]] dates back to 17th century. After the establishment of the Dutch settlement at [[Cape Agulhas]], some Buddhists paid short, coincidental visits to the Cape Agulhas - such as the few Thai monks who were aboard the Portuguese ship which ran aground off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A World of Religions: A South African Perspective|publisher = Kagiso Publishers|year = 1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCAvAAAAYAAJ|author = Piet Meiring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Hinduism, [[Akan religion|Akan]] tradition shares belief in reincarnation with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Cross-Cultural Visions in African American Literature: West Meets East|publisher =[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|author = Yoshinobu Hakutani|page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Volunteer Minister''' (VM) is a member of [[Scientology]] sent to a [[disaster zone]] to spread the doctrine of Scientology and provide disaster relief.&lt;ref name="3 methods" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dissem Tips" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HCOPL 22-2-91"/&gt; The program was created in the 1970s by Scientology founder [[L.

As of 2016, The volunteer ministers has a network of over 9,000 trained ministers.&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first1=Eric |title=Cult Wars in Historical Perspective: New and Minority Religions |chapter=Scientology |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first=Eugene V. |publisher=Routledge |date=21 July 2016 |isbn=978-1472458124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology says that the program constitutes "the only effective steps to arrest and reverse the deterioration of [the] world",&lt;ref name="HCOPL 22-2-91"&gt;Hubbard, "Volunteer Ministers," HCO Policy Letter 22 February 1991&lt;/ref&gt; but critics argue that [[Scientology]] uses the program to gain positive media attention and recruit new members (known within Scientology as 'raw meat').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Objectives==
According to Hubbard, the objective of the program is to "put basic [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]] technology into view and into use at the raw public level."&lt;ref name="FBDL 424"&gt;Hubbard, "The Volunteer Ministers Program," Flag Bureau Data Letter 424, 11 July 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hubbard's words, ''The Volunteer Minister's Handbook'' "will be broadly distributed on Scn and non-Scientology lines, bought by the man on the street. He'll use some of the data, produce some miracles, save a marriage or two, rescue some kid from drugs, help his next door neighbor who's upset because her child's failing in school and couldn't care less, plus brighten up her yawning of Spring and teach him to study, and handle Aunt Martha's dizziness with assists."&lt;ref name="FBDL 424"/&gt;

Each Volunteer Minister pays to attend a two-week course and purchase Scientology materials; in 1994, these materials cost $435.&lt;ref name="WarmCold"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=Wayne|title=WANTED // WARM HEARTS, COLD CASH|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=29 May 1994|quote=Scientologists who enroll as volunteer ministers buy a $100 handbook and take a $335 course on how to use the book}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is called ''The Scientology Handbook'' and is 968 pages long.&lt;ref name="WarmCold"/&gt;

Scientology spokesman Eric Roux writes: “A Scientology volunteer minister is trained to bring spiritual assistance to anyone in any aspect of life, whether it is to increase his communication ability, his study skills, help raising children or save marriages, as well as dozens of other domains of intervention.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = French court convicts Church of Scientology of fraud | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/27/france.scientology.fraud/index.html | work = CNN | date = October 27, 2009 | accessdate = March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt;

==Origins==
{{Rquote|right|He should represent himself to the person or the person's family as a minister whose compassion was compelled by the newspaper story concerning the person|[[L. Ron Hubbard]]|&lt;ref name="3 methods" /&gt;}}
The program is the successor to earlier Scientology outreach efforts, notably the "Casualty Contact" program for recruiting new Scientologists (called "[[preclear]]s") from hospitals, the scenes of accidents and other places where people might have experienced trauma. As Hubbard put it, "One takes every daily paper he can get his hands on and cuts from it every story whereby he might have a preclear. [...] He should represent himself to the person or the person's family as a minister whose compassion was compelled by the newspaper story concerning the person. [...]."&lt;ref name="3 methods"&gt;Hubbard, "Three methods of dissemination," Professional Auditor's Bulletin 73, 28 February 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard advised that "using his minister's card, an auditor need only barge into any non-sectarian hospital, get permission to visit the wards from the superintendent, mentioning nothing about processing but only about taking care of people's souls."&lt;ref name="Dissem Tips"&gt;Hubbard, "Dissemination Tips," HCO Bulletin 15 September 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The primary objective was simply to recruit more members for Scientology: "Some small percentage of the persons visited or their families will turn up in his group. Thus he will build a group and naturally from that group he will get a great many individual preclears."&lt;ref name="3 methods"/&gt; This was, however, not how the program was to be presented to the general public: "A great many miracles will follow in his wake and he is later to become a subject of the press himself. However, in handling the press we should simply say that it is a mission of the Church to assist those who are in need of assistance."&lt;ref name="Dissem Tips"/&gt;

The Volunteer Ministers program is also intended to operate as a recruitment activity. As Hubbard puts it,

:As the benefits of the Volunteer Minister program begin to spread throughout the society, a rank and file of people that have been helped will begin to accumulate. These people will begin to feed into [[Scientology Missions International|missions]] and Churches of Scientology from wherever the Volunteer Minister has been at work.&lt;ref name="HCOPL 22-2-91"/&gt;

==Organizational aspects==
[[Image:Gulttält1.jpg|thumb|250px|Scientology volunteer minister tent in Sweden, October 2008]]
In recent years, the Church of Scientology has heavily promoted and greatly increased the profile and size of the Volunteer Ministers program. Church publications say that there are over 95,000 Volunteer Ministers - more than the [[Peace Corps]], [[Americorps]] and [[United Nations]] volunteer programs combined.&lt;ref&gt;The Bridge, Magazine of the Church of Scientology of Sydney. Issue 385, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
The Church has set a target of recruiting as many Volunteer Ministers as there are policemen in each of the principal countries in which Scientology is active. In 2001, the Church announced a number of target quotas for Volunteer Minister recruitment, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"Cause" magazine, Magazine of the International Ecclesiastical League of Pastors (I HELP), December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an ARIS demographic study by the City University of New York (CUNY) estimated in 2000 that there may only be 55,000 Scientologists in the whole of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kosmin, Barry A.

==Controversy==

As with many of the Church of Scientology's programs, the Volunteer Ministers have generated controversy and criticism. The organization provides "spiritual relief" parallel with medical treatment, but also does simple tasks such as helping cleanup or fetch food and generally assist the disaster effort as seems indicated.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They have been accused of attempting to take advantage of disasters in order to promote Scientology to a grief-stricken populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Janaka | last = Perera | title = Scientology: Cult of greed in divine garb | url = http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2005/06/10/scientology-cult-greed-divine-garb | work = [[Asian Tribune]] | date = 2005-06-10 | accessdate = 2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Church of Scientology insists that assists are given parallel to medical treatment, not in place of it; the Handbook for Scientology Assists stresses in its basic guidelines:  "Always seek first aid and medical attention when needed.  An assist is not a substitute for medical attention or treatment by a qualified doctor.  First, call the doctor.  Then assist the person as you can."&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard "Assists Processing Handbook" page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Volunteer Minister program most heavily promoted by Scientology took place in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Critics of Scientology accused the organization of attempting to take advantage of the disaster in order to promote Scientology to the grief-stricken populace in the area. The National Mental Health Association issued a public warning in response to the conduct of Scientologists in the immediate aftermath of September 11, claiming that Scientologists were "Intentionally confusing [the] public" by presenting themselves as mental health service providers. According to NMHA President Michael M. Faenza, "The public needs to understand that the Scientologists are using this tragedy to recruit new members. They are not providing mental health assistance."&lt;ref name="NMHA" /&gt;

In Russia, after the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] tragedy in 2004, the Health Ministry ordered Scientologists out of the area, saying "that various psychological tactics the groups use, including what it called hypnosis, may be harmful not only for adults, but for children that have already suffered severe mental shock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/10/12/scientologybeslan.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041016034857/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/10/12/scientologybeslan.shtml | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2004-10-16 | title = Health Ministry Asks Police to Shut Down Church of Scientology in Beslan | accessdate = 2006-10-21 | date = 2004-10-12 | publisher = MosNews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/10/22/scientologists.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041031024305/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/10/22/scientologists.shtml | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2004-10-31 | title = Scientologists Sent Packing from Beslan — Police | accessdate = 2006-10-21 | date = 2004-10-22 | publisher = MosNews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], Volunteer Ministers played a similar role in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], targeting the families of victims and emergency workers. As in the United States in 2001, this resulted in controversy, and it was reported that Volunteer Ministers had been removed from the vicinity of survivors of the bus bombing in Tavistock Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=7/7 War on Britain: Sick Comfort|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=12 July 2005|first=Stephen|last=Moyes|pages=10|location=London|quote=At the bus-bomb scene, 12 Scientologists in yellow T- shirts carrying the words Volunteer Minister were ushered away from survivors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that the [[Metropolitan Police]] had agreed to give the Church of Scientology privileged access to the Police Message Broadcasting System, enabling the Church to dispatch Volunteer Minister rapid-response teams in the event of future emergencies in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Met allows Cruise's sect access to data on security alerts | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23389685-details/article.do | work =  | publisher = [[Evening Standard]] | date = 2007-03-20 | accessdate = 2008-03-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407213023/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23389685-details/article.do | archive-date = 2008-04-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Fletcher, director of the London branch of [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]] and Stefania Cisco, a Director of Special Affairs for Scientology, admitted to an undercover [[BBC]] reporter that the purpose of the volunteer ministers was to keep the psychiatrists away, and called this "spiritual security".&lt;ref name="FiveLive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsfrombree.co.uk/stolgy_25.htm Transcript of BBC Radio report on Volunteer Ministers, 2 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Virginia Tech massacre]], April 16, 2007, 20 Volunteer Ministers were on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = George Rush |author2=Joanna Rush Molloy  | title = Critics: Scientologists' Va. trip a time to prey | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/r_m/2007/04/18/2007-04-18_critics_scientologists_va_trip_a_time_to.html | publisher = [[NY Daily News]] | date = 2007-04-17 | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulletins to Scientology members said that help had been requested by the university provost, the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[Red Cross]], but these organizations denied that any requests had been made.

'''Weixinism''' (唯心教 ''Wéixīnjiào''), institutionally also known by the extended title of '''Holy Church of the Heart-Only''' (唯心聖教 ''Wéixīn Shèngjiào'') is one of the [[Chinese salvationist religions]] born in [[Taiwan]] in the late 20th century. It was founded in 1984 in [[Taichung]] by [[Grand Master Hun Yuan]]. Its global core membership is "about 300,000, with a larger audience estimated by Taiwan's Ministry of Internal Affairs at 1,000,000".&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The church has quickly spread to mainland [[China]] since the early 2000s, where it functions as a platform for joint initiatives of the Chinese mainland and Taiwanese governments for the renewal of Chinese culture. It has also developed as a worldwide religious movement, attracting followers not only from the Chinese diaspora, but also communities of other races, including East Asians and even Westerners.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Weixinism operates a synthesis and reproposition for the modern times of ancient [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]] and [[philosophy]], primarily focused on the "orthodox lineages of ''[[Yijing]]'' and ''[[fengshui]]''",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hunyuan.tw/m/?disp=pwpeace&amp;language=ENG&amp;page=5 Weixinism propagates Chinese culture and Yi-Ching]".

==Founding==
[[File:Grand Master Hun Yuan.jpg|thumb|Grand Master Hun Yuan]]

Weixinism was founded in the 1980s, in a context where the end of [[martial law in Taiwan]], with the consequent affirmation of [[freedom of religion]], allowed several new religious movements to operate openly and eventually to gain legal recognition. At the same time, in the aftermath of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the mainland, several local new religious movements presented themselves as the guardians of Chinese "orthodoxy" in religious beliefs, intended as the genuine religious and cultural tradition that had developed throughout centuries of Chinese history.&lt;ref name="Chang 2016, p. 4"/&gt;

Among the most successful of such movements&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; was Weixinism, which was founded as the result of the mystical experiences of Chang Yi-Jui, born in [[Zhongliao, Nantou]], Taiwan, in 1944, and later known as Grand Master Hun Yuan. Before falling seriously ill in 1982, Chang, who operated a land survey company in Taiwan, was not particularly religious, although he had been interested for years in ''[[Yijing]]'' and ''[[fengshui]]''.&lt;ref name="Chang 2016, p. 5"&gt;Chang (2016), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed his recovery to a miraculous intervention and vowed to dedicate his remaining life to spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed to have received messages both from the [[Chinese theology#Yudi|Jade Deity]], one of the representations of the [[Chinese theology|supreme God]], and from [[Guiguzi]], a name that indicates both a group of writings compiled between the late [[Warring States]] period and the end of the [[Han Dynasty]] and their author, later deified in Chinese folk religion.&lt;ref name="Chang 2016, p. 5"/&gt; Feeling he was now mystically united with Guiguzi, Chang opened a small worship hall in Taichung and started gathering followers. In 1984, he renamed the hall [[Shennong]] Temple and claimed to have received by divine revelation the name and title of Grand Master Hun Yuan.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he registered his movement as Weixinism, a name meaning "Heart(or Mind)-Only" teaching.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the headquarters were moved to larger facilities in [[Nantou County]], in a complex known as the Hsien Fo Temple.&lt;ref name="Chang 2016, p. 5"/&gt; The movement’s growth led to the establishment of some forty branch temples in Taiwan, and overseas branches in China, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, the United States, Canada, and Spain.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of temples, including a large headquarters complex known as the "City (or Temple) of the Eight Symbols" on Yumen Mountain in [[Henan]], have been built in mainland China since 2001.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Another headquarters complex has been built in 2008 in [[Nantou City]], Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and society==
[[File:Main temple of the City of the Eight Symbols (八卦城), the holy see of Weixinism (唯心教) in Hebi (鹤壁市), Henan, China.jpg|thumb|The City of the Eight Symbols in [[Qi County, Hebi|Qi]], [[Hebi]], is the headquarters of the Weixinist Church in [[Henan]], mainland China.]]
Weixinism success is largely due to it having emerged as a leading provider of courses on ''Yijing'' and ''fengshui'', two systems that are immensely popular both in Taiwan and in China and among the international Chinese diaspora, and increasingly interest Westerners as well.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Academic courses are offered through the Weixinist College, which has been accredited in 2013 by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education of Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2016), p. 5; Ministry of Education (Taiwan) 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; while the I Ching University proposes "lifelong learning" seminars and coordinates courses offering ''Yijing'' teaching to children. Two million children have attended such courses between their launching in 1996 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Ling (2013), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Weixinism has also organized a number of academic conferences, featuring scholars from Taiwan, Mainland China, Korea, and the West.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church's educational effort also includes the publication of several books by Grand Master Hun Yuan and the daily television programs ''View All Perspectives of I Ching – Feng Shui'' (1998), ''Everybody Comes to Learn I Ching'' (1998), and ''Feng Shui of My Home'' (digital, 2004), as well as the group’s own TV channel, Wei Xin TV.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The Weixinist Church insists that ''Yijing'' should be taught not only as a philosophical system, but as a practical tool for divination, and that ''fengshui'' goes beyond the harmonious arrangement of buildings and furniture, and is in fact a complete system teaching how to live in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2016), p. 5; Hun Yuan (2016b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Weixinism's notion of ''fengshui'' also motivated the movement to establish in 1999, in the aftermath of the devastating [[1999 Jiji earthquake]], the I Ching and Feng Shui Interest Circle, which later evolved into the Feng Shui Interest Circle Service Team. The organization offers advise on how to build [[anti-seismic]] buildings according to the principles of ''fengshui'', but also helps needy families in both Taiwan and Mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs are aimed at improving the conditions in Taiwanese factories and other workplaces by applying the principles of ''fengshui'' there.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weixinism worships Guiguzi who, according to the tradition, operated the first school of diplomacy in the world. One of the main activities of the movement is the promotion of initiatives for the spiritual reconciliation of Taiwan and mainland China, which is seen as a pre-condition for the solution of political problems. The Taiwan Weixin Association for World Peace has been established in 2009. Its goals go beyond local problems in Taiwan and include the promotion of world peace through the healing of grievances and resentments deriving from centuries of war and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrines==
{{Further|Chinese theology|Wufang Shangdi}}
Weixinist theology is rooted in a mythical history of Chinese culture and civilization, largely derived from the tradition of Chinese folk religion. This history starts with the ''[[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]]''. The Kunlun civilization is said to have flourished in remote times at the beginning of human history. Kunlun’s wisdom was inherited by [[Fuxi]], a king in the third millennium BCE and reputedly the originator of the ''Yijing'', and transmitted by him through [[Jiutian Xuannü]], the goddess of longevity incarnated on Earth, to the Three Ancestors of China: the ''[[Yan Emperor|Yandi]]'' ("Flame God"), the ''[[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]]'' ("Yellow God") and ''[[Chiyou]]''.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter, Chiyou, is regarded in Chinese folk religion as an enemy against whom the Flame and Yellow Emperors had to fight. One of the peculiarities of Weixinism is its rehabilitation of Chiyou. He is regarded as the ancestor of China's ethnic minorities and the healing of the wounds left by the conflicts and wars that accompanied Chinese history requires, according to the movement, that Chiyou be worshiped as equal in dignity to the Yan and Yellow Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2016), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guiguzi, according to Weixinist doctrines, was the legitimate heir of the Three Emperors. The awakened being Wang Chan Lao Chu incarnated in Guiguzi and is now mysteriously united with Grand Master Hun Yuan. The unbroken line connecting Kunlun to present-day Weixinism through the Three Ancestors and Guiguzi should guarantee that the movement embodies the most traditional Chinese "orthodoxy".&lt;ref name="Chang 2016, p. 5"/&gt; The Three Ancestors are said to be at the origins also of the Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean earliest royal families, thus incorporating a good part of the Far East within the same lineage.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2016"&gt;Introvigne (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
The revelation of Guiguzi to Grand Master Hun Yuan and the latter's writings, also said to be inspired by Guiguzi, form an impressive corpus. It includes sixteen ''Apocalypse Scriptures'' and more than 18,000 volumes of speeches, writings, and comments of Grand Master Hun Yuan. Most of what he says is faithfully recorded by his followers and included in these collected works, known as ''Weixin Canon'', and continuously growing.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2010–).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==
[[File:United Ancestor Worship Cerimony Taipei 2017 01.jpg|thumb|The annual United Ancestor Worship Ceremony organized by Weixin Shengjiao in Taipei, 2017.]]
Taiwanese scholars have interpreted Weixinism as an institutionalized form of traditional, non-institutional Chinese folk religion, "the institutionalization of […] diffuse folk beliefs".&lt;ref name="Chang 2016, p. 4"/&gt; Ritual, including chanting, is central in the movement. It includes daily ritual services at the headquarters and in the branch temples, as well as larger and more elaborate ceremonies. The movement believes that the systematic chanting of mantras by its members has averted or alleviated a number of world catastrophes.&lt;ref&gt;Hun Yuan (2016a), pp. 149–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2004, the Weixinist Church has organized each year on January 1 in Taipei's Linkou Stadium the "Unified Ancestor Worship Ceremony for Chinese in the 21st Century", to bring peace to the souls of all ancestors, particularly those who perished in the many wars fought during Chinese history. These spectacular ceremonies draw crowds in excess of 30,000 each year. Presidents of the republic of Taiwan, cabinet ministers, and other political leaders have also participated.&lt;ref&gt;See Weixin Shengjiao (2004), p. 90, and Weixin Shengjiao (2008), p. 54. Introvigne wrote that the ceremony "attracts great crowds. Taiwanese political dignitaries, including presidents of the Republic, have also participated in the event" (Introvigne, 2016). According to Fiona Chang, "this is a major event for ancestral worship and is also a carnival that mobilizes over 30 thousand members of the religious group, inviting politicians and businessmen from around the world, as well as representatives of Chinese religious groups" (Chang, 2016, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Weixinism believes that ancestor worship ceremonies have a crucial role in promoting world peace and ushering in a future millennial era without conflicts that would last for 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Huang (2016), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
