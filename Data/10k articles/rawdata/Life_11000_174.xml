|publisher=Le Vif
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Russian entrepreneur [[Dmitry Itskov]] in February 2011 with the participation of Russian specialists in the field of neural interfaces, robotics, artificial organs and systems.

The main goal of the 2045 Initiative, as stated on site, is "to create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier, and extending life, including to the point of immortality. We devote particular attention to enabling the fullest possible dialogue between the world’s major spiritual traditions, science and society".

==Future prospects==
The 2045 Initiative has a roadmap for developing cybernetic [[immortality]].&lt;ref name = social&gt;[http://2045.com/ideology/ About Us, Strategic Social Initiative, 2045]&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative has the goal for an avatar controlled by a "brain-computer" interface to be developed between 2015 and 2020, between 2020 and 2025 creating an autonomous life-support system for the human brain linked to a robot, between 2030 and 2035 creating a computer model of the brain and human consciousness with the means to transfer it into an artificial carrier, and by 2045 create a new era for humanity with holographic bodies.&lt;ref name = social/&gt;

==Avatar Project==

One of the featured [[Life extension|life-extension]] projects is to design an artificial [[humanoid]] body (called an "avatar") and an advanced [[brain–computer interface]] system. On the biological side, a life support system will be developed for hosting a human brain inside the avatar and maintaining it alive and functional. A later phase of the project will research into the creation of an [[artificial brain]] into which the original individual [[consciousness]] may be transferred.

=== Avatar A ===

A robotic copy of a human body remotely capable of interpreting commands directly from the mind, and sending information back to the mind in a form that can be interpreted via [[brain–computer interface]]. It is estimated to be popularized in or before 2020.

=== Avatar B ===

An avatar in which a human brain is [[Brain transplant|transplanted]] at the end of one's life. Avatar B has an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment, possibly mounted into an existing Avatar A Chassis. Deadline of this phase is year 2025.

=== Avatar C ===

An avatar with an artificial brain to which a human personality is transferred for emulation at the end of one's life. The first successful attempt to upload one's personality to a computer is estimated to happen around 2035.

=== Avatar D ===

A [[Holography|hologram]]- or [[diagram]]-like avatar. This is the ultimate goal of this project but is optional since, assuming either the upload is involuntary or all humans chose to upload, biological diseases are prevented in the previous phase, and it is far away from current technological achievement and our understanding on physics.

==Reception==

Professor [[George M. Church]] has complained that "there's a lot of dots that aren't connected in (Itskov's) plans. It's not a real road map." [[Martine A. Rothblatt]], the founder of [[United Therapeutics]], has claimed the Avatar Project is "no more wild than in the early '60s, when we saw the advent of [[liver transplantation|liver]] and [[Kidney transplantation|kidney]] transplants."&lt;ref name=nytimes_06_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Segal|first=David|title=Dmitry Itskov and the Avatar Quest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=9 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vithal Sakharam Parasnis''' (17xx-18xx) was popularly known as 'Aba' hence he is usually referred to as '''Aba Parasnis''' by sources. He was a [[Sanskrit]], [[Vedic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] scholar of the early 19th century [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name = "keer76"&gt;{{cite book|title=Shahu Chhatrapati: A Royal Revolutionary|page=81|author=Dhananjay Keer|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kulkarni"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Satara Raj, 1818-1848: A Study in History, Administration, and Culture|author=Sumitra Kulkarni|pages=186, 143, 144, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "milton1987"&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and society in Maharashtra|author1=Milton Israel|author2=N.K.Wagle|year=1987|pages=162, 163, 166, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deshpande2007"/&gt; He was a native of the [[Satara_district|Satara]] district of [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name ="rane"/&gt;

==Consultant to James Grand Duff==
Aba was one of the three scholars who were consultants to the British Historian [[James Grant Duff]], specifically in [[Persian language|Persian]] sources of the 
history of [[Maharashtra]] - the other two scholars being Balajipant Natu and Balvantrao Chitnis. Duff would persistently demand more material and would consult and ask them for interpretations of terms and policies and explanations for events in the materials that he had in his possession. His questions were directed to the origin and justification of specific policies and concepts - taxes such as ''[[chauth]]'' and ''[[chauth|sardeshmukhi]]''. Duff would be frustrated by what he deemed as "inconsistent answers" from these knowledgeable people. The scholars such as Parasnis, on their part, resented the "insistent cross examination" by Duff.&lt;ref name= "milton1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deshpande2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Creative Pasts: Historical Memory and Identity in Western India|author=Prachi Deshpande|year=2007|pages=77, 78|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on Vedic scriptures and Hindu Shastras==
Parasnis is most notable for a unique "Brahmin varna vs Kshatriya varna" debate that took place at [[Satara (city)|Satara]]. It involved discussions and disputes related to the intricacies of the Hindu [[Shastras]], [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]]. The Kshatriya varna was represented by Parasnis and the Brahman varna was 
represented by Raghvacharya Gajendragadkar. This historic debate took place in the early 19th century Maharashtra. It was attended by hundreds of prominent Brahmins all over Maharashtra. Historians have credited Parasnis for debating effectively and "holding his own".&lt;ref name = "keer76"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "milton1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salunkhe"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chhatrapati Shahu, the piller of social democracy|page=114|author1=Salunkhe|author2=M.

Giuffre |pages=784, 789|language=italian|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Two Sanskrit books "Karmakalapdruma" and "Siddhantavijaya" were authored by Parasnis and published by [[Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara|Pratapsimha]]. 
The "Siddhantavijaya" is considered important because it gives details of the [[Maratha clan system]]. It is written in Sanskrit with some content in
marathi. The other Sanskrit scripture authored by him is "Karmakalpadruma". It is a manual for Hindu rituals and hence called the [[Sanskara (rite of passage)#Samskara as rituals|samskara]] manual. A translation of Siddhanatavijaya and some commentary was written by Mahadev Ganesh Dongre in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name= "milton1987"/&gt;

==Sanskrit School==
Pratapsimha realized the importance of the knowledge of [[Sanskrit]] and decided to open a "pathshala" to teach Sanskrit to boys from the [[Maratha]] caste. Parasnis was the first head of this school.&lt;ref name= "milton1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="rane"&gt;{{cite book|title= Chhatrapati Pratapsinha Maharaj Yanche Charitra|author=R.G.Rane|pages=216, 137|language=marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3953">An '''and–or tree''' is a [[graphical representation]] of the reduction of [[problem]]s (or goals) to [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] and [[disjunction]]s of subproblems (or subgoals).

==Example==
The and-or tree:

[[Image:Andortree.png|frameless|319px]]

represents the [[Candidate solution|search space]] for solving the problem P, using the goal-reduction methods:

:P if Q and R

:P if S

:Q if T

:Q if U

==Definitions==
Given an initial problem P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and set of problem solving methods of the form:

:P if P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and … and P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

the associated and-or tree is a set of labelled nodes such that: 

# The root of the tree is a node labelled by P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
# For every node N labelled by a problem or sub-problem P and for every method of the form P if P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and … and P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists a set of children nodes N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of the node N, such that each node N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is labelled by P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The nodes are conjoined by an arc, to distinguish them from children of N that might be associated with other methods.

A node N, labelled by a problem P, is a success node if there is a method of the form P if nothing (i.e., P is a "fact"). The node is a failure node if there is no method for solving P.

If all of the children of a node N, conjoined by the same arc, are success nodes, then the node N is also a success node. Otherwise the node is a failure node.

==Search strategies==

An and-or tree specifies only the search space for solving a problem. Different [[Tree traversal|search strategies]] for searching the space are possible. These include searching the tree depth-first, breadth-first, or best-first using some measure of desirability of solutions. The search strategy can be sequential, searching or generating one node at a time, or parallel, searching or generating several nodes in parallel.

==Relationship with logic programming==
The methods used for generating and-or trees are propositional [[Logic programming|logic programs]] (without variables). In the case of logic programs containing variables, the solutions of conjoint sub-problems must be compatible. Subject to this complication, sequential and parallel search strategies for and-or trees provide a computational model for executing logic programs.

==Relationship with two-player games==
And–or trees can also be used to represent the search spaces for two-person games. The root node of such a tree represents the problem of one of the players winning the game, starting from the initial state of the game. Given a node N, labelled by the problem P of the player winning the game from a particular state of play, there exists a single set of conjoint children nodes, corresponding to all of the opponents responding moves. 
For each of these children nodes, there exists a set of non-conjoint children nodes, corresponding to all of the player's defending moves.

For solving game trees with [[proof-number search]] family of algorithms, game trees are to be mapped to and-or trees. MAX-nodes (i.e. maximizing player to move) are represented as OR nodes, MIN-nodes map to AND nodes. The mapping is possible, when the search is done with only a binary goal, which usually is "player to move wins the game".

'''Animal-borne bomb attacks''' are the use of animals as delivery systems for explosives. The explosives are strapped to a [[pack animal]] such as a horse, mule or donkey. The pack animal may be set off in a crowd. 

Projects of [[bat bomb]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Project Pigeon|pigeon bomb]] have also been studied.

==Incidents==

===Afghanistan===
In 2009, the Taliban strapped an [[improvised explosive device]] to a donkey. The gate guard noticed something suspicious when a group of men let the donkey go a short way from the camp and then hurried off. The donkey was stopped with a rifle shot.

In April 2013, in Kabul, a bomb attached to a donkey blew up in front of a police security post, killing a policeman and wounding three civilians.

On 21 November 2003, eight rockets were fired from [[donkey]] carts at the Iraqi oil ministry and two hotels in downtown [[Baghdad]], injuring one man and causing some damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/rockets-slam-into-iraq-s-oil-ministry-two-hotels-1.106428 Rockets slam into Iraq's Oil Ministry, two hotels] Associated Press, 21 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004 a donkey in [[Ramadi]] was loaded with explosives and set off towards a US-run checkpoint. It exploded before it was able to injure or kill anyone.  The incident, along with a number of similar incidents involving dogs, fueled fears of terrorist practices of using living animals as weapons, a change from an older practice of using the bodies of dead animals to hold explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Focus/GH12Dh02.html Dogs of war can be friend or foe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504164945/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Focus/GH12Dh02.html |date=2009-05-04 }} August 12, 2005.

Malia Sufangi, a young Lebanese woman, was caught in the Security Zone in November 1985 with an explosive device mounted on a donkey with which she had failed to carry out an attack.&lt;ref name=Ganor&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/saa26.htm] "Syria and Terrorism, Boaz Ganor, 15 November 1991, JCPA.&lt;/ref&gt;  She claimed that she had been recruited and dispatched by Syrian Brigadier-General [[Ghazi Kanaan]] who supplied the explosives and instructions on how the attack was to be carried out from his headquarters in the town of [[Anjer]] in the [[Bekaa Valley]].&lt;ref name=Ganor/&gt;

===United States===

In 1862, during the [[New Mexico Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]] a Confederate force approached the ford at [[Battle of Valverde|Valverde]], six miles north of [[Fort Craig]], hoping to cut Union communications between the fort and their headquarters in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].  About midnight, Union Captain James Craydon tried to blow up a few rebel picket posts by sending [[mule]]s loaded with barrels of fused gunpowder into the Confederate lines, but the faithful old army mules insisted on wandering back toward the Union camp before blowing to bits. Although the only casualties were two mules, the explosions stampeded a herd of Confederate beef cattle and horses into the Union's lines, so depriving the Confederate troops of some much-needed provisions and horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kerby|1958,1995|pp=66–67.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Wall Street bombing]] of 1920, an incident thought to be related to the [[1919 United States anarchist bombings]], [[anarchists]] used a bomb carried by horse-drawn cart.

===West Bank and Gaza Strip===
* June 25, 1995 – At approximately 11 a.m., a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] rode a [[booby trap|booby-trapped]] donkey cart to an Israeli army base west of [[Khan Yunis]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] and detonated it. The Palestinian and the donkey were killed, but no soldiers were wounded. [[Hamas]] claimed responsibility for the attack. Three soldiers were treated for minor shock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-5990814.html Suicide bomber explodes donkey cart near Khan Yunis, 3 soldiers hurt], Jerusalem Post 26-06-1995&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 17, 2001 – A Palestinian man rode a bomb-laden donkey cart up to an Israeli position in the southern Gaza Strip and set off a small explosion. Israeli soldiers destroyed the cart, and no soldiers were wounded. The Palestinian man was captured by the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/06/17/mideast.02/index.html Fragile Mideast cease-fire endures another day], CNN 17-06-2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 26, 2003 – Palestinian fighters strapped a bomb to a donkey and then exploded it remotely on the road between [[Jerusalem]] and [[Gush Etzion]]. No humans were injured in the attack. [[PETA]] director [[Ingrid Newkirk]] wrote to [[PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] asking him to keep animals out of the conflict. PETA was criticized for not objecting to killing of humans in the context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/24/animalwelfare.comment 'We're stunt queens.

* June 8, 2009 – Palestinian gunmen approached the [[Karni crossing]] between the Gaza Strip and Israel with several trucks and at least five [[horse]]s loaded with explosive devices and mines. The gunmen fired on IDF troops who observed them, and at least four gunmen were killed in the ensuing battle. A previously unknown organization called "the army of Allah's supporters" claimed responsibility for the foiled attack. The IDF estimated that the gunmen had planned to kidnap an Israeli soldier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31173253/ Militants, bomb-laden horses die in Gaza clash], AP 08-06-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3728087,00.html Gaza gunmen use booby-trapped horses against IDF], Ynet News 08-06-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* May 25, 2010 – A small Syrian-backed militant group in the Gaza Strip blew up a donkey cart laden with explosives close to the border with Israel. According to a spokesman for the group, more than 200 kilograms of [[dynamite]] were heaped on the animal-drawn cart. The explosives were detonated several dozen meters from the border fence with Israel. The animal was killed in the blast but no human injuries or damage were reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/donkey-bomb-claims-only-the-donkey-20100525-wb8r.html Donkey bomb claims only the donkey], AP 25-05-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3893975,00.html http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3893975,00.html], Ynet News 25-05-2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* July 19, 2014 - Hamas militants attempted to attack Israeli troops in Gaza with a bomb-laden donkey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17707">'''Artificial intelligence and law''' ('''AI and law''') is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) mainly concerned with applications of AI to [[legal informatics]] problems and original research on those problems.  It is also concerned to contribute in the other direction: to export tools and techniques developed in the context of legal problems to AI in general. For example, theories of legal decision making, especially models of [[argumentation theory|argumentation]], have contributed to [[knowledge representation and reasoning]]; models of social organization based on norms have contributed to [[multi-agent systems]]; reasoning with legal cases has contributed to [[case-based reasoning]]; and the need to store and retrieve large amounts of textual data has resulted in contributions to conceptual [[information retrieval]] and intelligent databases.

=== Formal models of legal reasoning ===

Formal models of legal texts and legal reasoning have been used in AI and Law to clarify issues, to give a more precise understanding and to provide a basis for implementations. A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and Sartor&lt;ref&gt;H. Prakken and G.Sartor, [http://www.cs.uu.nl/groups/IS/archive/henry/ReviewLogicAndLawRevised.pdf Law and logic: A review from an argumentation perspective], Artificial Intelligence. Available on-line June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, and has an excellent set of references.

An important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as "and" and "or" can be unclear (legal drafters do not observe the mathematical conventions in this respect). "Unless" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write "if and only if", although this is often what they intend by "if". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers.&lt;ref name="allen57" /&gt;

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand on AI and Law work involved the production of executable models of legislation. Originating in the LEGOL work of Ronald Stamper&lt;ref name="stamper77" /&gt;  the idea was to represent legislation using a formal language and to use this formalisation (typically with some sort of user interface to gather the facts of a particular case) as the basis for an expert system. This became popular, mainly using the Horn Clause subset of first order predicate calculus. In particular Sergot et al.'s representation of the British Nationality Act&lt;ref name="sergot1986" /&gt; did much to popularise the approach. In fact, as later work showed, this was an untypically suitable piece of legislation on which to employ the approach: it was new, and so had not been amended, relatively simple and almost all of the concepts were non-technical. Later work, such as that on Supplementary Benefits,&lt;ref&gt;T.J.M. Bench-Capon, G.O. Robinson, T.W. Routen, M.J. Sergot, Logic programming for large scale applications in law: a formalisation of supplementary benefit legislation, in: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1987, pp. 190–198.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that larger, more complicated (containing many cross references, exceptions, counterfactuals, and deeming provisions), legislation which used many highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions) and which had been the subject of many amendments produced a far less satisfactory final system. Some efforts were made to improve matters from a software engineering perspective, especially to handle problems such as cross reference, verification and frequent amendment. The use of hierarchical representations&lt;ref&gt;T. Routen, T.J.M. Bench-Capon, Hierarchical formalizations, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 35 (1991) 69–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  was suggested to address the first problem, and so-called isomorphic&lt;ref&gt;T.J.M. Bench-Capon, F.P. Coenen, Isomorphism and legal knowledge based systems, Artificial Intelligence and Law 1 (1992) 65–86.&lt;/ref&gt; representation was intended to address the other two. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became largely absorbed in the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called ontologies), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Gruber: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0256/614d1dc55962708db9b791f70a29370f1d76.pdf The Role of Common Ontology in Achieving Sharable, Reusable Knowledge Bases]. Knowledge Representation 1991: 601-602&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples in AI and Law include Valente's functional ontology&lt;ref&gt;Valente, A. 1995. Legal Knowledge Engineering; A Modelling Approach, IOS Press, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and the frame based ontologies of Visser and van Kralingen.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. van Kralingen, Pepijn R. S. Visser, Trevor J. M. Bench-Capon, [[H. Jaap van den Herik]]: A principled approach to developing legal knowledge systems. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. 51(6): 1127-1154 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies&lt;ref&gt;Rinke Hoekstra, Joost Breuker, Marcello Di Bello, Alexander Boer: [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-321/LOAIT07-Proceedings.pdf#page=43 The LKIF Core Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts].  Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Legal Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence Techniques. 2007: 43-63&lt;/ref&gt; to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.

Since law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Jones, M.J. Sergot, On the characterisation of law and computer systems: the normative systems perspective, in: J.-J.Ch. Meyer, R. Wieringa (Eds.), Deontic Logic in Computer Science: Normative System Specification, Wiley, 1993, pp. 275–307&lt;/ref&gt; In law directed obligations,&lt;ref&gt;H. Herrestad, C. Krogh, Obligations directed from bearers to counterparties, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1995, pp. 210–218.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby an obligation is owed to another named individual are of particular interest, since violations of such obligations are often the basis of legal proceedings.  There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Sergot, A computational theory of normative positions, ACM Trans. Comput. Log. 2 (2001) 581–622.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[multi-agent system]]s, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Esteva, Juan A. Rodríguez-Aguilar, Josep Lluís Arcos, Carles Sierra, Pere Garcia: Institutionalizing Open Multi-Agent Systems. ICMAS 2000: 381–382&lt;/ref&gt; the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Modgil, Nir Oren, Noura Faci, Felipe Meneguzzi, Simon Miles and Michael Luck, [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/6046/JournalMonitoring3.pdf?sequence=1 Monitoring Compliance with E-Contracts and Norms], Artificial Intelligence and Law 23(2) (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Law often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus&lt;ref&gt;R. Hernandez Marin, G. Sartor, [https://www.academia.edu/download/42420341/Time_and_norms_a_formalisation_in_the_ev20160208-3430-19hoaxl.pdf Time and norms: a formalisation in the event-calculus], in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.&lt;ref&gt;G. Governatori, A. Rotolo, G. Sartor, [https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9579/ic05.pdf Temporalised normative positions in defeasible logic], in: Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 2005, pp. 25–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any consideration of the use of logic to model law it needs to be borne in mind that law is inherently non-monotonic, as is shown by the rights of appeal enshrined in all legal systems, and the way in which interpretations of the law change over time.&lt;ref&gt;Schauer, Frederick. "On the supposed defeasibility of legal rules." Current Legal Problems 51.1 (1998): 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prakken, Henry, and Giovanni Sartor. "The three faces of defeasibility in the law."

Artificial Intelligence 77(2): 321–358 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; however, these concerns have been addressed through argumentation rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1493">'''Caecilia Metella''' (died 89 BC) was the second daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus]], consul in 123 BC. Her [[Caecilia Metella Balearica (priestess)|oldest sister]] was a [[Vestal virgin]].

Metella was married to [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (praetor 88 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]], a politician of an old, although somewhat impoverished, [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family. As a member of an important family and married into another, Balearica was one of Rome's most esteemed ''matronas''. She had a reputation of virtue and modesty, allied to an irreproachable conduct as a mother of two boys (Appius and Gaius) and three (or four) girls (Claudia Prima, Claudia Secunda, and Claudia Tertulla - this one known to history as [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Rex)|Clodia]]).

While pregnant with her sixth child, Metella had a dream of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] complaining about the neglect of her temple. As any other Roman would, she took the dream very seriously and proceeded to clean the temple herself, with the help of the [[Roman censor|censor]] Lucius Julius Caesar. Shortly afterwards, Metella died in childbirth. Her youngest son was to be the notorious [[Publius Clodius]].

[[File:Kaupo mälestusmärk.jpg|thumb|300px|Monument to Caupo at [[Krimulda Castle]] ]]
'''Caupo of Turaida''', or '''Kaupo''' (died September 21, 1217) was a leader of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]]-speaking [[Livonian people]] in the beginning of the 13th century, in what is now part of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]. He is sometimes called 'King of Livonia', [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] calls him ''quasi rex'', 'like a king'.

He was the first prominent Livonian to be [[Christianization|christened]]. He was probably [[Baptism|baptized]] around 1191 by a priest called Theoderic. He became an ardent Christian and friend of [[Albert of Buxhoeveden]], Bishop of [[Riga]], who took him 1203-1204 all the way to [[Rome]] and introduced him to [[Pope Innocent III]]. The Pope was impressed by the converted [[paganism|pagan]] chief and presented him a [[Bible]]. When he returned from travel, his tribe rebelled against him and Caupo helped to conquer and destroy his own former [[Castle of Turaida]] in 1212. The castle was rebuilt two years later as a stone castle that is well preserved even today.

Caupo participated in a [[Northern Crusades|crusader]] raid against the still pagan [[Estonians]] and was killed in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] in 1217 against the troops of the Estonian leader [[Lembitu of Lehola]]. He did not have any male heirs as his son Bertold had been killed 1210 in the [[Battle of Ümera]] against Estonians. He left his inheritance to the church, but the [[Lieven]] family later claimed female-line descent from him.

Modern Estonians, [[Latvians]], and the remaining few Livonians do not have consensus view about the historical role of Caupo. Some consider him traitor and enemy agent. Others consider him a visionary leader who wanted his people to be part of Christian and European culture. Both these judgments attribute 19th-century views about nationality to a medieval chieftain. Latvian legends, however, are unequivocal: there he is named "Kaupo the accursed, the scourge of the Livs,... Kaupo who has sold his soul to the foreign bishops."&lt;ref&gt;Urch, R.O.G. Latvia{{mdash}}Country and People. London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd. 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chaetocladus''''' is a non-calcifying genus of unicellular [[green algae]] known from the [[Upper Silurian]].

==Morphology==
''Chaetocladus'' thalli range from 2–6&amp;nbsp;cm in height and average 1&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name=LoDuca1997/&gt; They comprise a parallel-sided, unbranching axis which is surrounded by leaf-like [[Ramification (botany)|ramification]]s.

==Fossil record==
''Chaetocladus'' is known from upper Silurian konservat [[l\agerstätte]], and found in association with other [[alga]]e, [[arthropod]]s, and [[annelid]] worms.&lt;ref name=LoDuca1997&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Due to its morphological similarity to the extant order [[Dasycladales]], ''Chaetocladus'' is considered to be an [[stem group|early cousin]] of this order.  Unlike the majority of Dasycladales, ''Chaetocladus'' does not form deposit calcite - therefore it required much rarer [[taphonomic]] conditions to be preserved.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2006&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1016/j.revpalbo.2006.03.023
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some genera now recognised as ''Chaetocladus'' were originally described as [[Graptolite]]s.&lt;ref name=Duca1990&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">The '''consequence argument''' is an argument against [[compatibilism]] popularised by [[Peter van Inwagen]]. The argument claims that if [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]] have no control over the facts of the past then the agent has no control of the consequences of those facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arguments for Incompatibilism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/#ChoConArg|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] gives the following [[syllogism]] of the argument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compatibilism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/#ConArg|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#No one has power over the facts of the past and the laws of nature.
#The events of the past and the laws of nature entail every fact of the future (i.e., [[determinism]] is true)
#Therefore, no one has power over the facts of the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or in van Inwagan's own words, in ''An Essay on Free Will'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Inwagen|first1=Peter|title=An Essay on Free Will|date=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198246244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHqh3BQVBt4C|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If determinism is true, then our acts are the consequence of laws of nature and events in the remote past. But it's not up to us what went on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up to us. (p. 56)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''David Abell''' or '''Abel Ebel''' (died c. 1576) was a [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Germany|German]] [[composer]] and [[organist]]. He worked in the ''Kantoriet'' (the choir and orchestra of the Danish king) of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]].

From 1555 to 1572 he was employed by the Marienkirche in [[Lübeck]], after which he returned to [[Copenhagen]] on [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]]'s insistence. In the Kantoriet's records from 1541, there are four choral works by him.

A '''death mask''' is a likeness (typically in [[wax]] or [[plaster cast]]) of a person's face following [[death]], often made by taking a cast or impression directly from the corpse. Death masks may be mementos of the dead, or be used for creation of [[portrait]]s.  Such casts obviate idealised representations by revealing the actual features. It is sometimes possible to identify portraits that have been painted from death masks, because of the characteristic slight distortions of the features caused by the weight of the plaster during the making of the [[Molding (process)|mold]].

The main purpose of the death mask from the [[Middle Ages]] until  the [[19th century]] was to serve  as a model for sculptors in creating statues and busts of the deceased person. Not until the 1800s did such masks become valued for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Almanac #2|last=WALLECHINSKY|first=Irving|last2=WALLACE|first2=Irving|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1978|isbn=0553011375|location=New York|pages=1189–1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other [[culture]]s a death mask may be a '''funeral mask''', an image placed on the face of the deceased before burial rites, and normally buried with them. The best known of these are the masks used in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[mummification]] process, such as [[Tutankhamun's mask]], and those from [[Mycenaean Greece]] such as the [[Mask of Agamemnon]].

In some European countries, it was common for death masks to be used as part of the [[effigy]] of the deceased, displayed at state funerals; the [[coffin portrait]] was an alternative. [[Mourning portraits]] were also painted, showing the subject [[lying in repose]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries masks were also used to permanently record the features of unknown corpses for purposes of identification. This function was later replaced by [[post-mortem photography]].

In the cases of people whose faces were damaged by their death, it was common to take casts of their hands. An example of this occurred in the case of [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]], the Canadian statesman whose face was shattered by the bullet which assassinated him in 1868.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{anchor|lifemask}}
When taken from a living subject, such a cast is called a '''life mask'''. Proponents of [[phrenology]] used both death masks and life masks for [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] purposes.

==History==

===Sculptures===
[[File:CairoEgMuseumTaaMaskMostlyPhotographed.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tutankhamun's mask]]]]

Masks of deceased persons are part of traditions in many countries. The most important process of the funeral ceremony in [[ancient Egypt]] was the mummification of the body, which, after prayers and consecration, was put into a sarcophagus enameled and decorated with gold and gems. A special element of the rite was a sculpted mask, put on the face of the deceased. This mask was believed to strengthen the spirit of the mummy and guard the soul from evil spirits on its way to the afterworld. The best known mask is [[Tutankhamun's mask]]. Made of gold and gems, the mask conveys the highly stylized features of the ancient ruler. Such masks were not, however, made from casts of the features; rather, the [[Mummy|mummification]] process itself preserved the features of the deceased.

In 1876 the archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] discovered in [[Mycenae]] six graves, which he was confident belonged to kings and ancient Greek heroes—[[Agamemnon]], [[Cassandra]], Evrimdon and their associates. To his surprise, the skulls were covered with gold masks. It is now thought most unlikely that the masks actually belonged to Agamemnon and other heroes of the [[Homer]]ic [[Epic poetry|epic]]s; in fact they are several centuries older.

The lifelike character of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] portrait sculptures has been attributed to the earlier Roman use of [[wax]] to preserve the features of deceased family members (the so-called ''imagines maiorum''). The wax masks were subsequently reproduced in more durable stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.W. Janson]] with Dora Jane Janson, ''History of Art: A Survey of the Major Visual Arts from the Dawn of History to the Present Day'', [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], [[Prentice-Hall]], and [[New York City|New York]], [[Harry N. Abrams]], 1962, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of masks in the [[ancestor cult]] is also attested in [[Etruria]]. Excavations of tombs in the area of the ancient city of [[Clusium]] (modern [[Chiusi]], [[Tuscany]]) have yielded a number of sheet bronze masks dating from the Etruscan Late [[Orientalising period]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8010712/_Some_considerations_on_the_function_and_meaning_of_the_Etruscan_bronze_masks_from_Chiusi_seventh_century_BC_._In_H._Duinker_E._Hopman_and_J._Steding_eds._2014._Proceedings_of_the_11th_annual_Symposium_Onderzoek_Jonge_Archeologen._Groningen_Stichting_Onderzoek_Jonge_Archeologen_pp._65-74  N. Steensma, Some considerations on the function and meaning of the Etruscan bronze "masks" from Chiusi (seventh century BC), in: H. Duinker, E. Hopman &amp; J. Steding (eds.),  ''Proceedings of the 11th annual Symposium Onderzoek Jonge Archeologen'', Groningen 2014, p. 65-74].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century it was thought that they were related to the Mycenaean examples, but whether they served as actual death masks cannot be proven. The most credited hypothesis holds that they were originally fixed to cinerary urns, to give them a human appearance. In Orientalising Clusium, the anthropomorphization of urns was a prevalent phenomenon that was strongly rooted in local religious beliefs.

===Casts===
[[File:Napoleon Death Mask.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze death mask of [[Napoleon]]]]

In the late [[Middle Ages]], a shift took place from sculpted masks to true death masks, made of wax or plaster. These masks were not interred with the deceased. Instead, they were used in funeral ceremonies and were later kept in libraries, museums, and universities. Death masks were taken not only of deceased royalty and nobility ([[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[House of Sforza|Sforza]]), but also of eminent persons—composers, [[dramaturge]]s, military and political leaders, philosophers, poets, and scientists, such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (whose death mask was taken on the island of [[Saint Helena]]), [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] (whose death mask is preserved at [[Warwick Castle]]), [[Joseph Haydn]], [[John Keats]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Nikola Tesla]] (commissioned by his friend [[Hugo Gernsback]] and now displayed in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]]), [[Torquato Tasso]], and [[Voltaire]]. As in [[ancient Rome]], death masks were often subsequently used in making marble sculpture portraits, busts, or engravings of the deceased.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In Russia, the death mask tradition dates back to the times of [[Peter the Great]], whose death mask was taken by [[Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]. Also well known are the death masks of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], and [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]].  Stalin's death mask is on display at the [[Joseph Stalin Museum, Gori|Stalin Museum]] in [[Gori, Georgia]].

One of the first real [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] death masks was that of the poet [[Taras Shevchenko]], taken by [[Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathmask.kiev.ua Virtual Museum of Death Mask] URL accessed on December 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early spring of 1860 and shortly before his death in April 1865, two life masks were created of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portraits of the Presidents|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/travpres/lincs.htm|work=National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
[[File:Making Death Mask Edit 4.jpg|right|thumb|Two men in the process of making a death mask, New York, c. 1908]]

Death masks were increasingly used by scientists from the late 18th century onwards to record variations in human [[physiognomy]]. The life mask was also increasingly common at this time, taken from living persons. Anthropologists used such masks to study [[Physiognomy|physiognomic]] features in famous people and notorious [[Crime|criminals]]. Masks were also used to collect data on [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] differences.

===Forensic science===
[[File:L'inconnue de la Seine (masque mortuaire).jpg|thumb|left|''[[L'Inconnue de la Seine]]'']]

Before the widespread availability of [[photography]], the facial features of [[unidentified decedent|unidentified bodie]]s were sometimes preserved by creating death masks so that relatives of the deceased could recognize them if they were seeking a missing person.

One mask, known as [[L'Inconnue de la Seine]], recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to one man's story, had been found drowned in the  Seine River at [[Paris]], [[France]] around the late 1880s. A morgue worker made a cast of her face, saying "Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved."  The cast was also compared to Mona Lisa, and other famous paintings and sculptures. In the following years, copies of the mask became a fashionable fixture in Parisian Bohemian society.

The face of [[Resusci Anne]], the world's first [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] training [[mannequin]], introduced in 1960, was modeled after ''L'Inconnue de la Seine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laerdal.com/docid/1117082/The-Girl-from-the-River-Seine Laerdal company website: The Girl from the River Seine] URL accessed on January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sca-aware.org/library/history/archer-gordon-story-of-resusci-anne.pdf A Death Mask to Help Save Lives] Archer Gordon, M.D., PH.D.

'''Edward Reilly Stettinius Jr.''' (October 22, 1900 – October 31, 1949) was an American businessman who served as [[United States Secretary of State]] under Presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] from 1944 to 1945, and as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1945 to 1946.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on October 22, 1900, the younger of two sons and third of four children of [[Edward R. Stettinius]] and Judith Carrington. His mother was a [[Virginia]]n of colonial English ancestry. His father was of German descent and was a native of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="chernow"&gt;{{cite book |title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|year=1990|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8021-3829-3 |pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Stettinius grew up in a mansion on the family's estate on [[Staten Island]] and graduated from the [[Pomfret School]] in 1920 after which he attended the [[University of Virginia]] until 1924. He finished very few courses and never took a degree, Instead he spent his time on charitable outreach to poor families. He became a member of the secret [[Seven Society]].&lt;ref name="sevens"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Bill |title=Seven Society's Secret Still Secret |newspaper=Washington Post |pages=C8 |date=1965-02-15 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prematurely white-haired, with dark eyebrows, blue eyes, tanned face, and a quick smile, Stettinius was striking in appearance and inspired goodwill. On May 15, 1926, Stettinius married Virginia Gordon Wallace, daughter of a prominent family of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They had three children: Edward Reilly and twins Wallace and Joseph.

==Career==
In 1926, Stettinius began working at [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] as a stock clerk, but his connections made for rapid advancement. He became assistant to [[John Lee Pratt]], a friend of the family, and by 1931 he had become vice president, in charge of public and industrial relations. At General Motors, he worked to develop unemployment relief programs and came into contact with [[Franklin Roosevelt]].

In the 1930s, Stettinius's work in the private sector alternated with public service. He served on the Industrial Advisory Board of the [[National Recovery Administration]] (1933), but in 1934, he returned to the private sector when he joined [[U.S. Steel]]; he eventually become chairman of the nation's largest corporation in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herman |first=Arthur |title=Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II |pages=80, 87–90 |publisher=Random House |location=New York, NY |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4000-6964-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then returned to public service, serving on the National Defense Advisory Commission, as chairman of the War Resources Board (1939) and administrator of the [[Lend-Lease]] Program (1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herman |first=Arthur |title=Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II |pages=70–1, 80, 87, 89, 125, 127, 150, 153, 155 |publisher=Random House |location=New York, NY |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4000-6964-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the latter position until he became undersecretary of state in 1943. The poor health of Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] made him chair the 1944 [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] and, in December 1944, succeed Hull as Secretary of State. Stettinius was a member of the US delegation to the 1945 [[Yalta Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Lafeber |title=The American Age: United States Foreign Policy at Home and Abroad Since 1750 |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton |year=1989 |pages=417–418 |isbn=0-393-95611-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truman thought Stettinius was too soft on communism and had yielded too much to Moscow when he was Roosevelt's advisor at Yalta. Truman had an old Senate friend in mind as a replacement, [[James F. Byrnes]]. Stettinius resigned as Secretary of State to take up the position of the first [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. He chaired the United States delegation to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] held in San Francisco from April 25 to June 26, 1945, which brought together delegates from 50 Allied nations to create the United Nations. [[Charles W. Yost]], who had been Under Secretary of State Stettinius' assistant in the State Department, was named Stettinius' Executive Secretary at the United Nations Conference.  Stettinius resigned in June 1946, as he became critical of what he saw as Truman's refusal to use the UN as a tool to resolve tensions with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Devine and Nathan Giles. "Stettinius, Edward Reilly, Jr."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
For three years after his return to private life, he served as rector of the University of Virginia. In 1947, Stettinius and friend [[William Tubman]], the president of [[Liberia]], helped form the Liberia Company, a partnership between the Liberian government and American financiers to provide funds for the development of the African nation. During his retirement, Stettinius lived at his Virginia estate, The Horseshoe, on the [[Rapidan River]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomasandtalbot.com/Property-Horse_Shoe_Farm&lt;/ref&gt; He died of a coronary [[thrombosis]] on October 31, 1949, at the home of a sister in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], at the age of 49, and was buried in the family plot in Locust Valley Cemetery, [[Locust Valley, New York]].

==Archive==
Stettinius's voluminous archive of more than 1,000 boxes resides at the [[Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library]] at the University of Virginia.

'''Elia Comini''' (7 May 1910 &amp;ndash; 1 October 1944) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and a professed member from the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]].&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90096|title=Servant of God|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a teacher after his [[ordination]] in two different areas until he returned to his hometown towards the end of the devastating [[World War II]] to tend to wounded and displaced people.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.salesiansisters.org/index.php/about-us/history-and-heritage/biographies/servants-of-god|title=Servants of God|date=|publisher=Salesian Sisters of Saint John Bosco Eastern Province USA|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.infoans.org/en/sections/news/item/3015-vatican-progress-in-the-cause-of-the-servant-of-god-fr-elia-comini-sdb|title=Vatican - Progress in the cause of the Servant of God Fr. Elia Comini, SDB|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Agenzia Info Salesiana|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the fierce fighting between the [[Nazis]] and [[Allies]] plus the partisan forces saw Comini and fellow priest (and future [[Servant of God]]) Nicola Capelli captured and murdered after the Nazis made accusations of the pair being spies.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

Comini's cause for beatification was introduced in 1995 at which stage he became titled as a [[Servant of God]].&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Life==
Elia Comini was born in [[Bologna]] on 7 May 1910 to Claudio Comini (a [[carpenter]]) and Emma Limoni (a [[dressmaker]]); one brother was Amleto.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; He was [[baptized]] in the local parish church on 8 May. In 1914 the Comini's moved to Casetta in the Salvaro parish in Bologna on the banks of the [[River Rhine]] along the Porrettana road.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

He attended the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] school in Finale Emilia where he later asked to be admitted into their order. He did his [[novitiate]] period in Castel de'Britti from 1925 to 1926 before making his first religious profession on 3 October 1926.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; His father died sometime during 1926 with the Salvaro archpriest Fidenzio Mellini (who himself knew [[John Bosco|Saint Giovanni Bosco]]) acted as a sort of surrogate father. Mellini had in fact predicted that Comini would become a [[priest]] and held him in high regard due to his goodness and intellect.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Comini completed his studies at the Salesian-run high school in Valsalice in [[Turin]] (1926-28) and then graduated in [[literature]] from [[University of Milan|the college]] in [[Milan]] prior to receiving his [[ordination]] to the priesthood on 16 March 1935 in the Brescia Cathedral from Bishop Giacinto Tredici.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He afterwards served as a teacher at the order's schools in both [[Chiari, Lombardy|Chiari]] in Brescia (1936-41) and [[Treviglio]] at the Salesian Aspirantate (1941-44).&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

In summer 1944 during [[World War II]] he returned to Salvaro to aid his frail mother and to render his aid to the aging [[Monsignor]] Mellini. But that area was the epicenter of war between the [[Nazis]] and the [[Allies]] as well as those [[Italian partisan|partisan forces]]. To that end he turned his attention to the poor and displaced peoples that the war affected.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; He made himself available for hearing confessions and for preaching while also using his musical abilities to enliven the people.

He soon came into contact with fellow priest (and future [[Servant of God]]) Nicola Capelli (in religious "Martino") and the pair often visited refugees and rendered medical aid to those who were wounded.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; On 29 September 1944 both he and Capelli were arrested en route to [[Grizzana]] where 69 people were about to be massacred. He had just celebrated his last [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that morning. The Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|S.S.]] considered them to be spies and so mistreated the pair and used them to transport their [[ammunition]] in terrible conditions. On 30 September he and Capelli spent their time comforting their fellow prisoners. The attempts made to rescue them were useless for Comini said "either all or none" even after his friend Commissioner Prefect Emilio Veggetti tried to secure his release.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

He and 44 others were shot dead around [[dusk]] on 1 October 1944 in the reservoir of the warehouse of the Industrie Canapiere Italiano.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; His remains were then cast into the Rhine. Before being shot he and Capelli heard each other's confessions before he granted their fellow hostages absolution in a loud and defiant voice.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

==Beatification process==
The beatification process was launched under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 14 February 1995 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] accepted a formal application to launch the process (providing the "[[nihil obstat]]" edict) and titling Comini as a Servant of God. Cardinal [[Giacomo Biffi]] inaugurated the diocesan investigation in Bologna on 3 December 1995 and closed it later on 25 November 2001 after documentation had been compiled to support the cause. The C.C.S. later validated the process on 1 October 2004 after receiving the documentation submitted to them; the [[Positio]] dossier was then sent to the C.C.S. for assessment in 2009 following its compilation.

Theologians approved the cause with nine affirmative votes in favor at their meeting held on 4 April 2017.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

'''Felix Alexandrovich Berezin''' ({{lang-ru|Фе́ликс Алекса́ндрович Бере́зин}}; 25 April 1931 – 14 July 1980) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Russians|Russian]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] known for his contributions to the theory of [[supersymmetry]] and [[supermanifold]]s as well as to the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum field theory]].

Berezin studied at the [[Moscow State University]], but was not allowed to do his graduate studies there on account of his [[Jew]]ish origin (his mother was Jewish). For the next three years Berezin taught at Moscow high schools.   He continued to study mathematical physics under direction of [[Israel Gelfand]].  After [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]'s liberalization, he joined the Department of Mathematics at the Moscow State University at the age of 25.

The [[Berezin integral]] over anticommuting [[Grassmann variable]]s is named for him, as is the closely related construction of the [[Berezinian]] which may be regarded as the "[[Supermathematics|super]]"-analog of the [[determinant]].

Berezin drowned during a summer trip in the region of [[Kolyma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2339">'''Fred''', or '''FRED''', was an early [[chatterbot]] written by [[Robby Garner]].

==History==
The name Fred was initially suggested by Karen Lindsey, and then Robby jokingly came up with an acronym, "Functional Response Emulation Device."&lt;ref name="tvshop"&gt;Robitron Software Research, Inc. [http://www.simonlaven.com/fred.htm "The Simon Laven Page"] ''Robitron History''&lt;/ref&gt; Fred has also been implemented as a Java application by [[Paco Nathan]] called [http://simonlaven.com/jfred.htm JFRED].

Fred Chatterbot is designed to explore [[Natural language processing|Natural Language]] communications between people and computer programs. In particular, this is a study of conversation between people and ways that a computer program can learn from other people's conversations to make its own conversations.&lt;ref name="jfred"&gt;L. Caputo, R. Garner, P. Nathan. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=304915 "FRED, Milton and Barry: the evolution of intelligent agents for the Web"], Advances in intelligent systems, 1997.
''portal.acm.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred used a minimalistic "stimulus-response" approach. It worked by storing a database of statements and their responses, and made its own reply by looking up the input statements made by a user and then rendering the corresponding response from the database. This approach simplified the complexity of the rule base, but required expert coding and editing for modifications.

Fred was a predecessor to [[Albert One]], which Garner used in 1998 and 1999 to win the [[Loebner Prize#Winners|Loebner Prize]].&lt;ref name="masters"&gt;Søren Gjellerup Christiansen [http://www.daimi.au.dk/~gjelle/thesis/cdrom/index.html "Techniques applied to pass the Turing Test"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914091424/http://www.daimi.au.dk/~gjelle/thesis/cdrom/index.html |date=2007-09-14 }} ''Master's Thesis''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2587">'''Goldie''' was a male [[golden eagle]] who lived at [[London Zoo]] in England during the 1960s. He caused a nationwide sensation when he escaped for 12 days in March 1965.

Goldie flew away from his keepers on 28 February 1965 while his cage was being cleaned. He avoided being recaptured for nearly two weeks, despite a massive effort using equipment borrowed from the [[Royal Navy]] and [[British Civil Defence]]. Goldie spent most of the time in [[Regent's Park]], which surrounds the zoo, but he also made excursions into the nearby neighbourhoods of [[Camden Town]], [[Tottenham Court Road]] and [[Euston railway station|Euston]].

Goldie's escape enthralled the British public. The zoo received thousands of phone calls and letters, and large crowds gathered in Regent's Park to watch the bird's keepers trying to catch him. There were severe [[traffic jam]]s in the area as drivers circled the park, watching Goldie in flight.

The saga was closely covered by the media. On a [[BBC]] television programme, the reporter [[John Timpson]] unsuccessfully tried to lure Goldie by playing an [[Ethiopia]]n [[bird pipe]]. Goldie was also mentioned during a debate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], where [[Members of Parliament]] greeted his name with cheers.

While free, the [[predator]]y bird killed and ate a duck in the garden of the American ambassador to Britain. He also attacked two [[terrier (dog)|terrier]]s in the park, but was driven off by their owner.

Goldie was finally caught on 11 March after the zoo's deputy head keeper tempted him to earth with a dead rabbit.  He was in good health after his experience and was reunited with his mate, Regina. The zoo's attendance nearly doubled in the days after his return.

Goldie escaped once again on 15 December 1965, and was recaptured 19 December 1965 at 6:15a.m. 

He was sent to The Falconry Centre, Newent, Glos. on 8 March 1985, and died on or about 23 March 1986.

'''F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has bearer shares listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].

The company controls the American biotechnology company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,&lt;ref name="FR16" /&gt; or approximately US$51 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.&lt;ref name="pharmexec50"&gt;[http://www.pharmexec.com/pharm-execs-top-50-companies-2018 Pharm Exec's 2018 ranking of the top 50 pharma companies worldwide], www.pharmexec.com. Retrieved 21 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm [[Novartis]] owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|title=Roche - Roche Annual General Meeting 2014|work=roche.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234724/http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; F.

==History==
Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.&lt;ref name="fundingroche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981—2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to [[Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings]]).&lt;ref name="sec950515"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/ds2yr.a4.htm Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11&lt;/ref&gt; Roche acquired [[Syntex]] in 1994 and [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] in 2002.

[[Oseltamivir]] is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the [[H5N1|bird flu]]. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]].  Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.&lt;ref name="royalty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14507&amp;hed=Roche%2C+Gilead+End+Tamiflu+Feud

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1120533,00.html|title=Why Roche Released Tamiflu|accessdate=2008-05-22|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-10-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to [[Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies|afucosylate antibodies]]; one of its products in development was [[obinutuzumab]], which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="roche"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205033013/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2015 |title=Roche - Roche acquires Swiss based GlycArt Biotechnology to strengthen expertise in therapeutic antibody research |publisher=roche.com |accessdate=2015-04-29 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002757/https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/pdf/event04/joel-jean-mairet-31032011_en.pdf Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after...] by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between [[Clifton, New Jersey]] and [[Nutley, New Jersey]] while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in [[South San Francisco, California|South San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/health/article5897691.ece |title=Roche swallows Genentech in third large drugs deal |last=Bawden |first=Tom |work=[[The Times]] |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-11 | location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612124041/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/health/article5897691.ece|archivedate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genentech became a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] group of Roche on 25 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSLQ73529820090326 |title=Roche completes Genentech buy |last=Jucca |first=Lisa |author2=Cage, Sam |work=[[Reuters]] |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price-fixing conspiracy ==
{{see also|Cartel}}

[[Stanley Adams (whistleblower)|Stanley Adams]], Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking [[antitrust laws]], engaging in [[price fixing]] and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure&amp;nbsp;— an offence under Swiss law&amp;nbsp;— and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/nov/25/businessofresearch.research | title=Blowing the final whistle | last = Mathiason | first = Nick| work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 November 2001 | accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for [[vitamin supplement|vitamins]] sold in the US and globally.  Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/top100.html#Annotated Corporate Crime Reporter]. Corporate Crime Reporter.

{{Thermoreg}}
[[File:Phylogenetic-Groups.svg|thumbnail|300px|The group that includes mammals and birds, both "warm-blooded" homeothermic animals (in red) is [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]].]]
'''Homeothermy''' or '''homothermy''' is [[thermoregulation]] that maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence. This internal [[body temperature]] is often, though not necessarily, higher than the immediate environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanov|first=K.P.|year=2005|title=The development of the concepts of homeothermy and thermoregulation|url=http://www.fvet.uba.ar/areas/fisica/articulos_cient_divulgacion/The_development_of_the_concepts_of_homeothermy_and_thermoregulation.pdf|journal=Journal of Thermal Biology|volume=31|pages=24–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὅμοιος ''homoios'' "similar" and θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat"). Homeothermy is one of the three types of thermo regulation in [[warm-blooded]] animal species.  Homeothermy's opposite is [[poikilothermy]].

Homeotherms are ''not'' necessarily [[endotherm]]ic. Some homeotherms may maintain constant body temperatures through behavioral mechanisms alone, ''i.e.'', behavioral thermoregulation. Many reptiles use this strategy. For example, desert lizards are remarkable in that they maintain near-constant activity temperatures that are often within a degree or two of their lethal critical temperatures.

==Pros==
[[Enzyme]]s have a relatively narrow temperature range at which their efficiencies are optimal. Temperatures outside this range can greatly reduce the rate of a reaction or stop it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniel|first=Roy M.|last2=Peterson|first2=Michelle E.|last3=Danson|first3=Michael J.|last4=Price|first4=Nicholas C.|last5=Kelly|first5=Sharon M.|last6=Monk|first6=Colin R.|last7=Weinberg|first7=Cristina S.|last8=Oudshoorn|first8=Matthew L.|last9=Lee|first9=Charles K.|date=2010-01-15|title=The molecular basis of the effect of temperature on enzyme activity|url=http://www.biochemj.org/content/425/2/353|journal=Biochemical Journal|language=en|volume=425|issue=2|pages=353–360|doi=10.1042/BJ20091254|issn=0264-6021|pmid=19849667}}&lt;/ref&gt; A creature with a fairly constant body temperature can therefore specialize in enzymes which are efficient at that particular temperature. A [[poikilothermic|poikilotherm]] must either operate well below optimum efficiency most of the time, migrate, hibernate or expend extra resources producing a wider range of enzymes to cover the wider range of body temperatures.

However, some environments offer much more consistent temperatures than others. For example, the tropics often have seasonal variations in temperature that are smaller than their diurnal variations. In addition, large bodies of water, such as the [[ocean]] and very large [[lake]]s, have moderate temperature variations. The waters below the ocean surface are particularly stable in temperature.

==Cons==
Because many homeothermic animals use enzymes that are specialized for a narrow range of body temperatures, [[hypothermia]] rapidly leads to [[torpor]] and then death.  Additionally, homeothermy obtained from endothermy is a high energy strategy and many environments will offer lower [[carrying capacity]] to these organisms. In cold weather the energy expenditure to maintain body temperature accelerates starvation and may lead to death.

'''James Anthony Hazeldine'''&lt;ref name="Billington"&gt;Billington, Michael. "Obituary – James Hazeldine. Gifted actor whose TV fame never dulled his love of theatre". In ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 Dec 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMDb Biography for James Hazeldine (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371951/bio) last accessed: 29/07/13&lt;/ref&gt; (4 April 1947 – 17 December 2002) was a British television, [[drama|stage]] and [[film]] actor.

==Early life==
Hazeldine was born the son of a [[dustman]] in [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]], where he grew up on a [[council estate]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;"Obituaries – James Hazeldine." In ''The Telegraph'', 20 Dec 2002. (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1416629/James-Hazeldine.html)&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he became obsessed with the films of director [[Elia Kazan]]. When, aged 11, he found out that Kazan had started his career as an actor and stage manager, he decided to do the same. Following the death of his mother, he left school when he was 15.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; He was accepted as a student assistant stage manager at Salford [[Repertory]] where he soon started taking on small acting roles. Seasons at [[Liverpool Playhouse]], Newcastle Playhouse and [[Manchester Central Library|Manchester Library Theatre]] followed.&lt;ref name="Billington" /&gt;

==Stage work==
Aged 20, Hazeldine made his London debut at the [[Royal Court Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Martland, John. "Obituaries: James Hazeldine" in ''The Stage'', 3 Jan 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sloane Square]]. Initially hired to understudy as Cliff in ''[[Look Back In Anger]]'', Hazeldine soon started taking on small roles in Edward Bond's ''Narrow Road to the Deep North'' and ''Early Morning''. He worked constantly at the Royal Court during the 1969-70 season. Spotting Hazeldine's potential, Peter Gill then cast him in his play ''Over Gardens Out'' and went on to direct him in ''Crete and Sergeant Pepper'' by John Antrobus.&lt;ref name="Billington"/&gt;

Although Hazeldine was rarely cast in starring roles, he became noted as an exceptionally honest and truthful actor who after his inductory season at the Royal Court was regularly seen in new plays, e.g. ''The Old Ones'' by [[Arnold Wesker]], ''The Foursome'' by EA Whitehead and ''Cato Street'' by Peter Gill. In 1981 he joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] for a season to appear in productions of ''Troilus and Cressida'', ''Timon of Athens'', ''Richard III'' and Edward Bond's play ''The Fool''.&lt;ref name="Billington"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371951/otherworks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Hazeldine made his Broadway debut as Sam Evans in ''Strange Interlude'' with [[Glenda Jackson]]. He returned to New York in 1998 when he played Harry Hope in ''The Iceman Cometh'' starring [[Kevin Spacey]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;"London's Burning star Hazeldine dies", BBC News, 20 Dec 2002. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2589587.stm)&lt;/ref&gt;  His last stage performance was that of the guilt-ridden Joe Keller in Arthur Miller's ''All My Sons'' (2000), praised by [[John Peter (critic)|John Peter]] of the ''Sunday Times'' as "the subtlest and most harrowing performance of his career."&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre Record''. Volume 21, Issues 10-18, p. 1010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and film==
Hazeldine was also a prolific television actor who is probably best known for his role as firefighter Mike "Bayleaf" Wilson in the LWT drama ''[[London's Burning (TV series)|London's Burning]]''. He played the role from 1986 to 1996 and also directed some episodes.

Other major TV roles include that of Frank Barraclough in the 1973-75 drama series ''[[Sam (1973 TV series)|Sam]]'' and the role of journalist Tom Crane in the 1979 paranormal thriller series ''[[The Omega Factor]]''. He also starred in the children's series ''[[Chocky]]'' (1984) and its sequels ''[[Chocky's Children]]'' (1985) and ''[[Chocky's Challenge]]'' (1986), all scripted by one of ''The Omega Factor's'' writers, [[Anthony Read]]. In 1983 he played the part of Kidder in [[Willy Russell|Willy Russell's]] five part [[Channel 4]] drama ''One Summer'', also starring [[David Morrissey]]. In the later 1980s Hazeldine had major roles in two BBC comedy dramas: as haulage firm owner Picard in ''Truckers'' (1987) and as Bernie in'' Streets Apart'' (1988–89). In 1999, he played Austin Danforth in the ITV drama ''[[The Last Train (TV series)|The Last Train]]'' and in 2001 he appeared as Ivan Braithwaite in ''[[Adrian Mole: the Cappuccino Years (TV series)|Adrian Mole: the Cappuccino Years]]''.

Hazeldine also appeared in [[Granada Television]]'s production of "[[The Musgrave Ritual]]", as part of [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]'' series, as Richard Brunton, alongside [[Jeremy Brett]], as well as the ''[[Miss Marple (TV series)|Miss Marple]]'' story "[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]", as Lawrence Redding, alongside [[Joan Hickson]], [[Paul Eddington]] and [[Cheryl Campbell]]. Shortly before he died, Hazeldine played DI Stan Egerton in the ITV television drama ''[[Shipman (film)|Shipman]]'' (2002).

His film credits are less numerous. Hazeldine made his screen debut as Stalin in ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971). His credits also include ''[[The National Health (film)|The National Health]]'' (1973), ''[[The Medusa Touch (film)|The Medusa Touch]]'' (1978) and ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall]]'' (1982).

==Death==
At the time of his death Hazeldine was appearing at the [[Cottesloe Theatre]] as [[Sigmund Freud]] in [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''The Talking Cure''. He was taken ill on 10 December 2002, the day after having performed in a preview of the play.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

He died one week later of [[aortic dissection]], caused by complications from a triple heart bypass he had received six months earlier. Following Hazeldine's death, [[Trevor Nunn]], director of the [[Royal National Theatre]], described him as "a leading actor of minutely observed truthfulness, comic brio and emotional daring" who "was also a man of infectious enthusiasm, great warmth and humanity who was universally popular amongst his colleagues".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

'''Laila Khan''' (born '''Reshma Patel''') was an Pakistan-born&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Bollywood actor Laila Khan's murder mystery solved| url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bollywood-actor-laila-khan-murder-mystery-solved/1/203947.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bollywood]] actress, best known for her role opposite [[Rajesh Khanna]] in the 2008 movie ''[[Wafa: A Deadly Love Story]]''. She was allegedly married to Munir Khan, a member of the banned Bangladeshi [[Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= All about B-Town starlet Laila Khan|url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Tabloid/All-about-B-Town-starlet-Laila-Khan/Article1-886384.aspx|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120711040659/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Tabloid/All-about-B-Town-starlet-Laila-Khan/Article1-886384.aspx|archivedate= 2012-07-11|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan, along with some members of her family, was allegedly shot dead in 2011 in [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Starlet Laila Khan shot dead in 2012, trail leads to Jammu and Kashmir| url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/north/starlet-laila-khan-shot-dead-2011-trail-leads-jammu-and-kashmir-065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged role in terror activities==
Khan allegedly supplied the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), a terrorist organization was planning an attack, with information on the city of [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Missing starlet Laila Khan recced Mumbai for LeT in 2011| url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/missing-starlet-laila-khan-recced-city-for-let-in-2011/264736-3.html|work=IBN Live|date=7 June 2012 &lt;!-- at 02:44pm IST --&gt; |location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On the night of 30 January 2011, Khan, accompanied by her mother Shelina, older sister Hashmina, twin siblings Imran and Zara, and cousin Rehshma, drove out of Mumbai towards their holiday home in [[Igatpuri]], 126&amp;nbsp;km north of Mumbai. On 9 February 2011, Khans's mother spoke with her sister, Albana Patel, and said that Khan was in [[Chandigarh]] with her third husband Pervez Iqbal Tak. After this, the family vanished without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sex, Sin and the Missing Starlet| url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/laila-khan-missing-starlet-pervez-iqbal-tak/1/203032.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Khans's father, Nadir Shah Patel (Shelina's first husband), filed a complaint at a Mumbai police station stating that his daughter had gone missing along with other members of her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Laila Khan kidnapped?| url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloid/glam-sham/laila-khan-kidnapped-684|work=Deccan Chronicle|date=12 June 2012|author=Lipika Varma}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar complaint was also filed by Bollywood film director [[Rakesh Sawant]], who was shooting his second film Jinnat with Khan just before she disappeared from Mumbai.
Nadir Shah Patel has appealed to the Bombay High Court on 17 July 2012 seeking transfer of her daughter's murder case from Crime Branch to CBI, alleging that the former did not probe the case promptly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Laila-Khan-s-father-moves-HC-seeking-CBI-probe/Article1-890535.aspx| archive-url= https://archive.is/20130125080945/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Laila-Khan-s-father-moves-HC-seeking-CBI-probe/Article1-890535.aspx| dead-url= yes| archive-date= 25 January 2013| title= Laila Khan's father moves HC seeking CBI probe| date= 17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police investigation and arrest of suspects==
Khan's step-fathers, Parvez Iqbal Tak, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba member, and Asif Sheikh (Shelina's second husband), were suspected of being behind Khan and her family's disappearance. Police also questioned Nadir Shah Patel during the investigation.

Parvez Iqbal Tak was arrested by the [[Jammu and Kashmir Police]] in connection with another case on 21 June 2012. During interrogation Tak admitted that Khan and some members of her family were shot dead in [[Maharashtra]] in February 2011. The next day Tak retracted his story, claiming instead that Khan and her family were still alive. The Crime Branch of Mumbai Police investigating the kidnapping case brought Tak to Mumbai, where he was produced before Esplanade Court, Southern Mumbai on 10 July 2012. The Court sent Tak to Police custody until 19 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Tabloid/Laila-case-Forest-contractor-brought-to-Mumbai/Article1-885676.aspx| title= Laila case: Forest contractor brought to Mumbai| date= 10 July 2012| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120709164859/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Tabloid/Laila-case-Forest-contractor-brought-to-Mumbai/Article1-885676.aspx| archivedate= 9 July 2012| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Confessing before the Crime Branch, Tak changed his statement for a third time, claiming instead, that he intended to kill Khan's mother Shelina for continuously humiliating him, and for having relationship with other men. Tak told interrogators that he, along with his associates killed Khan and her five family members and buried their bodies behind her Igatpuri bungalow. He allegedly killed all of them as Khan had witnessed her mother's murder. Owing to Tak's continuously changing statements, the Mumbai Police was reluctant to place full reliance on his testimony.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news |title= Missing actor Laila Khan is dead, key accused Parvez Iqbal Tak says| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-05/mumbai/32551187_1_farm-house-mumbai-crime-branch-mobile-phone | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Laila killed as she saw mom’s murder: Parvez Tak| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/india/32617069_1_laila-khan-asif-shaikh-parvez-tak | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tak was taken to Igatpuri to corroborate the claims he made during his interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Laila Khan case: Tak taken to Nashik for probe| url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/laila-khan-case-tak-taken-to-nashik-for-probe/270366-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that money, jealousy, property and possible shifting of the family to Dubai were the cause of the family murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Greed-jealousy-drove-Tak-to-murder-starlet-and-family-Police/Article1-887145.aspx| title= Greed, jealousy drove Tak to murder starlet and family: Police| date= 12 July 2012| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120712084529/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Greed-jealousy-drove-Tak-to-murder-starlet-and-family-Police/Article1-887145.aspx| archivedate= 12 July 2012| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of Tak revealed that he intended to flee to Nepal where his [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT) connections would have helped him to avoid arrest.

She was one of the pioneers of [[Indo-Guyanese]] cultural awareness. Her use of radio and television for cultural promotion was innovative. She also organized and presented cultural programmes, the first being [[Lalla-Rookh]]. She staged her first show in the early 1970s when there was considerable resistance within the ruling [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|PNC]] to regard Indo-Guyanese culture as being truly Guyanese.

Her work included the organization of dance and music shows, the organization of an important photographic exhibition of Indo-Guyanese history and artifacts, and the publishing of ''Shraadanjali'' (1986), a small anthology of Indo-Guyanese poetry.

She died in a fire in early 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5453">In [[computer science]], '''learning vector quantization''' ('''LVQ'''), is a [[prototype|prototype-based]] [[supervised learning|supervised]] [[Statistical classification|classification]] [[algorithm]]. LVQ is the supervised counterpart of [[vector quantization]] systems.

== Overview ==
LVQ can be understood as a special case of an [[artificial neural network]], more precisely, it applies a [[winner-take-all (computing)|winner-take-all]] [[Hebbian learning]]-based approach. It is a precursor to [[self-organizing map]]s (SOM) and related to [[neural gas]], and to the [[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]] (k-NN). LVQ was invented by [[Teuvo Kohonen]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Kohonen. Self-Organizing Maps. Springer, Berlin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

An LVQ system is represented by prototypes &lt;math&gt;W=(w(i),...,w(n))&lt;/math&gt; which are defined in the [[feature space]] of observed data. In winner-take-all training algorithms one determines, for each data point, the prototype which is closest to the input according to a given distance measure. The position of this so-called winner prototype is then adapted, i.e. the winner is moved closer if it correctly classifies the data point or moved away if it classifies the data point incorrectly.

An advantage of LVQ is that it creates prototypes that are easy to interpret for experts in the respective application domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=T. Kohonen|contribution=Learning vector quantization|editor=M.A. Arbib|title=The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks|pages=537–540|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LVQ systems can be applied to multi-class classification problems in a natural way. 
It is used in a variety of practical applications. See http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Neural/SOM.LVQ.html
for an extensive bibliography.

A key issue in LVQ is the choice of an appropriate measure of distance or similarity for training and classification. Recently, techniques have been developed which adapt a parameterized distance measure in the course of training the system, see e.g. (Schneider, Biehl, and Hammer, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=P. Schneider, B. Hammer, and M. Biehl|title=Adaptive Relevance Matrices in Learning Vector Quantization|journal= Neural Computation|volume=21|pages=3532–3561|year=2009|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.2009.10-08-892|doi=10.1162/neco.2009.10-08-892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and references therein.

LVQ can be a source of great help in classifying text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fahad and Sikander|title=Classification of textual documents using learning vector quantization|journal=Information Technology Journal|volume=6|issue=1|year=2007|pages=154–159|url=http://198.170.104.138/itj/2007/154-159.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809110450/http://198.170.104.138/itj/2007/154-159.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-08-09|doi=10.3923/itj.2007.154.159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm==
Below follows an informal description.&lt;br&gt;
The algorithm consists of 3 basic steps. The algorithm's input is:
* how many neurons the system will have &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (in the simplest case it is equal to the number of classes)
* what weight each neuron has &lt;math&gt;\vec{w_i}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i = 0,1,...,M - 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* the corresponding label &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to each neuron &lt;math&gt; \vec{w_i} &lt;/math&gt;
* how fast the neurons are learning &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt;
* and an input list &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; containing all the vectors of which the labels are known already (training set).

The algorithm's flow is:
# For next input &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; find the closest neuron &lt;math&gt;\vec{w_m}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;br&gt;i.e.  &lt;math&gt;d(\vec{x},\vec{w_m}) = \min\limits_i {d(\vec{x},\vec{w_i})} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\, d&lt;/math&gt; is the metric used ( [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]], etc. ).
# Update &lt;math&gt;\vec{w_m}&lt;/math&gt;. A better explanation is get &lt;math&gt;\vec{w_m}&lt;/math&gt; closer to the input &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{w_m}&lt;/math&gt; belong to the same label and get them further apart if they don't. &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt; \vec{w_m} \gets \vec{w_m} + \eta \cdot \left( \vec{x}  -  \vec{w_m} \right) &lt;/math&gt; (closer together) &lt;br&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \vec{w_m} \gets \vec{w_m} - \eta \cdot \left( \vec{x}  -  \vec{w_m} \right) &lt;/math&gt; (further apart).
# While there are vectors left in &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; go to step 1, else terminate.

Note: &lt;math&gt;\vec{w_i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; are [[vector space|vectors]] in feature space.&lt;br&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Live A Live'''''|ライブ・ア・ライブ|Raibu A Raibu, stylized as |LIVE A &lt;span style{{=}}"{{MirrorH}}"&gt;LIVE&lt;/span&gt;}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (company)|Square]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], and released on September 2, 1994. It was never released outside Japan, but it has been [[fan translation of video games|unofficially translated]] into English. It was released on the Virtual Console for [[Nintendo Wii U]] on June 24, 2015 and [[New Nintendo 3DS]] on November 28, 2016 in Japan.

''Live A Live''{{'}}s story begins with a series of seven seemingly unrelated chapters that can be played in any order, based on popular genres such as [[Western (genre)|Western]], [[science fiction]], and [[mecha]]. Each chapter has its own plot, setting, and characters. Although the basic gameplay is the same throughout the game, every chapter has its own unique gimmick, such as the [[stealth game|stealth]] elements in the [[ninja]] chapter.&lt;ref name="gtell_bestsnes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Importables: Best SNES role-playing games|first=Jenni|last=Lada|publisher=Gamer Tell|date=February 1, 2008|url=http://www.gamertell.com/gaming/comment/important-importables-best-snes-rpgs|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first seven chapters are completed, the game's final sequence plays out, linking the previous chapters together and resolving the story.

==Gameplay==
[[File:LiveALiveBattle.png|left|thumb|256px|Akira and Matsu battle Crusaders in the "Flow" chapter. Characters can move around a grid during battles, however, attacks are turn-based.]]
''Live A Live'' contains the basic elements of a role-playing video game. The characters explore dungeons, towns, or similar areas, fight enemies, and gain experience points to [[Experience level|level up]]. However, the game eschews some elements typical of the genre, such as [[magic point]]s and money.

The game has [[Turn-based tactics|turn-based, tactical]] battles that play out on a grid. Certain attacks can change tiles into damage zones. More powerful skills often have long charge times, which commits the character to that single attack for a long time, and gives the enemy an opportunity to interrupt them. Characters can be inflicted with status ailments, and certain items, attacks, and skills can raise or lower a character or enemy's stats while in battle. When a character's hit points reach zero, they collapse and are unable to move, but can be revived by using a healing item or spell. However, if they are hit when in the knocked-out state, they permanently disappear from the battle.

In addition to these basic gameplay mechanics, each chapter contains some variations on the standard formula.

==Characters==
''Live A Live'' has a large number of characters. The main character of the prehistoric chapter, Pogo (ポゴ), is a young caveman who has just come of age, who is only capable of saying the word "love". Master Xin Shan Quan (心山拳老師, ''Shinzanken-roushi'', ''Xīn Shān Quán-lǎoshī'') is an old kung-fu master seeking to pass on his art before he dies; his three pupils are an obese yet agile man named Sammo Hakka (サモ・ハッカ ''Samo Hakka''), a female bandit named Li Kuugo (レイ・クウゴ ''Rei Kuugo''), and a boy named Yuan Jou (ユン・ジョウ ''Yun Jou'') who stood up to the local gangsters. Oboro-maru (おぼろ丸) is a ninja of the Enma with great potential sent on an important mission. The Sundown Kid (サンダウン・キッド ''Sandaun Kiddo'') is a wandering cowboy famous for his skill with a gun. Masaru Takahara (高原 日勝 ''Takahara Masaru'') is a wrestler with the dream of being the strongest fighter in the world who possesses a strong sense of justice. Akira Tadokoro (田所 晃 ''Tadokoro Akira'') is an orphan in the near future with [[psychic]] powers. Cube (キューブ ''Kyūbu'') is a [[self-awareness|self-aware]] robot created by the mechanic Kato (カトゥー ''Katū'') aboard the spaceship Cogito Ergosum. Oersted (オルステッド ''Orusuteddo'') is a famous knight in the realm of Lucretia, betrothed to the King's only daughter. Odio (オディオ ''Odio''), whose name is [[Latin]] for hate, is the Demon King and the main [[antagonist]] of the game.

==Plot==
The first seven chapters can be played in any order, and the final two chapters open up after they are completed.

===Contact===
In [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times, a tribe of [[caveman|cavemen]] prepares to sacrifice a woman named Bel (べる ''Beru'') to their deity, a living [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] named O-D-O (おーでぃーおー ''Ōdīō''). She escapes to the south and hides in a cave belonging to another tribe, stealing their food to survive. She is discovered by a young caveman named Pogo, who falls in love with her and decides to help her hide from the rest of the tribe. The northern tribe attacks to retrieve her, but Pogo repels them. However, Bel is discovered in the process, and the elder exiles them. Eventually, Pogo is forced to fight O-D-O, and is assisted by a warrior of the northern tribe named Zaki (ざき). After the beast is defeated, peace is established between the two tribes and the first word, "Love", is said.

===Inheritance===
In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], an old kung-fu master of the Xin Shan Quan tradition takes on three students to pass on his art before he dies. While the master is away one day, the dojo is attacked by a rival dojo seeking revenge for an insult. Two of the students are killed (the surviving student being the one the player trained the most), prompting the master and the surviving student to avenge their deaths. The rival school, led by Odi Wang Lee (オディワン・リー ''Odiwan Rī''), is defeated, but the master dies afterward, having used the last of his strength in the fight. The student succeeds him as master of the tradition and takes a new generation of students.

===Secret Orders===
In [[Bakumatsu|feudal Japan]], a mysterious figure named Ode Iou &lt;!--Ancient Japan = Use Japanese order--&gt;(尾手 院王 ''Ode Iō'') is trying to throw Japan into chaos. The [[ninja]] clan Enma sends one of their ninja named Oboro-maru to rescue a prisoner who can stabilize Japan, then kill Ode Iou. After being rescued, the prisoner joins Oboro in the battle with Ode Iou. After Ode Iou is slain, the prisoner reveals that he is [[Sakamoto Ryōma]]. Oboro is then given the choice of returning to the Enma or joining Ryōma in his plans to rebuild Japan.

===Wandering===
This chapter takes place in the [[American Old West]]. An outlaw called the Sundown Kid and his rival, a [[bounty hunter]] named Mad Dog (マッド・ドッグ ''Maddo Doggu''), arrive in Success Town, a place terrorized by a group of bandits called the Crazy Bunch (クレイジー・バンチ ''Kureijī Banchi''), led by O. Dio (O・ディオ ''O Dio''), the last remaining survivor of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]]. Sundown stands up to the bandits, and they decide to raze the town in retaliation. Mad Dog agrees to help Sundown and the townsfolk prepare the town's defenses. After the town emerges from the battle victorious, Mad Dog challenges Sundown to one final duel. The player has the option of killing Mad Dog or running away.

===The Strongest===
''The Strongest'' is set in the present day. Masaru Takahara strives to become the strongest fighter in the world by fighting the masters of different fighting disciplines to learn their techniques. However, another fighter, Odie Oldbright (オディ・オブライト ''Odi Oburaito''), has the same idea, but deliberately kills each of his opponents during the fight. He then challenges Masaru, who defeats him.

===Blood Flow===
In the near future in [[Japan]], a biker gang called the Crusaders has been kidnapping people with unknown intentions. A young orphan with psychic powers named Akira Tadokoro grows up in an orphanage with his sister. One day, the Crusaders kidnap one of the children from the orphanage, so Akira and his friend Matsu (無法松 ''Muhoumatsu'') set out to rescue him. Akira learns the location of the Crusaders' base, and discovers a plot by the Japanese government to liquefy people and use them to power a giant idol named Odeo (御出居). Matsu then sacrifices himself to power an ancient mech called Buriki Daioh (ブリキ大王 ''Buriki Daiō'', "Tin-Plated Great King"), which Akira uses to destroy Odeo.

===Mechanical Heart===
In the distant future, a [[Spacecraft|space ship]] called Cogito Ergosum is returning to earth carrying a dangerous alien called the Behemoth (ベヒーモス ''Behīmosu''). The mechanic, Kato, creates a spherical robot and gives it the ironic name of Cube. The player takes the role of Cube as it explores the ship and meets the crew. However, things begin to go wrong as the ship malfunctions and a crew member named Kirk (カーク ''Kāku'') dies in a freak accident. Soon, the Behemoth is released, and it kills more crew members. The remaining crew members continue to blame and mistrust one another, but it is finally revealed that the culprit is the ship's computer, OD-10. Cube hacks into the computer and defeats it.

===King of Demons===
After completing the first seven chapters, the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chapter is unlocked. A brave knight named Oersted, a hero beloved by the people, defeats his best friend, the wizard Straybow (ストレイボウ ''Sutoreibou''), in the final round of a fighting tournament, winning the right to marry Princess Alicia (アリシア ''Arishia'') of Lucretia (ルクレツィア ''Rukuretsia''). That night, she is kidnapped by the Demon King (魔王 ''Maō''). The next day, Oersted and Straybow set out to rescue her. First, they find the heroes who defeated the Demon King thirty years prior, the knight Hash (ハッシュ ''Hasshu'') and the priest Uranus (ウラヌス ''Uranusu''), and convince them to join. They fight and defeat the Demon King, but Hash dies due to a plague, Alicia is nowhere to be found, and Straybow is seemingly killed by falling rocks. Oersted and Uranus return to Lucretia in defeat. That night, Oersted is tricked into slaying the King of Lucretia by an apparition of the Demon King after seeing what looks like Straybow exit his room. He is accused of being the Demon King himself, and he is later imprisoned. Uranus, who is also imprisoned for being a "demon ally", uses the last of his strength to help him escape. Oersted returns to the mountain of the Demon King and finds Straybow alive, having faked his own death. Straybow reveals that, out of jealousy for Oersted, he sold his soul to become the next Demon King, and tricked Oersted into killing the King. Oersted is forced to kill him. He then rescues Alicia, but she confesses her love for Straybow and blames Oersted's heroism for Straybow's fall to evil, before killing herself. Oersted is driven insane by his rage and grief, sacrifices his soul to become the next Demon King, and names himself Odio, deciding to teach humans "the folly of their selfishness". He then takes revenge on all of Lucretia, killing everything.

===Final Chapter===
In the final chapter, Oersted summons the protagonists of the first seven chapters to Lucretia, which is now colorless and depopulated, for a final battle. The player's chosen hero meets and recruits the other six heroes. During their exploration of Lucretia, they can encounter Straybow, who laments what his jealousy had caused. Once ready, the group confronts Odio, who questions the heroes' motives, and then transforms into a monster to fight them. Once defeated, he reverts to his human form, and asks the hero to kill him. The hero refuses, so Oersted attacks again, forcing each hero to fight the incarnation of Odio from their chapter. After the heroes win again, Oersted is unable to understand why he cannot win. The hero explains what he or she fights for to Oersted—each one having a different reason. He is finally moved, and so agrees to return them all to where they came from. He warns the heroes that anyone can become a demon with enough hatred before dying, and Lucretia is restored.

If the player chooses Oersted as the final chapter's lead character, he will take control of the seven different incarnations of Odio in each chapter in turn. If he defeats each of the heroes, he is left to wander in an empty Lucretia. Alternately, he can choose to cause [[armageddon]] once an incarnation becomes low on health, destroying all of space-time instantly.

==Development==
The characters of each of the game's chapters were illustrated by a group of different [[manga]] artists involving [[Yoshihide Fujiwara]], [[Yoshinori Kobayashi]], [[Osamu Ishiwata]], [[Yumi Tamura]], [[Ryōji Minagawa]], [[Gosho Aoyama]] and [[Kazuhiko Shimamoto]].

'''Marie I de Coucy''' (April 1366 – after 3 March 1405) was Dame de Coucy and d'Oisy, and Countess of Soissons from 1397. She succeeded to the title of [[suo jure]] Countess of Soissons, on 18 February 1397, upon the death of her father, Enguerrand VII de Coucy. In addition to her titles, she also owned numerous estates in North-Eastern France. She was the wife of [[Henry of Bar]], and the granddaughter of King [[Edward III of England]] and [[Philippa of Hainault]].

==Life==
[[Image:Description du chateau de coucy Figure 00.png|thumb|left|Coucy Castle, the birthplace of Marie de Coucy, and the lords of Coucy]]

Marie was born in April 1366 at Coucy Castle, [[Picardy]], France. She was the eldest daughter of a powerful French nobleman, [[Enguerrand VII de Coucy]], and [[Isabella de Coucy|Isabella of England]],{{sfn|Lutkin|2010|p=139}} daughter of King [[Edward III of England]] and [[Philippa of Hainault]]. She had a younger sister, [[Philippa de Coucy]] (1367–1411), who married [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland|Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, Marquess of Dublin, Duke of Ireland]].

When Marie was about a month old, she accompanied her parents to England, where on 11 May 1366 her father received the title of [[Earl of Bedford]] and was inducted into the [[Order of the Garter]]. In 1376 at the age of ten, Marie joined the household of the French queen, [[Joanna of Bourbon]] and was educated alongside the Dauphin and his siblings.

===Marriage===
In November 1384, she married [[Henry of Bar]], Marquis de Pont-à-Mousson, son of [[Robert I, Duke of Bar]] and [[Marie of Valois (1344-1404)|Marie of Valois]], sister of King [[Charles V of France]]. The marriage produced two sons: 
* Enguerrand of Bar (1387 – c. 1400){{cn|date=April 2017}}
* [[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle and Soissons]] (1390 – 25 October 1415), who died at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].{{sfn|Souchal|1974|p=124}}

By the 15th century, Marie and her husband Henry moved to the [[Château de Condé]], which had been in the Coucy family since the end of the 12th century.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Legal disputes===
Marie's mother, Isabella, died in 1379. Her father, Enguerrand, remarried in February 1386 to Isabelle, the daughter of [[John I, Duke of Lorraine]]. Upon Enguerrand's death on 18 February 1397 in a Turkish prison at [[Bursa]], [[Anatolia]], five months after the ferocious [[Battle of Nicopolis]], Marie inherited his title and became the ''suo jure'' Countess of Soissons. Near the end of that same year, she was widowed. Her husband Henry was also taken prisoner at the Battle of Nicopolis and later ransomed.{{sfn|Sumption|2009|p=839}}{{sfn|Setton|1976|p=355}} In October 1397, on the lengthy journey home to France, Henry of Bar died at the Crusaders' camp in Treviso after having contracted the plague during his sojourn in [[Venice]].{{sfn|Setton|1976|p=361}} He was buried at the convent of the [[Celestines]] in Paris.

Marie disputed the wealthy de Coucy inheritance with her stepmother, with Marie claiming the entire inheritance, while Isabelle insisted upon receiving half. Neither of them yielded. The rich barony was described as "having castles of grandeur, with its 150 towns and villages, its famous forests, fine ponds, many good vassals, much great nobility and inestimable revenues". The women lived in mutual hostility, each in a separate castle of the domain, with her own captains and entourage of relatives, both of them endlessly pursuing lawsuits. 

Marie was coerced by [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans|Louis d'Orléans]] into selling the barony to him in 1404. She brought at least eleven lawsuits against Orléans in an attempt to recover her property, but following a wedding feast which she had attended in 1405, Marie died suddenly. There were persistent rumours that she had been poisoned, but nothing could be proven to substantiate the allegations. Her son Robert continued the litigation, but eventually, the barony of Coucy passed to the French Crown.

'''''Marsupilami''''' is a [[comic book]] character created by [[André Franquin]], first published on 31 January 1952 in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]''.&lt;ref name="Une vie-1vcvcvcvcvcthe dog952"&gt;{{cite web| last =franquin.com | title =Franquin-Une vie-1952 | url =http://www.franquin.com/bio/1952.php |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it appeared regularly in the popular [[Franco-Belgian comics|Belgian comics]] series ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' until Franquin stopped working on the series in 1968 and the character dropped out soon afterward. In the late 1980s, the Marsupilami got its own successful [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series of [[comic album]]s, ''Marsupilami'', written by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]], [[Yann Leppennetier|Yann]] and Dugomier and drawn by [[Luc Collin|Batem]], launching the publishing house [[Marsu Productions]]. Later, two animated shows featuring this character, as well as the ''[[Marsupilami (game)|Marsupilami]]'' [[Sega Genesis]] [[video game]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Marsupilami|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=82|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1996|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Marsupilami |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=93 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1996|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Marsupilami |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|pages=160-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other merchandise followed. The [[asteroid]] [[98494 Marsupilami]] is [[Meanings of asteroid names|named in its honour]].

The name is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[marsupial]]'', ''Pilou-Pilou'' (the French name for [[Eugene the Jeep]], a character Franquin loved as a kid) and ''ami'', French for ''friend''.

Marsupilami's adventures had been translated to several languages, like [[Dutch language|Dutch]], German, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], Spanish,  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and several [[Scandinavian languages]]. More than three million albums of the ''Marsupilami'' series are claimed to have been sold by [[Marsu Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marsuproductions.com/pers.php?name=marsupilami|title=Marsu Productions : Merchandising – Promotion – Edition tout pour la BD  et bande dessinée|publisher=Marsuproductions.com|language=French|date=|accessdate=2014-01-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202083439/http://www.marsuproductions.com/pers.php?name=marsupilami|archivedate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One album of ''Spirou and Fantasio'' featuring Marsupilami, number 15, was translated to English by Fantasy Flight Publishing in 1995, although it is currently out of print. Plans on releasing number 16 ended halfway through the translation process, due to bad sales. In 2007, Egmont's subsidiary Euro Books translated albums number 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 for the Indian market.

In 2013, [[Dupuis]] bought [[Marsu Productions]] and its characters, thereby allowing a new production of Spirou and Fantasio adventures including Marsupilami.

==Appearance==
The marsupilami is a black-spotted yellow monkey-like creature with dog-like ears.&lt;ref name="Héritiers-taxonomy"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Cartoonist = [[André Franquin|Franquin, André]]
 | Title = ''Spirou et les héritiers'' | Date = 1 January 1952 | Publisher = Éditions Dupuis| Page = 61 | Panel = 1 | ID ={{ISBN|2800100060}} }}{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male marsupilamis have an incredibly long, strong, flexible, prehensile tail, used for almost any task.  Female marsupilamis have a much shorter tail, but still long compared to real animals. Both the male and female are able to use their tail as a weapon, by tightening the end into a fist and the remainder of the tail into a spring-like spiral for maximal force. This attack was responsible for the Danish and Norwegian translators choosing words similar to "spiral" over "marsupial" as the creature's name. Unlike the males, the females also walk on the tips of their toes. When the animal rebounds, he makes the noise: "Boing". Males also have eyes that are not completely separate while females have two separate eyes. Female marsupilamis also have a totally different voice than the males. Males say "houba" most of the time, while females say "houbii". According to the ''L'Encyclopédie du Marsupilami'', they are [[monotreme]]s like the [[platypus]] and [[echidna]], which explains why they lay eggs while having [[mammalian]] features.&lt;ref&gt;L'encyclopédie du Marsupilami (1991), Marsu Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specimens ==
"The Marsupilami" refers originally to the individual captured and then adopted by Spirou and Fantasio, which they never bothered to name because he was the only known specimen. The ''Spirou et Fantasio'' album ''[[Le nid des Marsupilamis]]'' is mostly concerned with a documentary-within-the-comic about the life of a family of marsupilamis still living in the wild in [[Palombia]]. The spin-off comics later drawn by Batem star those, and the title of the series now refers to the - also unnamed - father in this family, and not to Spirou's original Marsupilami.

In these series, Marsupilami's wife is referred to as Marsupilamie (a female version of the name) but their three young are named, respectively, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo. Mars le noir (''Mars the Black'') is another specimen, which first appears in the album ''Mars le Noir''. A former captive marsupilami, he first finds it hard to live again in the forest. After failing to seduce Marsupilamie, he becomes jealous of Marsupilami and nearly gets into a fight with him. Later, he meets a black female marsupilami, named Vénus, who becomes his mate. In ''Baby Prinz'', another specimen, an elderly male who lives in a zoo, is featured. Altogether, that comes to eight specimens in Palombia, plus Spirou and Fantasio's pet. Marsupilamis can come in colours of yellow, yellow with black spots, dark blue, white, white with black spots, and dark blue with yellow spots. They can also be black.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Only the yellow, yellow with black spots and dark blue marsupilami's show up in cartoon.

===''Marsupilami''===
By the late 1960s, Franquin decided to retire from drawing the ''Spirou et Fantasio'' series, which was passed to a new artist, [[Jean-Claude Fournier]]. Franquin did not give permission for the character to continue appearing in the series after the first Fournier story, ''[[Le faiseur d'or]]'' ("The Gold Maker"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franquin.com/bio/1969.php Franquin's official site] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he drew the Marsupilami himself.  Spirou's Marsupilami did not feature in comics after that.

In 1987 however, Franquin launched the Marsupilami series with the new publishing house, [[Marsu Productions]], with [[Greg (comics)|Greg]] and Batem. This series featured the Marsupilami family which had appeared in ''[[Le nid des Marsupilamis]]''. Later, Greg abandoned the series, and other collaborators were chosen by Franquin, such as Yann, Fauche and Adam. The first published album of the series is ''[[La Queue du Marsupilami]]''. In 2002, an album #0 was published, consisting of short stories featuring the Marsupilami, drawn by Franquin before 1987.  The series, drawn by Batem, has survived André Franquin.

====Other====
*''L'Encyclopédie du Marsupilami'', published in 1991 is an "Encyclopedia" about the natural history of the Marsupilami, not a comic book. Text is by Cambier and Verhoest, art by Batem and Franquin.
*''Gaston et le Marsupilami'' was published by Dupuis in 1978. This album groups all the short stories featuring both [[Gaston Lagaffe]] and Marsupilami, previously published in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine. All these strips were then published in the album ''[[Capturez un Marsupilami]]''.
*In December 2006, an illustrated book series featuring the marsupilami as the main character was created in the [[Bibliothèque Rose]] Collection, published by [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette]]. Scenarios are taken from the animated series ''Mon ami Marsupilami''.
*A short lived series produced in connection to the TV-series were published 1993-1994 in the American ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine. Some stories were also reprinted in the German magazine ''Limit''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c1=date&amp;c=Marsupilami&amp;view=4 Character: Marsupilami] on the [[Inducks]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several Marsupilami cameos and tributes have been produced in [[Franco-Belgian comics]]; among the earliest in [[Jijé]]'s series ''[[Blondin et Cirage]]'', in the volume ''Les soucoupes volantes'' (1956), where the characters Blondin and Cirage find the creature ''Marsupilami Africanis'', a slightly different species than the South American ''Marsupilamus Fantasii''.

{{main|Marsupilami (1993 TV series)}}
[[Image:Marsujoking.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Marsupilami: "Where is Maurice? That big gorilla is supposed to drop in....]]
[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s version of the Marsupilami first appeared on television in ''[[Raw Toonage]]'' in 1992, and was then spun off into his own eponymous show on the [[CBS]] network and [[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]] in 1993. Marsupilami's supporting characters included among others Maurice the [[gorilla]], Stewart the [[elephant]], Eduardo the [[jaguar]], Leonardo the [[lion]], and Norman the [[poaching|poacher]]. The original Marsupilami stories by Franquin never encountered a [[gorilla]] or [[elephant]], since these species are native to [[Africa]], while the marsupilami in the comic was said to come from [[South America]] (however, in the album "Le dictateur et le champignon", the Marsupilami escapes from his cell on a boat with a gorilla). Another change is Marsupilami can speak in difference to his comic counterpart that can only mimic sound like a parrot. In this version, Marsupilami is voiced by [[Steve Mackall]].
[[The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show|Shnookums and Meat]] was a secondary segment on this show.

There were thirteen episodes in the series, and the series lasted one season. Reruns of the show were aired on [[The Disney Channel]] (from October 1994&lt;ref&gt;''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 12, no. 6, October/November 1994: pp. 36, 46, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; to June 1995&lt;ref&gt;''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 13, no. 2 (typo in magazine: should be "no. 3"), April/May 1995: pp. 26, 36, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 13, no. 4, June/July 1995: p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;), and later on [[Toon Disney]].

Animators [[Tony Bancroft]] and [[Michael Surrey]] are in the character design ending credits.

====Season 1 - Marsupilami (2000)====
A second series, this time produced in France, premiered in March 2000 and ran for 26 episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les dessins animés Marsupilami - Saison 1|url=http://www.marsupilami.com/anime/saison-1/|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in France's [[Canal J]]. Produced by [[Cactus Animation]], [[Marathon Production]] &amp; Marsu Productions, this series more closely followed the character in the original comic.

In this first season, Marsupilami lived adventures alone or with his family (his wife Marsupilamie and their three young, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo). For example, in one episode he saved a group of circus animals, got them back to the city and saved the circus from closing. In another, he had to go to the city again to save one of his young, captured by their constant enemy, the hunter Bring M. Backalive.

====Season 2 - Mon ami Marsupilami (2003)====
In the 15 episode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les dessins animés Marsupilami - Saison 2|url=http://www.marsupilami.com/anime/saison-2/|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  second season, called ''Mon ami Marsupilami'' (translated as ''My friend Marsupilami'' in the [[Disney Channel]] version), Marsupilami and his family become best friends with a human family, the Du Jardin, that comes to live near them. Amanda is a Marsupilami researcher, while her husband Jean-Pierre is a computer technician that works from home and they have two children, Teo (Leo in the Disney Channel version) and toddler Zoe. Leo and Marsupilami become best friends and they have lots of adventures, with both new friends and old enemies, like Backalive.

====Seasons 3-4 - Houba Houba Hop! (2009-2011)====
The third series, started in 2009, features a preteen boy named Hector and his aunt Diane, who are going to live in the jungle for one year to study its fauna and flora. They become the best friends with the Marsupilami family. Their main enemies are megalomaniac industrialist and jungle-hater Felicia Devort, who plans to level out the Palombian jungle and build the Devort City megalopolis in its place, and her two henchmen, {{Not a typo|Stroy}} and Blouprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les dessins animés Marsupilami - Saison 3|url=http://www.marsupilami.com/anime/saison-3/|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their old enemy, hunter Bring M. Backalive, also appears.

====Season 5 - Nos voisins les Marsupilamis (2012)====
The fourth series, translated to ''Our Neighbors the Marsupilamis'', featured the Marsupilami family living with veterinarian Bernard Vanderstadt and his four children Sarah, Iris, Isidore and Zoe. Their mother, Caroline, frequently contacts them by phone, but appears in the last three episode. Once again Backalive makes an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=" Nos voisins les Marsupilamis " – Bienvenue en Palombie !

==Movies==
* '''[[HOUBA! On the Trail of the Marsupilami|Sur la piste du Marsupilami (On the Trail of the Marsupilami)]]''' is a live-action, adventure-comedy directed by [[Alain Chabat]] and released in 2012. Chabat himself stars in the movie alongside [[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Fred Testot|Frédéric Testot]], [[Géraldine Nakache]], [[Lambert Wilson]], [[Patrick Timsit]], [[Liya Kebede]], [[Aïssa Maïga]] and [[The Great Khali]]. Though Marsupilami and his family are featured prominently, the movie features new characters rather than any of the established cast from the comics or television shows. The central focus is on [[French people|French]] reporter Dan Geraldo (Chabat) and [[Palombia]]n vet Pablito Camaron (Debbouze), whose name humorously translates to ''Little Pablo Shrimp'', as they go searching for the indigenous Paya people led by Queen Paya (Kebede). The duo end up in a complicated plot involving the Marsupilami, an evil botanist (Testot) who discovers the elixir of youth, a major (Timsit) the botanist teams up with to overthrow the Palombian president (Wilson) and said president's love for [[Celine Dion]].

==Fame==
* A wax figure of a Marsupilami was manufactured and exhibited at the [[Musée Grévin]], a museum displaying realistic statues of famous personalities, along with two other famous Franco-Belgian comics characters, [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Asterix]].
* Many commercial products have been created by several companies: clothes (Avance Diffusion), shoes (Léomil), clocks, watches, decoration, dishes (Tropico), figurines (Pixi and Plastoy), cuddly toys (Nounours), socks (Agofroy), schoolbags ([[Hasbro]]), school products (Oberthur), linen (MCT), puzzles (Jumbo), underwear (United Labels).
* Marsupilami appears on a stamp created by the [[La Poste (France)|French Poste]] in 2003 (n° 3569).
* The official website www.marsupilami.com claims to have more than 25,000 subscribers.
* The Marsupilami is a fairground attraction in ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]''.
* Marsupilami is honoured by Asterix illustrator and occasional writer Albert Uderzo on page 11 of [[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]].
* A statue of the Marsupilami can be found at the center of a [[Charleroi]] roundabout and another has been seen at the train station of [[Angoulême]], the city of France's largest comics festival

His mutilated body was found on a railway line {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} away in [[Walton, Liverpool]], two days after his murder. Thompson and Venables were [[prosecuted|charged]] on 20 February 1993 with Bulger's abduction and murder.

They were found guilty on 24 November 1993, making them the youngest convicted murderers in modern English history. They were sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|detention during Her Majesty's pleasure]] until a [[Parole Board for England and Wales|Parole Board]] decision in June 2001 recommended their [[Parole|release on a lifelong licence]] aged 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bulger-killers-to-be-released-on-parole-9274011.html|title=Bulger killers to be released on parole|date=22 June 2001|work=The Independent|access-date=7 February 2018|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208005901/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bulger-killers-to-be-released-on-parole-9274011.html|archivedate=8 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Venables was sent to prison for breaching the terms of his licence, and was released on [[parole]] again in 2013.

==Legal proceedings==

===Arrest===
The fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to investigating officers, headed by Detective Superintendent Albert Kirby, of [[Merseyside Police]]. Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with "two youths" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV.&lt;ref name=trutv_4/&gt; Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body. Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through [[DNA]] tests.

The boys were each charged with the murder of James Bulger on 20 February 1993,&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; and appeared at South Sefton Youth Court on 22 February 1993, when they were remanded in custody to await trial.&lt;ref name=trutv_1/&gt;&lt;ref name="bulger_murder"/&gt; In the aftermath of their arrest, and throughout the media accounts of their trial, the boys were referred to as 'Child A' (Thompson) and 'Child B' (Venables).&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Awaiting trial, they were held in the secure units where they would eventually be sentenced to be detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure|indefinitely]].&lt;ref name=STM/&gt;

===Trial===
Up to five hundred protesters gathered at [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|South Sefton]] [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] during the boys' initial court appearances. The parents of the accused were moved to different parts of the country and assumed new identities following death threats from vigilantes.&lt;ref name=trutv_4/&gt; The full trial opened at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] [[Crown Court]] on 1 November 1993,&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; conducted as an [[trial as an adult|adult trial]] with the accused in the dock away from their parents, and the judge and court officials in legal regalia.&lt;ref name="bbc_strasbourg" /&gt; The boys denied the charges of murder, abduction and attempted abduction.&lt;ref name="blood shoe" /&gt; The attempted abduction charge related to an incident at the New Strand Shopping Centre earlier on 12 February 1993, the day of Bulger's death. Thompson and Venables had attempted to lead away another two-year-old boy, but had been prevented by the boy's mother.&lt;ref name="trutv_2" /&gt;

Each boy sat in view of the court on raised chairs (so they could see out of the dock designed for adults) accompanied by two social workers. Although they were separated from their parents, they were within touching distance when their families attended the trial. News stories reported the demeanour of the defendants.&lt;ref name="guardian_harris"&gt;{{Cite news |first= Paul |last= Harris |author2= Bright, Martin |title= The secret meetings that set James's killers free |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/24/bulger.paulharris |work= The Guardian |date= 24 June 2001 |location= London, UK |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131112152925/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/24/bulger.paulharris |archivedate= 12 November 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects were later criticised by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which ruled in 1999 that they had not received a fair trial by being tried in public in an adult court.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; At the trial, the lead [[Prosecutor|prosecution counsel]] [[Richard Henriques]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] successfully rebutted the principle of ''[[doli incapax]]'', which presumes that young children cannot be held legally responsible for their actions.&lt;ref name="doli incapax"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Foster|first=Jonathan|title=Bulger ruling: If the defendants could not talk about their crime, how could they conduct a defence?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bulger-ruling-if-the-defendants-could-not-talk-about-their-crime-how-could-they-conduct-a-defence-739709.html|date=17 December 1999|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 March 2010|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411080625/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bulger-ruling-if-the-defendants-could-not-talk-about-their-crime-how-could-they-conduct-a-defence-739709.html|archivedate=11 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson and Venables were considered by the court to be capable of "mischievous discretion", meaning an ability to act with criminal intent as they were mature enough to understand that they were doing something seriously wrong.&lt;ref name="intent"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Morrison|first=Blake|title=Let the circus begin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/11/bulger-trial-juvenile-crime-edlington|date=11 April 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=1 February 2015|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125204/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/11/bulger-trial-juvenile-crime-edlington|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child psychiatrist, Dr Eileen Vizard, who interviewed Thompson before the trial, was asked in court whether he would know the difference between right and wrong, that it was wrong to take a young child away from his mother, and that it was wrong to cause injury to a child. Vizard replied, "If the issue is on the balance of probabilities, I think I can answer with certainty."

Thompson and Venables did not speak during the trial, and the case against them was based to a large extent on the more than 20 hours of tape-recorded police interviews with the boys, which were played back in court.&lt;ref name="doli incapax"/&gt; Thompson was considered to have taken the leading role in the abduction process, though it was Venables who had apparently initiated the idea of taking Bulger to the railway line.

===Post-trial===
Shortly after the trial, and after the judge had recommended a minimum sentence of eight years, [[Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth|Lord Taylor of Gosforth]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], recommended that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years,&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; which would have made them eligible for release in February 2003 at the age of 20. The editors of the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper handed a petition bearing nearly 280,000 signatures to [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]], in a bid to increase the time spent by both boys in custody.&lt;ref name="Guardian03Mar2010"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/03/james-bulger-case-venables-thompson James Bulger killing: the case history of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709061058/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/mar/03/james-bulger-case-venables-thompson |date=9 July 2013 }} ''The Guardian'' 3 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was successful, and in July 1994, Howard announced that the boys would be kept in custody for a minimum of fifteen years,&lt;ref name="Guardian03Mar2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC3008191"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3008191.stm|title=New sentencing rules: Key cases|date=7 May 2003|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040730061644/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3008191.stm|archivedate=30 July 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that they would not be considered for release until February 2008, by which time they would be 25 years old.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

[[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson]] criticised Howard's intervention, describing the increased tariff as "institutionalised vengeance ... [by] a politician playing to the gallery."&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; The increased minimum term was overturned in 1997 by the [[House of Lords]], who ruled that it was "unlawful" for the Home Secretary to decide on minimum sentences for young offenders.&lt;ref name=bbc_outrage&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|title=Outrage at call for Bulger killers' release|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/492487.stm|publisher=BBC|date=28 October 1999|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222181631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/492487.stm|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and European Court of Human Rights have since ruled that, though the parliament may set minimum and maximum terms for individual categories of crime, it is the responsibility of the trial judge, with the benefit of all the evidence and argument from both prosecution and defence counsel, to determine the minimum term in individual criminal cases.&lt;ref name=BBC3008191 /&gt;

[[Tony Blair]], then [[Shadow Home Secretary]], gave a speech in [[Wellingborough]] during which he said: "We hear of crimes so horrific they provoke anger and disbelief in equal proportions... These are the ugly manifestations of a society that is becoming unworthy of that name."&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] said that "society needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less."&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; The trial judge Mr. Justice Morland stated that exposure to violent videos might have encouraged the actions of Thompson and Venables, but this was disputed by [[David Maclean]], the Minister of State at the Home Office at the time, who pointed out that police had found no evidence linking the case with  "[[video nasty|video nasties]]".&lt;ref name="video_nasties"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/video-link-to-bulger-murder-disputed-1506766.html Video link to Bulger murder disputed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118070353/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/video-link-to-bulger-murder-disputed-1506766.html |date=18 January 2012 }} ''The Independent'', 26 November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention===
After the trial, Thompson was held at the Barton Moss Secure Care Centre in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="bbcvenables" /&gt; Venables was detained in Vardy House, a small eight-bedded unit at [[Red Bank secure unit]] in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] on Merseyside. These locations were not publicly known until after the boys' release.&lt;ref name=STM/&gt; Details of the boys' lives were recorded twice daily on running sheets and signed by the member of staff who had written them. The records were stored at the units and copied to officials in [[Whitehall]]. The boys were taught to conceal their real names and the crime they had committed which resulted in their being in the units. Venables' parents regularly visited their son at Red Bank, just as Thompson's mother did, every three days, at Barton Moss.&lt;ref name="STM" /&gt; The boys received education and rehabilitation; despite initial problems, Venables was said to have eventually made good progress at Red Bank, resulting in him being kept there for the full eight years, despite the facility only being a short-stay remand unit.&lt;ref name="STM" /&gt; Both boys, however, were reported to suffer [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and Venables in particular told of experiencing nightmares and flashbacks of the murder.&lt;ref name="STM" /&gt;

===Appeal and release===
In 1999, lawyers for Thompson and Venables appealed to the European Court of Human Rights that the boys' trial had not been impartial, since they were too young to follow proceedings and understand an adult court. The European Court dismissed their claim that the trial was inhuman and degrading treatment, but upheld their claim they were denied a [[Right to a fair trial|fair hearing]] by the nature of the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''BBC News'' 16 December 1999 {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/567440.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429103441/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/567440.stm |archivedate=29 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.

In June 2001, after a six-month review, the [[Parole Board for England and Wales|parole board]] ruled the boys were no longer a threat to public safety and could be released as their minimum tariff had expired in February of that year. The Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] approved the decision, and they were released a few weeks later on [[life imprisonment in England and Wales|lifelong licence]] after serving eight years.&lt;ref name="bulger_blunkett_statement"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1402798.stm Bulger statement in full] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040311225737/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1402798.stm |date=11 March 2004 }} at news.bbc.co.uk (accessed 23 April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_bulger_victims_danger"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1405142.stm Bulger killers 'face danger'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409101846/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1405142.stm |date=9 April 2004 }} at news.bbc.co.uk (accessed 23 April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Both men "were given new identities and moved to secret locations under a '[[witness protection]]'-style programme."&lt;ref name="witness"&gt;{{Cite news | work=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/22/edlington-brothers-bulger-rehabilitation | title=Bulger killers prove child criminals can be rehabilitated | date=22 January 2010 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Walker | accessdate=13 May 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103233954/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/22/edlington-brothers-bulger-rehabilitation | archivedate=3 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the fabrication of passports, national insurance numbers, qualification certificates and medical records.

In the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down; they divorced in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/the-bad-seeds-20130210-2dt7k.html| location=Sydney | work=Sydney Morning Herald | title=The bad seeds | date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denise married Stuart Fergus and they have two sons together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/twenty-years-after-murder-liverpool-3322165| work=Liverpool Echo| title=Twenty years after the murder of Liverpool toddler James Bulger, his mum Denise Fergus reflects on the past and the battles still to come| first=Susan| last=Lee| date=11 February 2013| accessdate=8 November 2014| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108105834/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/twenty-years-after-murder-liverpool-3322165| archivedate=8 November 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph also remarried and has three daughters by his second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7053350.ece |title='It was like my son had been taken again' |work=The Times |accessdate=11 March 2010 |location=London |first=Will |last=Pavia |date=8 March 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603050050/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7053350.ece |archivedate=3 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2723145.stm|title=Bulger's father visits murder scene|publisher=BBC|date=4 February 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321064311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2723145.stm|archivedate=21 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Observer]]'' revealed that both Venables and Thompson had passed [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] during their sentences. The paper also told how the Bulger family's lawyers had consulted psychiatric experts in order to present the parole panel with a report which suggested that Thompson is an undiagnosed [[psychopathy|psychopath]], citing his lack of remorse during his trial and arrest. The report was ultimately dismissed. However, his lack of remorse at the time, in stark contrast to Venables, led to considerable scrutiny from the parole panel. Upon release, both Thompson and Venables had lost all trace of their [[Scouse|Liverpool accents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/24/bulger.paulharris|title=The secret meetings that set James's killers free|author=Harris &amp; Bright|date=24 June 2001|work=The Observer|accessdate=3 March 2010|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112152925/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/24/bulger.paulharris|archivedate=12 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a psychiatric report prepared in 2000 before Venables' release, he was described as posing a "trivial" risk to the public and unlikely to reoffend.

The ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' published details that suggested the names of the secure institutions in which the pair were housed, in breach of the injunction against publicity which had been renewed early in 2001. In December that year, the paper was fined [[pound sterling|£]]30,000 for [[contempt of court]] and ordered to pay costs of £120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/dec/05/bulger.uknews|title=Paper fined for Bulger order breach|last=Dyer|first=Clare|date=5 December 2001|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2009|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510004314/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/dec/05/bulger.uknews|archivedate=10 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No significant publication or vigilante action against Thompson or Venables has occurred. Despite this, Bulger's mother, Denise, told how in 2004 she received a tip-off from an anonymous source that helped her locate Thompson. Upon seeing him, she was "paralysed with hatred" and was unable to confront him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4048957.stm|title=Bulger mother 'sees son's killer'|work=BBC News|date=28 November 2004|accessdate=26 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213172024/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4048957.stm|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, documents released under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] confirmed that the Home Office had spent £13,000 on an injunction to prevent a foreign magazine from revealing the new identities of Thompson and Venables.&lt;ref name="13k_protect_killers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1259668,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410075357/http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0%2C%2C30100-1259668%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 April 2007 |title=£13K To Protect Bulger Killers' New IDs-Injunction |publisher=news.sky.com |date=8 April 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="protect_killers"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barrett |first=David |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2434965.ece |title=£13,000 Spent protecting Bulger killers' identities |work=The Independent |date=9 April 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2008 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044228/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2434965.ece |archivedate=12 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2008, an appeal to set up a [[The Red Balloon Learner Centres|Red Balloon Learner Centre]] in Merseyside in memory of James Bulger was launched by Denise Fergus, his mother, and [[Esther Rantzen]].&lt;ref name="bbc_memorial"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7295910.stm|title=Bulger 'refuge' appeal launched|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317225041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7295910.stm|archivedate=17 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_memorial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/14/nbulger114.xml|title=James Bulger memorial appeal launched|publisher=at telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=13 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316074800/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2008%2F03%2F14%2Fnbulger114.xml|archivedate=16 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial garden in Bulger's memory was created in Sacred Heart Primary School in his hometown of Kirkby, the school he would have been expected to attend had he not been murdered.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

In March 2010, a call was made to raise the age of criminal responsibility in England from ten to twelve. Children's commissioner Maggie Atkinson said that the killers of James Bulger should have undergone "programmes" to help turn their lives around, rather than being prosecuted. The [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] rejected the call, saying that children over the age of ten knew the difference "between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing".&lt;ref name="atkinson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8565619.stm|title=Calls to raise age of criminal responsibility rejected|date=13 March 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215181605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8565619.stm|archivedate=15 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, a 19-year-old man from the [[Isle of Man]] was given a three-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming in a Facebook message that one of his former colleagues was Robert Thompson. In passing sentence, Deputy High Bailiff Alastair Montgomerie said that the teenager had "put that person at significant risk of serious harm" and in a "perilous position" by making the allegation.&lt;ref name="isle of man bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/8641162.stm|title=Man sentenced for lying over James Bulger killer|date=23 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a 26-year-old man from [[Chorley]], Lancashire, was arrested after allegedly setting up a Facebook group with the title "What happened to Jamie Bulger was f**king hilarious." The man's computer was seized for further investigations.&lt;ref name="chorley"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clickliverpool.com/news/national-news/1215471-denise-fergus-calls-for-crack-down-after-sickening-james-bulger-facebook-group.html |title=Denise Fergus calls for crack down after sickening James Bulger Facebook group |date=6 March 2012 |publisher=Click Liverpool |accessdate=7 March 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119121156/http://www.clickliverpool.com/news/national-news/1215471-denise-fergus-calls-for-crack-down-after-sickening-james-bulger-facebook-group.html |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 2013, the [[Attorney General's Office (United Kingdom)|Attorney General's Office]] announced that it was instituting contempt of court proceedings against several people who had allegedly published photographs online showing Thompson or Venables as adults. A spokesman commented "There are many different images circulating online claiming to be of Venables or Thompson; potentially innocent individuals may be wrongly identified as being one of the two men and placed in danger. The order, and its enforcement, is therefore intended to protect not only Venables and Thompson but also those members of the public who have been incorrectly identified as being one of the two men."&lt;ref name="contempt"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-21577475|title=Attorney general takes action over 'Bulger killer images'|date=25 February 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225170501/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-21577475|archivedate=25 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contempt_2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-21455860|title='Bulger killer Jon Venables images' appear online|date=14 February 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055552/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-21455860|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2013, two men received suspended jail sentences of nine months after admitting to contempt of court, by publishing photographs which they claimed to be of Venables and Thompson on Facebook and Twitter. The posts were seen by 24,000 people. According to BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman, the purpose of the prosecution was to ensure that the public was aware that Internet users were also subject to the law of contempt.&lt;ref name=bbc_contempt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22310412|title='Bulger killers' images': Two admit contempt of court|work=BBC News|date=26 April 2013|accessdate=26 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428055308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22310412|archivedate=28 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] stated that Venables had been returned to prison because of "extremely serious allegations", and stated that he was "unable to give further details of the reasons for Jon Venables's return to custody, because it was not in the public interest to do so."&lt;ref name="bbc_straw"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8553056.stm|title=Bulger killer Venables faces 'extremely serious' claim |date=6 March 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March, Venables was returned to prison accused of [[child pornography]] offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7390615/James-Bulger-killer-Jon-Venables-accused-of-child-porn-offences.html |title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables 'accused of child porn offences' – Telegraph |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=7 March 2010 |location=London |first=Alastair |last=Jamieson |date=7 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310012548/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7390615/James-Bulger-killer-Jon-Venables-accused-of-child-porn-offences.html |archivedate=10 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/world/bulger-killer-jon-venables-jailed-again-for-child-porn/story-e6frfkyi-1225837945932 | title=Bulger killer Jon Venables jailed again 'for child porn' | publisher=news.com.au | accessdate=7 March 2010 | first1=Alison | last1=Chung | first2=Tom | last2=Bonnett | date=8 March 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310074851/http://www.news.com.au/world/bulger-killer-jon-venables-jailed-again-for-child-porn/story-e6frfkyi-1225837945932 | archivedate=10 March 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_2010&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/07/jon-venables-alleged-child-porn-offences |title=Jon Venables back in prison 'over child pornography offences' |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=8 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108112126/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/07/jon-venables-alleged-child-porn-offences |archivedate=8 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2010, Venables was charged with possession and distribution of indecent images of children. It was alleged that he had downloaded 57 indecent images of children over a 12-month period to February 2010, and allowed other people to access the files through a [[peer-to-peer]] network. Venables faced two charges under the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]].&lt;ref name="bbc_porn_charges"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10369277.stm|title=Bulger killer Jon Venables faces child porn charges|date=21 June 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standard_porn_charges"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23847494-james-bulger-killer-jon-venables-is-suspected-paedophile.do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624021137/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23847494-james-bulger-killer-jon-venables-is-suspected-paedophile.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 June 2010 |title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables is 'suspected paedophile' |date=21 June 2010 |work=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=21 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2010, Venables appeared at a court hearing at the [[Old Bailey]] via a video link, visible only to the judge hearing the case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7906539/James-Bulger-killer-Jon-Venables-jailed-for-two-years-for-downloading-child-pornography.html "Venables jailed for two years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170331/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7906539/James-Bulger-killer-Jon-Venables-jailed-for-two-years-for-downloading-child-pornography.html |date=27 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty to charges of downloading and distributing child pornography, and was given a sentence of two years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="sky_porn_charges"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jon-Venables-Appears-By-Video-Link-At-Old-Bailey-On-Child-Pornography-Charges/Article/201007415669778?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15669778_Jon_Venables_Appears_By_Video-Link_At_Old_Bailey_On_Child_Pornography_Charges|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202193321/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jon-Venables-Appears-By-Video-Link-At-Old-Bailey-On-Child-Pornography-Charges/Article/201007415669778?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15669778_Jon_Venables_Appears_By_Video-Link_At_Old_Bailey_On_Child_Pornography_Charges|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 February 2013|title=James Bulger Killer Guilty of Child Porn|date=23 July 2010|work=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the court hearing, it emerged that Venables had posed in online chat rooms as 35-year-old Dawn "Dawnie" Smith, a married woman from Liverpool who boasted about abusing her 8-year-old daughter, in the hope of obtaining further child pornography. Venables had contacted his [[probation officer]] in February 2010, fearing that his new identity had been compromised at his place of work. When the officer arrived at his flat, Venables was attempting to remove or destroy the [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] of his computer with a knife and a tin opener.&lt;ref name=STM/&gt; The officer's suspicions were aroused, and the computer was taken away for examination leading to the discovery of the child pornography, which included children as young as two being raped by adults&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/23/james-bulger-killer-jon-venables|title=Child porn charges send James Bulger's killer back to jail|date=23 July 2010|work=[[Guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=24 July 2010|location=London|first=Helen|last=Pidd|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103225113/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/23/james-bulger-killer-jon-venables|archivedate=3 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent_jailed&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jon Venables jailed for two years over child porn|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/jon-venables-jailed-for-two-years-over-child-porn-2033788.html|date=23 July 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=24 July 2010|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725071909/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/jon-venables-jailed-for-two-years-over-child-porn-2033788.html|archivedate=25 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and penetrative rape of seven- or eight-year-olds.&lt;ref name=STM/&gt;

In November 2010, a review of the [[National Probation Service]] handling of the case by Sir David Omand found that probation officers could not have prevented Venables from downloading child pornography. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the [[National Association of Probation Officers]], commented that only 24-hour surveillance would have prevented Venables from downloading the material.&lt;ref name="omand"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/43766244/Venables-Omand-Review |title=Omand Review – The Case of Jon Venables |publisher=Scribd.com |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105135827/http://www.scribd.com/doc/43766244/Venables-Omand-Review |archivedate=5 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jon_Venables_Probation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-11818188|title=Report finds no probation lapse over Venables images|date=23 November 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=23 November 2010|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124202235/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-11818188|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venables was eligible for parole in July 2011. On 27 June 2011, the parole board decided that Venables would remain in custody, and that his parole would not be considered again for at least another year.&lt;ref name="Jon Venables denied parole"&gt;{{ Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-13927361|title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables denied parole|date=27 June 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629055017/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-13927361|archivedate=29 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venables' relationships and other misdemeanours===
Shortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the [[Red Bank secure unit]] where he was held. In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine|Sunday Times Magazine]]'' article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a [[BBC]] documentary titled ''Jon Venables: What Went Wrong?''  The female staff member was accused of sexual misconduct and suspended; she never returned to work at Red Bank.&lt;ref name=STM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickliverpool.com/news/national-news/1212824-mother-of-murdered-toddler-james-bulger-calls-for-inquiry-into-jon-venables-parole-after-reports-he-had-sex-with-carer.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729013022/http://www.clickliverpool.com/news/national-news/1212824-mother-of-murdered-toddler-james-bulger-calls-for-inquiry-into-jon-venables-parole-after-reports-he-had-sex-with-carer.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 July 2012 |title=Mother of James Bulger calls for Venables parole inquiry after reports he slept with carer &gt; National News &gt; News |publisher=Click Liverpool |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens Borough Council]] denied that the incident had been covered up, saying: "All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor."&lt;ref name="cover_up_denial"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clickliverpool.com/news/national-news/1212839-cover-up-denial-in-case-of-bulger-killers-sex-romps.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119120546/http://www.clickliverpool.com/news/national-news/1212839-cover-up-denial-in-case-of-bulger-killers-sex-romps.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 January 2013|title=Cover-up denial in case of Bulger killer's sex romps|date=28 March 2011|work=Click Liverpool|accessdate=24 April 2011 | first=Tony | last=McConville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venables began living independently in March 2002. Some time thereafter, he began a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child. It is not known whether Venables had already begun downloading child pornography at the time of dating the woman, though he denies having ever met the child. In 2005, when Venables was 23, his probation officer met another girlfriend of his, who was aged 17. After a number of "young girlfriends", it was presumed that Venables was having a delayed adolescence.&lt;ref name=STM/&gt;

After a period of apparently reduced supervision, Venables began excessively drinking, taking drugs, downloading child pornography, as well as visiting Merseyside (a breach of his licence). In 2008, a new probation officer noted that he spent "a great deal of leisure time" playing video games and on the Internet. In September that year, Venables was arrested on suspicion of [[affray]], following a fight outside a nightclub; he claimed he was acting in self-defence and the charges were later dropped after he agreed to go on an alcohol-awareness course. Three months later he was found to be in possession of cocaine; he was subjected to a curfew.&lt;ref name=STM/&gt;

On two separate occasions, Venables revealed his true identity to a friend.&lt;ref name=bbcvenables/&gt;

===New identity for Venables===
On 4 May 2011, it was reported that Venables would once again be given a new identity, following what was described as a "serious security breach" which revealed an identity that he had been using before his imprisonment in 2010. Details of the breach could not be reported for legal reasons.&lt;ref name="new_identity"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/James-Bulger-Killer-Jon-Venables-To-Be-Given-New-ID-After-Security-Breach-Revealed-Old-Identity/Article/201105115985161?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15985161_James_Bulger_Killer_Jon_Venables_To_Be_Given_New_ID_After_Security_Breach_Revealed_Old_Identity |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507231237/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/James-Bulger-Killer-Jon-Venables-To-Be-Given-New-ID-After-Security-Breach-Revealed-Old-Identity/Article/201105115985161?lpos=UK_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15985161_James_Bulger_Killer_Jon_Venables_To_Be_Given_New_ID_After_Security_Breach_Revealed_Old_Identity |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 7 May 2011 |title=Breach Sees Child Killer Venables Get New ID |date=4 May 2011 |work=[[Sky News]] |first=Martin |last=Brunt |accessdate=4 May 2011 |location=London |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice commented: "Such a change of identity is extremely rare and granted only when the police assess that there is clear and credible evidence of a sustained threat to the offender's life on release into the community."&lt;ref name="echo_identity"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/05/04/james-bulger-s-killer-jon-venables-could-get-second-new-identity-after-pictures-leaked-on-internet-100252-28637186/|title=James Bulger's killer Jon Venables could get second new identity after pictures leaked on internet|date=4 May 2011|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|accessdate=4 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013054846/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/05/04/james-bulger-s-killer-jon-venables-could-get-second-new-identity-after-pictures-leaked-on-internet-100252-28637186/|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred after a man from [[Exeter]] posted photographs on a website devoted to identifying [[paedophile]]s, allegedly showing Venables as an adult and giving his name.&lt;ref name="echo_exeter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/news/City-man-defends-decision-publish-photos-Bulger-killer/article-3522436-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508223654/http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/news/City-man-defends-decision-publish-photos-Bulger-killer/article-3522436-detail/article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 8 May 2011 |title=City man defends decision to publish photos of Bulger killer |date=5 May 2011 |work=[[Express &amp; Echo]] |accessdate=6 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 parole hearing and release for Venables===
In November 2011, it was reported that officials had decided that Venables would stay in prison for the foreseeable future, as he would be likely to reveal his true identity if released. A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the reports.&lt;ref name="pa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hgBtaHLHgwvw-iPeQPdG0Ht2-D0w?docId=N0546841320832544731A |title=Venables 'locked up indefinitely' |date=9 November 2011 |work=[[Press Association]] |accessdate=9 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/634BEo5Ia?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hgBtaHLHgwvw-iPeQPdG0Ht2-D0w?docId=N0546841320832544731A |archivedate= 9 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 2013, it was reported that the [[Parole Board for England and Wales]] had approved the release of Venables.&lt;ref name="parole_2013"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/james-bulger-killer-jon-venables-to-be-freed-8688769.html|title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables to be freed|date=4 July 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parole_2013b"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23190447|title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables to be freed|date=4 July 2013|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=4 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170613/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23190447|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2013, it was reported that Venables had been released from prison.&lt;ref name="2013_release"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23941699|title=Bulger killer Jon Venables released from prison|date=3 September 2013|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903104723/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23941699|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 imprisonment of Venables===

On 23 November 2017, it was reported that Venables had again been recalled to prison for possession of child abuse imagery. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the reports.&lt;ref name="2017_prison"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/child-killer-jon-venables-back-13941586|title=Child killer Jon Venables 'back in jail' after latest arrest|date=23 November 2017|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123125151/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/child-killer-jon-venables-back-13941586|archivedate=23 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2018, Venables was charged with unspecified offences relating to indecent images of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-42582561|title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables charged over indecent images|date=5 January 2018|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105143841/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-42582561|archivedate=5 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February 2018, Venables pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children for a second time. He pleaded guilty via video link to three charges of making indecent images of children and one of possessing a paedophile manual. He admitted being in possession of 392 category A, 148 category B, and 630 category C child pornography images, and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. The parole board will decide whether to release him at the end of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42972085|title=James Bulger killer Jon Venables guilty over indecent images|publisher=BBC News|date=7 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207105601/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42972085|archivedate=7 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In June 2007, a computer game based on the TV series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', titled ''[[Law &amp; Order: Double or Nothing]]'' (made in 2003), was withdrawn from stores in the UK following reports that it contained an image of Bulger. The image in question is the [[:Image:Bulger cctv.jpg|CCTV frame of Bulger being led away by his killers]], Thompson and Venables. The scene in the game involves a computer-generated detective pointing out the picture, which is meant to represent a fictional child abduction that the player is then asked to investigate. Bulger's family, along with many others, complained and the game was subsequently withdrawn by its UK distributor, GSP. The game's developer, Legacy Interactive, released a statement in which it apologised for the image's inclusion in the game; according to the statement, the image's use was "inadvertent" and took place "without any knowledge of the crime, which occurred in the UK and was minimally publicized in the United States."&lt;ref name="legacy_apologise"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14423| title=Legacy Apologises For Law And Order Crime Photo| publisher=gamasutra.com| date=21 June 2007| accessdate=13 April 2008| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429180539/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14423| archivedate=29 April 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Swedish playwright [[Niklas Rådström]] used the interview transcripts from interrogations with the murderers and their families to recreate the story. His play, ''Monsters,'' opened to mixed reviews at the [[Arcola Theatre]] in [[London]] in May 2009.&lt;ref name="monsters"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/09/monsters-michael-billington-theatre-review| title=Monsters| work=The Guardian| date=9 May 2009| accessdate=11 March 2010| location=London| first=Michael| last=Billington| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809040527/http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/09/monsters-michael-billington-theatre-review| archivedate=9 August 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAlpine, Emma (15 May 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090523095110/http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/spooners/emma-422/monsters-at-the-arcola-theatre-1135 Review of ''Monsters'' at the Arcola Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Australia's [[Seven Network]] used real footage of the abduction to promote its crime drama ''[[City Homicide]]''. The use of the footage was criticised by Bulger's mother and Seven apologised.&lt;ref name="Seven 'sorry' for Bulger ad"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/0930_theage.pdf| format=PDF| title=Seven 'sorry' for Bulger ad| work=The Age| location=Australia| date=31 August 2009| accessdate=1 September 2009| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401004452/http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/0930_theage.pdf| archivedate=1 April 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2009, co-hosts on Seven's breakfast show [[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|''Sunrise'']] asked whether the killers were now living in Australia in an apparent tie-in with that week's episode of ''City Homicide''. They answered the question the next day, on 25 August 2009, relaying the Australian government's denial that the killers had been settled in the country.&lt;ref name="Rumour-Fuelled Ratings Chase"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2672289.htm| title=Rumour-Fuelled Ratings Chase| publisher=ABC| date=31 August 2009| accessdate=1 September 2009| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904153206/http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2672289.htm| archivedate=4 September 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' storyline, set to begin in December 2009, was cancelled after the show gave Bulger's mother Denise Fergus a special screening. The storyline was to feature [[Loretta Jones]] and her friend Chrissy, who had been given new identities before arriving in the village, after being convicted of murdering a child at the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6812785/Hollyoaks-producers-drop-scenes-echoing-the-killing-of-James-Bulger.html|title=Hollyoaks producers drop scenes echoing the killing of James Bulger|date=15 November 2009|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=8 November 2014|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108111852/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6812785/Hollyoaks-producers-drop-scenes-echoing-the-killing-of-James-Bulger.html|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] investigators recalled that during a previous interview with the estranged husband, Douglas Beamish, that he had a white cat named Snowball. The detectives confiscated the cat and drew blood in which they intended to use [[DNA fingerprinting]] to compare it to the [[DNA]] found in the white hairs from the jacket, but they found that no one in the world had done this before.

After contacting the [[Laboratory of Genomic Diversity]], a laboratory specializing not in forensics, but in the study of genetic diseases, detectives and scientists were able to develop a method in which to test the feline DNA. The test included a fail-safe method of randomly testing 20 other cats from the isolated Prince Edward Island, in order to establish the degree of genetic diversity among cats in the area, to rule out the possibility that the hairs found in the jacket came from a close relative of Snowball, or if all the cats on the island had a common ancestor, rendering the DNA test useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promega.com/geneticidproc/ussymp13proc/contents/raymond.pdf |title=THE MEOWPLEX: A NEW DNA TEST USING TETRANUCLEOTIDE STR MARKERS FOR THE DOMESTIC CAT |last1=Butler |first1=John |last2=David |first2=Victor |last3=O’Brien |first3=Stephen |last4=Menotti-Raymond |first4=Marilyn |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=May 18, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031410/http://www.promega.com/geneticidproc/ussymp13proc/contents/raymond.pdf| archivedate=May 18, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2232">In [[mathematics]], the '''no-wandering-domain theorem''' is a result on [[dynamical system]]s, proven by [[Dennis Sullivan]] in 1985.

The theorem states that a [[rational function|rational map]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''Ĉ'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''Ĉ''' with deg(''f'') &amp;ge; 2 does not have a [[Wandering_set#Wandering_sets_and_dissipative_systems|wandering domain]], where '''Ĉ''' denotes the [[Riemann sphere]].   More precisely, for every [[Connected space|component]] ''U'' in the [[Fatou set]] of ''f'',  the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;U,f(U),f(f(U)),\dots,f^n(U), \dots&lt;/math&gt;

will eventually become periodic.  Here, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[function iteration|''n''-fold iteration]] of ''f'', that is,

:&lt;math&gt;f^n = \underbrace{f \circ f\circ \cdots \circ f}_n .&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Wandering domains for the entire function f(z)=z+2πsin(z).png|thumb|alt=An image of the dynamical plane for &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z+2\pi\sin(z)&lt;/math&gt;.|This image illustrates the dynamics of &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z+2\pi\sin(z)&lt;/math&gt;; the Fatou set (consisting entirely of wandering domains) is shown in white, while the Julia set is shown in tones of gray.]]

The theorem does not hold for arbitrary maps; for example, the [[Transcendental function|transcendental map]] &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z+2\pi\sin(z)&lt;/math&gt; has wandering domains. However, the result can be generalized to many situations where the functions naturally belong to a finite-dimensional parameter space, most notably to transcendental entire and meromorphic functions with a finite number of singular values.

==Professional career==

===Early career===
Usyk turned pro in late 2013 at the age of 26 and signed a promotional deal with the Klitschko brothers' [[K2 Promotions]], fighting in the Cruiserweight division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2013/oleksandr-usyk-an-olympic-gold-medalist-will-make-a-pro-debut-on-nov-9/|title=Oleksandr Usyk, an Olympic gold medalist, will make a pro debut on Nov.9|date=September 25, 2013|publisher=Eastside Boxing|author=Ivan Ivanov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 2013 Usyk made his professional debut by defeating Mexican fighter Felipe Romero via a fifth-round knockout. The following month he stopped 38 year old Epifanio Mendoza in four rounds. In his 3rd professional fight on April 2014, Usyk made his debut in Germany on the undercard of [[Wladimir Klitschko|Klitschko]]-[[Alex Leapai|Leapai]] at the [[König Pilsener Arena|Koenig Pilsener Arena]] defeating Ben Nsafoah via 3rd-round knockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kupoos.com/video/J6NjM8GTNgw/boxing-fight-oleksandr-usyk-ukraine-vs-ben-nsafoah-germany/|title=Usyk vs. Nsafoah in Germany|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Usyk returned home and knocked out Cesar David Crenz in round 4, having knocked him down in round 3 as well.

===Rise up the ranks===
Usyk won his first title on 4 October 2014 after beating South African boxer Daniel Bruwer via round 7 technical knockout for the [[Interim championship|Interim]] [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Inter-Continental [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2014/10/oleksandr-usyk-stops-daniel-bruwer-in-7th-round/|title=Oleksandr Usyk stops Daniel Bruwer in 7th round - Boxing News|date=2014-10-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usyk defended the title two months later stopping 35 year old Danie Venter in round 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2014/12/oleksandr-usyk-vs-danie-venter-on-december-13th-in-kiev-ukraine/|title=Oleksandr Usyk vs. Danie Venter on December 13th in Kiev, Ukraine - Boxing News|date=2014-12-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usyk was ahead on all three judges' scorecards at the time of stoppage.

Usyk made another defence in April 2015 against former Russian cruiserweight champion Andrey Knyazev (11-1, 6 KOs) in Kiev. After seven one-sided rounds, referee Mickey Vann finally stopped the fight in round 8 after deciding Knyazev had taken enough beating. This win kept Usyk on course to a WBO title fight against then champion [[Marco Huck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/04/oleksandr-usyk-defeats-andrey-knyazev/|title=Oleksandr Usyk defeats Andrey Knyazev » Boxing News|date=2015-04-18|work=Boxing News 24|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Usyk defeated former South African light heavyweight champion Johnny Muller via 3rd-round technical knockout at the Sport Palace in Kiev, which saw Usyk control the fight with a jab. Usyk knocked down Muller twice in round 3 and although Muller protested, referee waved the fight off with one second of the round left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/08/oleksandr-usyk-stops-johnny-muller/|title=Oleksandr Usyk stops Johnny Muller - Boxing News|date=2015-08-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usyk won the fight scoring his 9th straight knockout in as many fights, first dropping Rodriguez in round 6 with an uppercut before the fight was stopped in round 7, being knocked down again, although he beat the count. This win put Usyk at WBO's number 1 position, with a World title fight on the cards for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/12/oleksandr-usyk-destroys-pedro-rodriguez/|title=Oleksandr Usyk destroys Pedro Rodriguez - Boxing News|date=2015-12-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the shove, Huck said, "I wanted to show Usyk that he is my hometown and that he should be prepared for the battle of his life on Saturday." Usyk, who remained professional and calm, replied, "If you want to be a great champion, you have to beat the best and Huck is one of the best. I chose to enter this tournament because it is a path to achieve my dream of unifying all the belts. There’s a prestigious trophy at stake too, the Muhammad Ali Trophy. We were born on the same day and I admire Ali because he is the biggest role model in boxing and I will thank God if I win a trophy with his name on it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ringsidefightingnews.com/marco-huck-pushes-usyk-final-press-conference-berlin/|title=Marco Huck Pushes Usyk At Final Press Conference In Berlin|date=2017-09-06|work=Ringsidefightingnews|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was leaving the building, Usyk claimed he would 'bury' Huck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/usyk-vows-bury-huck-being-shoved-press-conference--120203|title=Usyk Vows To "Bury" Huck After Being Shoved at Press Conference - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On fight night, Usyk used his footwork and combination punching to cruise to a TKO win. On top of his dominant performance, Usyk taunted Huck throughout the fight. In round 8, Usyk tripped on Huck's feet and Huck lost a point on the scorecards as he threw a punch at Usyk when the latter was down. Usyk continued to land combinations with little to no response from Huck until referee Robert Byrd stopped the fight in the tenth round. With the win, Usyk progressed to the semi-final stage of the Super Series and was to face the winner of the [[Mairis Briedis]] vs. [[Mike Perez (boxer)|Mike Perez]], scheduled for 30 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2017/9/9/16281600/usyk-vs-huck-results-oleksandr-usyk-stops-marco-huck-to-kick-off-world-boxing-super-series|title=Usyk vs Huck results: Oleksandr Usyk stops Marco Huck to kick off World Boxing Super Series|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/usyk-stops-huck-tenth-advances-wbss-tournament-results--120320|title=Usyk Stops Huck in Tenth, Advances in WBSS Tournament - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usyk quickly took control of the fight, moving rapidly and using his "beautiful, commandeering jab".

According to many reports, Usyk outclassed, outboxed, and dominated Gassiev.

On fight night, Usyk, who is usually a slow starter, eventually took full control of the bout and stopped Bellew in round 8 to retain all the cruiserweight belts. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:00 of round 8. There was very little action in round 1 as both boxers showed each other respect. It was a feeling out round.Due to the lack of action, the crowd began to boo towards the end. Overall, Usyk landed just 3 jabs and Bellew landed 1 power shot. Round 2 was similar, however Bellew stepped on the gas, managed to land some clean shots along with some showboating. Bellew took control in round 3, landing two straight right hands. Usyk began using his jab more and after landing an overhand left, Bellew was left slightly shaken. By the end of round 4, Bellew was backed up against the ropes and looked to tire. Bellew aimed most of his shots to Usyk's body and by round 7, was missing a lot of shots and ended up with a bloodied nose, mostly due to Usyk's foot movement. In round 8, whilst in a neutral corner, Usyk landed a hard left, again buzzing Bellew, forcing him to move away against the ropes. Another left hand wobbled Bellew before Usyk finished him off with another left which dropped Bellew backwards with his head landing on the bottom rope. A brave Bellew tried to get up slowly and beat the count but referee Terry O'Connor stopped the fight. Bellew's 10-fight winning streak came to an end. Judges Alejandro Cid and Steve Gray scored the first seven round 68–65 and 67–66 respectively and Yury Koptsev had the fight 67–67 entering round 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/oleksandr-usyk-blasts-tony-bellew-knockout-results--133598|title=Oleksandr Usyk Blasts Tony Bellew For Knockout Win in Eight|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11551101/usyk-vs-bellew-tony-bellew-falls-short-in-attempt-to-dethrone-cruiserweight-king-oleksandr-usyk|title=Usyk vs Bellew: Tony Bellew falls short in attempt to dethrone cruiserweight king Oleksandr Usyk|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Bellew paid tribute to Usyk and announced his retirement from boxing, saying; "I have been doing this for 20 years, and it is over." Usyk stated 2018 was the most difficult year of his career, but most successful. "We need to put goals in front of us and move towards them," Usyk later stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46167379|title=Oleksandr Usyk beats Tony Bellew to remain undisputed world cruiserweight champion|date=2018-11-11|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11551110/usyk-vs-bellew-tony-bellew-labels-victorious-oleksandr-usyk-the-greatest-man-i-have-ever-shared-a-ring-with|title=Usyk vs Bellew: Tony Bellew labels victorious Oleksandr Usyk 'the greatest man I have ever shared a ring with'|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a small concern during Bellew's post-fight interview as many felt he was clearly concussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/boxing/46186822|title=Tony Bellew: Costello and Bunce debate if he should have been interviewed after Usyk defeat|date=2018-11-12|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to compubox stats, Usyk landed 112 of his 424 punches thrown (26%) and Bellew landed 61 of his 268 thrown (23%).

==Personal life==
Usyk is married to Kateryna and the couple have 3 children (born in 2009, 2013 and 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://prosport.tsn.ua/sport/otaman-usik-vdruge-stav-tatusem-281213.html Oleksandr's wife Katerina gave birth to a son], [[Televiziyna Sluzhba Novyn]] (8 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; They now live in [[Kiev]], Ukraine.

Roughly one month after the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], Usyk declared (on 28 April 2014) he would never exchange his [[Ukrainian citizenship]] for a [[Russian citizenship|Russian]] one and that he considered Crimea a part of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.champion.com.ua/boxing/2014/04/28/571234 Usyk: "I am Ukrainian, and Crimea is Ukrainian"], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] Champion (28 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, answering to a question if he can still enter [[Crimea]] and his patriotic position, he stated that he can enter Crimea after each of his fights; that he doesn't like to talk politics due to the fact that people like to take words out of context, that in Russia he has many fans and that he doesn't divide "our peoples because we are [[Slavs]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://xsport.ua/boxing_s/news/usik-ya-ne-razdelyayu-narody-ukrainy-i-rossii-poskolku-my-slavyane_180193/|title=Усик: "Я не разделяю народы Украины и России, ибо мы славяне"|date=1 April 2016|work=Xsport.ua|language=Russian|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5464">[[File:Basarab Olha-1-.jpg|thumb|right|Olha Basarab, in the uniform of the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]]]]
'''Olha Basarab''' ({{lang-uk|Ольга Михайлівна Басараб}} September 1, 1889 - February 12, 1924) was a Ukrainian political activist and member of the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]] who conducted both charitable and humanitarian work that was recognized by the International Red Cross, as well as military or intelligence work on behalf of the Ukrainian underground. She was an executive of the Ukrainian Women's Union branch in [[Lviv]] Ukraine. She was arrested by the Polish police after being accused of working with the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]] and of spying for Germany (with whom the Ukrainian Military Organization had a working relationship). Materials indicating cooperation with Germany's intelligence were found at her home.&lt;ref&gt;''"Organizacja Ukraińskich Nacjonalistów 1929-1939"'' Roman Wysocki&lt;/ref&gt;  Different accounts of her death in prison exist range from suicide to murder. Afterwards she was seen as a martyr and source of inspiration within the Ukrainian community.&lt;ref name ="martha"&gt;Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak (1988). ''Feminists despite themselves: women in Ukrainian community life, 1884-1939 '' Edmonton: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta pg. 164 "Her death, at first covored up by the Poles, was later presented as a suicide, but the exhumation of her body proved otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Olha Basarab was born Olha Levytska in 1889 into the family of petty gentry (coat-of-arms [[Rogala coat of arms|Rogala]]) near the town of [[Rohatyn]]. In 1914 she married Dmytry Basarab, who died fighting for Austrian on the Italian front in 1915.&lt;ref name = "lvivska"&gt;[http://www.gazeta.lviv.ua/articles/2006/02/17/13110/ ] Lvivska Hazata (Lviv Newspaper) No. 30 (837) 2006 article written by Ihor Chornovol, [http://www.inst-ukr.lviv.ua/departments/worker/?profileid=7 historian at the Institute of Ukrainian Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I Basarab was a member of the first Women's Platoon of the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]], a unit of Ukrainian volunteers within the Austrian army. After the war she worked in the years 1918-1923 as an accountant of Embassy of Ukraine in Vienna, she also visited Denmark, Germany, Norway and other states to collect military and political intelligence.&lt;ref name = "lvivska"/&gt;
She was involved in charity work involving helping wounded soldiers and civilians, and was recognized by the [[International Red Cross]] for her efforts.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Ukraine"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/B/A/BasarabOlha.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine] University of Toronto Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Active in Ukrainian political organizing, she helped organize Ukrainian soldiers and was a member of the Ukrainian Women's Union in Vienna and a member of the Supreme Executive of the Union of Ukrainian Women in [[Lviv]]. In 1923 she started working with Ukrainian Military Organization where her liaison was colonel Eugene Konovalets.&lt;ref name = "lvivska"/&gt; She was accused by the Polish authorities of working with intelligence from Germany and Bolshevik Ukraine in Poland&lt;ref name = "lvivska"/&gt; and belonging to the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]] which organised assassinations on Poles and Ukrainians. After her imprisonment, materials concerning cooperation with German intelligence were found (the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]] signed an agreement on May 1923 with Weimar Germany's [[Absweh|intelligence service]] according to which UVO would conduct espionage work against Poland while the German side was to provide financial aid and military equipment). She died in prison in unclear circumstances. The Polish government was accused of torturing her to death,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Ukraine"/&gt; although this accusation was never conclusively proven.&lt;ref name = "lvivska"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wysocki page 341"&gt;Wysocki page 341&lt;/ref&gt;  Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak from Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies claims the Polish government initially presented her death as a suicide but subsequent exhumation of her body showed that she had been murdered in their custody.&lt;ref name ="martha"/&gt; Basarab's death resulted in protests from Ukrainians, demands for an inquiry from Ukrainian members of the Polish [[Sejm|parliament]], and calls from the Jewish members of the Polish parliament to investigate prisoner conditions in Polish jails.&lt;ref name = "lvivska"/&gt; Her body was exhumed on February 26 and the Polish forensic expert stated that she had died by hanging. He declined to publicly identify the bruises on her body as being the results of beatings, although his student stated that he had told her during the autopsy that Basarb's body showed traces of having been beaten. Rumors spread in Lviv that police tortured people through the use of electric shocks.&lt;ref name = "lvivska"/&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
In England's [[Lake District]], [[Peter Rabbit]], his cousin [[Benjamin Bunny]], and Peter's triplet sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, spend most of their days picking on Mr. Joe McGregor and stealing vegetables from his garden. They are friends with a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits as well as the surrounding nature. Bea takes on a mother-like relationship with the rabbits due to the death of their parents, who were killed by McGregor. One day, Peter is forced to leave his jacket in McGregor's garden and goes back to retrieve it. McGregor spots and catches him, but suddenly dies of a heart attack due to decades of unhealthy eating habits. Enthralled, Peter invites all of the local animals and takes over McGregor's manor.

Meanwhile in [[London]], McGregor's great-nephew Thomas McGregor, an uptight, controlling workaholic, works at the toy department of [[Harrods]] department store where he waits for a promotion to associate general manager. He indifferently accepts the news about his great-uncle's death, someone he was completely unaware of, but is infuriated over losing the promotion to a lazy nephew of the managing director and is fired for losing his temper. His now-former manager encourages him to get a hobby and spend some time in the country.

When Thomas learns that his great-uncle's manor is valuable and that he's inherited it, he decides to appraise and prepare it for resale in order to start his own toy store to get even with his former employers. He kicks out Peter and his friends and begins to upgrade the security of the garden wall and gates, despite Bea's objections. When Peter and Benjamin sneak back into the garden, Thomas catches the latter and attempts to drown Benjamin in a river. His cousins rescue him; Thomas instead accidentally drops a prized set of binoculars that Bea had given him earlier, forcing him to retrieve it.

Thomas and Peter start a war with each other by setting up traps and other offensive nuisances. Thomas and Bea end up falling in love with each other, which causes Peter to become jealous and wanting to separate them more. This all culminates when Peter rewires an electric fence set up by Thomas, prompting Thomas to throw dynamite at Peter's burrow. Thomas then attacks Peter in the garden, telling Peter that his antics caused him to become aggressive. When Peter detonates the dynamite to prove to Bea that Thomas was using it, he ends up knocking down the tree on top of the burrow, which crushes Bea's art studio. Bea, ignoring Thomas’s explanation of his quarrel with the rabbits, breaks up with him, and he goes back to London to work at Harrods again.

Peter feels bad for what he has done, and upon learning that Bea intends to leave the neighborhood, he and Benjamin head to London to find Thomas at Harrods. Tricking Thomas into believing he was imagining the rabbits’ ability to communicate, Peter apologizes for his part of the conflict and convinces Thomas to follow his heart. They rush back to the country, where Peter shows Bea the detonator and presses it for her to see, confirming Thomas’s previous claims that the rabbits were responsible for the explosion. Peter and Thomas apologize and convince Bea not to leave her home.

Wishing to remain with Bea, Thomas no longer wants to sell the manor but discovers that an unpleasant wealthy couple had already bought the house and finalized the sale. Peter and his friends use their tricks to force the couple out of the house, allowing Thomas to move back in. Thomas and Bea resume their relationship, and he permits the wildlife to freely take food from the garden as long as it's within reason. Peter and his family restore the burrow with Bea and Thomas’s help. Thomas sets up his own toy shop in the village, where Bea showcases her illustrations of the rabbits.

''Peter Rabbit'' was originally scheduled to be released on March 23, 2018,&lt;ref name="Dec2015CS" /&gt; but it was moved up to February 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Rabbit|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movie/peter-rabbit-2018|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=[[CraveOnline Media]]|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trailer criticism===
The first trailer received negative feedback from critics and fans of the character, many of whom labelled the film as being too modern and insulting to Beatrix Potter's works. [[Collider (website)|Collider]] called the trailer "garbage" and a "low brow 'comedy' cringe fest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Trombore|title=First ‘Peter Rabbit’ Trailer Gives Us Another Reason to Be Mad at James Corden|url=http://collider.com/peter-rabbit-trailer|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=Complex Media|date=September 21, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Heritage from ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that "the ''Peter Rabbit'' film looks like the result of some blisteringly inept manhandling [...] there's something genuinely harrowing about the sight of ''Peter Rabbit'' – gentle, Edwardian Peter Rabbit – thoughtlessly injuring some birds, or grabbing a pile of lettuce leaves and making it rain like a banker in a strip club, or literally twerking" and argued "there is no way on Earth that [Beatrix Potter would] have ever given the green light to a slow motion car crash like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stuart|last=Heritage|title=James Corden's Peter Rabbit: another kids' classic wrecked forever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/25/peter-rabbit-film-trailer-beatrix-potter-james-corden|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' writer James Baldock found that the trailer was "so gut wrenchingly bad" and that "if the movie lives up to its two minute preview – [it] is set to be the greatest abomination to grace the big screen since ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''." He finished by writing "Listen carefully, and you can just about hear the sound of Beatrix Potter, turning furiously in her grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Baldock|title=Here’s the trailer for the new Peter Rabbit movie – and it’s a total disaster|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/25/heres-the-trailer-for-the-new-peter-rabbit-movie-and-its-a-total-disaster-6954943/|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, a new trailer for the United Kingdom was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Katharine|last=Cowdrey|title=Sony launches trailer for upcoming Peter Rabbit film|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/sony-launches-trailer-upcoming-peter-rabbit-film-669466|website=[[The Bookseller]]|publisher=Bookseller Media|location=London, England|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 133 reviews and an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Peter Rabbit'' updates Beatrix Potter's classic characters with colorfully agreeable results that should entertain younger viewers while admittedly risking the wrath of purists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Rabbit (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/peter_rabbit_2018|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/peter-rabbit|title=Peter Rabbit Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Cinemascore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Peter Rabbit|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In the first week after the film's release, groups in multiple countries criticized it for "allergy bullying" and called for an apology from Sony. The accusations focused on a scene where Thomas McGregor — whose character has a known severe allergy to [[blackberries]] — is pelted with the berries until one enters his mouth, causing him to enter [[anaphylactic shock]] and grab for his [[Epipen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/11/peter-rabbit-film-criticised-for-depicting-allergy-bullying |title=Peter Rabbit film criticised for depicting allergy bullying |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=February 11, 2018 |author=Guardian staff|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-11/peter-rabbit-calls-sony-pictures-apologise-food-allergy-scene/9420102 |title=Peter Rabbit: Calls for Sony Pictures to apologise after food allergy bullying scene in new movie |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|first1=Edwina|last1=Seselja|first2=Samantha|last2=Dawes|date=February 11, 2018|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/11/peter-rabbit-film-accused-food-bullying-rabbits-pelt-allergic|title=Peter Rabbit film accused of food bullying as rabbits pelt allergic man with blackberries |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=February 11, 2018 |last=Ward |first=Victoria|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Sony published a statement saying "We sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue, and we truly apologize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43027764|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Peter Rabbit film producers apologise over allergy scene|date=February 12, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15835">'''Pluralism''' is a term used in [[philosophy]], meaning "doctrine of multiplicity", often used in opposition to [[monism]] ("doctrine of unity") and [[Mind–body dualism|dualism]] ("doctrine of duality"). The term has different meanings in [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[logic]].

In metaphysics, pluralism is the doctrine that - contrary to the assertions of monism and dualism, there are in fact many different [[Substance theory|substances]] in nature that constitute reality.

In ontology, pluralism refers to different ways, kinds, or modes of being. For example, a topic in [[ontological pluralism]] is the comparison of the modes of existence of things like 'humans' and 'cars' with things like 'numbers' and some other concepts as they are used in science.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Philosophy Compass |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=910–918 |date= November 12, 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2012.00527.x |author=Joshua Spencer |title=Ways of being}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In epistemology, pluralism is the position that there is not one consistent means of approaching truths about the world, but rather many. Often this is associated with [[pragmatism]], or conceptual, [[factual relativism|contextual]], or [[cultural relativism]]. In the [[philosophy of science]] it may refer to the acceptance of co-existing scientific paradigms which though accurately describing their relevant domains are nonetheless [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]]. 

In logic, pluralism is the view that there is no one correct logic, or alternatively, that there is more than one correct logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beall |first=JC|last2=Restall |first2=Greg |date=2000 |title=Logical Pluralism |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048400012349751?journalCode=rajp20#.V5qjxrgrLIU |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages= |doi=10.1080/00048400012349751 |access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may, for instance, believe that [[classical logic]] is the correct logic generally, but believe that [[paraconsistent logic]] is the correct logic for dealing with certain [[Liar paradox|paradoxes]]. However, there are different versions of logical pluralism depending on what one believes 'logic' to be and what it means for a logical system to be 'correct'.

== Metaphysical pluralism ==
{{See also|Monism|Mind–body dualism}}
Metaphysical pluralism in philosophy is the multiplicity of metaphysical models of the structure and content of reality, both as it appears and as logic dictates that it might be,&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/p5.htm |work=Philosophy Pages |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Pluralism |quote=Belief that reality ultimately includes many different kinds of things.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is exhibited by the four related models in Plato's ''Republic''&lt;ref name=Plato&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book 6 (509D–513E)&lt;/ref&gt; and as developed in the  [[Irrealism (philosophy)#Nelson Goodman.27s irrealism|contrast]] between [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]]. It is similar to the [[many-worlds interpretation]]. Pluralism is in contrast to the concept of monism in metaphysics, while [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] is a limited form, a pluralism of exactly two models, structures, elements, or concepts.&lt;ref name=Hamlyn&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Simple substances: Monism and pluralism |title=Metaphysics |author=D. W. Hamlyn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8v0tI9TT8cC&amp;pg=PA109 |pages=109 ''ff'' |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521286905 |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A distinction is made between the metaphysical identification of realms of reality&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite web |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/james-o/#SH5a |author=Wayne P. Pomerleau |date=February 11, 2011|title=Subsection ''Realms of reality'' in article on William James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more restricted sub-fields of ontological pluralism (that examines what exists in each of these realms) and [[epistemological pluralism]] (that deals with the methodology for establishing knowledge about these realms).

===Ancient pluralism ===
{{anchor|Classical elements}}
In Greece, [[Empedocles]] wrote that they were fire, air, water and earth,&lt;ref name=DielsKranz&gt;Diels –Kranz, Simplicius ''Physics'', frag. B-17&lt;/ref&gt; although he used the word "root" rather than "element" (στοιχεῖον; ''stoicheion''), which appeared later in Plato.&lt;ref name=Plato2&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', 48 b - c&lt;/ref&gt; From the association (φιλία; ''philia'') and separation (νεῖκος; ''neikos'') of these indestructible and unchangeable root elements, all things came to be in a fullness (πλήρωμα; ''[[pleroma]]'') of ratio (λόγος; ''[[logos]]'') and proportion (ἀνάλογος; ''analogos'').

Similar to Empedocles, [[Anaxagoras]] was another ancient greek philosohper with ties to the [[Pluralist school]]. His metaphysical system is centered around mechanically necessitated [[Nous]] which governs, combines and diffuses the various "roots" of reality (known as ''homoioneroi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Curd |first1=Patricia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaxagoras/#MetPri |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;''). Unlike Empedocles' four ''"root elements"'' and similar to [[Democritus]]'s multitude of atoms (yet not physical in nature), these homoioneroi are used by Anaxagoras to explain the multiplicity in reality and becoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Anaxagoras |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Anaxagoras |website=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pluralist theory of being influenced later thinkers such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s theory of ''monads'' and [[Julius Bahnsen]]'s idea of ''"will henades"''. The notion of a governing [[Nous]] would also be used by [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], but they will assign it a more active and rational role in their philosophical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous#Plato |website=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] incorporated these elements, but his [[substance theory|substance pluralism]] was not material in essence. His [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic theory]] allowed him to maintain a [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduced set]] of basic material elements as per the [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]], while answering for the ever-changing flux of [[Heraclitus]] and the unchanging unity of [[Parmenides]]. In his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]],'' due to the continuum of [[Zeno's paradoxes]], as well as both logical and empirical considerations for natural science, he presented numerous arguments against the [[atomism]] of [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], who posited a basic duality of ''void'' and ''atoms''. The atoms were an infinite variety of ''irreducibles'', of all shapes and sizes, which randomly collide and mechanically hook together in the void, thus providing a reductive account of changeable figure, order and position as aggregates of the unchangeable atoms.&lt;ref name=Aristotle&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 4, 985&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ontological pluralism&lt;!--'Ontological pluralism' redirects here--&gt; ==
The topic of ontological pluralism discusses different ways, kinds, or modes of being. Recent attention in ontological pluralism is due to the work of Kris McDaniel, who defends ontological pluralism in a number of papers. The name for the doctrine is due to Jason Turner, who, following McDaniel, suggests that "In contemporary guise, it is the doctrine that a logically perspicuous description of reality will use multiple [[existential quantifier|quantifiers]] which cannot be thought of as ranging over a single [[domain of discourse|domain]]."&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite journal |title= Logic and ontological pluralism |author=Jason Turner |journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic |doi=10.1007/s10992-010-9167-x |date=April 2012 |pages=419–448 |volume=41 |issue=2 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10992-010-9167-x#page-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are numbers, fictional characters, impossible things, and holes. But, we don't think these things all exist in the same sense as cars and human beings."&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt;

It is common to refer to a film, novel or otherwise fictitious or virtual narrative as not being 'real'. Thus, the characters in the film or novel are not real, where the 'real world' is the everyday world in which we live. However, some authors may argue that fiction informs our concept of reality, and so has ''some'' kind of reality.&lt;ref name=Prentice&gt;{{cite book |pages=529–546 |chapter=Chapter 26: Exploring the boundary between fiction and reality |author1= Deborah A Prentice |author2=Richard J Gerrig |editor1= Shelly Chaiken |editor2= Yaacov Trope |year=1999 |title= Dual-process theories in social psychology |publisher=Guilford Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&amp;pg=PA529 |isbn=1572304219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Castaneda&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fiction and reality: Their fundamental connections: An essay on the ontology of total experience |author=Hector-Neri Castañeda |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-422X(79)90014-7 |journal=Poetics |volume=8 |issue=1-2 |date=April 1979 |pages=31–62 |doi=10.1016/0304-422x(79)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s notion of [[language-games]] argues that there is no overarching, single, fundamental ontology, but only a patchwork of overlapping interconnected ontologies [[ineluctably]] leading from one to another. For example, Wittgenstein discusses 'number' as technical vocabulary and in more general usage:
{{quote|""All right: the concept of 'number' is defined for you as the logical sum of these individual interrelated concepts: cardinal numbers, rational numbers, real numbers ''etc.'';" ... — it need not be so. For I ''can'' give the concept 'number' rigid limits in this way, that is, use the word 'number' for a rigidly limited concept, but I can also use it so that the extension of the concept is ''not'' closed by a frontier. ...Can you give the boundary? No. You can ''draw'' one..."|Ludwig Wittgenstein|excerpt from §68 in ''Philosophical Investigations''}} Wittgenstein suggests that it is not possible to identify a single concept underlying all versions of 'number', but that there are many interconnected meanings that transition one to another; vocabulary need not be restricted to technical meanings to be useful, and indeed technical meanings are 'exact' only within some proscribed context:

Eklund has argued that Wittgenstein's conception includes as a special case the technically constructed, largely autonomous, ''forms of language'' or [[internal-external distinction|''linguistic frameworks'']] of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and Carnapian ontological pluralism. He places Carnap's ontological pluralism in the context of other philosophers, such as [[Eli Hirsch]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].&lt;ref name=Eklund&gt;{{cite book |title=Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology |author=Matti Eklund |chapter=Chapter 4: Carnap and ontological pluralism |year=2009 |pages=130–156 |isbn=0199546002 |editor1=David J Chalmers |editor2=David Manley |editor3=Ryan Wasserman |publisher=Clarendon Press}}  On-line text found at [https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/me72/carnap.pdf Cornell]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemological pluralism==
{{main article|Epistemological pluralism}}

Epistemological pluralism is a term used in philosophy and in other fields of study to refer to different ways of knowing things, different epistemological [[methodology|methodologies]] for attaining a full description of a particular field.&lt;ref name=Kellert&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Introduction: The pluralist stance |author1=Stephen H Kellert |author2=Helen E Longino |author3=C Kenneth Waters |url=http://www.mcps.umn.edu/assets/pdf/19intro_scipluralism.pdf |page=''vii'' |title=Scientific pluralism; volume XIX in Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science |isbn=978-0-8166-4763-7 |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Minnesota Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609220945/http://mcps.umn.edu/assets/pdf/19Intro_SciPluralism.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[philosophy of science]] epistemological pluralism arose in opposition to [[reductionism]] to express the contrary view that at least some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach.&lt;ref name=Kellert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3083/1/EP3single.doc |title=Epistemological pluralism |author=E Brian Davies |year=2006}} Available through [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/ PhilSci Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical pluralism==
{{main article|Logical pluralism}}

''Logical pluralism'' can be defined a number of ways: the position that there is more than one correct account of [[logical consequence]] (or no single, 'correct' account at all), that there is more than once correct set of [[logical constants]] or even that the 'correct' logic depends on the relevant logical questions under consideration (a sort of logical instrumentalism).&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Gillian|title=Logical Pluralism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-pluralism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=28 July 2016|ref=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism about logical consequence says that because different logical systems have different logical consequence relations, there is therefore more than one correct logic. For example, classical logic holds that the [[principle of explosion|argument from explosion]] is a valid argument, but in [[Graham Priest]]'s paraconsistent logic - '''LP''', the 'Logic of Paradox' - it is an invalid argument.&lt;ref name=Priest&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Priest|first1=Graham|title=The Logic of Paradox|jstor=30227165|journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic|publisher=Springer|ref=Priest}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, logical monists may respond that a plurality of logical theories does not mean that no single one of the theories is the correct one. After all, there are and have been a multitude of theories in physics, but that hasn't been taken to mean that all of them are correct.

Pluralists of the instrumentalist sort hold if a logic can be correct at all, it based on its ability to answer the logical questions under consideration. If one wants to understand vague propositions, one may need a [[many-valued logic]]. Or if one wants to know what the truth-value of the Liar Paradox is, a [[dialetheism|dialetheic]] paraconsistent logic may be required. [[Rudolf Carnap]] held to a version of logical pluralism:
{{quote|In logic there are no morals. Everyone is at liberty to build his own logic, i.e. his own language, as he wishes. All that is required of him is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he must state his methods clearly, and give syntactical rules instead of philosophical arguments.|Rudolph Carnap|excerpt from §17 in ''The Logical Syntax of Language''}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8836">The '''predation risk allocation hypothesis''' attempts to explain how and why animals' behaviour and [[foraging]] strategies differ in various predatory situations, depending on their risk of endangerment. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beauchamp, G., &amp; Ruxton, G. D. (2011) A reassessment of the predation risk allocation hypothesis: A comment on Luna and Bendnekoff. ''The American Naturalist, 177'', 143-146&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that an animal's alertness and attention, along with its willingness to hunt for food, will change depending on the [[risk factors]] within that animal's environment and the presence of predators that could attack. The model assumes there are different levels of risk factors within various environments and prey animals will behave more cautiously when they are found in high-risk environments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ferrari, M. C. O., Sih, A., &amp; Chivers, D. P. (2009) The paradox of risk allocation: A review and prospectus. ''Animal Behaviour, 78'', 579-585&lt;/ref&gt; The overall effectiveness of the model for predicting animal behaviour varies, therefore, its results are dependent on the prey species used in the model and how their behaviour changes. There are several reasons the predation risk allocation hypothesis was developed to observe how animal behaviour varies depending on its risk factors. Mixed results have been found for the model's effectiveness in predicting predator defensive behaviour for various species.

== Hypothesis background == 

The hypothesis attempts to explain how animals demonstrate anti-predator behaviours in different environments depending on risk factors, ie. predatory threats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Threat levels can vary among different habitats, depending on the type of terrain and other animals inhibiting that zone.

There are two main predictions used in the predation risk allocation hypothesis. The first assumes that animals will increase foraging in safer environments, at times when predators are not present. The predicted advantage of foraging while predators are absent allows animals to eat and gain energy to then fight against predators upon their arrival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second prediction anticipates that animals will demonstrate less anti-predator behaviours when they have been in a high-risk environment for a long period of time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Buskirk, J. V., Muller, C., Portmann, A., &amp; Surbeck, M. (2002) A test of the risk allocation hypothesis: Tadpole responses to temporal change in predation risk. ''Ecology, 13'', 526-530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When significant time has passed in the same environmental location, the animal needs to eat to survive, therefore they are more likely to forage and spend less energy defending against predators when they have been in the same environment for a long period of time. These animals have to be less selective over their foraging times since they are not left with many options.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The model cannot be used for animals that exhibit control over their predation risk. These animals would not demonstrate the anticipated behavioural responses in accordance with the hypothesis predictions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, if animals could control their predation risk, they would not exhibit avoidance behaviours in response to predation in safer situations and therefore not supporting the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another observation found animals with more time to learn about risk factors in their habitats were then better able to demonstrate behaviours found to be consistent with this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Ferrari, M. C. O., Rive, A. C., MacNaughton, C. J., Brown, G. E., &amp; Chivers, D. P. (2008) Fixed vs. random temporal predictability of predation risk: An extension of the risk allocation hypothesis. ''Ethology, 114'', 238-244.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, those animals without sufficient time to learn or understand the risk factors in their area will not display behaviours that support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Case studies ==

Various studies have observed the effectiveness of the predation risk allocation hypothesis for both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. The results both support and refute the hypothesis. 

=== Snails === 
Freshwater physid snails ''([[Physella gyrina]])'' act in accordance with the hypothesis in response to crayfish predators in their environments. The snails' frequency of activity, response to predators and interaction behaviours with their environments have been observed in different contexts. The physid snails' behaviour occurs in response to the level of predatory threat in their habitat area, they increase foraging and demonstrate higher activity measures in lower predation risk levels whereas they will decrease these behaviours in high risk predation areas.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Sih, A., &amp; McCarthy, T. M. (2002) Prey responses to pulses of risk and safety: Testing the risk allocation hypothesis. ''Animal Behaviour, 63'', 437-443&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish === 
[[File:Male Convict Cichlid.jpg|thumb|Male Convict Cichlid]]
The convict cichlids ''([[Archocentrus nigrofasciatus]])'' have been observed in two different contexts, high and low-risk predatory settings. These fish behave with less anti-predator and foraging behaviours when located in dangerous predatory areas, high-risk compared to the low-risk zones. These behaviour adjustments in various contexts support the risk allocation hypothesis since the animals follow its assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Tadpoles ===
Tadpoles of the pool frog ''([[Rana lessonae]])'' do not follow the predictions risk allocation hypothesis with their foraging behaviours. Tadpoles were observed and these animals did not increase their foraging behaviours in zones with less threat. Instead, they continued a constant feeding pattern, not dependant on their living condition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Voles ===
[[File:Bank voles.jpg|thumb|Bank voles]]
Behaviour of bank voles ''([[Clethrionomys glareolus]])'' in response to least weasel prey does not support the risk allocation hypothesis, which can demonstrate that bank voles cannot assess risk in their territories. There were no changes in the foraging behaviours in different risk contexts or the amount of time these animals spent in these zones. The voles demonstrated more anti-predator behaviour in the high-risk situation however they did not increase their foraging behaviour in the high-risk zones. Since the bank vole behaviour was not demonstrated as predicted in both zones, they cannot be used to support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Sundell, J., Dudek, D., Klemme, I., Koivisto, E., Pusenius, J., &amp; Ylönen, H. (2004) Variation in predation risk and vole feeding behaviour: A field test of the risk allocation hypothesis ''Oecologia, 139'', 157-162&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis application ==
The predation risk allocation hypothesis can help researchers learn how animals make behavioural responses to predators, since it is the first research that observes temporal variation in different risk situations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Animals' responses to predators can be better understood by observing behaviour adjustments to modified risk levels. The hypothesis however, does not explain behaviour in all types of variable risk situations, since this concept assumes that risk levels in every environment will change over time.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lima|first1=S. L.|last2=Bednekoff|first2=P. A.|title=Temporal variation in danger drives antipredator behaviour: The predation risk allocation hypothesis|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1999|volume=153|page=649-659}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk allocation hypothesis best supports observations of animal behaviour for those animals that developed and evolved in the same environments where they received information about that zone's local predators.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luttbeg|first=B.|date=2017|title=Re-examining the causes and meaning of the risk allocation hypothesis|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=189|pages=644-656|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These animals would therefore be most informed on what to expect and how to react in their environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Animals that are exposed to risky situations i.e. predation, more frequently, may demonstrate similar behaviours in both high-risk and safe situations due to habituation.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Mirza, R. S., Mathis, A., Chivers, D. P. (2005). Does Temporal Variation in Predation Risk Influence the Intensity of Antipredator Responses? A Test of the Risk Allocation Hypothesis. ''Ethology, 112,'' 44-51.&lt;/ref&gt; These animals become used to the constant threat and therefore would not act the same compared to animals who are not used to high-risk situations since they have become more immune to these instances. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Prelabor rupture of membranes''' ('''PROM'''), also known as '''premature rupture of membranes''', is [[rupture of membranes|breakage of the amniotic sac]] before the onset of [[childbirth|labor]].&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; Women usually experience a painless gush or a steady leakage of fluid from the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name=Ox2007&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norwitz |first1=Errol R. |last2=Arulkumaran |first2=S. |last3=Symonds |first3=I. |title=Oxford American Handbook of Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195189384 |page=268 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=pZk6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA268 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complications in the baby may include [[premature birth]], [[umbilical cord compression|cord compression]], and infection.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ox2007/&gt; Complications in the mother may include [[placental abruption]] and [[postpartum endometritis]].&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Risk factors and diagnosis --&gt;
Risk factors include [[chorioamnionitis|infection of the amniotic fluid]], prior PROM, [[obstetrical bleeding|bleeding in the later parts of pregnancy]], smoking, and a mother who is [[underweight]].&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and [[speculum exam]] and may be supported by testing the vaginal fluid or by [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; If it occurs before 37 weeks it is known as preterm PROM otherwise it is known as term PROM.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Treatment is based on how far along a women is in [[pregnancy]] and whether complications are present.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; In those at or near term without any complications, [[induction of labor]] is generally recommended.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; Time may also be provided for labor to begin spontaneously.&lt;ref name=Ox2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; In those 24 to 34 weeks of [[gestation]] without complications [[corticosteroids]] and close observation is recommended.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; [[Antibiotics]] may be given for those at risk of ''[[Group B streptococcus]]''.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; Delivery is generally indicated in those with complications, regardless of how far along in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; 

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
About 8% of term pregnancies are complicated by PROM while about 30% of preterm births are complicated by PROM.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kee2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keeling |first1=Jean W. |title=Fetal and Neonatal Pathology |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9781447136828 |page=325 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sdJ9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dug2016&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duff |first1=Patrick |title=Management of Premature Rupture of the Membranes in Term Patients |journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine |date=2016 |doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 24 weeks PROM occurs in fewer than 1% of pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt; Prognosis is primarily determined by complications related to prematurity such as [[necrotizing enterocolitis]], [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], and [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref name=Bull2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mer2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mercer |first1=Brian M. |title=Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes |journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine |date=2009 |doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most women will experience a painless leakage of fluid out of the vagina. They may notice either a distinct "gush" or a steady flow of small amounts of watery fluid in the absence of steady [[Uterine contraction|uterine contractions]].&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; Loss of fluid may be associated with the baby becoming easier to feel through the belly (due to the loss of the surrounding fluid), decreased uterine size, or [[meconium]] (fetal stool) seen in the fluid.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment : Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|last = DeCherney|first = Alan|publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0071638562|location = New York|pages =Chapter 14: Late Pregnancy Complication, section: premature rupture of membranes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
[[Image:Fetus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A fetus surrounded by the amniotic sac which is enclosed by fetal membranes. In PROM, these membranes rupture before labor starts.]]
The cause of prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) is not clearly understood, but the following are risk factors that increase the chance of it occurring. In many cases, however, no risk factor is identified.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014&gt;{{Cite book|title = Williams Obstetrics|last = Cunningham|first = F|publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0071798938|location = New York|pages =Chapter 23: Abnormal Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Infections: [[urinary tract infection]], [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]], lower genital tract infections (e.g. [[bacterial vaginosis]]),&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; infections within the amniotic sac membranes ([[chorioamnionitis]])&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

=== Weak membranes ===
Fetal membranes likely break because they become weak and fragile. This weakening is a normal process that typically happens at term as the body prepares for labor and delivery. However, this can be a problem when it occurs before 37 weeks (preterm). The natural weakening of fetal membranes is thought to be due to one or a combination of the following. In PROM, these processes are activated too early:
* [[apoptosis|Cell death]]: when cells undergo programmed cell death, they release biochemical markers that are detected in higher concentrations in cases of PPROM.
* Poor assembly of [[collagen]]: collagen is a molecule that gives fetal membranes, as well as other parts of the human body such as the skin, their strength. In cases of PPROM, proteins that bind and [[cross-link]] collagen to increase its [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] are altered.
* Breakdown of collagen: collagen is broken down by enzymes called [[matrix metalloproteinase|matrix metalloproteinases]] (MMPs), which are found at higher levels in PPROM amniotic fluid. This breakdown results in [[prostaglandin]] production which stimulates uterine contractions and [[cervical ripening]]. MMPs are inhibited by [[Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase|tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases]] (TIMPs) which are found at lower levels in PPROM amniotic fluid.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt;

=== Infection ===
Infection and [[inflammation]] likely explains why membranes break earlier than they are supposed to. In studies, [[bacteria]] have been found in the amniotic fluid from about one-third of cases of PROM. Often, testing of the amniotic fluid is normal, but a [[subclinical infection]] (too small to detect) or infection of maternal tissues adjacent to the amniotic fluid, may still be a contributing factor. In response to infection, the resultant infection and release of chemicals ([[cytokine]]s) subsequently weakens the fetal membranes and put them at risk for rupture.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; PROM is also a risk factor in the development of [[neonatal infection|neonatal infections]].

=== Genetics ===
Many [[Gene|genes]] play a role in inflammation and collagen production, therefore inherited genes may play a role in predisposing a person to PROM.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
To confirm if a woman has experienced prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), a health care clinician must prove that the fluid leaking from the vagina is amniotic fluid, and that labor has not yet started. To do this, a careful [[medical history]] is taken, a [[Gynaecology#Examination|gynecological exam]] is conducted using a sterile [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]], and an [[ultrasound]] of the uterus is performed.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; 
* History: a person with PROM typically recalls a sudden "gush" of fluid loss from the vagina, or steady loss of small amounts of fluid.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;
* Sterile speculum exam: a clinician will insert a sterile speculum into the vagina in order to see inside and perform the following evaluations. Digital cervical exams, in which gloved fingers are inserted into the vagina to measure the cervix, are avoided until the women is in active labor to reduce the risk of infection.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch17/&gt;  
**Pooling test: Pooling is when a collection of amniotic fluid can be seen in the back of the vagina ([[vaginal fornix]]). Sometimes leakage of fluid from the cervical opening can be seen when the person coughs or performs a [[valsalva maneuver]].&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;
** [[Nitrazine]] test: A sterile cotton swab is used to collect fluid from the vagina and place it on nitrazine (phenaphthazine) paper. Amniotic fluid is mildly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] ([[pH]] 7.1–7.3) compared to normal vaginal secretions which are [[Acid|acidic]] (pH 4.5–6).&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; Basic fluid, like amniotic fluid, will turn the nitrazine paper from orange to dark blue.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;
** [[Fern test]]: A sterile cotton swab is used to collect fluid from the vagina and place it on a [[microscope slide]]. After drying, amniotic fluid will form a [[crystallization]] pattern called arborization&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; which resembles leaves of a [[fern]] plant when viewed under a microscope.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt;
** [[Fibronectin binding protein A|Fibronectin]] and [[alpha-fetoprotein]] [[Blood test|blood tests]]

=== Classification ===
* Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM): when the [[fetal membranes]] rupture early, at least one hour before labor has started.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22&gt;{{Cite book|title = Obstetrics and Gynecology, 6e|last = Beckmann|first = Charles|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0781788076|location = Baltimore, MD|pages =Chapter 22: Premature Rupture of Membranes, pg 213–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prolonged PROM: a case of prelabor rupture of membranes in which more than 18 hours has passed between the rupture and the onset of labor.&lt;ref name=WilliamsObstetrics&gt;{{Cite book|title = Williams Obstetrics|last = Spong|first = Catherine|publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical|year = 2018|isbn = 978-1259644337|location = New York|pages =Chapter 22: Normal Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM): prelabor rupture of membranes that occurs before 37 weeks gestation.
*Midtrimester PPROM or pre-viable PPROM: prelabor rupture of membranes that occurs before 24 weeks' gestation. Before this age, the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's womb.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch17&gt;{{Cite book|title = Obstetrics and Gynecology, 7e|last = Beckmann|first = Charles|publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1451144314|location = Philadelphia|pages =Chapter 17: Premature Rupture of Membranes, pg 169–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Additional tests ===
The following tests should only be used if the diagnosis is still unclear after the standard tests above. 
* Ultrasound: Ultrasound can measure the amount of fluid still in the uterus surrounding the fetus. If the [[Oligohydramnios|fluid levels are low]], PROM is more likely.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; This is helpful in cases when the diagnosis is not certain, but is not, by itself, definitive.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; 
* Immune-chromatological tests are helpful, if negative, to rule out PROM, but are not that helpful if positive since the [[Sensitivity and specificity|false-positive rate]] is relatively high (19–30%).&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;
*[[Indigo carmine]] dye test: a needle is used to inject indigo carmine dye (blue) into the amniotic fluid that remains in the uterus through the abdominal wall. In the case of PROM, blue dye can be seen on a stained tampon or pad after about 15–30 minutes.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; This method can be used to definitively make a diagnosis, but is rarely done because it is invasive and increases risk of infection. But, can be helpful if the diagnosis is still unclear after the above evaluations have been done.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;

It is unclear if different methods of assessing the fetus in a woman with PPROM affects outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharp|first1=GC|last2=Stock|first2=SJ|last3=Norman|first3=JE|title=Fetal assessment methods for improving neonatal and maternal outcomes in preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 3, 2014|volume=10|pages=CD010209|pmid=25279580|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010209.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False positives ===

Like amniotic fluid, [[blood]], [[semen]], [[vaginal secretions]] in the presence of infection,&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; soap,&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; [[urine]], and [[Cervix|cervical mucus]]&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; also have an alkaline pH and can also turn nitrazine paper blue.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; Cervical mucus can also make a pattern similar to ferning on a microscope slide, but it is usually patchy&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; and with less branching.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis  ===
Other conditions that may present similarly to premature rupture of membranes are the following:&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt;
* [[Urinary incontinence]]: leakage of small amounts of urine is common in the last part of pregnancy
* Normal vaginal secretions of pregnancy
* Increased sweat or moisture around the perineum 
* Increased cervical discharge: this can happen when there is a genital tract infection  
* Semen
* [[douche|Douching]]
* [[Vesicovaginal fistula]]: an abnormal connection between the bladder and the vagina 
* Loss of the [[Cervical mucus plug|mucus plug]]

== Prevention ==
Women who have had prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) are more likely to experience it in future pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; There is not enough data to recommend a way to specifically prevent future PROM. However, any woman that has had a history of preterm delivery, because of PROM or not, is recommended to take [[progesterone|progesterone supplementation]] to prevent recurrence.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;

The management of PROM remains controversial, and depends largely on the gestational age of the fetus and other complicating factors. The risks of quick delivery (induction of labor) vs. watchful waiting in each case is carefully considered before deciding on a course of action.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

As of 2012, the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] advised, based on expert opinion and not clinical evidence, that attempted delivery during maternal instability increases the rates of both fetal death and [[maternal death]], unless the source of instability is an intrauterine infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=No. 64a: Bacterial Sepsis in Pregnancy|journal=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Green–top Guideline|date=April 2012|url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg_64a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all women with PROM, the age of the fetus, its [[Fetal position|position in the uterus]], and its well being should be evaluated. This can be done with ultrasound, [[Doppler fetal monitor|Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring]], and [[Cardiotocography|uterine activity monitoring]]. This will also show whether or not [[uterine contractions]] are happening which may be a sign that labor is starting. Signs and symptoms of infection should be closely monitored, and, if not already done, a [[group B streptococcus]] (GBS) culture should be collected.

At any age, if the fetal well-being appears to be compromised, or if intrauterine infection is suspected, the baby should be delivered quickly by induction of labour.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch17/&gt;

=== Term ===
Both expectant management (watchful waiting) and an induction of labor (artificially stimulating labor) are considered in this case. 90% of women start labor on their own within 24 hours, and therefore it is reasonable to wait for 12–24 hours as long as there is no risk of infection.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch17/&gt;  However, if labor does not begin soon after the PROM, an induction of labor is recommended because it reduces rates of infections, decreases the chances that the baby will require a stay in the [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU), and does not increase the rate of [[Caesarean section|caesarean sections]].&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; If a woman strongly does not want to be induced, watchful waiting is an acceptable option as long as there is no sign of infection, the [[Fetal distress|fetus is not in distress]], and she is aware and accepts the risks of PPROM.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; There is not enough data to show that the use of prophylactic antibiotics (to prevent infection) is beneficial for mothers or babies at or near term because of the potential side effects and development of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wojcieszek|first1=AM|last2=Stock|first2=OM|last3=Flenady|first3=V|title=Antibiotics for prelabour rupture of membranes at or near term.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 October 2014|volume=10|pages=CD001807|pmid=25352443|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001807.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 34 to 37 weeks  ===
When the fetus is premature (less than 37 weeks gestation), the risk of being born prematurely must be weighed against the risk of PROM. As long as the fetus is 34 weeks or greater, delivery is recommended as if the baby was term.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeckmannText2014ch22" /&gt;

=== 24 to 34 weeks  ===
Before 34 weeks, the fetus is at a much higher risk of the complications of prematurity. Therefore, as long as the fetus is doing well, and there are no signs of infection or [[placental abruption]], watchful waiting (expectant management) is recommended.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; The younger the fetus, the longer it takes for labor to start on its own,&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; but most women will deliver within a week.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; Waiting usually requires a woman to stay in the hospital so that health care providers can watch her carefully for infection, placental abruption, umbilical cord compression, or any other fetal emergency that would require quick delivery by induction of labor.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

In 2017, a review of watchful waiting vs the early birth strategy was conducted to ascertain which was associated with a lower overall risk. Focusing on the 24–37-week range, the review analysed twelve [[Randomized controlled trial|randomised controlled trials]] from the "[[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register", concluding that "In women with PPROM before 37 weeks' gestation with no [[contraindication]]s to continuing the pregnancy, a policy of expectant management with careful monitoring was associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=DM|last2=Middleton|first2=P|last3=Levett|first3=KM|last4=van der Ham|first4=DP|last5=Crowther|first5=CA|last6=Buchanan|first6=SL|last7=Morris|first7=J|title=Planned early birth versus expectant management for women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes prior to 37 weeks' gestation for improving pregnancy outcome.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=3 March 2017|volume=3|pages=CD004735|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004735.pub4|pmid=28257562}} {{cite web|title=Lay summary|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD004735/PREG_it-better-baby-be-born-immediately-or-wait-labour-start-if-waters-break-without-contractions-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is believed to be a correlation between volume of amniotic fluid retained and neonatal outcomes before 26 weeks' gestation.&lt;ref name="WilliamsText2014" /&gt; Amniotic fluid levels are an important consideration when debating expectant management vs clinical intervention, as low levels, or oligohydramnios, can result in lung and limb abnormalities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsText2014" /&gt; Additionally, labor and infection are less likely to occur when there are sufficient levels of amniotic fluid remaining in the uterus.&lt;ref name="BeckmannText2014ch22" /&gt; Serial [[amnioinfusion]] in pregnancies with PPROM-related oligohydramnios at less than 26 weeks gestation, successfully alleviates [[oligohydramnios]], with perinatal outcomes that are significantly better than the outcome in those with the persistent condition and is comparable with gestations with PPROM in which oligohydramnios never develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vergani |first1=P |last2=Locatelli |first2=A |last3=Verderio |first3=M |last4=Assi |first4=F |title=Premature rupture of the membranes at &amp;lt;26 weeks' gestation: role of amnioinfusion in the management of oligohydramnios. |journal=Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis |date=2004 |volume=75 Suppl 1 |pages=62-6 |pmid=15301294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recommended ====
* '''Monitoring for infection:''' signs of infection include a [[fever]] in the mother, fetal [[tachycardia]] (fast heart rate of the fetus, more than160 beats per minute), or tachycardia in the mother (more than 100 beats per minute). [[Complete blood count|White blood cell]] (WBC) counts are not helpful in this case because WBC's are normally high in late pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;
* '''[[Antenatal steroid|Steroids before birth]]:''' corticosteroids ([[betamethasone]]) given to the mother of a baby at risk of being born prematurely can speed up fetal lung development and reduce the risk of death of the infant, [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain bleeds]], and [[Necrotizing enterocolitis|bowel death]].&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; It is recommended that mothers receive one course of corticosteroids between 24 and 34 weeks when there is a risk of preterm delivery. In cases of PPROM these medications do not increase the risk of infection even though steroids are known to suppress the immune system. More than two courses is not recommended because three or more can lead to small birth weight and small head circumference.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; In pregnancies between 32 and 34 weeks (right around the time that fetal lungs mature) vaginal fluid can be tested to determine fetal lung maturity using chemical markers which can help to decide if corticosteroids should be given.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;
* '''Magnesium sulfate''': Intravenous magnesium sulfate is given to the mother in cases when there is a risk of preterm birth before 32 weeks. This has been shown to protect the fetal brain and reduce the risk of [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;
* '''Latency antibiotics''': The time from PROM to labor is termed the latency period, and there is an inverse relationship between gestational age and the length of latency, meaning that the earlier the rupture, the longer it will take for labor to begin naturally.&lt;ref name="BeckmannText2014ch22" /&gt; As expected, antibiotics given to mothers that experience PPROM serve to protect against infections during this lengthened latency period. Additionally, antibiotics increase the time that babies stay in the womb. Antibiotics don't seem to prevent death or make a difference in the long-term (years after the baby is born). But, because of the short-term benefits, routine use of antibiotics in PPROM is still recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=S|last2=Boulvain|first2=M|last3=Neilson|first3=JP|title=Antibiotics for preterm rupture of membranes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2 December 2013|volume=12|pages=CD001058|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001058.pub3|pmid=24297389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) recommends a seven-day course of intravenous [[ampicillin]] and [[erythromycin]] followed by oral [[amoxicillin]] and erythromycin if watchful waiting is attempted before 34 weeks.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; [[Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid]] increases the risk of fetal bowel death ([[necrotizing enterocolitis]]) and should be avoided in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;
* '''Prophylactic antibiotics:''' If a woman is colonized with GBS, than the typical use of antibiotics during labor is recommended to prevent transmission of this bacteria to the fetus, regardless of earlier treatments.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

==== Controversial or not recommended ====
* '''Preventative tocolysis (medications to prevent contractions)''': the use of tocolytic medications to prevent labor contractions is controversial. On the one hand, this can delay delivery and allow the fetus more time to develop and benefit from antenatal corticosteroid medication, on the other hand it increases the risk of infection or chorioamnionitis. The use of tocolysis has not shown to benefit mom or baby and currently there is not enough data to recommend or discourage its use in the case of preterm PROM.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014toco/&gt;
* '''Therapeutic tocolysis (medications to stop contractions):''' Once labor has started, using tocolysis to stop labor has not been shown to help, and is not recommended.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;
* '''[[Amnioinfusion]]''': This treatment attempts to replace the lost amniotic fluid from the uterus by infusing normal saline fluid into the uterine cavity. This can be done through the vagina and cervix (transcervical amnioinfusion) or by passing a needle through the abdominal wall (transabdominal amnioinfusion). Current data suggests that this treatment prevents infection, lung problems, and fetal death. However, there have not been enough trials to recommend its routine use in all cases of PPROM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Eke|first2=AC|last3=Lawrie|first3=TA|title=Amnioinfusion for third trimester preterm premature rupture of membranes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=30 March 2014|volume=3|pages=CD000942|pmid=24683009|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000942.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Home care''': Typically women with PPROM are managed in the hospital, but, occasionally they opt to go home if watchful waiting is attempted. Since labor usually starts soon after PPROM, and infection, umbilical cord compression, and other fetal emergencies can happen very suddenly, it is recommended that women stay in the hospital in cases of PPROM after 24 weeks.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; Currently, there is not enough evidence to determine meaningful differences in safety, cost, and women's views between management at home vs. the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abou El Senoun|first1=G|last2=Dowswell|first2=T|last3=Mousa|first3=HA|title=Planned home versus hospital care for preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) prior to 37 weeks' gestation.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=14 April 2014|volume=4|pages=CD008053|pmid=24729384|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008053.pub3|pmc=4170988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sealing membranes after rupture''':  Infection is the major risk associated with PROM and PPROM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Practice Bulletin No. 172|url=http://Insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006250-201610000-00062|journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|language=ENGLISH|volume=128|issue=4|pages=e165–e177|doi=10.1097/aog.0000000000001712|issn=0029-7844}}&lt;/ref&gt; By closing the ruptured membranes, it is hoped that there would be a decrease in infection, as well as encouraging the re-accumulation of amniotic fluid in the uterus to protect the fetus and allow for further lung development. Common techniques include placing a sponge over the ruptured membrane and the use of oral autoimmune stimulating drugs to encourage the body’s immune system to repair the rupture. There is currently insufficient research to determine whether these or other resealing techniques improve maternal or neonatal outcomes when compared to the current standard of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowley AE, Grivell RM, Dodd JM|first=|date=7 July 2016|title=Sealing procedures for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|pages=|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010218.pub2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before 24 weeks ===
Before 24 weeks, a fetus is not viable meaning it cannot live outside the mother. In this case, either watchful waiting at home or an induction of labor done.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

Because the risk of infection is so high, the mother should check her temperature often and return to the hospital if she develops any signs or symptoms of infection, labor, or vaginal bleeding. These women are typically admitted to the hospital once their fetus reaches 24 weeks and then managed the same as women with PPROM before 34 weeks (discussed above). When possible, these deliveries should take place in a hospital that has expertise in the management of the potential maternal and neonatal complications, and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the care of these patients (ie. neonatal intensive care unit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=October 2017|title=Obstetric Care Consensus No. 6 Summary: Periviable Birth|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=130|issue=4|pages=926–928|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000002347|issn=1873-233X|pmid=28937567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antenatal corticosteroids, latency antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, and tocolytic medications are not recommended until the fetus reaches viability (24 weeks).&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; In cases of pre-viable PPROM, chance of survival of the fetus is between 15–50%, and the risk of chorioamnionitis is about 30%.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;

=== Chorioamnionitis ===
[[Chorioamnionitis]] is a bacterial infection of the fetal membranes, which can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Women with PROM at any age are at high risk of infection because the membranes are open and allow bacteria to enter. Women are checked often (usually every 4 hours) for signs of infection: fever (more than 38&amp;nbsp;°C or 100.5&amp;nbsp;°F), uterine pain, maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, or foul-smelling amniotic fluid.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; Elevated white blood cells are not a good way to predict infection because they are normally high in labor.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; If infection is suspected, artificial induction of labor is started at any gestational age and broad antibiotics are given. Caesarean section should not be automatically done in cases of infection, and should only be reserved for the usual fetal emergencies.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;

== Outcomes ==
The consequences of PROM depend on the gestational age of the fetus.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; When PROM occurs at term (after 36 weeks), it is typically followed soon thereafter by the start of labor and delivery. About half of women will give birth within 5 hours, and 95% will give birth within 28 hours without any intervention.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; The younger the baby, the longer the latency period (time between membrane rupture and start of labor). Rarely, in cases of preterm PROM, amniotic fluid will stop leaking and the amniotic fluid volume will return to normal.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

If PROM occurs before 37 weeks, it is called preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), and the baby and mother are at greater risk of complications. PPROM causes one-third of all [[Preterm birth|preterm births]].&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014toco&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackeen|first1=AD|last2=Seibel-Seamon|first2=J|last3=Muhammad|first3=J|last4=Baxter|first4=JK|last5=Berghella|first5=V|title=Tocolytics for preterm premature rupture of membranes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=27 February 2014|volume=2|pages=CD007062|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007062.pub3|pmid=24578236}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROM provides a path for [[Pathogen|disease-causing organisms]] to enter the womb and puts both the mother and baby at risk for [[infection]]. Low levels of fluid around the baby also increase the risk of [[umbilical cord compression]] and can interfere with lung and body formation of the baby in early pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014toco/&gt;

===Infection (any age)===

At any gestational age, an opening in the fetal membranes provides a route for bacteria to enter the womb. This can lead to [[chorioamnionitis]] (an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid) which can be life-threatening to both the mother and fetus.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; The risk of infection increases the longer the membranes remain open and baby undelivered.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; Women with preterm PROM will develop an intra-amniotic infection 15–25% of the time, and the chances of infection increase at earlier gestational ages.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

===Pre-term birth (before 37 weeks)===

PROM occurring before 37 weeks (PPROM) is one of the leading causes of preterm birth. Thirty to 35% of all preterm births are caused by PPROM.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; This puts the fetus at risk for the many complications associated with prematurity such as respiratory distress, brain bleeds, infection, [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (death of the fetal bowels), brain injury, muscle dysfunction, and death.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt; Prematurity from any cause leads to 75% of perinatal mortality and about 50% of all long-term morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tocolysis for preterm labor: expert opinion|last = Hösli|first = Irene|date = 2014|journal = Arch Gynecol Obstet|doi = 10.1007/s00404-013-3137-9|pmid = 24385286|volume=289|pages=903–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROM is responsible for 20% of all fetal deaths between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation.&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt;

===Fetal development (before 24 weeks)===

Before 24 weeks the fetus is still developing its organs, and the amniotic fluid is important for protecting the fetus against infection, physical impact, and for preventing the umbilical cord from becoming compressed. It also allows for fetal movement and breathing that is necessary for the development of the lungs, chest, and bones.&lt;ref name=BeckmannText2014ch22/&gt;  Low levels of amniotic fluid due to mid-trimester or previable PPROM (before 24 weeks) can result in fetal deformity (e.g. [[potter sequence|Potter-like facies]]), limb [[contracture]]s, [[pulmonary hypoplasia]] (underdeveloped lungs),&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; infection (especially if the mother is colonized by group B streptococcus or bacterial vaginosis), prolapsed umbilical cord or compression, and placental abruption.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;

=== PROM after second-trimester amniocentesis ===
Most cases of PROM occur spontaneously, but the risk of PROM in women undergoing a second trimester amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders is 1%. Although, no studies are known to account for all cases of PROM that stem from amniocentesis. This case, the chances of the membranes healing on their own and the amniotic fluid returning to normal levels is much higher than spontaneous PROM. Compared to spontaneous PROM, about 70% of women will have normal amniotic fluid levels within one month, and about 90% of babies will survive.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Of term pregnancies (more than 37 weeks) about 8% are complicated by PROM,&lt;ref name=WilliamsText2014/&gt; 20% of these become prolonged PROM.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt; About 30% of all preterm deliveries (before 37 weeks) are complicated by PPROM, and rupture of membranes before viability (before 24 weeks) occurs in less than 1% of all pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Bulletin2013/&gt; Since there are significantly fewer preterm deliveries than term deliveries, the number of PPROM cases make up only about 5% of all cases of PROM.&lt;ref name=DeCherneyText2013/&gt;

'''[[Championship (dog)|Ch.]] Rancho Dobe's Storm''' (12 December, 1949 – October, 1960) also known as '''Storm''' or '''Stormie''', a [[Doberman Pinscher]], best known for being [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show|Best in Show]] at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in both 1952 and 1953. He was the grandson of the 1939 champion, [[Ferry v. Rauhfelsen of Giralda]]. Born in California, he was sold to his New York based owner Len Carey at the age of three months. At the age of sixteen months he won [[Best of Breed]] at his first adult dog show, something he would repeat in all 25 of the shows he was entered into, becoming undefeated in breed competition.

He became a [[popular sire effect|popular sire]], having sired over 300 puppies. [[Royal Doulton]] released a ceramic figurine of him, and the [[American Kennel Club]] inducted him in 1993 as one of only three [[conformation show]] dogs in the Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Dog in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

==Early life==
Storm was born on 12 December, 1949, at the Ranch Dobe kennels in [[Van Nuys]], California. He was one of thirteen puppies whelped by his mother, Champion Maedel von Randahof, who died shortly after giving birth.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Robert|title=Dog of Distinction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22Rancho+Dobe's+Storm%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GaoET9WGC4Wo8QOV6eX8Dg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rancho%20Dobe's%20Storm%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Life|pages=107–115|date=9 February 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Storm, only three other puppies survived, Zephyr, Breeze and Gale – all females. The puppies great-grandsire was the 1939 [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show|Best in Show]] winner, [[Ferry v. Rauhfelsen of Giralda]]. At the age of three months he was sold by his original owners, Mr and Mrs Brint Edwards to Len Carey, an advertising executive for [[Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn]] in New York. Carey had a standing order with the Edwards for the next male Doberman with [[conformation show]] potential.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt;

Once in New York, Storm lived with Carey and his family in a 12th-floor apartment in [[Manhattan]]. Initially the dog had some difficulties with house training and using the elevators, but a strike by elevator workers in New York changed that. "Twelve floors down and twelve floors up, four times a day. It housebroke the dog and made a man of my son Jeff." recalled Carey later in an interview for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; At the age of four months while being walked in [[Central Park]] he slipped off his lead while being walked by Mrs Carey, and was seized by a police officer. Charged with permitting an animal to run at large, his owners were fined $1. The normal range of fines for such a charge were between $5 and $25.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; On another occasion, Storm was left sitting in a parked car with the window open slightly. Mrs Carey returned to the car to find a drunken man had shoved his fist through the gap in the window and was waving his hand around Storm's nose. The dog did not bite, and the entire drive home simply laid down and trembled.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt;

The family moved out of the city in 1951 to [[Cos Cob, Connecticut]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} from New York. Storm shared the bed of Jeff Carey, Len's son, and ate [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[Biscuit (bread)|biscuits]] and canned [[beef]] for his meals.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt;

==Show history==
Storm was entered into his first adult show at the age of sixteen months at the Yonkers Kennel Club. He was named [[Best of Breed]] for Dobermans, although was defeated in the [[Working Group (dogs)|Group round]] by a [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]] who went on to become [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show|Best in Show]].&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; He had only been trained for ten hours in conformation show handling and maneuvers.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt;

More titles followed, during the course of his career he was entered in 25 dog shows and won Best of Breed in all of them.&lt;ref name=nyt1996&gt;{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Walter R.|title=Backtalk;All Those Dogs, All Those Tales|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/sports/backtalk-all-those-dogs-all-those-tales.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he won his Group round on 22 occasions and was named Best in Show seventeen times.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1996/&gt; Storm was never entered into competition at the Westchester Kennel Club Shows as his owner was a club official.&lt;ref name=westchester&gt;{{cite news|title=Height Of The Dog Days|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133852/index.htm|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=21 September 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Len Carey claims that Storm knew how he had performed by the photographers after the event, "He knows what a flashbulb is. He's a real ham."&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; Although when a paper crown was placed on his head by a photographer, he knocked it to the floor, chewed on it and then buried it.&lt;ref name=life1952/&gt; At the Wilmington Kennel Club Dog Show on 28 April, 1951, he was named Best in Show, beating [[English Setter]] Ch. Sir Herbert Kennelworth into second place in front of a crowd of 2,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dog Show|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2290&amp;dat=19510506&amp;id=q_kmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VQIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3238,929035|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Sunday Star|page=27|date=6 May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His thirteenth show was the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1952, held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.&lt;ref name=nyt1996/&gt; It was thirteen years since the only previous Doberman had won the title of [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show|Best in Show]] at the event, and the unlucky number was compounded as Stormie was registered in the show catalogue as #13.&lt;ref name=nyt1996/&gt; During the Best in Show round, Storm stood dead still for thirteen minutes while judge Joseph P. Sims reviewed the other competitors, a [[Dachshund]], a [[Poodle]], a [[Brussels Griffon]], a [[Welsh Terrier]] and an English Setter. Sims said of Storm, "The dog is a great showman and never lets up. I couldn't get away from him."&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; Peter Knopp was Storm's handler during the event, it was the thirteenth occasion he had led a dog to Best in Show.&lt;ref name=nyt1996/&gt;

Storm was entered in the 1953 Westminster Kennel Club in order to attempt to retain the title. Only five dogs had previously retained the title over the course of the previous 76 years.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; He won the Best of Breed title once more, beating 65 other Dobermans in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports in Brief|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SlMmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nf8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4061,3350144&amp;dq=westminster+kennel+club+1953&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Gettysburg Times|page=3|date=10 February 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win the Best in Show title for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German Short-Haired Pointer Best in Westminster Show|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OTtRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cDMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4320,2093933&amp;dq=westminster+kennel+club+1953&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|page=35|date=12 February 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Storm became a [[popular sire effect|popular sire]], having sired over 300 puppies by the time he competed at Westminster in 1954. Before his victory at the event in 1953, his stud fees were $100, which went up to $150 after the event.&lt;ref name=lifedistinction/&gt; The Careys kept one of Storm's puppies, officially named Stormson, but known about the house as "Mo".&lt;ref name=life1952&gt;{{cite news|last=McCombe|first=Leonard|title=Dogs and People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22Rancho+Dobe's+Storm%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GaoET9WGC4Wo8QOV6eX8Dg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rancho%20Dobe's%20Storm%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Life|pages=106–110|date=25 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, one of Storm's sons, named Storm's Donner, won Best in Show at the Westchester Kennel Club Dog Show, an event that Storm himself was never entered into.&lt;ref name=westchester /&gt; Donner was [[Inbreeding|line bred]] to Storm, meaning that Storm was both the dog's father and grandfather.&lt;ref name=westchester /&gt;

His owner, Len Carey, would return to the Westminster show in 1964 and 1974, but this time as the Best in Show judge. He chose the [[Whippet]] Ch. [[Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth]] and the [[German Shorthaired Pointer]] Ch. [[Gretchenhof Columbia River]] for the titles, respectively.&lt;ref name=nyt1996 /&gt; As of 2011, Storm remains in a group of only eight dogs who have won the Westminster show on more than one occasion, and the only Doberman to have done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best in Show Winners|url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/history/biswinners.html|publisher=Westminster Kennel Club|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Doulton]] released a ceramic figurine of Storm between 1955 and 1985. By 2011, these figures were worth $165.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownell|first=Dan|title=Antique Trader Antiques And Collectibles Price Guide 2011|year=2011|publisher=Krause|location=Iola, WI|isbn=978-1-4402-1233-8|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mZbsj8m0isC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22Rancho+Dobe's+Storm%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GaoET9WGC4Wo8QOV6eX8Dg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rancho%20Dobe's%20Storm%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm is one of only fourteen dogs inducted into the [[American Kennel Club]]'s Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Dog in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], having been inducted in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23678">'''Remarriage''' is a [[marriage]] that takes place after a previous marital union has ended, as through [[divorce]] or [[widow]]hood.
Some individuals are more likely to remarry than others; the likelihood can differ based on previous relationship status (e.g. divorced vs. widowed), level of interest in establishing a new romantic relationship, gender, race, and age among other factors. Those who choose not to remarry may prefer alternative arrangements like [[cohabitation]] or [[living apart together]].
Remarriage also provides [[mental health|mental]] and [[health|physical health]] benefits. However, although remarried individuals tend to have better health than individuals who do not repartner, they still generally have worse health than individuals who have remained continuously married.

==Remarriage following divorce or separation==
As of 1995, depending on individual and contextual factors, up to 50% of couples in the USA ended their first marriage in divorce or permanent [[legal separation|separation]] (i.e. the couple is not officially divorced but they no longer live together or share assets).&lt;ref name=Bramlett&gt;Bramlett, M. D., &amp; Mosher, W. D. (2002). Cohabitation, marriage, divorce, and remarriage in the United States. Vital and Health Statistics. Series 23, Data from the National Survey of Family Growth, (22), 1-93. {{PMID|12183886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couples typically end their marriage because they are unhappy during the partnership; however, while these couples give up hope for their partner, this does not mean they give up on the institution of marriage. The majority of people who have divorced (close to 80%) go on to marry again.&lt;ref&gt;Cherlin, A. J. (1992). Marriage, divorce, remarriage (rev. and enl. ed.). Social trends in the United States. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press. As cited in Bradbury, T. N., &amp; Karney, B. R. (2010). Intimate Relationships. W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, they remarry just under 4 years after divorcing; younger adults tend to remarry more quickly than older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, B. F., &amp; Clarke, S. C. (1992). Remarriages: A demographic profile. Journal of Family Issues, 13(2), 123 -141. {{doi|10.1177/019251392013002001}} {{PMID|12343618}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ķn, just over half remarry in less than 5 years, and by 10 years after a divorce 75% have remarried.&lt;ref name=Bramlett /&gt;

People may be eager to remarry because they do not see themselves as responsible for the previous marriage ending. Generally, they are more likely to believe their partner's behaviors caused the divorce, and minimize the influence of their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, P. R., &amp; Previti, D. (2003). People’s Reasons for Divorcing. Journal of Family Issues, 24(5), 602 -626. {{doi|10.1177/0192513X03254507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they remain optimistic that a new partnership will lead to better results.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, T. N., &amp; Karney, B. R. (2010). Intimate Relationships. W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data analyzed by USA Today in 2013, [http://www.mollybkenny.com/news/u-s--remarriage-rate-has-dropped-40-percent-in-20-years.cfm remarriage rates] in the United States have dropped by 40 percent over the last 20 years.

Numerous religions and sects forbid, or formerly forbade, remarriage after divorce. Some still do, although in many countries the percentage of the populace that adhere to them has been shrinking for more than half a century. Old-fashioned terms for second marriage that date to the earlier era of more widespread censure include ''[[wikt:deuterogamy|deuterogamy]]'' and ''[[wikt:digamy|digamy]]'', but the terms ''second marriage'' or ''remarriage'' are more readily understood.

===Factors influencing likelihood of remarriage===
Many factors influence the likelihood of remarrying after a divorce. Based on the 2006 census, men remarry more often than women.&lt;ref name=Census&gt;U.S. Census Bureau. (2006). American Community Survey: 2006 (No. S1201): Marital Status. As cited in Bradbury, T. N., &amp; Karney, B. R. (2010). Intimate Relationships. W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Remarriage rates also differ by ethnicity; remarriage is most common among White women, while Black women have the lowest probability of marrying again. Age is another determining factor; women who are older than 25 at the time of divorce are less likely to remarry than women who are younger at the time of marital dissolution. Having children is associated with higher rates of remarriage for men and women.&lt;ref name=Brown2006&gt;Brown, S. L., Lee, G. R., &amp; Bulanda, J. R. (2006). Cohabitation among older adults: A national portrait. The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 61(2), S71. {{PMID|16497963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarriage also differs by community setting. Women from urban areas or areas with a greater proportion of women who never married are less likely to marry again. Some environmental factors do not affect all ethnicities: only non-White women from communities with high unemployment and poverty have reduced likelihood of remarriage.&lt;ref name=Bramlett /&gt;

Some women enter cohabiting relationships after a divorce instead of remarrying. This pattern of cohabiting after a divorce is more likely for White than Black women, for women without religious affiliation, with few or no children, and who live in more economically stable communities.&lt;ref name=Bramlett /&gt;

===Outcomes of remarriage===
On the whole, remarriages are associated with greater socioeconomic security and life satisfaction compared to remaining divorced or separated.&lt;ref&gt;Forste, R., &amp; Heaton, T. B. (2004). The Divorce Generation. Journal of Divorce &amp; Remarriage, 41, 95-114. {{doi|10.1300/J087v41n01_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who remarry tend to have better adjustment to their divorce, reporting more positive evaluations of their lives compared to divorced individuals who remain single.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, H.-H., Wu, S.-Z., &amp; Liu, Y.-Y. (2003). Association Between Social Support and Health Outcomes: A Meta-analysis. The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences, 19(7), 345-350. {{doi|10.1016/s1607-551x(09)70436-x}} {{PMID|12926520}}&lt;/ref&gt; While divorced couples have a higher risk of developing a wide range of physical and mental health problems,&lt;ref name=Keicolt&gt;Kiecolt-Glaser, J. K., &amp; Newton, T. L. (2001). Marriage and health: his and hers. Psychological Bulletin, 127(4), 472-503. {{PMID|11439708}}&lt;/ref&gt; remarrying may attenuate, but not eliminate, some of these health risks.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, M. E., &amp; Waite, L. J. (2009). Marital Biography and Health at Mid-Life. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 50(3), 344 -358. {{doi|10.1177/002214650905000307}} {{PMID|19711810}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Second Marriages: Triumph of decision over hope?
It is often assumed that second marriages are riskier than first marriages - “The triumph of hope over experience” as popularised by Samuel Johnson in 1791. A new analysis of data commissioned from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) challenges this assumption. In fact, second marriages overall do consistently better than first marriages. Where one or both spouses are marrying for the second time, couples marrying today face an estimated 31% risk of divorce during their lifetime, compared to an estimated 45% risk of divorce amongst couples where both spouses are marrying for the first time.
However, second marriages do not always fare any better than the first.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, S. C., &amp; Wilson, B. F. (1994). The relative stability of remarriages: A cohort approach using vital statistics. ''[[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]]'', 43, 305-310.&lt;/ref&gt; Again the rates of divorce and separation vary based on demographic and social factors. Second marriage disruptions are more likely for Black women and for women in communities that are less economically well off.&lt;ref name=Bramlett/&gt; Conversely, rates of divorce decline as age at the time of second marriage increases.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Also, women who enter their second marriage with no children are generally more likely to sustain their marriages.&lt;ref name=Bramlett/&gt;

===Vulnerabilities to second marriages===
There are several reasons why second marriages can be more vulnerable to disruption. Partners bring the same personal qualities to their subsequent marriage as they had during the first, but some of these qualities may have contributed to the first marriage’s problems. People who have divorced and remarried multiple times tend to be relatively impulsive and nonconformist.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, G. H., Neubaum, E., &amp; Forehand, R. (1988). Serial marriage: A heuristic analysis of an emerging family form. Psychological Bulletin, 103, 211-222. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amato, P. R., &amp; Booth, A. (1991). The consequences of divorce for attitudes towards divorce and gender roles. Journal of Family Issues, 12, 306-322.&lt;/ref&gt; In second marriages, partners also often have to deal with additional complications that do not exist in first marriages, like combining families. Remarriages involving stepchildren have a greater rate of dissolution than those without.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., &amp; Edwards, J. N. (1992). Starting Over. Journal of Family Issues, 13(2), 179 -194. {{doi|10.1177/019251392013002004}} {{PMID|12343619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remarriage following widowhood==
[[File:It's all about love.jpg|thumb]]
As of the 2006 census, 32% of the U.S. population over age 65 was [[widow]]ed.&lt;ref name=Census/&gt; Most people successfully adjust after losing a partner; research on bereavement patterns finds the most frequent outcome is [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonanno, G. A., Wortman, C. B., Lehman, D. R., Tweed, R. G., Haring, M., Sonnega, J., Carr, D., et al. (2002). Resilience to loss and chronic grief: a prospective study from preloss to 18-months postloss. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(5), 1150–1164. {{PMID|12416919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, remarriage rates among older widowers are fairly low, and even lower among older widows. However, looking at rates of remarriage vastly underestimates interest in new romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;Carr, D. (2004). The desire to date and remarry among older widows and widowers. Journal of Marriage and Family, 66(4), 1051–1068.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences in desire to repartner===
Men and women not only have different remarriage rates, but they also differ in their desire to repartner (to establish a new romantic relationship). A year and a half after the death of a spouse, 15% of widows and 37% of widowers ages 65 and older were interested in dating.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt; Differences in desire to repartner may stem from the different benefits men and women receive in and outside of a marriage.

The most frequent reasons older adults give for remaining without a partner after losing a spouse are gender-specific. While the common myth is "women grieve, men replace," research does not support this pattern. Rather, widows are more likely to report that they are reluctant to give up newfound freedom and independence.&lt;ref name=Davidson2001&gt;Davidson, K. (2001). Late life widowhood, selfishness and new partnership choices: a gendered perspective. Ageing &amp; Society, 21. {{doi|10.1017/S0144686X01008169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many widows perceive a sense of liberation no longer having to take care of another person, and value this more than additional companionship.&lt;ref name=Davidson2002&gt;Davidson, K. (2002). Gender differences in new partnership choices and constraints for older widows and widowers. Ageing International, 27(4), 43–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Widowers, on the other hand, tend to report that they have not repartnered because they are concerned about being undesirable partners due to older age and ill health.&lt;ref name=Davidson2001/&gt;

Some studies have found that women who are not interested in a new relationship have explicitly decided to remain unpartnered. In contrast, men were more likely to report that they would not rule out the possibility but had not encountered a suitable relationship yet.&lt;ref name=Davidson2001/&gt; Interviews indicate that widowers are more prepared than widows to take a chance on a new relationship.&lt;ref name=Davidson2002/&gt;

Among widows, social support appears to promote interest in new intimate partnerships. Widows with confidants are more interested in repartnering than those without close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Talbott, M. M. (1998). Older widows’ attitudes towards men and remarriage. Journal of Aging Studies, 12(4), 429-449. {{doi|10.1016/S0890-4065(98)90028-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for men this pattern may be reversed. While overall widowers are more interested in remarriage than widows, only the men with low or average levels of support from friends are any more likely than women to report desire to remarry in the future. When widowers have high levels of social support from friends, they have equivalent levels of interest as widows. This suggests that men may be more motivated to repartner if they do not have as much social support as they would like. Women on the other hand tend to have more diverse sources of social support within their social networks.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt;

Although the gender differences in desire to repartner are most well documented,
younger age and greater unhappiness also predict increased interest in remarriage.&lt;ref name=Moorman&gt;Moorman, S. M., Booth, A., &amp; Fingerman, K. L. (2006). Women’s Romantic Relationships After Widowhood. Journal of Family Issues, 27(9), 1281–1304. {{doi|10.1177/0192513X06289096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Likelihood to repartner===
Men are more likely to repartner after losing their spouse; more than 60% of men but less than 20% of women are involved in a new romance or remarried within just over two years of being widowed.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, D., Sledge, P., Shuchter, S., &amp; Zisook, S. (1996). Dating and Remarriage over the First Two Years of Widowhood. Annals of Clinical Psychiatry, 8, 51-57. {{doi|10.3109/10401239609148802}} {{PMID|8807029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in repartnering is only one factor in determining the likelihood that a widow or widower will establish a new romantic relationship. Davidson (2002) describes a framework which proposes three primary intervening conditions affecting likelihood of repartnering following widowhood: availability of partners, the feasibility of a relationship, and desirability of companionship.&lt;ref name=Davidson2002/&gt;

There are frequent gender differences in availability, desirability, and feasibility of new relationships. Availability of partners is a greater constraint for older widows; there are far fewer partners available for older women than older men, given that women tend to live longer and men tend to prefer younger partners. As detailed in the [[#Differences in desire to repartner|previous section]], older widowers also typically have greater desire to repartner than widows.&lt;ref name=Davidson2002/&gt;

Studies have identified many other factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of successfully repartnering following widowhood. Most of these factors fit within Davidson’s framework. For widows, younger age is associated with greater probability of repartnering; younger women typically have more available potential partners. For widowers, new romance is predicted by greater income and education.&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt; In Davidson's model, feasibility of a relationship is affected by age, health, and financial resources; being younger, healthier, and having financial resources makes one a more attractive partner.&lt;ref name=Davidson2002/&gt;

===Outcomes of remarriage===
Widowed older adults show high increases in loneliness, but expanding their social network or repartnering can attenuate this loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;Dykstra, P. A., van Tilburg, T. G., &amp; Gierveld, J. de J. (2005). Changes in Older Adult Loneliness. Research on Aging, 27(6), 725 -747. {{doi|10.1177/0164027505279712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating and remarriage following widowhood appear to be both fairly common and highly adaptive responses.&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooney&gt;Cooney, T. M., &amp; Dunne, K. (2001). Intimate Relationships in Later Life: Current Realities, Future Prospects. Journal of Family Issues, 22, 838-858. {{doi|10.1177/019251301022007003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving spouses who remarry within about 1–5 years of being widowed have more positive outcomes (e.g. greater [[wellbeing]], greater [[life satisfaction]], and less [[Depression (mood)|depression]]) than widows and widowers who have not remarried.&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burks, V. K., Lund, D. A., Gregg, C. H., &amp; Bluhm, H. P. (1988). Bereavement and remarriage for older adults. Death Studies, 12, 51-60. {{doi|10.1080/07481188808252219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research has shown this reduced depression in repartnered compared to single widows and widowers is due to the remarried individuals’ greater socioeconomic resources.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt;  For example, compared to widows who do not remarry, remarried widows tend to report higher household incomes and are less likely to report anxiety about financial matters.&lt;ref name=Moorman/&gt;

==Alternatives to remarriage in later life==
Remarriage is not always the goal or ideal arrangement for divorced and widowed adults. Especially among older adults, there is a growing acceptance and interest in alternative romantic commitments like [[cohabitation]] or [[Living Apart Together]] (LAT). While for younger adults cohabitation is typically a precursor to marriage, older adults have additional reasons why they may not want to remarry and cohabiting may be the ideal partnership.&lt;ref name=Brown2006/&gt; For some, remarriage inspires feelings of disloyalty, and adult children can discourage remarriage based on concerns about inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Bulcroft, K., &amp; O’Connor, M. (1986). The importance of dating relationships on quality of life for older persons. Family relations, 397–401.&lt;/ref&gt; Many older women are interested in companionship but may want to avoid long-term obligations and are hesitant to give up their new independence.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karlsson&gt;Karlsson, S. G., &amp; Borell, K. (2002). Intimacy and autonomy, gender and ageing: Living apart together. Ageing International, 27, 11-26. {{doi|10.1007/s12126-002-1012-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an arrangement called Living Apart Together (LAT) offers an appealing alternative; it is a form of intimate ongoing companionship that allows each partner to maintain autonomy and independent households.&lt;ref name=Karlsson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Jong Gierveld, J., &amp; Peeters, A. (2003). The Interweaving of Repartnered Older Adults’ Lives with Their Children and Siblings. Ageing &amp; Society, 23(02), 187-205. {{doi|10.1017/S0144686X02001095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General physical and mental health benefits of remarriage==
Health is influenced both by current marital status and marital transition history. Marriage confers mental and physical health advantages, but remarried individuals who have been widowed or divorced continue to be disadvantaged compared to continuously married individuals.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

===Mental health benefits===
Marriage has been shown to impart significant mental health benefits&lt;ref name=Keicolt/&gt; and remarriage seems to be protective as well. Overall, people who remarry have lower levels of depressive symptoms compared to others who have lost a partner (through widowhood, divorce, or separation) and remain single. Remarriage seems to be especially beneficial for men, who have lower levels of depressive symptoms than remarried women.&lt;ref name=Brown2005&gt;{{MEDRS|date=December 2011}}Brown, S. L., Bulanda, J. R., &amp; Lee, G. R. (2005). The significance of nonmarital cohabitation: Marital status and mental health benefits among middle-aged and older adults. The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 60(1), S21–9 {{PMID|15643043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the health benefits of remarriage do not appear to be as strong as those for continuous marriage. Several studies have found that the mental and [[#Physical health benefits|physical health benefits of remarriage]] do not fully balance out the negative effects of a previous marital disruption. Compared to the strong advantage of being continuously married, the mental health benefits are progressively weaker the more previous marriages a person has had.&lt;ref&gt;{{MEDRS|date=December 2011}}Barrett, Anne E. 2000. Marital Trajectories and Mental Health. Journal of Health and Social Behavior 41:451–64. {{PMID|11198568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although men seem to benefit as much from remarriage as being continuously married, remarried women have weaker mental health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Carol S. |first1=Aneshensel |last2=Jo C. |first2=Phelan |last3=Alex |first3= Bierman|title=Handbook of the Sociology of Mental Health|isbn=978-94-007-4276-5|page=410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cmCtUtIjlQYC&amp;pg=PA410&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;dq=remarriage+weaker+mental+women&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zO9Dcgl1Zn&amp;sig=jSp_8Og2quefouEJPu2KG9ETlZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wqvfUeviHIiHrAeqh4CoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=remarriage%20weaker%20mental%20women&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MEDRS|date=December 2011}} Williams, Kristi. 2003. Has the Future of Marriage Arrived? A Contemporary Examination of Gender, Marriage, and Psychological Well-Being. Journal of Health and Social Behavior 44:470–87. {{PMID|15038144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental health differences between remarried women and unpartnered women appear to be due to differences in economic resources and social support. Findings also indicate that the mental health benefit of marriage for women is primarily driven by the fact that married women tend to be physically healthier than cohabiting and unpartnered women. There may be a selection effect whereby healthy women are more likely to remarry, and subsequently, based on their greater physical health, experience less depression. On the other hand, even when controlling for economic resources, social support, and health, married men experience fewer depressive symptoms compared to cohabiting or unpartnered men. This is likely because depression symptoms in married men are so low.&lt;ref name=Brown2005/&gt;

===Physical health benefits===
The physical health benefits of marriage are well documented,&lt;ref name=Keicolt/&gt; but marital disruptions have been shown to negatively affect health.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dupre, M. E., &amp; Meadows, S. O. (2007). Disaggregating the Effects of Marital Trajectories on Health. Journal of Family Issues, 28(5), 623 -652. {{doi|10.1177/0192513X06296296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarriage can attenuate but not completely eliminate the negative health effects of a marital disruption. Among currently married persons, those who have previously been divorced or widowed have worse health than those who have been continuously married. Research has not found any difference in physical health between persons with only one compared to multiple marital disruptions.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;  The lingering negative health effects of marital disruption include increased risk for chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes and heart disease) and mobility limitations (e.g. difficulty walking a block or climbing stairs). However, it is also important to consider that it is difficult to determine causality; it is possible that a person’s health determines their likelihood of marrying and experiencing a disruption. In fact, it is possible that there are effects in both directions.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

The '''Research Triangle''', commonly referred to as simply '''The Triangle''', is a region in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] of [[North Carolina]] in the United States, anchored by the three major research universities of [[North Carolina State University]], [[Duke University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], as well as the cities of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] and the town of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]]. The eight-county region, officially named the '''Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill''' [[combined statistical area]] (CSA), comprises the Raleigh and Durham–Chapel Hill metropolitan areas and the Dunn, Henderson, Oxford, and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Areas.

A 2017 Census estimate put the population at 2,156,253, making it the second largest metropolitan area in the state of North Carolina behind [[Charlotte metropolitan area|Charlotte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-metro-and-micro-statistical-areas.html|title=Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas Population Totals: 2010-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2018-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Raleigh-Durham television station history|Raleigh–Durham television market]] includes a broader 24-county area which includes [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], and has a population of 2,726,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Station Index, Viewers in Profile, Raleigh–Durham (Fayetteville), NC May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Triangle" name was cemented in the public consciousness in the 1950s with the creation of [[Research Triangle Park]], home to numerous high-tech companies and enterprises. Although the name is now used to refer to the geographic region, "the Triangle" originally referred to the universities, whose research facilities, and the educated workforce they provide, have historically served as a major attraction for businesses located in the region.

Most of the Triangle is part of North Carolina's [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district|second]], [[North Carolina's 4th congressional district|fourth]], and [[North Carolina's 13th congressional district|thirteenth]] congressional districts.

The region is sometimes confused with [[Piedmont Triad|The Triad]], which is a North Carolina region adjacent to and directly west of the Triangle comprising [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], and [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]], among other cities.

The Triangle region, as defined for statistical purposes as the '''Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill CSA''', comprises eight counties, although the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] divided the region into two metropolitan statistical areas and one micropolitan area in 2003. The Raleigh metropolitan area comprises Wake,Franklin, and Johnston Counties; the Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area comprises Durham, Orange, Chatham, and Person Counties; and the Dunn micropolitan area comprises Harnett County.

Some area television stations define the region as '''Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville'''. Fayetteville is more than {{convert|50|mi|km}} from Raleigh, but is part of the Triangle [[media market|television market]].

== Education ==
Public secondary education in the Triangle is similar to that of the majority of the state of North Carolina, in which there are county-wide school systems (the exception is [[Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools]] within Orange County but apart from Orange County Schools). Based in Cary, the [[Wake County Public School System]], which includes the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is the largest school system in the state of North Carolina and the 15th-largest in the United States, with average daily entollment of 159,949 as of the second month of the 2016-17 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wcpss.net/domain/100|title=District Facts / Overview|website=www.wcpss.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other larger systems in the region include Durham Public Schools (about 33,000 students) and rapidly growing Johnston County Schools (about 31,000 students).

== Sports ==

=== College sports ===

With the significant number of universities and colleges in the area and the relative absence of major league professional sports, [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sports are very popular, particularly those sports in which the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] participates, most notably basketball.

The [[Duke Blue Devils]] (representing [[Duke University]] in Durham), [[NC State Wolfpack]] (representing [[North Carolina State University]] in Raleigh), and [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] (representing the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]) are all members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]. Rivalries among these schools are very strong, fueled by proximity to each other, with annual competitions in every sport. Adding to the rivalries is the large number of graduates the high schools in the region send to each of the local universities. It is very common for students at one university to know many students attending the other local universities, which increases the opportunities for "bragging" among the schools. The four ACC schools in the state, Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and [[Wake Forest University]] (the last of which was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956), are referred to as [[Tobacco Road (rivalry)|Tobacco Road]] by sportscasters, particularly in basketball. All four teams consistently produce high-caliber teams. Each of the Triangle-based universities listed has won at least two NCAA Basketball national championships.

Three [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]], including recent Division I arrival [[North Carolina Central University]] and Division II members [[St. Augustine's College (North Carolina)|St. Augustine College]] and [[Shaw University]] also boost the popularity of college sports in the region.

Other colleges in the Triangle that field intercollegiate teams include [[Campbell University]], [[Meredith College]], and [[William Peace University]].

=== Professional sports ===
[[File:RBC Center Stanley Cup Championship.jpg|thumb|260px|2006 Stanley Cup ceremony at the RBC Center (now [[PNC Arena]])]]
The region has only one professional team of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major sports]], the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], based in Raleigh. Since moving to the Research Triangle region from [[Hartford, Connecticut]], they have enjoyed great success, including winning a [[Stanley Cup]]. With only one top-level professional sports option, minor league sports are quite popular in the region. The [[Durham Bulls]] in downtown Durham are a AAA Minor League baseball affiliate of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and the [[Carolina Mudcats]], based in Zebulon, 10 miles east of Raleigh, are the Advanced-A affiliate of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. In Cary, [[North Carolina FC]] plays in the second-level [[United Soccer League]], and the [[North Carolina Courage]] began play in the [[National Women's Soccer League]] in 2017 after the owner of North Carolina FC bought the NWSL franchise rights of the [[Western New York Flash]] and relocated the NWSL franchise to the Triangle.

The area also had a team in the fledgling [[World League of American Football]] – however, the [[Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks]], coached by [[Roman Gabriel]], did not exactly cover themselves in glory; they lost all 10 games of their inaugural (and only) season in 1991. The team folded after that, being replaced in the league by the [[Ohio Glory]], which fared little better at 1-9, ultimately suffering the same fate – along with the other six teams based in North America – when the league took a two-year hiatus, returning as a six-team all-European league in 1995.

=== Badminton ===
With over 1200 active participants in multiple recreation centers and university campuses throughout the area, Research Triangle is home to one of the largest badminton communities in the Southeastern United States. The American Badminton Academy is also located here in a dedicated facility with seven permanent courts. The Academy is unique among U.S. badminton facilities in that it hosts an international player development program run by Dennis Christensen, an Olympic-level coach from Denmark.

== Commerce ==
Anchored by leading technology firms, government and world-class universities, medical centers and schools, the area's economy has performed exceptionally well. Significant increases in employment, earnings, personal income, and retail sales are projected over the next 15 years.

The region's growing high-technology community includes such companies as [[IBM]], [[SAS Institute]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[NetApp]], [[Red Hat]], [[EMC Corporation]], and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]]. In addition to high-tech, the region is consistently ranked in the top three in the U.S. with concentration in life science companies. Some of these companies include [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Biogen Idec]], [[BASF]], [[Merck &amp; Co.]], [[Novo Nordisk]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Pfizer]]. Research Triangle Park and [[Centennial Campus|North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus]] in Raleigh support innovation through R&amp;D and technology transfer among the region's companies and research universities (including Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).

The area fared relatively well during the [[late-2000s recession]], ranked as the strongest region in North Carolina by the [[Brookings Institution]] and among the top 40 in the country.  The change in unemployment during 2008 to 2009 was 4.6% and home prices was 2%.  The [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] metropolitan area was listed among the second-weakest and the [[Charlotte]] area among the middle in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2009/06/15/daily31.html|title=Brookings report ranks Raleigh–Cary strongest metro in N.C.|last=Snipes|first=Cameron |date=June 17, 2009|publisher=Triangle Business Journal|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==

=== Freeways and primary designated routes ===
[[File:2008-07-25 I-85 from Davis Dr in RTP.jpg|thumb|180px|right|I-40]]
[[File:2008-07-23 Morning Durham from Fayetteville St over NC 147.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The Durham Freeway]]

The Triangle proper is served by three major [[interstate highway]]s: [[Interstate 40|I-40]], [[Interstate 85|I-85]], and [[Interstate 87 (North Carolina)|I-87]] along with their [[spur route|spurs]]: [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]] and [[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)|I-540]], and seven [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Routes]]: [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|1]], [[U.S. Route 15|15]], [[U.S. Route 64|64]], [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|70]], [[U.S. Route 264|264]], [[U.S. Route 401|401]],  and [[U.S. Route 501|501]]. US Highways 15 and 501 are multiplexed through much of the region as [[U.S. Route 15/501 in North Carolina|US 15-501]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] passes 30 miles east of Raleigh through Johnston County, with I-87 connecting I-95 at Rocky Mount, NC to Raleigh via the [[Knightdale Bypass|US 64-264 Bypass]].

The two interstates diverge from one another in Orange County, with I-85 heading northeast through northern Durham County toward [[Virginia]], while [[I-40]] travels southeast through southern Durham, through the center of the region, and serves as the primary freeway through Raleigh.  The related loop freeways I-440 and I-540 are primarily located in Wake County around Raleigh.  I-440 begins at the interchange of US 1 and I-40 southwest of downtown Raleigh and arcs as a multiplex with US 1 northward around downtown with the formal designation as the Cliff Benson/Raleigh Beltline (cosigned with US 1 on three-fourths of its northern route) and ends at its junction with I-40 in southeast Raleigh.  I-540, sometimes known as the Raleigh Outer Loop, extends from the [[Knightdale Bypass|US 64-264 Bypass]] to I-40 just inside Durham County, where it continues across the interstate as a [[state route]] (NC 540), prior to its becoming a [[toll road]] from the NC 54 interchange to the current terminus at NC Highway 55 near Holly Springs. I-95 serves the extreme eastern edge of the region, crossing north-south through suburban Johnston County.

U.S. Routes 1, 15, and 64 primarily serve the region as limited-access freeways or multilane highways with [[frontage road|access roads]]. US 1 enters the region from the southwest as the Claude E. Pope Memorial Highway and travels through suburban Apex where it merges with US 64 and continues northeast through Cary. The two highways are codesignated for about {{convert|2|mi|km}} until US 1 joins I-440 and US 64 with I-40 along the Raleigh–Cary border.  Capital Boulevard, which is designated US 1 for half of its route and US 401 the other is not a limited-access freeway, although it is a major thoroughfare through northeast Raleigh and into the northern downtown area.

[[North Carolina Highway 147]] is a limited-access freeway that connects I-85 with Toll Route NC 540 in northwestern Wake County. The older, toll-free portion of the four-lane route—known as the Durham Freeway or the I.L. "Buck" Dean Expressway—traverses downtown Durham and extends through Research Triangle Park to I-40. The Durham Freeway is often used as a detour or alternate route for I-40 through southwestern Durham the Chapel Hill area in cases of traffic accident, congestion or road construction delays. The tolled portion of NC 147, called the Triangle Expressway—North Carolina's first modern toll road when it opened to traffic in late 2011—continues past I-40 to Toll NC 540. Both Toll NC 147 and Toll NC 540 are modern facilities which collect tolls using transponders and license plate photo-capture technology.

=== Public transit ===
[[File:2008-07-05 TTA bus 713 at DATA terminal.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Triangle Transit bus]]
[[File:2008-07-11 Chapel Hill bus passing South Building.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Chapel Hill Transit bus]]

A partnering system of multiple public transportation agencies currently serves the Triangle region under the joint [[GoTransit (North Carolina)|GoTransit]] branding. Raleigh is served by the [[Capital Area Transit (Raleigh)|Capital Area Transit (CAT)]] municipal transit system, while Durham has the [[Durham Area Transit Authority]] (DATA) system.  Chapel Hill is served by [[Chapel Hill Transit]], and Cary is served by [[C-TRAN (North Carolina)|C-Tran]] public transit systems.  However, [[Triangle Transit]], formerly called the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA), works in cooperation with all area transit systems by offering transfers between its own routes and those of the other systems. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive [[vanpool]] and [[carpool|rideshare]] program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.

Plans have been made to merge all of the area's municipal systems into Triangle Transit, and Triangle Transit also has proposed a regional rail system to connect downtown Durham, downtown Cary and downtown Raleigh with multiple suburban stops, as well as stops in the Research Triangle Park area. The agency's initial proposal was effectively cancelled in 2006, however, when the agency could not procure adequate federal funding. A committee of local business, transportation and government leaders currently are working with Triangle Transit to develop a new transit blueprint for the region, with various modes of rail transit, as well as [[bus rapid transit]], open as options for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridetta.org/Regional_Rail/Overview/3-07LatestTransitNeeds.htm |title=Regional Transit Needs: Next Steps |accessdate=2007-07-04 |work=TTA Web Site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU) ====
{{Main|Raleigh–Durham International Airport}} {{airport codes|RDU|KRDU|RDU}}
[[File:2008-07-30 RDU welcome sign.jpg|thumb|180px|right|RDU welcome sign]]
[[File:RDU-27527.jpg|thumb|180px|right|American Airlines [[Boeing 777]] touches down at RDU]]
[[File:2008-07-30 Southwest Boeing 737 RDU 23R Final.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Southwest Airlines jet landing at RDU]]

The General Assembly of North Carolina chartered the Raleigh–Durham Aeronautical Authority in 1939, which was changed in 1945 to the Raleigh–Durham Airport Authority. The first new terminal opened in 1955. Terminal A (now Terminal 1) opened in 1981. [[American Airlines]] began service to RDU in 1985.

RDU opened the {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway, 5L-23R, in 1986. American Airlines opened its north-south hub operation at RDU in the new Terminal C in June 1987, greatly increasing the size of RDU's operations with a new terminal including a new apron and runway. American brought RDU its first international flights to [[Bermuda]], [[Cancun]], [[Paris, France|Paris]] and [[London]].

In 1996, American Airlines ceased its hub operations at RDU due to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Eastern Airlines]].  Pan Am and Eastern were [[Miami International Airport|Miami's]] main tenants until 1991, when both carriers went bankrupt. Their hubs at MIA were taken over by [[United Airlines]] and American Airlines. This created a difficulty in competing with [[US Airways]]' hub in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]' hub in Atlanta, Georgia for passengers traveling between smaller cities in the North and South. [[Midway Airlines (1993–2003)|Midway Airlines]] entered the market, starting service in 1995 with the then somewhat novel concept of 50-seat [[Canadair Regional Jet]]s providing service from its RDU hub primarily along the East Coast. Midway, originally incorporated in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], had some success after moving its operations to the midpoint of the eastern United States at RDU and its headquarters to Morrisville, NC. The carrier ultimately could not overcome three weighty challenges: the arrival of [[Southwest Airlines]], the refusal of American Airlines to renew the frequent flyer affiliation it had with Midway (thus dispatching numerous higher fare-paying businesspeople to airlines with better reward destinations), and the significant blow of September 11, 2001. Midway Airlines filed [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on August 13, 2001, and ceased operations entirely on October 30, 2003.

In February 2000, RDU was ranked as the nation's second fastest-growing major airport in the United States, by Airports Council International, based on 1999 statistics. Passenger growth hit 24% over the previous year, ranking RDU second only to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. RDU opened Terminal A south concourse for use by [[Northwest Airlines|Northwest]] and [[Continental Airlines]] in 2001. The addition added {{convert|46000|sqft|m2}} and five aircraft gates to the terminal. Terminal A became designated as Terminal 1 on October 26, 2008. In 2003, RDU also dedicated a new general aviation terminal. RDU continues to keep pace with its growth by redeveloping Terminal C into a new state-of-the-art terminal, now known as Terminal 2, which opened in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdu.com/airportdev/termc-updates.htm|title=Raleigh–Durham International Airport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Southwest Airlines]], the nation's largest [[low-cost carrier]], began service to RDU in 1999.

* [[JetBlue]] began nonstop service between RDU and [[New York, New York|New York]] and [[Boston]] in 2006, with additional service to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], which began in January 2008.

The '''SS ''James Carruthers''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Great Lakes]] [[cargo ship|freighter]] built in 1913. The ship was owned by the St. Lawrence &amp; Chicago Steam and Navigation Company of [[Toronto]], Ontario, with the official registry number 131090.

The ''Carruthers'' was lost 9 November 1913 on [[Lake Huron]] during the [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]]. The crew of 22 perished with the vessel.

== Construction ==
The ''James Carruthers'' was built at [[Collingwood, Ontario]] by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company, her hull number was 00038. She was a steel hulled, propeller driven lake freighter; 550 feet in length, 58 feet wide and 27 feet deep. The gross tonnage was 7862 and the net tonnage 5606.

== Final voyage ==
On the evening of November 6, 1913, the ''James Carruthers'' loaded a total of 375,000 bushels of wheat at [[Fort William, Ontario]]. Her destination was [[Midland, Ontario]], on the shores of [[Georgian Bay]]. Captain William H. Wright had conferred with another downbound skipper, S.A. Lyons of the [[SS J.H. Sheadle|''J.H. Sheadle'']], and planned to travel down [[Lake Superior]] together. Wright commented on his new boat, "We've still to learn all her tricks, and some of the lads in the [[fo'c'sle]] are complaining that the paint in their rooms is still a little sticky."

By 3 o'clock on the morning of Saturday, November 8, the first hints of the storm blew over Lake Superior. The winds quickly shifted from southwest to northwest, bringing with them freezing temperatures, snow squalls, and high waves. The ''Carruthers'' and the ''Sheadle'' were better than halfway to the [[Soo Locks|Soo]] when the storm hit. By the evening, both vessels were locking through and snaking their way down the [[St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario)|St. Mary's River]]. While going down the river the Canadian freighter passed the upbound ''Midland Prince''. Angus "Ray" McMillan, wheelsman of the ''Carruthers'', sighted his friend Jack Daley aboard the ''Prince'' and yelled out, "We're going to Midland this time, Jack! I'll tell your father we passed you!" At 12:53 on the morning of Sunday, November 9, the ''Carruthers'' was sighted taking on coal at the Picklands, Mather &amp; Company dock near [[De Tour, Michigan]]. Shortly after refueling, the ''James Carruthers'' entered [[Lake Huron]], with the ''J.H. Sheadle'' a short distance behind. The lights of the ''Carruthers'' were visible for a short time aboard the ''Sheadle'' as they sailed on a southeastern heading. A little after dawn, the ''Carruthers'' turned to port on a course that would keep her south of [[Duck Island (Lake Huron)|Great Duck Island]] and on a straight line for Georgian Bay. The ''Carruthers'' hasn't been seen since.

== Aftermath ==
After the great storm finally blew itself out late on Monday, November 10, copious amounts of wreckage from several boats began to wash onto Lake Huron's shores. Evidence of the ''James Carruthers'' was slow at first, until great amounts of debris from Canada's newest and largest freighter began coming ashore, mostly near [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]] and [[Point Clark, Ontario|Point Clark]]. A large field of wreckage was found offshore between Kincardine and [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]], nearly seventy miles (113&amp;nbsp;km) south of the ''Carruthers'''s known course. Several bodies of the crew washed ashore as well, mostly around Point Clark. Captain Wright was identified by his large red mustache. Most of the bodies wore life jackets and heavy coats, indicating that they had had time to prepare for disaster. During the height of the storm late on the afternoon of the 9th, several witnesses heard steamer whistles and sighted distress rockets far offshore of [[Inverhuron, Ontario|Inverhuron]]. It was concluded that the rockets were from the ''Carruthers'' as most of her wreckage and crew were found in the vicinity. How the brand-new freighter sank, and how she came to be so far off course (she was bound for Georgian Bay) are mysteries that have never been answered. As of 2018, the wreck of the ''James Carruthers'' has not been located,&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Dwight. ''True Tales of the Great Lakes''. Cleveland: Freshwater Press, 1971. (pgs. 293-294) {{ISBN|0-912514-48-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is also the largest unidentified shipwreck on the lakes.

== John Thompson ==
By the evening of Tuesday, November 11, there were still several unidentified bodies in the Goderich morgue from a few different vessels. Thomas Thompson of [[Hamilton, Ontario]] scanned the corpses for signs of his son John, a crewman aboard the ''James Carruthers''. Thomas saw one body who looked a lot like his son. The facial features and hair color were identical. The corpse was missing an eyetooth like his son and had a tattoo of J.T. on the left forearm. Several scars and a birth defect (the second and third toes of the feet grew together) convinced Thomas Thompson that he had finally found his son John. He arranged to take possession of the body and notified his family.

Meanwhile, in [[Toronto]], John Thompson read newspaper accounts of the great storm and saw his name on a list of the known dead. Thompson had not accompanied the ''Carruthers'' on its final voyage. Instead of immediately wiring his family, young Thompson leisurely took a train to Hamilton to explain what happened in person. While John dawdled, his father Thomas had purchased a coffin, somberly watched as a grave was dug, and made funeral preparations for his dead son. Once in Hamilton, John still inexplicably wandered around town, visiting a friend who advised him to return home at once. Young Thompson walked into his family's house while the wake was in progress. Mrs. Thompson, after the tremendous shock, was overjoyed that her son was still alive. Thomas Thompson was angered beyond belief at the debts incurred and shame, and yelled "It's just like you to come home and attend your own wake, and you can get right out of this house until this thing blows over!" The young man whom Thomas Thompson mistook for his son remains unidentified to this day; he rests with four other unknown sailors in Goderich, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Dwight.

{{Distinguish|Segmentation contractions}}
[[Image:Gray 111 - Vertebral column.png|thumb|100px&lt;!--Way too tall unless this # is small--&gt;|right|[[Vertebrate]]s have a segmented vertebral column.]]

'''Segmentation''' in biology is the division of some [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[body plan]]s into a series of repetitive segments. This article focuses on the segmentation of [[animal]] body plans, specifically using the examples of the taxa [[Arthropoda]], [[Chordata]], and [[Annelida]]. These three groups form segments by using a "growth zone" to direct and define the segments. While all three have a generally segmented body plan and use a growth zone, they use different mechanisms for generating this patterning. Even within these groups, different organisms have different mechanisms for segmenting the body. Segmentation of the body plan is important for allowing free movement and development of certain body parts. It also allows for regeneration in specific individuals.

== Definition ==

Segmentation is a difficult process to satisfactorily define. Many taxa (for instance the molluscs) have some form of serial repetition in their units, but are not conventionally thought of as segmented. Segmented animals are those considered to have organs that were repeated, or to have a body composed of self-similar units, but usually it is the parts of an organism that are referred to as being segmented.&lt;ref name="Budd2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Budd | first1 = G. E. | title = Why are arthropods segmented? | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142X.2001.01041.x | journal = Evolution and Development | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 332–42 | year = 2001 | pmid = 
11710765| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==

Segmentation in animals typically falls into three types, characteristic of different [[arthropods]], [[vertebrates]], and [[annelids]]. Arthropods such as the [[Drosophila|fruit fly]] form segments from a field of equivalent cells based on [[transcription factor]] gradients. Vertebrates like the [[zebrafish]] use oscillating [[gene expression]] to define segments known as [[somites]]. Annelids such as the [[leech]] use smaller [[blast cell]]s budded off from large [[teloblast]] cells to define segments.&lt;ref name = tautz&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz, D | title = Segmentation | journal = Dev Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–312 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15363406 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arthropods===

The Hox genes 7, 8, and 9 correspond in these groups but are shifted (by [[heterochrony]]) by up to three segments. Segments with maxillopeds have Hox gene 7. Fossil [[trilobite]]s probably had three body regions, each with a unique combination of Hox genes.]]

Although ''[[Drosophila]]'' segmentation is not representative of the [[arthropod]] phylum in general, it is the most highly studied. Early screens to identify genes involved in cuticle development led to the discovery of a class of genes that was necessary for proper segmentation of the ''Drosophila'' embryo.&lt;ref name = pick&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pick, L | title = Segmentation: Painting Stripes From Flies to Vertebrates | journal = Dev Genet | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9706689 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1998)23:1&lt;1::AID-DVG1&gt;3.0.CO;2-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To properly segment the ''Drosophila'' embryo, the [[anterior]]-[[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] axis is defined by maternally supplied transcripts giving rise to gradients of these proteins.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt;&lt;ref name = pick /&gt;&lt;ref name = peel&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peel AD |author2=Chipman AD |author3=Akam M | title = Arthropod Segmentation: Beyond The Drosophila Paradigm | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 905–916 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16341071 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gradient then defines the expression pattern for [[gap gene]]s, which set up the boundaries between the different segments. The gradients produced from gap gene expression then define the expression pattern for the [[pair-rule gene]]s.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt;&lt;ref name = peel /&gt; The pair-rule genes are mostly [[transcription factor]]s, expressed in regular stripes down the length of the embryo.&lt;ref name = peel /&gt; These transcription factors then regulate the expression of [[segment polarity gene]]s, which define the polarity of each segment. Boundaries and identities of each segment are later defined.&lt;ref name = peel /&gt;

Within the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are segmented, as are the appendages (when they are present). Some of these elements (e.g. musculature) are not segmented in their sister taxon, the [[onychophora]].&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

===Annelids: Leech===

While not as well studied as in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]], segmentation in the [[leech]] has been described as “budding” segmentation. Early divisions within the leech embryo result in teloblast cells, which are stem cells that divide asymmetrically to create bandlets of blast cells.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt; Furthermore, there are five different teloblast lineages (N, M, O, P, and Q), with one set for each side of the midline. The N and Q lineages contribute two blast cells for each segment, while the M, O, and P lineages only contribute one cell per segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weisblat DA |author2=Shankland M | title = Cell lineage and segmentation in the leech | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 312 | issue = 1153 | pages = 39–56 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2869529 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1985.0176|bibcode = 1985RSPTB.312...39W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the number of segments within the embryo is defined by the number of divisions and blast cells.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt; Segmentation appears to be regulated by the gene [[Hedgehog (gene)|Hedgehog]], suggesting its common evolutionary origin in the ancestor of arthropods and annelids.&lt;ref name=Dray2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dray | first1 = N.| last2 = Tessmar-Raible | first2 = K.| last3 = Le Gouar | first3 = M.| last4 = Vibert | first4 = L.| last5 = Christodoulou | first5 = F.| last6 = Schipany | first6 = K.| last7 = Guillou | first7 = A.| last8 = Zantke | first8 = J.| last9 = Snyman | first9 = H.| last10 = Béhague | first10 = J.| last11 = Vervoort | first11 = M.| last12 = Arendt | first12 = D.| last13 = Balavoine | first13 = G.| title = Hedgehog signaling regulates segment formation in the annelid Platynereis| journal = Science| volume = 329| issue = 5989| pages = 339–342| year = 2010| pmid = 20647470| doi = 10.1126/science.1188913|bibcode = 2010Sci...329..339D | pmc=3182550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the annelids, as with the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are generally segmented. However, this is not true for all of the traits all of the time: many lack segmentation in the body wall, coelom and musculature.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

===Chordates: Zebrafish===
[[Image:Zebrafish Somitogenesis.png|thumb|left|[[Zebrafish]] form segments known as [[somites]] through a process that is reliant upon gradients of [[retinoic acid]] and [[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]], as well as periodic oscillation of gene expression.]]

Although perhaps not as well studied as ''[[Drosophila]]'', segmentation in [[zebrafish]] is actively studied. The process is similar in zebrafish and other [[chordates]], such as the [[chicken]] and the [[mouse]]. Segmentation in chordates is characterized as the formation of a pair of [[somites]] on either side of the midline. This is often referred to as [[somitogenesis]].

In the zebrafish, segmentation is coordinated by the [[clock and wavefront model]]. The "clock" refers to the periodic oscillation of specific genes, such as Her1, a hairy/Enhancer of split- gene. Expression starts at the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] end of the embryo and moves towards the [[anterior]]. The wavefront is where the somites mature, defined by gradients of [[retinoic acid]] and [[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]]. Retinoic acid is high in the anterior and FGF is high in the posterior; the wavefront is the point at which both concentrations are at their lowest. Cells at this point will mature and form a pair of somites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cinquin O | title = Understanding the somitogenesis clock: what's missing? | journal = Mech Dev | volume = 124 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 501–517 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17643270 | doi = 10.1016/j.mod.2007.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaboration of this process with other signalling chemicals allows for structures such as muscles to span the basic segments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Other taxa ===

In other taxa, there is some evidence of segmentation in some organs, but this segmentation is not pervasive to the full list of organs mentioned above for arthropods and annelids. One might think of the serially repeated units in many [[Cycloneuralia]], or the segmented body armature of the chitons (which is not accompanied by a segmented coelom).&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Segmentation can be seen as originating in two ways. To caricature, the 'amplification' pathway would involve a single-segment ancestral organism becoming segmented by repeating itself. This seems implausible, and the 'parcellization' framework is generally preferred – where existing organization of organ systems is 'formalized' from loosely defined packets into more rigid segments.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt; As such, organisms with a loosely defined metamerism, whether internal (as some molluscs) or external (as onychophora), can be seen as 'precursors' to eusegmented organisms such as annelids or arthropods.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49231">'''Spiritual ecology''' is an emerging field in religion, conservation, and academia recognizing that there is a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] facet to all issues related to [[conservation biology|conservation]], [[environmentalism]], and earth [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]]. Proponents of Spiritual Ecology assert a need for contemporary conservation work to include spiritual elements and for contemporary religion and spirituality to include awareness of and engagement in ecological issues.

==Introduction==
Contributors in the field of Spiritual Ecology contend there are spiritual elements at the root of environmental issues. Those working in the arena of Spiritual Ecology further suggest that there is a critical need to recognize and address the spiritual dynamics at the root of environmental degradation.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

The field is largely emerging through three individual streams of formal study and activity: science and academia, religion and spirituality, and ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sponsel|first=Leslie E.|title=Spiritual Ecology: A Quiet Revolution|year=2012|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-36409-9|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the disparate arenas of study and practice, the principles of spiritual ecology are simple: In order to resolve such environmental issues as depletion of species, global warming, and over-consumption, humanity must examine and reassess our underlying attitudes and beliefs about the earth, and our spiritual responsibilities toward the planet.&lt;ref&gt;This theme is developed further in the work of [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]], Sandra Ingerman, Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim: http://fore.research.yale.edu, Leslie Sponsel: http://spiritualecology.info, and others.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Advisor on climate change, [[James Gustave Speth]], said: "I used to think that top environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought that thirty years of good science could address these problems. I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with these we need a cultural and spiritual transformation."&lt;ref&gt;Crockett, Daniel. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/daniel-crockett/nature-connection-will-be-the-next-big-human-trend_b_5698267.html/Nature Connection Will Be the Next Big Human Trend]", ''Huffington Post'', Aug 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it is argued, ecological renewal and sustainability necessarily depends upon spiritual awareness and an attitude of responsibility. Spiritual Ecologists concur that this includes both the recognition of creation as [[sacred]] and behaviors that honor that sacredness.

Recent written and spoken contributions of Pope Francis, particularly his May 2015 Encyclical, [[Laudato si']], as well as unprecedented involvement of faith leaders at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Vidal, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/04/religious-leaders-step-up-pressure-for-action-on-climate-change "Religious leaders step up pressure for action on climate change]",  ''The Guardian'', December 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; reflect a growing popularity of this emerging view. The UN secretary general, [[Ban Ki-moon]], stated on December 4, 2015, that “Faith communities are vital for global efforts to address the climate challenge. They remind us of the moral dimensions of climate change, and of our obligation to care for both the Earth’s fragile environment and our neighbours in need.” &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

==History==
Spiritual ecology identifies the [[Scientific Revolution]]—beginning the 16th century, and continuing through the [[Age of Enlightenment]] to the [[Industrial Revolution]]—as contributing to a critical shift in human understanding with reverberating effects on the environment. The radical expansion of collective consciousness into the era of rational science included a collective change from experiencing nature as a living, spiritual presence to a [[utilitarian]] [[means to an end]].&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;Mary Evelyn Tucker, [http://www.globalonenessproject.org/library/interviews/mary-evelyn-tucker-complete-interview "Complete Interview"], Global Oneness Project video. See also: ''Worldviews &amp; Ecology: Religion, Philosophy, and the Environment'', Mary Evelyn Tucker and John A. Grim (eds.), and the [http://fore.research.yale.edu Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the modern age, [[reason]] became valued over faith, tradition, and revelation. Industrialized society replaced agricultural societies and the old ways of relating to seasons and cycles. Furthermore, it is argued that the growing predominance of a global, mechanized worldview, a collective sense of the sacred was severed and replaced with an insatiable drive for [[scientific progress]] and material prosperity without any sense of limits or responsibility.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

Some in Spiritual Ecology argue that a pervasive patriarchal world-view, and a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religious orientation towards a transcendent divinity, is largely responsible for destructive attitudes about the earth, body, and the sacred nature of creation.&lt;ref&gt;See Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, ''The Return of the Feminine and the World Soul'', ch. 3, "Patriarchal Deities and the Repression of the Feminine."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many identify the wisdom of [[indigenous culture]]s, for whom the physical world is still regarded as sacred, as holding a key to our current ecological predicament.

Spiritual ecology is a response to the values and socio-political structures of recent centuries with their trajectory away from intimacy with the earth and its sacred essence. It has been forming and developing as an intellectual and practice-oriented discipline for nearly a century.&lt;ref&gt;See Leslie E. Sponsel, ''Spiritual Ecology: A Quiet Revolution'', ch. III, "Branches", 69-83 and specifically ch. 12, "Supernovas."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual ecology includes a vast array of people and practices that intertwine spiritual and environmental experience and understanding. Additionally, within the tradition itself resides a deep, developing spiritual vision of a collective human/earth/divine evolution that is expanding consciousness beyond the dualities of human/earth, heaven/earth, mind/body. This belongs to the contemporary movement that recognizes the unity and interrelationship, or "interbeing," the interconnectedness of all of creation.

Visionaries carrying this thread include [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861-1925) who founded the spiritual movement of anthroposophy, and described a "co-evolution of spirituality and nature"&lt;ref&gt;Leslie E. Sponsel, ''Spiritual Ecology: A Quiet Revolution'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://teilharddechardin.org/index.php/index/ Pierre Teilhard de Chardin], a French Jesuit and paleontologist (1881-1955) who spoke of a transition in collective awareness toward a consciousness of the [[divinity]] within every particle of life, even the most dense mineral. This shift includes the necessary dissolution of divisions between fields of study as mentioned above. "Science, philosophy and religion are bound to converge as they draw nearer to the whole."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, ''The Phenomenon of Man'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Berry]], the American [[Passionist]] priest known a 'geologian' (1914-2009), has been one of the most influential figures in this developing movement, with his stress on returning to a sense of wonder and reverence for the natural world. He shared and furthered many of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]’s views, including the understanding that humanity is not at the center of the universe, but integrated into a divine whole with its own evolutionary path. This view compels a re-thinking of the earth/human relationship: "The present urgency is to begin thinking within the context of the whole planet, the integral earth community with all its human and other-than-human components."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Berry, ''The Great Work'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, leaders in the [[Engaged Buddhism]] movement, including [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], also identify a need to return to a sense of self which includes the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Confino, Jo. "[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/zen-thich-naht-hanh-buddhidm-business-values Beyond environment: falling back in love with Mother Earth]," ''The Guardian'', Feb. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joanna Macy]] describes a collective shift – referred to as the "[[Great Turning]]" – taking us into a new consciousness in which the earth is not experienced as separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joanna Macy |url=http://www.joannamacy.net/thegreatturning.html |title=The Great Turning |publisher=Joannamacy.net |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi teacher [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]] similarly grounds his spiritual ecology work in the context of a collective evolutionary expansion towards oneness, bringing us all toward an experience of earth and humanity – all life – as interdependent. In the vision and experience of oneness, the term "spiritual ecology" becomes, itself, redundant. What is earth-sustaining is spiritual; that which is spiritual honors a sacred earth.&lt;ref name="spiritual ecology"&gt;{{cite web|author=Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee |url=http://www.spiritualecology.org/ |title=Spiritual Ecology |publisher=Spiritual Ecology |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="working with oneness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workingwithoneness.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Working with Oneness |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important element in the work of these contemporary teachers is the call for humanity’s full acceptance of responsibility for what we have done – physically and spiritually – to the earth. Only through accepting responsibility will healing and transformation occur.&lt;ref name="spiritual ecology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="working with oneness"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see the video [https://vimeo.com/channels/spiritualecology/36779600 ''Taking Spiritual Responsibility for the Planet''] with Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, and ''[[Engaged Buddhism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the need for a spiritual response to the environmental crisis, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in his 2010 book ''[[Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World]]'', writes: "A specifically [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] science has only recently assumed a position of such authority in the world... (and) not only has it prevented us from considering the world philosophically any more, our predominantly mechanistic way of looking at the world has also excluded our spiritual relationship with Nature. Any such concerns get short shrift in the mainstream debate about what we do to the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Charles HRH The Prince of Wales. ''[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Harmony%20-%20Pages%201-27.pdf/ Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World]'', ch. 1, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles, who has promoted environmental awareness since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Gayathri, Amrutha. "[http://www.ibtimes.com/prince-charles-warns-sixth-extinction-event-asks-people-cut-down-consumption-311446 Prince Charles Warns of ‘Sixth Extinction Event,’ Asks People to Cut Down on Consumption]," ''International Business Times'', Sept. 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; continues: "... by continuing to deny ourselves this profound, ancient, intimate relationship with Nature, I fear we are compounding our subconscious sense of alienation and disintegration, which is mirrored in the fragmentation and disruption of harmony we are bringing about in the world around us. At the moment we are disrupting the teeming diversity of life and the ‘ecosystems’ that sustain it—the forests and prairies, the woodland, moorland and fens, the oceans, rivers and streams. And this all adds up to the degree of ‘disease’ we are causing to the intricate balance that regulates the planet’s climate, on which we so intimately depend."&lt;ref&gt;Charles HRH The Prince of Wales. ''[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Harmony%20-%20Pages%201-27.pdf/ Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World],'' ch. 1, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 Pope Francis’s Encyclical, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html “Laudato Si’: On Care for our Common Home,”] endorsed the need for a spiritual and moral response to our environmental crisis, and thus implicitly brings the subject of spiritual ecology to the forefront of our present ecological debate. This encyclical recognizes that  “The ecological crisis is essentially a spiritual problem,” &lt;ref&gt;'[http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/06/18/metropolitan_john_zizioulas_laudato_si_give_orthodox_grea/1152356 Metropolitan John Zizioulas: Laudato Si' give Orthodox 'great joy]'", ''Vatican Radio'', June 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the ideas of this developing field. American environmentalist, author, and journalist [[Bill McKibben]] who has written extensively on the impact of [[global warming]], says that Pope Francis has "brought the full weight of the spiritual order to bear on the global threat posed by [[climate change]], and in so doing joined its power with the scientific order."&lt;ref&gt;McKibben, Bill. "[http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/06/18/pope-francis-encyclical-cry-of-earth/ Pope Francis: The Cry of the Earth]," ''New York Review of Books, NYDaily'', June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientist, environmentalist, and a leader in sustainable ecology [[David Suzuki]] also expresses the importance of including the sacred in addressing the ecological crisis: "The way we see the world shapes the way we treat it. If a mountain is a deity, not a pile of ore; if a river is one of the veins of the land, not potential irrigation water; if a forest is a sacred grove, not timber; if other species are biological kin, not resources; or if the planet is our mother, not an opportunity—then we will treat each other with greater [[respect]]. Thus is the challenge, to look at the world from a different perspective."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEtHBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=The%20way%20we%20see%20the%20world%20shapes%20the%20way%20we%20treat%20it%20suzuki&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20way%20we%20see%20the%20world%20shapes%20the%20way%20we%20treat%20it%20suzuki&amp;f=false/ The David Suzuki Reader]'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically we see the development of the foundational ideas and perspective of spiritual ecology in mystical arms of traditional religions and spiritual arms of environmental conservation. These ideas put forth a story of an evolving universe and potential human experience of wholeness in which dualities dissipate—dualities that have marked past eras and contributed to the destruction of the earth as "other" than spirit.

==Indigenous wisdom==
Many in the field of spiritual ecology agree that a distinct stream of experience threading throughout history that has at its heart a lived understanding of the principles, values and attitudes of spiritual ecology: indigenous wisdom. The term "indigenous" in this context refers to that which is native, original, and resident to a place, more specifically to societies who share and preserve ways of knowing the world in relationship to the land.&lt;ref&gt;John Grim, "Recovering Religious Ecology with Indigenous Traditions", available online at: [http://fore.research.yale.edu/religion/indigenous Indigenous Traditions and Ecology], Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; For many Native traditions, the earth ''is'' the central spiritual context.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Evelyn Tucker and John A. Grim (eds.), ''Worldviews &amp; Ecology: Religion, Philosophy, and the Environment'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle condition reflects an attitude and way of being in the world that is rooted in land and embedded in place.&lt;ref&gt;Tu Wei-Ming, "Beyond Enlightenment Mentality", published in ''Worldviews &amp; Ecology: Religion, Philosophy, and the Environment'', Mary Evelyn Tucker and John A. Grim (eds.), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual ecology directs us to look to revered holders of these traditions in order to understand the source of our current ecological and spiritual crisis and find guidance to move into a state of balance.

Features of many indigenous teachings include life as a continual act of [[prayer]] and [[gratitude|thanksgiving]], knowledge and symbiotic relationship with an animate nature, and being aware of one’s actions on future generations. Such understanding necessarily implies a mutuality and reciprocity between people, earth and the cosmos.

The above historical trajectory is located predominantly in a Judeo-Christian European context, for it is within this context that humanity experienced the loss of the sacred nature of creation, with its devastating consequences. For example, with [[colonization]], indigenous spiritual ecology was historically replaced by an imposed Western belief that land and the environment are [[Commodity|commodities]] to be used and exploited, with [[exploitation of natural resources]] in the name of socio-economic evolution. This perspective "... tended to remove any spiritual value of the land, with regard only given for [[Value (economics)|economic value]], and this served to further distance communities from intimate relationships with their environments,"&lt;ref&gt;Ritskes, Eric. “[http://gir.uoguelph.ca/index.php/ajote/article/view/1937/2475 A Great Tree Has Fallen: Community, Spiritual Ecology, and African Education]", AJOTE, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, Toronto, Canada, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; often with "devastating consequences for indigenous people and nature around the world."&lt;ref&gt;See "Environment and Imperialism: Why Colonialism Still Matters,"[https://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/fileadmin/Documents/research/sri/workingpapers/SRIPs-20_01.pdf] Joseph Murphy, Sustainability Research Institute (SRI), School of Earth and Environment, The University of Leeds, U.K., Oct. 2009, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Healing Ecological and Spiritual Connections through Learning to be Non-Subjects'[https://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/fileadmin/Documents/research/sri/workingpapers/SRIPs-20_01.pdf], Charlotte Šunde, Australian eJournal of Theology 8, Oct 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on early prehistoric human activity in the [[Quaternary extinction event]], shows overhunting megafauna well before European colonization in North America, South America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, William Ellis.

(2001). “New Ages for the Last Australian Megafauna: Continent-Wide Extinction About 46,000 Years Ago.”  Science 292:1888-1892&lt;/ref&gt; While this might cast doubt upon the view of indigenous wisdom and the sacred relationship to land and environment throughout the entirety of human history, it this does not negate the more recent devastating effects as referenced.

Along with the basic principles and behaviors advocated by spiritual ecology, some indigenous traditions hold the same evolutionary view articulated by the Western spiritual teachers listed above. The understanding of humanity evolving toward a state of unity and harmony with the earth after a period of discord and suffering is described in a number of prophecies around the globe. These include the White Buffalo prophecy of the Plains Indians, the prophecy of the Eagle and Condor from the people of the Andes, and the Onondaga prophecies held and retold by [[Oren Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHqVdZmpRgI |title=Chief Arvol Looking Horse Speaks of White Buffalo Prophecy |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaughan |first=Emmanuel |url=http://www.globalonenessproject.org/library/films/invitation |title=An Invitation |publisher=Global Oneness Project |date=2015-04-25 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=6300 |title=The Faithkeeper &amp;#124; Film Reviews &amp;#124; Films &amp;#124; Spirituality &amp; Practice |publisher=Spiritualityandpractice.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current trends==
Spiritual ecology is developing largely in three arenas identified above: Science and Academia, Religion and Spirituality, and Environmental Conservation.

===Science and academia===
Among scholars contributing to spiritual ecology, five stand out: [[Steven Clark Rockefeller]], [[Mary Evelyn Tucker]], John Grim, [[Bron Taylor]] and Roger S. Gottlieb.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie E. Sponsel, ''Spiritual Ecology: A Quiet Revolution'', ch. 12, "Supernovas", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Evelyn Tucker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergingearthcommunity.org/mary-evelyn-tucker |title=About &amp;#124; Mary Evelyn Tucker |publisher=Emerging Earth Community |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Grim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergingearthcommunity.org/john-grim |title=About &amp;#124; John Grim |publisher=Emerging Earth Community |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the co-ordinators of [[Yale University]]’s Forum on Religion and Ecology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.research.yale.edu/ |title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology |publisher=Fore.research.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international multi-religious project exploring religious world-views, texts ethics and practices in order to broaden understanding of the complex nature of current environmental concerns.

Steven C. Rockefeller is an author of numerous books about religion and the environment, and is professor emeritus of religion at [[Middlebury College]]. He played a leading role in the drafting of the [[Earth Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergingearthcommunity.org/earth-charter |title=Earth Charter &amp;#124; Overview |publisher=Emerging Earth Community |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger S. Gottlieb&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.wpi.edu/~gottlieb/ Roger S. Gottlieb, Professor of Philosophy, Worcester Polytechnic Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; is a professor of Philosophy at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] is author of over 100 articles and 16 books on environmentalism, religious life, contemporary spirituality, political philosophy, ethics, feminism, and the Holocaust.

Bron Taylor at the University of Florida coined the term "Dark Green Religion" to describe a set of beliefs and practices centered on the conviction that nature is sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brontaylor.com/ |title=Exploring and Studying Environmental Ethics &amp; History, Nature Religion, Radical Environmentalism, Surfing Spirituality, Deep Ecology and more |publisher=Bron Taylor |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leaders in the field include: Leslie E. Sponsel at the [[University of Hawai'i]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritualecology.info/ |title=Spiritual Ecology &amp;#124; Leslie E. Sponsel |publisher=Spiritualecology.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah McFarland Taylor]] at Northwestern University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sarah McFarland Taylor]] |title=Green Sisters: a Spiritual Ecology |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780674034952}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitchell Thomashow]] at Antioch University New England and the [[Schumacher College]] Programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/ |title=Transformative Learning through Sustainable Living |publisher=Schumacher College |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the field of science, spiritual ecology is emerging in arenas including Physics, Biology (see: [[Ursula Goodenough]]), Consciousness Studies (see: [[Brian Swimme]]; California Institute of Integral Studies), [[Systems Theory]] (see: [[David Loy]]; Nondual Science Institute), and [[Gaia Hypothesis]], which was first articulated by [[James Lovelock]] and [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

Another example is scientist and author [[Diana Beresford-Kroeger]], world recognized expert on how trees chemically affect the environment, who brings together the fields of [[ethnobotany]], [[horticulture]], [[ecology]], and spirituality in relation to the current ecological crisis and stewardship of the natural world. She says, "... the world, the gift of this world is fantastic and phenomenal. The molecular working of the world is extraordinary, the mathematics of the world is extraordinary... sacred and science go together."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sarah, (Reporter and Producer) ''[http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/24869/20140515/sacred-and-science-go-together-for-botanist-diana-beresford-kroeger/ "Sacred and science go together" for botanist Diana Beresford-Kroeger]'' North Country Public Radio, May 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Hampson, Sarah. ''[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-tree-whisperer-science-spirituality-and-an-abiding-love-of-forests/article14783699/ The tree whisperer: science, spirituality and an abiding love of forests]'' The Globe and Mail, Oct. 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and ecology===
Within many faiths, environmentalism is becoming an area of study and advocacy. [[Pope Francis]]’s May 2015 encyclical, [[Laudato si']], offered a strong confirmation of spiritual ecology and its principles from within the Catholic Church. Additionally, over 150 leaders from various faiths signed a letter to the UN Climate Summit in Paris 2015, [http://actalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/COP21_Statement_englisch2.pdf “Statement of Faith and Spiritual Leaders on the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21 in Paris in December 2015”], recognizing the earth as “a gift” from God and calling for climate action. These contemporary events are reflections of enduring themes coming to the fore within many religions.

Christian environmentalists emphasize the ecological responsibilities of all Christians as stewards of God's earth, while contemporary Muslim religious ecology is inspired by Qur'anic themes, such as mankind being ''[[khalifa]]'', or trustee of God on earth (2:30). There is also a Jewish ecological perspective based upon the Bible and Torah, for example the laws of ''[[bal tashchit]]'' (neither to destroy wantonly, nor waste resources unnecessarily). [[Engaged Buddhism]] applies Buddhist principles and teachings to social and environmental issues. A collection of Buddhist responses to global warming can be seen at Ecological Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuddhism.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Ecobuddhism |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Pope Francis]], other world traditions currently seem to include a subset of leaders committed to an ecological perspective. The "[[Green Patriarch]]," Bartholomew 1, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriarchate.org/ |title=Home - The Ecumenical Patriarchate |publisher=Patriarchate.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; has worked since the late nineties to bring together scientists, environmentalists, religious leaders and policy makers to address the ecological crisis, and says protecting the planet is a "sacred task and a common vocation… Global warming is a moral crisis and a moral challenge.”&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, John. "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11973107/Science-alone-cannot-save-the-planet-insists-spiritual-leader-of-Orthodox-Church.html Science alone cannot save the planet, insists spiritual leader of Orthodox Church]" ''The Telegraph'', Nov. 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Foundation For Ecology And Environmental Sciences (IFEES)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifees.org.uk/ The Islamic Foundation For Ecology And Environmental Sciences (IFEES)]&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the sponsors of the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium held in Istanbul in August 2015, which resulted in "Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change"—a declaration endorsed by religious leaders, noted Islamic scholars and teachers from 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamicclimatedeclaration.org/islamic-declaration-on-global-climate-change/ Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt; In October, 2015, 425 rabbis signed "A Rabbinic Letter on the Climate Crisis", calling for vigorous action to prevent worsening climate disruption and to seek eco-social justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theshalomcenter.org/RabbinicLetterClimate Link to the text of the Rabbinic Letter and its signers]&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scriptures also allude strongly and often to the connection between humans and nature, and these texts form the foundation of the Hindu Declaration on Climate Change, presented at a 2009 meeting of the [[Parliament of World Religions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regionalinterfaith.org.au/component/content/article/99-climate-change/442-hindu-declaration-on-climate-change-.html Hindu Declaration on Climate Change, presented at the Parliament of the World’s Religions, Melbourne, Australia, Dec. 8, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many world faith and religious leaders, such as the Dalai Lama, were present at the 2015 Climate Change Conference, and shared the view that: "Saving the planet is not just a political duty, but also a moral one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpa-international.com/news/asia/religious-leaders-as-climate-activists-saving-planet-is-moral-duty-a-47170101-img-1.html Religious leaders as climate activists: Saving planet is moral duty]", DPA (German Press Agency News), Nov 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Greenfield, Nicole "[http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/content/spiritual-movement-fight-climate-change-pope-not-alone In the Spiritual Movement to Fight Climate Change, the Pope Is Not Alone]," originally published by the Natural Resource Defense Council, June 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Karmapa, [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]], has also stated, "The environmental emergency that we face is not just a scientific issue, nor is it just a political issue—it is also a moral issue.”&lt;ref&gt;Rohn, Roger. "[http://e360.yale.edu/feature/for_buddhist_leader_religion_and_the_environment_are_one/2866/ For Buddhist Leader, Religion And the Environment Are One: Interview with H.H. The Karmapa], ''Yale Environment 360'', April 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

These religious approaches to ecology also have a growing interfaith expression, for example in [http://www.interfaithsustain.com The Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development (ICSD)] where world religious leaders speak out on [[climate change]] and [[sustainability]]. And at their gathering in Fall 2015, the [[Parliament of World Religions]] created a declaration for Interfaith Action on Climate Change, and "brought together more than 10,000 activists, professors, clergy, and global leaders from 73 countries and 50 faiths to confront climate change"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/blog/2015-12-14-1823/7-ways-parliament-stepped-challenge-climate-change-2015 7 Ways the Parliament Stepped Up to Challenge Climate Change in 2015]," Parliament of World Religions, Dec. 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth-based traditions and earth spirituality===
Care for and respect to earth as Sacred—as Mother Earth ([[Mother Nature]])—who provides life and nourishment, is a central point to Earth-based spirituality. PaGaian Cosmology is a tradition within Earth-based spirituality that focuses particularly in Spiritual Ecology and celebrating the sacredness of life. Glenys Livingstone describes it in her book as "an ecospirituality grounded in indigenous Western religious celebration of the Earth-Sun annual cycle. By linking to story of the unfolding universe this practice can be deepened. And a sense of the Triple Goddess—central to the cycle and known in ancient cultures—may be developed as a dynamic innate to all being. The ritual scripts and the process of ritual events presented here, may be a journey into self-knowledge through personal, communal and ecological story: the self to be known is one that is integral with place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://pagaiancosmology.com/ |title=PaGaian Cosmology |publisher=PaGaian Cosmology |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirituality and ecology===
While religiously-oriented environmentalism is grounded in scripture and theology, there is a more recent environmental movement that articulates the need for an ecological approach founded on spiritual awareness rather than religious belief. The individuals articulating this approach may have a religious background, but their ecological vision comes from their own lived spiritual experience. The difference between this spiritually-oriented ecology and a religious approach to ecology can be seen as analogous to how the [[Inter-spiritual]] Movement moves beyond [[interfaith]] and interreligious dialogue to focus on the actual experience of spiritual principles and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Interspirituality moves a step beyond interfaith dialogue and is a concept and term developed by the Catholic Monk [[Wayne Teasdale]] in 1999 in his book ''The Mystic Heart: Discovering a Universal Spirituality in the World’s Religions''. Also see [https://www.scribd.com/doc/101981052/New-Monasticism-An-Interspiritual-Manifesto-for-Contemplative-Life-in-the-21st-Century "New Monasticism: An Interspiritual Manifesto for Contemplative Life in the 21st Century"], by Rory McEntee &amp; Adam Bucko, p. 22, and Wayne Teasdale, ''A Monk in the World'', p.175. Furthermore, interspirituality has an ecological dimension. See "The Interspiritual Age: Practical Mysticism for a Third Millennium", Wayne Teasdale, (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual ecology similarly explores the importance of this experiential spiritual dimension in relation to our present ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="spiritual ecology"/&gt;

The Engaged Buddhist teacher [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] speaks of the importance of mindfulness in taking care of our Mother Earth, and how the highest form of [[prayer]] is real communion with the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuddhism.org/wisdom/interviews/tnh-be |title=Thay: Beyond Environment |publisher=Ecobuddhism |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Ingerman offers shamanic healing as a way of reversing pollution in Medicine for the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandraingerman.com/medicinefortheearth.html |title=Sandra Ingerman |publisher=Sandra Ingerman |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franciscan monk [[Richard Rohr]] emphasizes the need to experience the whole world as a divine incarnation. Sufi mystic [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]] directs our attention not just to the suffering of the physical world, but also its interior spiritual self, or [[anima mundi]] (world soul). Bill Plotkin and others are involved in the work of finding within nature the reconnection with our soul and the world soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureandthehumansoul.com/ |title=A New Book by Bill Plotkin, Ph.D |publisher=Nature and the Human Soul |date= |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are just a few of the many different ways practitioners of spiritual ecology within different spiritual traditions and disciplines bring our awareness back to the sacred nature of creation.

===Environmental conservation===
{{Main|Conservation movement}}
The environmental conservation field has been informed, shaped, and led by individuals who have had profound experiences of nature’s sacredness and have fought to protect it. Recognizing the intimacy of human soul and nature, many have pioneered a new way of thinking about and relating to the earth.

Today many aspects of the environmental conservation movement are empowered by spiritual principles and interdisciplinary cooperation.

[[Robin Wall Kimmerer]], Professor of Environmental and Forest Biology at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, has recently founded the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.esf.edu/nativepeoples/ SUNY-ESF Center for Native Peoples and the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; which bridges scientific based study of ecology and the environment with [[traditional ecological knowledge]], which includes spirituality. As she writes in this piece from Oxford Journal [[BioScience]]: "Traditional ecological knowledge is increasingly being sought by academics, agency scientists, and policymakers as a potential source of ideas for emerging models of ecosystem management, conservation biology, and ecological restoration. It has been recognized as complementary and equivalent to scientific knowledge... Traditional ecological knowledge is not unique to Native American culture but exists all over the world, independent of ethnicity. It is born of long intimacy and attentiveness to a homeland and can arise wherever people are materially and spiritually integrated with their landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Kimmerer, Robin Wall. "[http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/432.full/ Weaving Traditional Ecological Knowledge into Biological Education: A Call to Action]," Oxford Journals: Science &amp; Mathematics, BioScience, Vol. 52, Issue 5, Pp. 432-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the World Wildlife Fund ([[World Wide Fund for Nature]]) has developed [http://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/sacred-earth-faiths-for-conservation#close/ Sacred Earth: Faiths for Conservation], a program to collaborate with spiritual leaders and faith communities from all different spiritual traditions around the world, to face environmental issues including deforestation, pollution, unsustainable extraction, melting glaciers and rising sea levels. The Sacred Earth program works with faith-based leaders and communities, who "best articulate ethical and spiritual ideals around the sacred [[value of Earth]] and its diversity, and are committed to protecting it."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/sacred-earth-faiths-for-conservation#close Sacred Earth: Faiths for Conservation at WWF].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the conservation projects developed from the WWF Sacred Earth program is Khoryug,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.khoryug.com/ Khoryug].&lt;/ref&gt; based in the Eastern Himalayas, which is an association of several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries that works on environmental protection of the Himalayan region through apply the values of compassion and interdependence towards the Earth and all living beings that dwell here. Organized under the auspices of His Holiness, the 17th Karmapa, [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]], the Khoryug project resulted in the publication of environmental guidelines for Buddhists and "more than 55 monastery-led projects to address forest degradation, water loss, wildlife trade, waste, pollution and climate change."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/sacred-earth-faiths-for-conservation#close/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishna Kant Shukla]], a physicist and musician, is noted for his lectures on "Indian villages as models of sustainable development" and his work in establishing [[Saha Astitva]] a model eco village and organic farm in tribal Maharashtra, India.

One trend to note is the recognition that women—by instinct and nature—have a unique commitment and capacity to protect the earth’s resources. We see this illustrated in the lives of [[Wangari Maathai]], founder of Africa’s [[Green Belt Movement]], which was initially made up of women planting trees; [[Jane Goodall]], innovator of local sustainable programs in Africa, many of which are designed to empower girls and women; and [[Vandana Shiva]], the Indian feminist activist working on a variety of issues including [[seed saving]], protecting small farms in India and protesting agri-business.

Other contemporary inter-disciplinary environmentalists include [[Wendell Berry]], a farmer, poet, and academic living in Kentucky, who fights for small farms and criticizes agri-business; and [[Satish Kumar]], a former Jain monk and founder of [[Schumacher College]], a center for ecological studies.

==Opposing views==
Although the May 2015 Encyclical from Pope Francis brought the importance of the subject spiritual ecology to the fore of mainstream contemporary culture, it is a point of view that is not widely accepted or included in the work of most environmentalists and ecologists. Academic research on the subject has also generated some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;See Murray, Tim. ''[http://www.humanistperspectives.org/issue186/murray.html/ Seeking an Ecological Rescue: Do We Need a Spiritual Awakening—or a Scientific Understanding?]'', Humanist Perspectives: a Canadian Journal of Humanism, Issue 86, Autumn 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Sponsel, Leslie E. [http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155698/ Religion, nature and environmentalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530055521/http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155698/ |date=2014-05-30 }}''Encyclopedia of the Earth, published July 2, 2007 (updated March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Wilber]] has criticized spiritual ecology, suggesting that “spiritually oriented [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]]” fail to acknowledge the transcendent aspect of the divine, or hierarchical cosmologies, and thus exclude an important aspect of spirituality, as well as presenting what Wilber calls a one-dimensional “flat land” ontology in which the sacred in nature is wholly immanent. But Wilber's views are also criticized as not including an in-depth understanding of indigenous spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;See Zimmerman, Michael E. ''[http://www.integralworld.net/zimmerman3.html/ Ken Wilber's Critique of Ecological Spirituality]'', Integral World, published August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tendril perversion''', often referred to in context as simply '''perversion''', is a geometric phenomenon found in [[helix|helical]] structures such as plant [[tendril]]s, in which a helical structure forms that is divided into two sections of opposite [[chirality]], with a transition between the two in the middle.&lt;ref name=MacMillan2002/&gt; A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as [[telephone handset]] cords.&lt;ref name="LiuEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093183| pmid = 24759785| title = Structural Transition from Helices to Hemihelices| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = e93183| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Huang | first2 = J. | last3 = Su | first3 = T. | last4 = Bertoldi | first4 = K. | last5 = Clarke | first5 = D. R. | pmc=3997338|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...993183L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phenomenon was known to [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref name=Goriely2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/research/researchgroups/applied/siam/resources/SIAM_Day_2013_AGoriely_lecture.pdf|title=Inversion, Rotation, and Perversion in Mechanical Biology: From Microscopic Anisotropy to Macroscopic Chirality | author=Alain Goriely | date = 2013 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote in 1865,

{{cquote|
A tendril ... invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction, and in another part in the opposite direction...
This curious and symmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists, but has not been sufficiently
explained.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, "On the movements and habits of climbing plants", ''Journal of the Linnean Society'', 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The term "tendril perversion" was coined by Goriely and Tabor in 1998 based on the word ''perversion'' found in the 19th Century science literature. "Perversion" is a transition from one chirality to another and was known to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who attributed it to the [[topologist]] [[J. B. Listing]].&lt;ref name=Goriely2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism|author=James Clerk Maxwell|year=1873|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|page=|quote=The operation of passing from one system to the other is called by Listing, ''Perversion''. The reflection of an object in a mirror image is a perverted image of the object.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tendril perversion can be viewed as an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], in which the strained structure of the tendril adopts a [[minimum total potential energy principle|configuration of minimum energy]] while preserving zero overall twist.&lt;ref name="MacMillan2002" /&gt; 

Tendril perversion has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Gerbode et al. have made experimental studies of the coiling of [[cucumber]] tendrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1223304| pmid = 22936777| title = How the Cucumber Tendril Coils and Overwinds| journal = Science| volume = 337| issue = 6098| pages = 1087–91| year = 2012| last1 = Gerbode | first1 = S.

Generalized tendril perversions were put forward by Silva et al., to include perversions that can be intrinsically produced in elastic filaments, leading to a multiplicity of geometries and dynamical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Pedro E.

'''Vostok 4''' ({{lang-ru|'''Восток-4'''}}, ''[[Orient]] 4'' or ''East 4'') was a mission in the [[Soviet space program]]. It was launched in August 1962, a day after [[Vostok 3]] with [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Pavel Popovich]] on board—the first time that more than one manned spacecraft were in orbit at the same time. The two [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok capsules]] came within {{convert|6.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} of one another and ship-to-ship radio contact was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 0-02-542820-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmonauts of Vostok 3 and 4 did not attempt rendezvous. At one point the craft came within a few kilometers of each other and Popovich later reported at a news conference that he saw the other craft from orbit. Popovich is quoted as saying, "I saw it at once," referring to seeing Vostok 3 in orbit. "It looked like a very small moon in the distance."

The Vostok 3 and 4 spacecraft landed about 200&amp;nbsp;km apart, south of [[Karaganda]], [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VoU0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jJ4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6601,3363422&amp;hl=en "Soviet Spacemen Say No Try Made To 'Rendezvous'"], ''TheMontreal Gazette newspaper'', Aug 22, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission went largely as planned, despite a malfunction with the Vostok's life-support systems that meant that cabin temperature dropped down to {{convert|10|°C|F}}. The flight was terminated early after a misunderstanding by ground control, who believed that Popovich had given them a codeword asking to be brought back ahead of schedule.

The re-entry capsule is now on display at the [[NPO Zvezda Museum]] in [[Moscow]], but it has been modified to represent the [[Voskhod 2]] capsule.
