'''''1491''''' is a musical centered around Christopher Columbus before his voyage to discover the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=John C. |first1=Skipper |title=Meredith Willson: The Unsinkable Music Man |date=2015 |publisher=Savas Publishing |isbn=9781882810789 |pages=156-159 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzB1CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music and lyrics are by American composer and playwright [[Meredith Willson]]. It was Willson's final musical.  The book was by Willson and Richard Morris with additional material by Ira Barmak and was based on an idea by Ed Ainsworth.

==Creation==
It was intended to have the show open in California in 1967, before transferring to Broadway. The previous two years were spent researching Columbus and traveling in Spain and Italy for possible material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0-1kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KoINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3223,1769878&amp;dq=meredith-willson+1491&amp;hl=en Columbus Story Inspires Willson] - [[Edmonton Journal]] - Oct 7, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production History==
The musical opened in Los Angeles on September 2, 1969, and later transferred to San Francisco where it closed on December 13, 1969.  The musical closed before reaching Broadway.  Richard Morris was the director, Edwin Lester was the producer, and Danny Daniels was the choreographer.  [[John Cullum]] starred as Christopher Columbus and [[Chita Rivera]] starred as his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mordden|first=Ethan |title=Open a new window: the Broadway musical in the 1960s|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|date=2002|pages=41|isbn=978-1-4039-6013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean Fenn]] played [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oates|first=Bill |title=Meredith Willson, America's music man: the whole Broadway-symphonic-radio-motion picture story|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|date=2005|pages=172|isbn=978-1-4208-3524-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sergio Franchi was previously cast as Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;Age is No Barrier to Talented Stars - The News and Courier - Sep 18, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">The '''1959 anti-American riots in Panama''' happened during the celebration of [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|Panamanian independence]] on November 3, 1959. Demonstrations started that day as Panamanians were influenced by former foreign minister [[Aquilino Boyd]], who threatened a "peaceful invasion" of the American-controlled [[Panama Canal Zone]], to raise the flag of the republic there as tangible evidence of Panama's sovereignty over the territory.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Meditz |editor1-first=Sandra W. |editor2-last=Hanratty |editor2-first=Dennis M. |title=Panama : A Country Study |date=1989 |publisher=Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/88600486/ |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearful that Panamanian mobs might actually force entry into the Canal Zone, the [[United States]] called out its troops. Several hundred Panamanians crossed barbed-wire restraints and clashed with Canal Zone police and troops. A second wave of Panamanian citizens was repulsed by the [[Panamanian National Guard]], supported by American troops.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19591103.2.10&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive and violent disorder followed. A mob smashed the windows of the United States Information Agency library. The United States flag was torn from the ambassador's residence and trampled, and the U.S. embassy was attacked. Stones were thrown against the troops, who were dispersed by [[tear gas]]. Three American troops were injured, whilst two student protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19591103.2.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Aware that public hostility was getting out of hand, political leaders attempted to regain control over their followers but were unsuccessful. Relations between the two governments were severely strained. United States authorities erected a fence on the border of the Canal Zone, and United States citizens residing in the Canal Zone observed a voluntary boycott of Panamanian merchants, who traditionally depended heavily on these patrons.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/panama-canal-flag-riots&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension were already stoked before amid the discontent over the Canal Zone. In May 1958 students demonstrating against the United States clashed with the National Guard, and nine peopled died in the violence.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; On September 17, 1960, American President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attempted to defuse the issue by letting the [[Flag of Panama]] fly alongside the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] of the U.S. inside the Canal Zone. After the events of 1959, violence occurred [[Martyrs' Day (Panama)|again in 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/panama-canal-flag-riots&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15209">'''[[Abusive]] [[Supervisor|supervision]]''' is most commonly studied in the context of the workplace, although can arise in other areas such as in the household and at school. "Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome." &lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions|[weasel ]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 178–190 | doi=10.2307/1556375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoobler, J. M., Tepper, B. J., &amp; Duffy, M. K. ( 2000). Moderating effects of coworkers' organizational citizenship behavior on relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates' attitudes and psychological distress. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Management Association, Orlando, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Workplace violence]] has combination of situational and personal factors".

== Workplace bullying ==

{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workplace deviance ==

{{Main|Workplace deviance}}
Workplace deviance is closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = M. | last2 = Ambrose | first2 = M.L. | year = 2007 | title = Abusive Supervision and Workplace Deviance and the Moderating Effects of Negative Reciprocity Beliefs | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 4| pages = 1159–1168 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.4.1159 | pmid=17638473}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bolin | first1 = A. | last2 = Heatherly | first2 =  | year = 2001 | title = Predictors of Employee Deviance: The Relationship between Bad Attitudes and Bad Behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Business and Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| page = 405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".&lt;ref&gt;The past, present, and future of workplace deviance research.
Bennett, Rebecca J.; Robinson, Sandra L.Greenberg, Jerald (Ed), (2003). Organizational behavior: The state of the science (2nd ed.), (pp. 247-281).&lt;/ref&gt; Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

== Social undermining ==

{{Main|Social undermining}}
Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S.

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat?

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person’s] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref&gt;8. Hoobler, J. M., &amp; Brass, D. J. (2006). Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5438">[[File:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Bug River property lies to the east of the Curzon Line-based part of the modern Polish border]]
The '''Bug River property''' ({{lang-pl|Mienie zabużańskie}}, "Trans-Bug property") is property which was within the territory of the [[interbellum]] Poland ([[Second Polish Republic]]) and was abandoned by Polish owners after 1945. it was abandoned when the territory was no longer inside of [[Poland]]. The name refers to [[Bug River]] because the Bug is a major part of the new eastern boundary of Poland (roughly based on the [[Curzon Line]]), separating the so-called [[Eastern Borderlands]] from the rest of the former Polish territory. The Bug River property is located within the states of  [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=msp&gt;[http://www.msp.gov.pl/en/restitution/bug-river-claims/118,Bug-river-claims.html "Bug River claims"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419204516/http://www.msp.gov.pl/en/restitution/bug-river-claims/118%2CBug-river-claims.html |date=April 19, 2015 }}, [[Ministry of State Treasury (Poland)|Ministry of Treasury of the Republic of Poland]] (retrieved April 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The claims for compensation for this lost property are known as the '''Bug River claims'''.

The agreements between the USSR and the interim Polish government ([[Government of National Unity]]) mostly concerned the evacuation of the population, and did not set out in any detail rules for compensation for owners of abandoned property. The laws of the [[Communist Poland]]  had a number of provisions concerning the issues related to agricultural land and unmovable property.&lt;ref name=msp/&gt;

In modern Poland,  the act of December 12, 2003, by offsetting the value of the property abandoned abroad against sales price or fees for perpetual use is regarded as a base for state compensation to Polish citizens for the value of the abandoned property.  As of February 29, 2003, 82,000 applications for compensation were submitted, with total estimate value over 10,500 million [[Polish złoty|PLN]].&lt;ref name=msp/&gt;

Due to unsatisfactory handling of the issue, it was raised before the  Constitutional Tribunal (2002 proceedings &lt;ref&gt;''Regional Protection of Human Rights'', Volume 1, 2013, {{ISBN|0199941521}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HAfFyRlCYjUC&amp;pg=PA862 p.862]&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 2004 the issue was considered by the [[European Court for Human Rights]] (pilot case: ''Broniowski v. Poland''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-70326 Case ''Broniowski v. Poland''], [[HUDOC]] database&lt;/ref&gt;). The Court found 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a systemic problem connected with the malfunctioning of domestic legislation and practice caused by the failure to set up an effective mechanism to implement the "right to credit" of Bug River claimants ... with the consequence that not only the applicant in this particular case but also a whole class of individuals had been or were still denied the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Court noted that the issue was not satisfactorily resolved for some 80,000 claims.&lt;ref&gt;''The Individual in the International Legal System: Continuity and Change in International Law'', 2011, {{ISBN|1139499971}},  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LF7k-bnyMMoC&amp;pg=PA333 p. 333]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further decrees on the implementation of the right for compensation include:
*Decree of July 8, 2005 "O realizacji prawa do rekompensaty z tytułu pozostawienia nieruchomości poza obecnymi granicami Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej" (Dz. U. z 2005r. Nr 169 poz. 1418).
*Decree of September 8, 2006 "O zmianie ustawy o realizacji prawa do rekompensaty z tytułu pozostawienia nieruchomości poza obecnymi granicami Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz niektórych innych ustaw" (Dz. U. 2006r.Nr 195 poz. 1437).

In February 2014 President [[Bronisław Komorowski]] signed a decree to further update the regulations related to compensation for Bug River property. In particular, the decree removed a number of restrictions to the right for the compensation.&lt;ref name=podp&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,91446,15390132,Prezydent_podpisal_ustawe_ws__rekompensat_za_mienie.html "Prezydent podpisał ustawę ws. rekompensat za mienie zabużańskie"]&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it addressed the issues raised before the Constitutional Tribunal and the ECHR on the subject.&lt;ref name=podp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Law and Domestic Legal Systems: Incorporation, Transformation, and Persuasion'', 2011, {{ISBN|0191029769}}, Chapter "Poland" by Anna Wyrozumska, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9aHFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA479 p. 479]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, due to the aspirations of Ukraine to join the [[European Union]], Polish society raised an issue whether Ukraine will be willing to share the burden of the compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pl.sputniknews.com/opinie/20150417/264893.html "Zwrot Kresów: Czy Ukraina zapłaci wystawione rachunki?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Lithuania has been very reluctantly handling the claims of Poles for compensation/restitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurierwilenski.lt/2013/12/06/nic-co-polskie-polakom-na-litwie/ "Nic co polskie Polakom na Litwie"] ("Nothing Polish to be Returned to Poles in Lithuania"), ''[[Kurier Wilenski]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of emergency and conflict experiences ==
In sum, emergency and conflict may impact on [[Child development|children’s development]] in the following manner:
* Physical: exacerbation of medical problems, [[headache]]s, fatigue, unexplained physical complaints.
* Cognitive: trouble concentrating, preoccupation with the traumatic event, recurring [[dream]]s or [[nightmare]]s, questioning spiritual beliefs, inability to process the event.
* Emotional: [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or sadness, irritability, anger, resentfulness, despair, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, phobias, health concerns, [[anxiety]] or fearfulness.
* Social: increased conflicts with family and friends, sleep problems, crying, changes in appetite, social withdrawal, talking repeatedly about the traumatic event, refusal to go to school, repetitive play.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

=== Impact on pregnancy ===
Research shows that environmental factors and experiences can alter the [[genetic make-up]] of a developing child.&lt;ref name="Das, Hampton &amp; Jirtle 2009, p, 563"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Das |first=R. |last2=Hampton |first2=D. D. |last3=Jirtle |first3=R.L. |year=2009 |title=Imprinting evolution and human health |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=20 |number=10 |page= 563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to prolonged stress, environmental [[toxin]]s or nutritional deficits chemically alter genes in the [[foetus]] or young child and may shape the individual’s development temporarily or permanently.

=== Impact on child development ===
Children’s reactions to emergencies fluctuate depending on age, temperament, genetics, pre-existing problems, coping skills and cognitive competencies, and the dose of the emergency. Although most children are said to recover over time, if emergency reactions are left untreated, they can have a significant adverse impact on children’s social, emotional, behavioural and physical development.&lt;ref&gt;Zubenko, W. N. and Capozzoli, J. 2002. Children in Disasters: A Practical Guide to Healing and Recovery, New York, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyregrov, Gjestad &amp; Raundalen 2002, pp. 59-68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

==== Age 6 and younger  ====
In conflict-affected countries, the average mortality rate for children under 5 is more than double the rate in other countries. On the average, twelve children out of a hundred die before their  fth birthday, compared with six out of a hundred.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2011"&gt;{{cite web |author=UNESCO |year=2011 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001907/190743e.pdf |title=EFA Global Monitoring Report: The Hidden Crisis - Armed Conflict and Education |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common reactions among this age group are severe separation distress, crying, clinging, immobility and/or aimless motion, whimpering, screaming, sleeping and eating disorders, nightmares, fearfulness, regressive behaviours such as [[Thumb sucking|thumb-sucking]], [[Bed-Wetting|bed-wetting]], loss of bowel/bladder control, inability to dress or eat without assistance, and [[Fear of the dark|fear of darkness]], crowds and being left alone.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

During an investigation of the relationship between exposure to day raids and shelling and behavioural and emotional problems among Palestinian children, aged 3–6, in the [[Gaza Strip]], children demonstrated sleeping problems, poor concentration, attention-seeking behaviour, dependency, [[temper tantrums]] and increased fear.&lt;ref name="Thabet, Abed &amp; Vostanis 2002, pp. 1801-1804" /&gt; Mothers of Palestinian kindergarten children reported severely impaired psychosocial and emotional functioning in their children.&lt;ref&gt;Massad, S., Nieto, F. J., [[Mari Palta|Palta, M.]], Smith, M., Clark, R., Thabet, A., 2009. Mental health of Palestinian children in kindergartens: Resilience and vulnerability. ''Child and Adolescent Mental Health'', Vol. 14(2), pp. 89-96, {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-3588.2009.00528.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thabet et al.&lt;ref&gt;Thabet, A. A., Vostanis, P. and Karim, K. 2005. Group crisis intervention for children during ongoing war conflict. ''Psychiatry'', Vol.14, pp. 262-269.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the behavioural and emotional problems of 309 Palestinian [[Preschool|pre-schoolers]], and found that direct and indirect exposure to war trauma increased the risk of poor mental health. Zahr et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Zahr, L. K. 1996. Effects of war on the behavior of Lebanese pre-school children: The influence of home environment and family functioning. ''American Journal of Orthopsychiatry'', Vol. 66, pp. 401-408.&lt;/ref&gt; in a study on the effect of war on Lebanese pre-school children, found more problems in children aged 3–6 years exposed to heavy shelling over a 2-year period than in a control group living without this threat. According to Yaktine,&lt;ref&gt;Yaktine, U. 1978. Effect of war on Lebanese children: New trends in children’s culture. ''The Arabic Cultural Club'', 119-121. (Arabic language)&lt;/ref&gt; 40 mothers of different socio-economic backgrounds during the civil war in [[Beirut]] reported that their pre-school children became more anxious and fearful about bombardments and explosions. After [[SCUD missile|Scud missile]] attacks, displaced Israeli pre-school children demonstrated aggression, hyperactivity and oppositional behaviour and stress. This was compared with non-displaced children and, despite a continuous decrease in symptom severity, risk factors identified shortly after the [[Gulf War]] continued to exert their influence on children five years after the traumatic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Laor, N., Wolmer, L., Cohen, D. J. 2001. Mothers’ functioning and children’s symptoms 5 years after a SCUD missile attack. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', Vol. 158, No. 7, pp. 1020-1026.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

==== Ages 6 to 11 ====
Common symptoms in this age bracket include disturbing thoughts and images, nightmares, eating and sleeping disorders, noncompliance, irritability, extreme withdrawal, outbursts of anger and fighting, disruptive behaviour, inability to pay attention, irrational fears, regressive behaviour, depression and anxiety, feeling of guilt and emotional numbing, excessive clinging, headaches, [[nausea]] and visual or hearing problems. Traumatic events experienced before the age of 11 are three times more likely to result in serious emotional and behavioural difficulties than those experienced later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, G. S., Batterman-Faunce, J. M., Schaaf, J. M., and Kenney, R. 2002. Nearly 4 years after an event: Children’s eyewitness memory and adults’ perceptions of children’s accuracy. ''Child Abuse and Neglect'', Vol. 26(8), pp. 849-884.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Palestinian Counseling Centre, [[Save the Children International|Save the Children]], even six months after the demolition of their homes, young Palestinian children suffered from withdrawal, somatic complaints, depression/anxiety, unexplained pain, breathing problems, attention difficulties and violent behaviour. They were afraid to go to school, had problems relating to other children and greater attachment to caregivers. As a result, parents reported deterioration in educational achievement and ability to study.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt; Al-Amine and Liabre &lt;ref&gt;Al Amine, A. and Llabre, M. 2008. The psychological conditions of children and youth in Lebanon after July 2006 War. ''Lebanese Association for Educational Studies, Kuwait Society for the Advancement of Arab Children''.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that 27.7 per cent of Lebanese children aged between 6 and 12 suffered from symptoms of PTSD, as well as from problems sleeping, agitation, difficulties in concentrating and excessive awareness of events related to the 2006 [[2006 Lebanon War|Lebanese-Israeli war]]. Many children in Sudan and northern [[Uganda]] who were forced to witness family members being [[torture]]d and murdered&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; exhibited [[Stunted growth|stunting]], PTSD and other trauma-related disorders.&lt;ref name="Husain 2005, pp. 239-246" /&gt;

=== Disabilities ===
Children with [[Disability|disabilities]] are disproportionately affected by emergencies, and many become disabled during disasters. Children with disabilities may suffer due to loss of their assistive devices, loss of access to medicines or rehabilitative services and, in some cases, loss of their caregiver. In addition, disabled children tend to be more vulnerable to abuse and violence. [[UNICEF]] research indicates that violence against children with disabilities occurs at annual rates at least 1.7 times greater than their able-bodied peers.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, 2005. ''Violence against Children with Disabilities: UN Secretary General’s Study on Violence against Children''. New York, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; Young children with disabilities living in conflict are more vulnerable and the consequent physical, psychological or emotional problems are higher. They are also more likely to develop emotional and mental health problems during emergencies because of lack of mobility, treatment, and medication or through starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, S. and Medi, E. 1994. Community based support for disabled children in post-war Mozambique. ''Disasters'', Vol. 18, pp. 284-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inter-Agency Standing Committee]] (IASC) recognizes that children with pre-existing disabilities are more vulnerable to mistreatment, [[discrimination]], abuse and [[destitution]].&lt;ref name="IASC 2007"&gt;{{cite web |author=Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)|year=2007 |title=IASC Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/emergencies/guidelines_iasc_mental_health_psychosocial_june_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with mobility, visual and hearing disabilities or intellectual impairments may feel particularly vulnerable if an emergency leads to the relocation of school and the learning of new daily routines. During emergencies, long unsafe distances to school, the lack of buildings with adequate facilities and equipment and teachers with minimum qualifications, are likely to be overwhelming challenges for young children with disabilities to be enrolled in day care and [[Early childhood education|early education]].&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

=== Gender differences ===
Some research shows that girls exhibit higher levels of distress than boys in relation to stressful situations and are considered at higher risk in situations of war and terror.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt; Other research has found that girls express more worry,&lt;ref&gt;Lengua, L.

P. 1994. pp. 80-93"/&gt; while boys show more behavioural problems in the aftermath of a disaster.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt; However, pre-school girls exposed to [[earthquake]]s in [[Sultandağı|Sultandagi]] (Turkey) displayed more problematic behaviours than boys in the same educational category.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt; Additionally, Wiest, Mocellin, and Motsisi&lt;ref&gt;Wiest, R. D., Mocellin, J. and Thandiwe Motsisi, D. 1992. ''The Needs of Women and Children in Emergencies''. Winnipeg, University of Manitoba.&lt;/ref&gt; contend that young children, especially girls, may be vulnerable to [[sexual abuse]] and exploitation. Garbarino and Kostelny&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt; reported that Palestinian boys suffered more than girls from psychological problems when exposed to chronic conflict. In another study, Palestinian boys were more susceptible to effects of violence during early childhood and girls during [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt, L. A. and Fox, N. A. 1993. ''Psychological Effects of War and Violence on Children''. Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; In general it appears that boys take longer to recover, displaying more aggressive, antisocial and violent behaviour while girls may be more distressed but are more verbally expressive about their emotions.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

=== Educational consequences ===
In all conflict-affected countries, 21.5 million children of primary school age are out of school. Over the past decade, the problem of out-of- school children has been increasingly concentrated in conflict-affected countries, where the proportion increased from 29% in 2000 to 35% in 2014; in Northern Africa and Western Asia, it increased from 63% to 91%.&lt;ref&gt;One or more of the  preceding sentences incorporates text from the [[free content]] work {{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246045e.pdf|title=Creating sustainable futures for all; Global education monitoring report, 2016; Gender review|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality education alleviates the psychosocial impact of conflict and disasters by giving a sense of normalcy, stability, structure and hope for the future. However, emergency and conflict situations often undermine the quality of educational services. They result in shortages of materials, resources and personnel, thereby depriving young children of the opportunity to receive quality early education. In most conflicts, education infrastructure is usually a target. Pre-schools and schools are often destroyed or closed due to hazardous conditions depriving young children of the opportunity to learn and socialize in a safe place that provides a sense of routine.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=UNICEF |year=2009 |title=Children and Conflict in a Changing World: Machel Study 10-Year Strategic Review |location=New York |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obel, C. 2003. ''Epidemiological Studies of Stress during Pregnancy and Fetal Brain Development''. Arhus, Denmark, University of Aarhus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

Young children living under emergencies are less likely to be in primary school and more likely to drop out. Primary school completion in poorer conflict-affected countries is 65 per cent while it is 86 per cent in other poor countries.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2011" /&gt; According to the 2000 UNICEF MICS report, information from Iraq, for example, confirms the lack of Early Childhood Development programmes within the formal educational system. Only 3.7 per cent of children aged from 36 to 59 months were enrolled in nurseries or kindergartens. Low enrollment rates in early education programmes decrease the opportunity for young children to find a safe space where they flourish and release the stress and tension resulting from the emergency. In countries with ongoing emergencies, researchers have found a full range of symptoms that may be co-morbid with trauma, including [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], poor academic performance, behavioural problems, [[bullying]] and abuse, [[oppositional defiant disorder]], conduct disorder, phobic disorder and negative relationships (Terr, 1991; Streeck-Fischer and van der Kolk, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Terr, L. 1991. Childhood traumas: An outline and overview. ''American Journal of Psychiatry''. Vol.148, pp. 10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streeck-Fischer, A. and van der Kolk, B. A. 2009. Down will come baby, cradle and all: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of chronic trauma on child development.

A study using the Young Lives data in [[Ethiopia]] found that young children whose mothers had died were 20 per cent less likely to enroll in school, 21 per cent less likely to be able to write, and 27 per cent less likely to be able to read.&lt;ref&gt;Himaz, Rozana.2009. ''The Impact of Parental Death on Schooling and Subjective Well-being''. Young Lives Working Paper No. 44. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.younglives.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;. uk/pdf/publication-sectionpdfs/ working-paper pdfs/WP44_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dybdahl&lt;ref&gt;Dybdahl, R. 2001. Children and mothers in war: An outcome study of a psychosocial intervention program. ''Child Development''. Vol. 72 (4), pp. 1214-1230.&lt;/ref&gt; found that 5- to 6-year-old war-traumatized [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] children showed lower levels of cognitive competence. Pre-school and school age Palestinian children exposed to severe losses, wounding and home destruction suffered impaired cognitive capacity for attention and concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Qouta, S., Punamaki, R.L. and El Sarraj, E. 2005. Mother-child expression of psychological distress in acute war trauma. ''Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry'', 2005, Vol. 10, pp. 135-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Severe trauma has been found to be associated with in exible and narrowed attention and problem-solving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Quota, S., Punamäki, R. L., and El Sarraj, E. 2008. Child development and family mental health in war and military violence: the Palestinian experience. ''International Journal of Behavioral Development'', Vol. 32 (4), pp. 310-321.&lt;/ref&gt; Since both physical and mental health are linked to [[Language development|language]] and cognitive development,&lt;ref name="Engel, Berkowitz, Wold &amp; Yehuda 2005, pp. 334-341" /&gt; it is reasonable to assume that violent conflict has a negative effect on these areas of development.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

== Supporting young children during emergency and conflict situations ==
Early childhood care and education (ECCE) is a multisectoral field that holistically addresses children’s multiple needs. During emergencies ECCE supportive services may address a range of issues including [[prenatal care]], [[immunization]], nutrition, education, psychosocial support and community engagement. Coordinated services of health and nutrition, [[Water, Sanitation and Hygiene|water sanitation and hygiene]], early learning, mental health and protection are considered essential in supporting young children living under emergencies and conflicts.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

Many programmes and strategies, whether in the formal or [[Non formal education|non-formal education]] sector, have proved to be very supportive to the well-being and recovery of young children living in areas of conflict. [[Child Friendly Spaces]] (CFS) programmes have been found valuable in creating a sense of normality and providing coping skills and resilience to children affected by emergencies.&lt;ref name="CCF 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Christian Children’s Fund |year=2008 |title=Child-Centred Spaces Manual |location=Richmond |publisher=Christian Children’s Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IASC 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) |year=2004 |title=INEE Minimum Standards for Education in Emergencies, Chronic Crises and Early Reconstruction |location=Paris |publisher=INEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child Friendly Spaces help children develop social skills and competencies such as sharing and cooperation through interaction with other children. They also offer opportunities to learn about risks in their environment and build life skills, such as [[literacy]] and non-violent conflict resolution, and provide a useful means of mobilizing communities around children’s needs. In an effort to strengthen community systems of [[child protection]], [[Christian Children's Fund]] (CCF)&lt;ref name="CCF 2008" /&gt; established three centres for internally displaced young children in Unyama (Uganda) camp that provided a safe, adult-supervised place for young children between 3 and 6 years of age. [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] established six ‘safe spaces’ in schools in northern Lebanon for displaced [[Syrians|Syrian]] children where counsellors used [[Art therapy|art]] and [[music therapy]] to help young children express their emotions in a healthy way.&lt;ref name="Marope &amp; Kaga 2015, pp. 118–125" /&gt;

Several studies show that children who have participated in quality education programmes within schools tend to have better knowledge of hazards, reduced levels of fear and more realistic risk perceptions than their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn, D. 2010. ''Early Childhood Development Centre Curriculum Guide for Plan Indonesia''.&lt;/ref&gt; In such contexts, psychosocial intervention programmes for young children and their families are considered to be vital. Interventions such as [[storytelling]], [[singing]], [[jumping rope]], role-play activities, team sports and writing and drawing exercises helped to reduce psychological distress associated with exposure to conflict-related violence in [[Sierra Leone]] for children aged 8 to 18.&lt;ref name="Gupta &amp; Zimmer 2008, pp. 212-216"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gupta |first=L. |last2=Zimmer |first2=C. |year=2008 |title=Psychosocial intervention for war affected children in Sierra Leone |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=192 |number=3 |pages=212-216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in [[Eritrea]] and Sierra Leone revealed that children’s psychosocial well-being was improved by well-designed educational interventions.&lt;ref name="Gupta &amp; Zimmer 2008, pp. 212-216" /&gt; In [[Afghanistan]], young children and adolescents gained a sense of stability and security after their involvement in constructive activities (e.g. art, narrative, sports) which took place in neutral safe places within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, A. and Flisher, A. 2009.

Historian Niall Ferguson and economist Moritz Schularick first coined the term in late 2006, arguing that [[global savings glut|saving]] by the Chinese and overspending by Americans led to an incredible period of wealth creation that contributed to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5424112/The-trillion-dollar-question-China-or-America.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Niall |last=Ferguson |title=The trillion dollar question: China or America? |date=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, China accumulated large [[currency reserves]] and channeled them into US [[government securities]], which kept nominal and real long-term [[interest rates]] artificially low in the United States. Ferguson describes Chimerica as one economy which "accounts for around 13 percent of the world's [[land surface]], a quarter of its [[population]], about a third of its [[gross domestic product]], and somewhere over half of the global [[economic growth]] of the past six years."&lt;ref name="American interest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=533 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721015335/http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=533 |archivedate=2009-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests Chimerica could end if China were to decouple from the United States bringing with it a shift in [[global power]] and allowing China "to explore other spheres of global influence, from the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]], of which Russia is also a member, to its own informal nascent empire in commodity-rich Africa."&lt;ref name="American interest" /&gt;

The accumulation of American debt, which has been estimated at over $800 billion, suggests the two nations are intrinsically linked; the economic symbiosis prevalent between the two suggests that separation would harm both countries and be disastrous for the global economy.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Another way to measure this integration is the trade deficit. The US trade deficit with China was $295 billion in 2011, meaning the US imported that much more goods and services from China than it exported to China. The [[Economic Policy Institute]] estimated that from 2001–2011, 2.7 million US jobs were lost to China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/23/us-usa-china-trade-idUSBRE87M0T420120823 "U.S. trade gap with China cost 2.7 million jobs"], Reuters, August 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

The idea of Chimerica features prominently in Ferguson's 2008 book and adapted television documentary ''[[The Ascent of Money]]'', which reviews the history of money, credit, and banking.

The concept of Chimerica supplements and/or supplants ''[[Nichibei]]'', or the similarly constructed Japan-U.S. economic model and relationship that had been prominent in years before the development of Chimerica.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36109">This is a chronicle of important events that took place under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1636–1912) in what is now [[China]]. It spans from the death of his predecessor [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626–1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi [[Chinese era name|reign period]]. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644—on [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]] of the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar year]] following the emperor's accession—and ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one [[solar year]] after the emperor's death. The posthumous events related to the Shunzhi Emperor's burial and posthumous cult are also included.

*'''September 21''': [[Hong Taiji]] dies after a successful seventeen-year reign during which the [[Qing]] became a major power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde 崇德 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''September 26''': a [[Deliberative Council]] of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, [[Hong Taiji]]'s ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother [[Dorgon]] and [[Jirgalang]] will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]) and those who supported Dorgon.
*'''October 8''': at the age of six ''sui'', [[Fulin]] officially becomes [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|1943|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''April 5''': Seeing the progress of rebel armies in north China, the Chongzhen Emperor issues a call for the immediate help of any military commandant in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=641}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''April 24''': Li Zicheng enters [[Beijing]], the capital of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]].
*'''April 25''': the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] commits suicide on a hill behind the [[Forbidden City]].
*'''April 26''': [[Wu Sangui]], a powerful Ming general, moves his army through [[Shanhai Pass]] (at the eastern end of the [[Great Wall]]) and marches toward Beijing in response to the emperor's distress call. When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's departure from the fortified city of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], where [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ming armies had defeated]] Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control.
*'''April 29''': the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main [[Grand Secretary]] [[Niu Jinxing]] (牛金星), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government. The remaining literati are given over to Shun generals for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=277–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 5''': Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 10''': Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (永平) on the road to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"/&gt;
*'''May 13''': words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''May 18''': After the defeat of two of his armies a few days earlier, Li Zicheng decides to take Shanhai Pass himself: he leaves Beijing with an army of 60,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}, note 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 20''': two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the [[Liao River]] carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for "great profits" (大利).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=297}} (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300–1 (content of the letter).&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 25''': By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 26''': having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt;
*'''May 27''': [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]]. At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt; The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"/&gt; The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 28''': Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}, note 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 31''': Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''June 4''': after 42 days in Beijing, Li Zicheng sets the imperial palaces on fire and abandons the capital to flee toward the west.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"/&gt; The Beijing population massacres rebels who had not fled; nearly two thousand are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 5''': led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=314–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 7''': Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See June 25.)
*'''June 25''': because peasant rebellions quickly erupted around the capital in reaction to the haircutting order of June 7, Dorgon issues an edict saying that people will be allowed to arrange their hair the way they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 420–422. {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=84}} gives the date as June 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6883">'''Conspiracy against the United States''', or '''conspiracy to defraud the United States''',&lt;ref name="USAM"&gt;§ 923, [https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-923-18-usc-371-conspiracy-defraud-us 18 U.S.C. § 371—Conspiracy to Defraud the United States], [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s ''[[United States Attorneys' Manual]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[federal offense]] in the [[United States of America]] under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|371}}. The crime is that of two or more persons who [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspire]] to commit an offense against the United States, or to [[Fraud|defraud]] the United States.

==Statute==
{{UnitedStatesCode|18|371}} provides that:

{{quote|If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|18|371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History and interpretation==
In the 1924 case ''[[Hammerschmidt v.

'''Crocodile cracking''', also called alligator cracking and perhaps misleadingly fatigue cracking, is a common type of distress in [[asphalt]] [[road surface|pavement]]. The following is more closely related to fatigue cracking which is characterized by interconnecting or interlaced cracking in the asphalt layer resembling the hide of a [[crocodile]].&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; Cell sizes can vary in size up to {{convert|11.80|in|mm}} across, but are typically less than {{convert|5.90|in|mm}} across. Fatigue cracking is generally a loading failure,&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; but numerous factors can contribute to it. It is often a sign of sub-base failure, poor [[drainage]], or repeated over-loadings. It is important to prevent fatigue cracking, and repair as soon as possible, as advanced cases can be very costly to repair and can lead to  formation of [[pothole]]s or premature pavement failure.

It is usually studied under the [[transportation]] section of [[civil engineering]]. 

==Causes==

Fatigue cracking is an asphalt pavement distress most often instigated by failure of the surface due to traffic loading. However, fatigue cracking can be greatly influenced by environmental and other effects while traffic loading remains the direct cause. Frequently, overloading happens because the base or subbase inadequately support the surface layer and subsequently cannot handle loads that it would normally endure.&lt;ref name="PASER"&gt;[http://www.apa-mi.org/docs/Asphalt-PASERManual.pdf PASER Asphalt Pavement Manual], Asphalt Pavement Alliance of Michigan, date accessed: June 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways that the subbase or base can be weakened.

Poor drainage in the road bed is a frequent cause of this degradation of the base or subgrade.&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; A heavy spring thaw, similarly to poor drainage, can weaken the base course, leading to fatigue cracking.&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; 

''Stripping'' or ''raveling'' is another possible cause of fatigue cracking. Stripping occurs when poor adhesion between asphalt and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] allows the aggregate at the surface to dislodge. If left uncorrected, this reduces the thickness of the pavement, reducing the affected portion's ability to carry its designed loading.&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; This can cause fatigue cracking to develop rapidly, as overloading will happen with loads of less magnitude or frequency.

'''Edge cracking''' is the formation of crescent-shaped cracks near the edge of a road.&lt;ref name="LTPP"&gt;Distress Identification Manual for the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program, FHWA, JUNE 2003, 
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/infrastructure/pavements/ltpp/reports/03031/03031.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by lack of support of the road edge, sometimes due to poorly drained or weak shoulders. If left untreated, additional cracks will form until it resembles fatigue cracking.&lt;ref name="LTPP" /&gt; Like wheel-path fatigue cracking, poor drainage is a main cause of edge cracking, as it weakens the base, which hastens the deterioration of the pavement.&lt;ref name="ncdot" /&gt; Water [[ponding]] (a buildup of water which can also be called puddling) happens more frequently near the edge than in the center of the road path, as roads are usually sloped to prevent in-lane ponding. This leads to excess moisture in the shoulders and subbase at the road edge. Edge cracking differs from fatigue cracking in that the cracks form from the top down, where fatigue cracks usually start at the bottom and propagate to the surface.

==Development==

Fatigue cracking manifests itself initially as longitudinal cracking (cracks along the direction of the flow of traffic) in the top layer of the asphalt.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;[http://training.ce.washington.edu/WSDOT/Modules/09_pavement_evaluation/09-7_body.htm Alligator Cracking], Advanced Transportation Technology West Valley College, date accessed: November 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These cracks are initially thin and sparsely distributed. If further deterioration is allowed, these longitudinal cracks are connected by transverse cracks to form sharp sided, prismatic pieces. This interlaced cracking pattern resembles the scales on the back of a crocodile or alligator, hence the nickname, crocodile cracking. 

More severe cases involve pumping of fines, [[spalling]], and loose pieces of pavement. The most severe cases of fatigue cracking often occur with other pavement distresses, but are exemplified by: potholes,&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive"&gt;[http://www.pavementinteractive.org/category/Flexible-Pavement-Distress/ Flexible Pavement Distresses], Pavement Interactive, date accessed: June 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; large cracks(3/8" or larger), and severely spalled edges.&lt;ref name="ncdot"&gt;[http://www.ncdot.org/doh/pmu/PavementInfo/pcsman/alligtor.html Alligator Cracking], North Carolina Department of Transportation Pavement Management Unit, date accessed: November 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and quantification==

There are many different ways to measure fatigue cracking, but in general a pavement distress manual or index will be used. For example, the [[Pavement Condition Index]] is widely used to quantify the overall level of distress and condition of a section of road. Measurement of fatigue cracking specifically (and pavement distress in general) is necessary to determine the overall condition of a road, and for determination of a time-line for rehabilitation and/or repair. There are many other rating systems, and many rating systems currently in use are based on the [[AASHO Road Test]].

There are two important criteria to take into account when measuring fatigue cracking. The first is the [[wikt:extent|extent]] of the cracking. This is the amount of road surface area which is affected by this pavement distress. The second criterion is the [[:wikt:severity|severity]] of the cracking.&lt;ref name= Municipal&gt;[http://lgam.wikidot.com/crocodile-cracking Crocodile Cracking], Local Government &amp; Municipal Knowledge Base, accessed December 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Severity, which has been discussed above, refers to how far the cracking has progressed, and is often directly a function of crack width.&lt;ref name= Municipal /&gt; Severity may be rated  numerically, or given a rating from "low" to "severe". The rating may be entered into a [[pavement management system]], which will suggest a priority and method for the repair.

Systems have been developed that detect fatigue cracking and other types of pavement distress automatically.&lt;ref name="abstract"&gt;[http://www.engineeringvillage2.org/controller/servlet/Controller?SEARCHID=57828d12ca5c2fd8e2ae1prod2data1&amp;CID=quickSearchAbstractFormat&amp;DOCINDEX=3&amp;database=1&amp;format=quickSearchAbstractFormat Automated detection and classification of cracking in road pavements], Australian Road Research Board LLT, date accessed: December 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They measure the severity and frequency of alligator cracking on the road-path. One such machine is the road surface [[profilometer]], which is mounted on a vehicle and measures the profile of the road surface while it is moving down the roadway.

==Prevention and repair==

Preventing fatigue cracking can be as simple as preventing the common causes. For example, reducing overloading on an asphalt pavement or improving drainage&lt;ref name=PASER /&gt; can prevent fatigue cracking in many cases. Prevention primarily depends on  designing and constructing the pavement and subbase to support the expected traffic loads, and providing good drainage to keep water out of the subbase. 

A good strategy to prevent overloading, which is a main cause of fatigue cracking, is to increase the depth of the asphalt layer. According to certain researchers, pavements that exceed a certain minimum strength or thickness can hypothetically handle infinitely many loads without showing structural defects, including fatigue cracking.&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; These pavements are called perpetual pavements or long-term performance pavements (LTPP).

When repairing pavement affected by fatigue cracking, the main cause of the distress should be determined.  However, often the specific cause is fairly difficult to determine, and prevention is therefore correspondingly difficult. Any investigation should involve digging a pit or [[core sample|coring]] the pavement and subbase to determine the pavement's structural makeup as well as determining whether or not subsurface moisture is a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="PavementInteractive" /&gt; The repair needed also differs based on the severity and extent of the cracking.

In the early stages, sealing cracks with crack sealant limits further deterioration of the subgrade due to moisture penetration. Small areas may be repaired by removal of the affected area, and replacement with new base and asphalt surface.&lt;ref name=PASER /&gt; Once the damage has progressed or the affected area is large and extensive, a structural asphalt overlay or complete reconstruction is necessary to ensure structural integrity. Proper repair may include first sealing cracks with crack sealant, installing paving fabric over a tack coat, or milling the damaged asphalt. An overlay of hot mix asphalt is then placed over the completed repair. &lt;ref name=PASER /&gt;

'''Crony capitalism''' is an [[economy]] in which [[business]]es thrive not as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the [[political class]]. This is done using state power to crush genuine competition in handing out permits, government grants, special [[tax break]]s, or other forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/publications/policy-magazine/article/2877-feature-crony-capitalism-and-the-east-asian-currency-and-financial-crises|author=Helen Hughes|volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Spring 1999|title=Crony Capitalism and the East Asian Currency and Financial 'Crises'|magazine=Policy|quote=Japan’s dismal performance in the 1990s and the East Asian collapses of 1997 indicate that [[dirigisme]] can only boost economies in the short run and at high cost.

Money is then made not merely by making a profit  in the market, but through profiteering by "rent seeking" using this monopoly or oligopoly. Entrepreneurship and innovative practices, which seek to reward risk are stifled, since the value-added is little by crony businesses as hardly anything of significant value is created by them, with transactions taking the form of "trading". Crony capitalism spills over into the government, the politics and the media,&lt;ref name="The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism, 1981"&gt;''The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism'', by McCormick, Richard. 1981. The American Historical Review, Vol. 86, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 247–74.&lt;/ref&gt; when this nexus distorts the economy and affects society to an extent it corrupts [[public good|public-serving]] economic, political and social ideals.

The term "crony capitalism" made a significant impact in the public as an explanation of the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crony Capitalism: Corruption and Development in South Korea and the Philippines |first=David C. |last=Kang |year=2002 |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/2001025806.pdf |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-00408-4
|quote=Focused only on explaining successful outcomes, the conventional model provided no analytic way to explain the 1997 crisis. Countries previously regarded as miracles now were nothing more than havens for crony capitalists (p. 3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to describe governmental decisions favoring "cronies" of governmental officials. In this context, the term is often used comparatively with [[corporate welfare]], a technical term often used to assess government bailouts and favoritistic monetary policy, as opposed to the economic theory, described by "crony capitalism". The extent of difference between these terms is whether a government action can be said to benefit the individuals rather than the industry.

==In practice==
Crony capitalism exists along a continuum.  In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of [[collusion]] among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front (sometimes called a trade association or [[industry trade group]]) to the government in requesting subsidies or aid or regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/uber-vs-washington-dc-this-is-insane/259614/|title=Uber vs. Washington, D.C.: This Is Insane|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012|quote=a fight over a new competitor to the District's (often horrible) taxi service offers something I haven't seen in a while. Not routine retail-level corruption, nor skillful top-level favor trading, but instead what appears to be a blatant attempt to legislate favors for one set of interests by hamstringing another.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomers to a market then need to surmount significant "barriers to entry"  for instance, in seeking loans, acquire shelf space, or receive official sanction. Some such systems are very formalized, such as sports leagues and the Medallion System of the [[taxicabs of New York City]], but often the process is more subtle, such as expanding training and certification exams to make it more expensive for new entrants to enter a market and thereby limit competition. In technological fields, there may evolve a system whereby new entrants may be accused of infringing on [[patent]]s that the established competitors never assert against each other. In spite of this, some competitors may succeed when the legal [[Barriers to entry|barriers]] are light. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The term crony capitalism is generally used when these practices come to dominate the economy as a whole or to dominate the most valuable industries in an economy.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt; Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business; in practice, they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. Troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have the laws suddenly enforced against them, leading to fines or even jail time. Even in high-income democracies with well-established legal systems and freedom of the press in place, a larger state is associated with more political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''crony capitalism'' was initially applied to states involved in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] such as [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]]. In these cases, the term was used to point out how family members of the ruling leaders become extremely wealthy with no non-political justification.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Southeast Asian nations still score very poorly in rankings measuring this.

=== Crony capitalism index ===
''[[The Economist]]'' benchmarks countries based on a "[[crony-capitalism index]]" calculated via how much economic activity occurs in industries prone to cronyism.

Crony capitalism in finance was found in the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  It was a private company, but its largest stockholder was the federal government which owned 20%.   It was an early bank regulator and grew to be one being the most powerful organizations in the country due largely to being the depository of the government's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] in 1999 completely removed [[Glass-Steagall]]’s separation between commercial banks and investment banks.  After this repeal, commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies combined their [[lobbying]] efforts.

==In sections of an economy==
{{POV section|date=November 2012}}
More direct government involvement in a specific sector can also lead to specific areas of crony capitalism, even if the economy as a whole may be competitive. This is most common in natural resource sectors through the granting of mining or drilling concessions, but it is also possible through a process known as [[regulatory capture]] where the government agencies in charge of regulating an industry come to be controlled by that industry. Governments will often, in good faith, establish [[regulatory agency|government agencies to regulate an industry]]. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of that regulatory body, while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected. As a result, it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the "watchdog" and to use it against competitors. This typically takes the form of making it very expensive for a new entrant to enter the market. An [[Gibbons v. Ogden#Background|1824 landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling]] overturned a New York State-granted monopoly ("a veritable model of state munificence" facilitated by one of the [[Founding Fathers]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]]) for the then-revolutionary technology of [[North River Steamboat|steamboats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=T.J. |last=Styles |title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]|ISBN=978-0-375-41542-5|quote=Property requirements for suffrage under New York's constitution of 1777 hardened the culture of rank into law.

[this [[suffrage]] scheme fostered] [[mercantilism]], which in the state empowered private parties to carry out activities thought to serve the public interest. The standard reward for such an undertaking was a [[monopoly]]—just what Chancellor Livingston sought when he offered to meet a most pressing public need, the need for steamboats...Livingston maneuvered...the monopoly through the legislature ("a veritable model of state munificence," as legal scholar Maurice G. Baxter writes—that gave him the right to seize steamboats the entered New York waters from other states. But Livingston had overreached. With so many inventors and investors interested in the steamboat, the monopoly on served to limit its adoption.  The new technology was simply too important for the monopoly to remain unchallenged. [pp. 39–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging the Supreme Court's establishment of Congressional supremacy over commerce, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] was established in 1887 with the intent of regulating railroad "[[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]".  President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed [[Thomas M. Cooley]], a railroad ally, as its first chairman and a permit system was used to deny access to new entrants and legalize [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Lee |title=Entangling the Web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03lee.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense industry in the United States is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry. Connections with [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] and lobbyists in Washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition, due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts. In the [[Transatlantic relations#Boeing and Airbus subsidies|Airbus-Boeing WTO dispute]], Airbus (which receives outright [[subsidy|subsidies]] from European governments) has stated Boeing receives similar subsidies, which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Boeing Out of a Tailspin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862121_mz029.htm |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |quote=A national treasure, once No. 1 in commercial aviation, Boeing has become a risk-averse company stumbling to compete in the marketplace and dependent on political connections and chicanery to get government contracts.

Gerald P. O'Driscoll, former vice president at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], stated that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] became examples of crony capitalism. Government backing let Fannie and Freddie dominate [[mortgage underwriting]]. "The politicians created the mortgage giants, which then returned some of the profits to the pols—sometimes directly, as campaign funds; sometimes as "contributions" to favored constituents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |work=New York Post |title=Fannie/Freddie Bailout Baloney |first=Gerald P. |last=O'Driscoll Jr |date=September 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913195535/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In developing economies==
In its worst form, crony capitalism can devolve into simple [[Political corruption|corruption]], where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with. Bribes to government officials are considered ''de rigueur'' and [[tax evasion]] is common; this is seen in many parts of Africa, for instance.  This is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).

Corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others. This may also be done with, religious, or ethnic favoritism; for instance, [[Alawites]] in [[Syria]] have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there. ([[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] is an Alawite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01makhlouf.html Syrian Businessman Becomes Magnet for Anger and Dissent] "Like Mr. Ezz in Egypt, he has become a symbol of how economic reforms turned crony socialism into crony capitalism, making the poor poorer and the connected rich fantastically wealthier."&lt;/ref&gt;) This can be explained by considering personal relationships as a [[social network]]. As government and business leaders try to accomplish various things, they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors. These people form hubs in the network. In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.

Normally, this will be untenable to maintain in business; new entrants will affect the market. However, if business and government are entwined, then the government can maintain the small-hub network.

[[Raymond Vernon]], specialist in economics and international affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url         = http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|title       = Raymond Vernon Dies at 85|date        = September 23, 1999|work        = The Harvard University Gazette|publisher   = President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate  = February 9, 2013|deadurl     = yes|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503203741/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|archivedate = May 3, 2012|df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote that the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain]], because they were the first to successfully limit the power of veto groups (typically cronies of those with power in government) to block innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  "Unlike most other national environments, the British environment of the early 19th century contained relatively few threats to those who improved and applied existing inventions, whether from business competitors, labor, or the government itself.  In other European countries, by contrast, the merchant guilds ... were a pervasive source of veto for many centuries.  This power was typically bestowed upon them by government".  For example, a Russian inventor produced a steam engine in 1766 and disappeared without a trace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  "[A] steam powered horseless carriage produced in France in 1769 was officially suppressed."  [[James Watt]] began experimenting with steam in 1763, got a patent in 1769, and began commercial production in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989, p. 8);  see also [[Watt steam engine]] and [[James Watt#Patents|James Watt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raghuram Rajan]], former governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], has said "One of the greatest dangers to the growth of developing countries is the [[middle income trap]], where crony capitalism creates oligarchies that slow down growth.

==Political viewpoints==
{{misleading|date=May 2016}}
While the problem is generally accepted across the political spectrum, ideology shades the view of the problem's causes and therefore its solutions. Political views mostly fall into two camps which might be called the socialist and capitalist critique. The socialist position is that broadly democratic government must regulate economic, or wealthy, interests in order to restrict monopoly. The capitalist position is that "[[natural monopolies]]" are rare, therefore governmental regulations generally abet established wealthy interests by restricting competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083819/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |archivedate=2015-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist critique===
Critics of crony capitalism including [[socialism|socialists]] and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]] often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of ''any'' strictly capitalist system. [[Jane Jacobs]] described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[trade]], while [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that the word "crony" is superfluous when describing capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081114.htm "Black Faces in Limousines:" A Conversation with Noam Chomsky] from Chomsky.info accessed on June 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since businesses make money and money leads to political power, business will inevitably use their power to influence governments. Much of the impetus behind [[campaign finance reform in the United States]] and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power.

[[Ravi Batra]] argues that "all official economic measures adopted since 1981...have devastated the middle class" and that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement should push for their repeal and thus end the influence of the super wealthy in the political process, which he considers a manifestation of crony capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474 |title=The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism |first=Ravi |last=Batra |publisher=[[Truthout]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist economists, such as [[Robin Hahnel]], have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Review |url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/bpn/znet/april08.txt |author=[[Robin Hahnel]] |quote=IMF officials Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer were quick to explain that the afflicted economies had only themselves to blame. Crony capitalism, lack of transparency, accounting procedures not up to international standards, and weak-kneed politicians too quick to spend and too afraid to tax were the problems according to IMF and US Treasury Department officials. The fact that the afflicted economies had been held up as paragons of virtue and IMF/World Bank success stories only a year before, the fact that neoliberalism’s only success story had been the Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC's) who were now in the tank, and the fact that the IMF and Treasury department story just didn’t fit the facts since the afflicted economies were no more rife with crony capitalism, lack of transparency, and weak-willed politicians than dozens of other economies untouched by the Asian financial crisis, simply did not matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist economists dismiss the term as an [[apologetic]] for failures of [[neoliberal]] policy and, more fundamentally, their perception of the weaknesses of market allocation.

The '''Croswell Opera House''' is a historic [[theatre|theater]] located at 129 East Maumee Street in [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]], [[Michigan]].  It is recognized as the oldest theater in the state and among the oldest continuously operating theaters in the United States. The theater was designated as a [[Michigan State Historic Preservation Office|Michigan Historic Site]] on March 2, 1976 and later added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Adrian Union Hall-Croswell Opera House''' on April 18, 1985.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCGI/&gt;

==History==

=== Early history ===
The Croswell Opera House, or Adrian Union Hall as it was originally called, was completed in 1866. It was financed by the Adrian Union Hall Company, whose stockholders included future Michigan governor [[Charles Croswell]]. Its first public event, taking place on March 19, was a lecture by temperance advocate [[John Bartholomew Gough]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behind the Curtain: 150 Years at Michigan's Oldest Theater|last=Gable|first=Erik|publisher=Croswell Opera House and Fine Arts Association|year=2016|isbn=978-0-692-80582-4|location=Adrian, Michigan|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unpublished diary|last=Cleveland|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1866|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall served many functions during its early years. It hosted concerts, lectures, festivals, and theatrical performances by both traveling troupes and amateur local groups. Famous speakers who visited the opera house included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Thomas Nast]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. During the 19th century it hosted performances by [[Edwin Booth]], [[John Philip Sousa]], and [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]]; the early 20th century saw appearances by [[Mrs Patrick Campbell|Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] and [[Maude Adams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Croswell has gone by many different names. During its first few years of operation, the local newspaper usually referred to it as "New Hall." Around 1869, it started to be called the Opera House. When Charles Croswell retired as governor in 1881, he returned to Adrian and began buying up shares in the Adrian Union Hall Company, eventually becoming the majority shareholder; he then tasked his son, Charles Croswell Jr., with managing the theater. At this time it became known as Croswell's Opera House. Charles Croswell Jr. gave up the manager's job after his father's death in 1886, but although the possessive was dropped, the name stuck.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A new lobby was added to the original building in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tea-Table Talk|last=|first=|date=September 29, 1882|work=Adrian Daily Times and Expositor|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, the theater's first electric lights were installed — just two of them — and the entire theater was outfitted for electricity in 1895. The lighting apparatus was designed by Harry A. Fee, who is better known for creating [[Hidden Lake Gardens]] in nearby Franklin Township.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Electrical effects utilized in lighting Adrian's opera house|last=|first=|date=August 20, 1895|work=Adrian Daily Times and Expositor|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, to meet the demands of that era's increasingly elaborate theatrical productions, the stage was expanded and the roof above the stage raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Up-to-date improvements in the stage of Croswell Opera House|last=|first=|date=July 25, 1896|work=Adrian Daily Times and Expositor|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The movie theater years ===
In the early 20th century, the Croswell faced increasing competition from movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Croswell Opera House in Adrian, Michigan, 1900-1920|last=Kiersey|first=Stephen Francis|publisher=Michigan State University|year=1977|isbn=|location=East Lansing, Michigan|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased in 1919 by Harry Angell and Robert Codd, who undertook two major renovations. The first, in 1919, converted the Croswell into a movie house. A long arcade-style lobby was added to the front of the building, as was a projection booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Croswell Theater to re-open December 24|last=|first=|date=December 20, 1919|work=Adrian Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1921, the original balcony was torn out and replaced and the entire auditorium remodeled. It was during this renovation that the Croswell's interior took on its modern appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Big crowd attends Croswell opening|last=|first=|date=September 2, 1921|work=Adrian Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croswell was leased in 1927 by Butterfield Theatres, which would continue to operate it for the next 40 years. It was wired for sound in 1929; the first talking picture shown was ''[[Weary River]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During World War II, the Croswell raised more than $1 million for the war effort by holding "war bond premieres." The management would bring in a popular new film, and tickets were not for sale; only a newly purchased war bond would entitle a person to admission. Charity toy drives and children's food matinees were also common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Movies by TV? It irks him|last=|first=|date=February 7, 1967|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, however, the Croswell faced increasing competition from drive-in theaters and television. A theater with about 1,000 seats — the Croswell's capacity at the time — but only one screen was impractical to operate. In March 1967, the Butterfield chain announced it would not renew its lease, and owner Harry Angell put the building up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Croswell for sale|last=|first=|date=March 23, 1967|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last movie of the Butterfield era, ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', closed on September 16, 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Revival of live theater ===
With Butterfield's decision to pull out, the Croswell was in danger of being demolished. But Charlie Hickman, the owner of local manufacturing company Brazeway, stepped forward to buy the building, and a new nonprofit organization was chartered to take over its operation. The newly revived Croswell staged its first summer season of live theater in 1968, beginning with a production of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]''. This was followed by ''[[Summer and Smoke]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Once More, with Feeling (play)|Once More, With Feeling]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

That fall, a new group, the Croswell Players, was formed to continue offering theater during the fall, winter and spring. Eventually, the Croswell's summer and winter theater programs would merge.

In 1970, the tradition of bringing high-profile speakers to Adrian to speak at the Croswell was revived. Speakers in the theater's Town Hall series, which ran from 1970 to 1996, included [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Helen Thomas]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Jeane Dixon]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Kitty Carlisle]], [[Charlton Heston]], and "Dear Abby" author [[Pauline Phillips]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A capital campaign to renovate the theater was announced in May 2015, with changes to include new public spaces, more restrooms, Americans with Disabilities Act improvements, and electrical and other infrastructure upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lenconnect.com/article/20150612/ENTERTAINMENT/150619649|title=Croswell Opera House planning renovations, sets $6.2 million fundraising goal|last=Bachanov|first=Arlene|date=June 12, 2015|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 2016 and the theater reopened in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lenconnect.com/news/20170507/renovated-croswell-opera-house-reopens|title=Renovated Croswell Opera House reopens|last=Bachanov|first=Arlene|date=May 7, 2017|work=The Daily Telegram|access-date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 season will mark the Croswell's 50th summer as a producing theater.

== Architecture ==
The Croswell was originally designed by [[Horatio Nelson White]]. In 1865, while the theater was still under construction, a correspondent for the [[Detroit Free Press]] visited Adrian and gave this description:&lt;blockquote&gt;During this season, notwithstanding the high wages, cost of lumber and all building materials, there have been many fine buildings, dwellinghouses and stores erected. The first one particularly attracting attention on entering the city from the depot is “Union Hall,” a large brick structure erected and owned by a joint-stock company at a cost of $35,000. This building is located on the lower end of Maumee street, and fronts directly on it. It is one hundred and fifteen feet and ten inches deep, by sixty-four feet and four inches wide, and built of such a height that the main hall will finish thirty-two feet in the clear. The principal audience room is at some little distance from the street, and is reached through an arched passage-way, on each side of which is an elegant and commodious store. It is eighty feet in depth and sixty-three feet wide, with a gallery on three sides containing three rows of seats, calculated to seat with comfort fifteen hundred people. In the erection of the gallery a new feature is introduced, which, by means of trusses, braces and iron ties, makes it self-supporting, and entirely does away with the necessity of columns or ungainly brackets to support it. There is a large stage, 30x32 feet, which is fitted up for theatrical exhibitions, with scenery, dressing-rooms, &amp;c. In the arrangement of the scenery, some new ideas are carried out, several of the side scenes folding up, while the principal fines, five in number, are suspended from large cylinders overhead, being hoisted and lowered by means of machinery, completely doing away with the squeaking, rattling and confusion generally attendant upon the shifting and sliding of the different pieces, and as a whole scene is raised or lowered at once, the ridiculous gap often seen in the center of an elegant painting is obviated. In the basement are the furnaces for heating the building, a large storeroom capable of containing all the seats of the hall, when it is cleared for the benefit of those tripping the “light fantastic toe,” and a large dining room, which extends the entire length of the building. The ceiling and walls are to be frescoed, and if finished according to design, will present an elegant and tasteful appearance, reflecting much credit on the designers and owners, and the city. In the erection of the structure there is no attempt at the gaudy or gorgeous, everything in and about it is plain, sold ''[sic.]'' and substantial. It was designed by H. N. White, of Syracuse, New York, and erected under the supervision of Mr. Smith, a master-builder of this city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Detroit Free Press|last=|first=|date=October 11, 1865|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Writing some time later, local historian R.I. Bonner reported that the Croswell was patterned after Wieting Hall in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Geo. Bonner and Croswell Opera House|last=Bonner|first=R.I.|date=January 12, 1918|work=Adrian Daily Telegram|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical appearance of the Croswell changed several times over the course of the 19th century. A 14-foot addition was built on the front of the theater in 1882, and the stage roof was raised in 1896 to accommodate more elaborate scenery.

The 1919 and 1921 renovations were directed by architect J.C. Brompton, who also designed the Riviera Theatre in [[Three Rivers, Michigan|Three Rivers]]. In 1919, a projection booth was built onto the front of the building and a long arcade-style lobby was added; previously, patrons had to walk down a long alley from Maumee Street and wait outdoors before a show. In 1921, the original horseshoe-shaped balcony was torn out and replaced and the entire interior of the theater was redesigned.

Some of the theater's distinctive features include ornate plaster detailing around the entire auditorium, two tall organ towers on either side of the stage with decorate urns built into them, and large panels on the walls reminiscent of the ones that can be seen in Brompton's RIviera Theatre.

From 1921 until the 1970s, only minor changes were made to the Croswell's interior. In 1976, an addition was built on the back of the theater for a scene shop and offices. Two buildings on either side of the Croswell's front lobby were purchased in 1978 and 1979 and added to the theater, becoming space for rehearsals, offices and an art gallery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;

== Current use ==
The Croswell is a [[Theatre#Producing vs. presenting|producing theater]] and operates year-round, staging six to eight full-scale musicals per year, along with straight plays, children's theater, and occasional concerts.

On the evening of 17 December 1991, Belgian teenager Katrien De Cuyper ({{IPA-nl|kɑtrin də ˈkœy̯pər}}) disappeared in [[Antwerp]]. Six months later, her body was discovered in the [[port of Antwerp]]. In 2006, a 35-year-old man from [[Kessel, Belgium|Kessel]], who had written to a magazine saying that he was with her on the night she disappeared, was arrested and charged with her kidnapping and murder; he was released after four months due to a lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf19122006_058|title=Verdachte in zaak Katrien De Cuyper op vrije voeten|date=19 December 2006|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|access-date=20 May 2018|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains unsolved.

== Disappearance and body discovery ==
On Tuesday, 17 December 1991, Katrien De Cuyper, a fifteen-year-old girl from [[Brasschaat]], went to visit a friend in Lange Lobroekstraat in [[Antwerp]]. After the visit, her friend stayed behind and let her walk to the bus stop alone as it was raining.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/g1q105nev|title=Verdachte gaf Katrien laatste lift|last=Eeckhaut|first=Mark|date=11 August 2006|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|access-date=20 May 2018|last2=Neyt|first2=Geert|language=nl-BE|last3=Verhaeghe|first3=Tonny}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Cuyper telephoned her parents at 21:30 to tell them she would take the bus home. She missed the bus and was last seen at 22:45 at Les Routiers café on the IJzerlaan, where she made a phone call to an unknown person.&lt;ref name="Documentary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De X-dossiers: wat België niet mocht weten over de zaak-Dutroux|last=Bulté|first=Annemie|last2=De Coninck|first2=Douglas|last3=Van Heeswyck|first3=Marie-Jeanne|year=1999|isbn=9789052405360|location=Belgium|pages=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/ghacs6tt|title=Ze zijn vermoord maar door wie?|date=27 February 2005|work=Het Nieuwsblad|access-date=22 May 2018|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1992, her naked, buried body was discovered during groundwork in the [[port of Antwerp]].

A month after De Cuyper's body was found, weekly magazine ''{{ill|Blik (magazine)|lt=Blik|nl|Blik (tijdschrift)}}'' received a letter from an anonymous sender claiming that they had given her a lift after she missed her bus the night she disappeared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/recup/katrien-de-cuyper_t-19920725-Z05M28.htmlhttp:/archives.lesoir.be/katrien-de-cuyper_t-19920725-Z05M28.html|title=Katrien De Cuyper: Lettre anonyme|date=25 July 1992|work=[[Le Soir]]|access-date=20 May 2018|language=fr-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following October, ''Blik'' received another letter from the same sender, as did De Cuyper's parents the month after.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In February 1997, Regina Louf (also known in Belgium as "{{ill|Witness X1|fr|Affaire du témoin X1}}") wrote a letter to police confessing to killing De Cuyper.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/recup/%252Felle-s-accuse-du-meurtre-de-katrien-de-cuyper-x1-longue_t-19980128-Z0ET7R.html|title=Elle s'accuse du meurtre de Katrien de Cuyper: X1 longuement interrogée à Anvers|last=Surmont|first=Eddy|date=28 January 1998|work=Le Soir|access-date=20 May 2018|last2=Vantroyen|first2=Jean-Claude|language=fr-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louf said that De Cuyper had been held in a castle north of Antwerp in which children would be raped, tortured and killed by what she described as a "paedophile network", and that she had been ordered to kill the girl during an [[orgy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/mensen/belgie-smacht-naar-de-waarheid-over-x1-gruwelijke-getuoigenissen~ba0a69f3/|title=België smacht naar de waarheid over X1; Gruwelijke getuoigenissen|last=de Graaf|first=Peter|date=28 January 1998|work=[[De Volkskrant]]|language=nl-NL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No concrete evidence was found to support Louf's testimony.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arrest of Karl V.R. ===
In August 2006, a 35-year-old man from [[Kessel, Belgium|Kessel]] identified as Karl V.R., who had been arrested for stalking, was charged with the kidnap and murder of De Cuyper. Police searching his house found [[child pornography]] on his computer and a box which contained newspaper clippings of articles about De Cuyper's disappearance and murder and copies of the letters sent to ''Blik'' and to her parents in 1992. Furthermore, V.R.'s [[DNA profiling|DNA]] had been found on the stamp on the envelope of one of the letters. In March 2002, his brother had been sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in Belgium|life imprisonment]] for the murder of his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.demorgen.be/plus/verdachte-in-moordzaak-katrien-de-cuyper-vrij-b-1412182734292/|title=Verdachte in moordzaak Katrien De Cuyper vrij|date=20 December 2006|work=[[De Morgen]]|access-date=20 May 2018|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/d-20060812-W284WL?referer=/archives/recherche?datefilter=anytime&amp;sort=date+asc&amp;start=30&amp;word=Katrien+De+Cuyper|title=Le meurtre de Katrien De Cuyper élucidé?|last=Surmont|first=Eddy|date=12 August 2006|work=Le Soir|access-date=20 May 2018|language=fr-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; V.R. admitted that he wrote the letters but said that they were fabricated and that he only wrote them for publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf11092006_039|title=Aanhouding verdachte in moordzaak Katrien De Cuyper verlengd|date=11 September 2006|work=[[De Standaard]]|access-date=20 May 2018|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, De Cuyper's remains were exhumed for further tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/lichaam-katrien-de-cuyper-opgegraven~aad625fb/|title=Lichaam Katrien De Cuyper opgegraven|date=21 September 2006|work=[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]|access-date=20 May 2006|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/d-20060921-W27DJ2?referer=/archives/recherche?datefilter=anytime&amp;sort=date+asc&amp;start=30&amp;word=Katrien+De+Cuyper|title=Exhumation du corps de Katrien De Cuyper|date=21 September 2006|work=Le Soir|access-date=20 May 2018|language=fr-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hen chicken.jpg|thumb|An adult bird which has been beak-trimmed as a chick]]
'''Debeaking''' is the partial removal of the [[beak]] of [[poultry]], especially [[chicken|layer hens]] and [[domesticated turkey|turkeys]] although it may also be performed on [[quail]] and [[ducks]]. Most commonly, the beak is shortened permanently, although regrowth can occur. The trimmed lower beak is somewhat longer than the upper beak.

Beak trimming is most common in egg-laying strains of chickens.  In some countries, such as the United States, turkeys routinely have their beaks trimmed. In the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed.&lt;ref name="FAWC turkeys"&gt;[http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/turkeys/turkr025.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Beak trimming is a preventive measure to reduce damage caused by injurious pecking such as [[Cannibalism in poultry|cannibalism]], [[feather pecking]] and [[vent pecking]], and thereby improve livability.&lt;ref name="Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)" /&gt;  Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking usually begins.  However, broiler breeding stock may be trimmed to prevent damage during mating.&lt;ref name="Gentle and McKeegan, (2007)"&gt;Gentle, M.J. and McKeegan, D.E.F., (2007). Evaluation of the effects of infrared beak trimming in broiler breeder chicks. Veterinary Record, 160: 145–148&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, beak trimming is done as a last resort where alternatives are considered not to be possible or appropriate.

Opponents of beak trimming state that the practice reduces problem pecking by minor amounts compared to the trauma, injury, and harm done to the entire flock by beak trimming. Reduction is in single digit percentiles, whereas improvement of conditions especially in layer colonies will cease problematic behavior entirely.&lt;ref name="niedr" /&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2017}}{{better citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beak trimming has been banned in Switzerland since 1992 and has been phased out in Germany in 2017.&lt;ref name="niedr"&gt;[http://www.ml.niedersachsen.de/portal/live.php?navigation_id=1810&amp;article_id=126928&amp;_psmand=7 Ab 2017 bleibt der Schnabel jetzt bundesweit dran!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In close confinement, [[Cannibalism in poultry|cannibalism]], feather pecking and aggression are common among turkeys, [[duck]]s, [[pheasant]]s, [[quail]], and chickens of many breeds (including both heritage breeds and modern [[Sex link|hybrids]]) kept for eggs. The tendency to cannibalism and feather pecking varies among different strains of chickens, but does not manifest itself consistently. Some flocks of the same breed may be entirely free from cannibalism, while others, under the same management, may have a serious outbreak.  Mortalities, mainly due to cannibalism, can be up to 15% in egg laying flocks housed in aviaries,&lt;ref name="Hill, (1986)"&gt;Hill, J.A., (1986). Egg production in alternative systems - a review of recent research in the UK. Research and Development in Agriculture, 3: 13-18&lt;/ref&gt; straw yards,&lt;ref name="Gibson et al., (1988)"&gt;Gibson, S.W., Dun, P. and Hughes, B.O., (1988). The performance and behaviour of laying fowls in a covered strawyard system.  Research and Development in Agriculture, 5: 153-163&lt;/ref&gt; and free-range systems.&lt;ref name="Keeling et al., (1988)"&gt;Keeling, L.J., Hughes, B.O. and Dun P., (1988). Performance of free range laying hens in a polythene house and their behaviour on range. Farm Building Progress, 94: 21-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Because egg laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in caged systems, cannibalism is reduced&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)"&gt;Appleby, M.C. and Hughes B.O., (1991). Welfare of laying hens in cages and alternative systems: Environmental, physical and behavioural aspects. World's Poultry Science Journal, 47: 109-128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson and Tauson, (1995)"&gt;Abrahamsson, P. and Tauson, R., (1995). Aviary systems and conventional cages for laying hens - effects on production, egg quality, health and bird location in 3 hybrids.  Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica Section A-Animal Science,  45: 191-203&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems.  Cannibalism among flocks is highly variable and when it is not problematic, then mortalities among production systems are similar.&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)" /&gt;

== History ==
Beak trimming was developed at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Kennard, (1937)"&gt;Kennard, D.C. (1937). ''Chicken Vices''. 184. Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station. 22: 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6&amp;nbsp;mm (1/4 inch) off the beak. It was thought that the tip of the beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.

Cannibalism is a serious management problem dating back to the periods before intensive housing of poultry became popular. Poultry books written before [[corporate farming|vertical integration of the poultry industry]] describe the abnormal pecking of poultry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chicks and adult birds' picking at each other until blood shows and then destroying one another by further picking is a source of great loss in many flocks, especially when kept in confinement .... The recommendation of the Ohio Experiment Station of cutting back the tip of the upper beak has been found to be effective until the beak grows out again.&lt;ref name="Jull, (1938)"&gt;Jull, M.A., (1938). ''Poultry Husbandry'', 2nd Edition. McGraw Hill, New York., page 346.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cannibalism has two peaks in the life of a chicken; during the brooding period and at the onset of egg laying. The point-of-lay cannibalism is generally the most damaging and gets most of the attention. The temporary beak trimming developed at the Ohio Experiment Station assumed that cannibalism was a phase, and that blunting the beak temporarily would be adequate.

===Current methods and guidelines===
In recent years, the aim has been to develop more permanent beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using  electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut.  There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including [[scissors]] or [[secateurs]]), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and [[infrared]].  The latter two methods usually remove only the tip of the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches such as the use of lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use.&lt;ref name="AVMA2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/beak_trimming_bgnd.pdf|title=AVMA Literature review on the welfare implications of beaktrimming|year=2010|author=AVMA|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips.  The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys.&lt;ref name="Glatz, (2005)"&gt;Glatz, P.C., (2005). ''Poultry Welfare Issues: Beak Trimming.'' Nottingham University Press, Nottingham, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate.  It was considered that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for turkeys.&lt;ref name="FAWC turkeys"/&gt;

In the UK, beak trimming of layer hens normally occurs at 1-day of age at the same time as the chick is being sexed and vaccinated.

USA's [[United Egg Producers|UEP]] guidelines suggest that in egg laying strains of chickens, the length of the upper beak distal from the nostrils that remains following trimming, should be 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;United Egg Producers Animal Husbandry Guidelines for U.S. Egg Laying Flocks, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] stated: "The accepted procedure is to remove not more than one third of the upper and lower beaks or not more than one third of the upper beak only" but went on to recommend: "Where beak trimming is carried out, it should, wherever possible, be restricted to beak tipping; that is the blunting of the beak to remove the sharp point which can be the cause of the most severe damage to other birds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/pdf/beak-trimming.pdf|title=FAWC opinion on beak trimming, 2007|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}

===Australia===
Beak trimming is banned in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. It is currently debated in parliament whether debeaking should be banned in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal law in the spotlight: Victoria's factory farming bill|url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/content/animal-law-spotlight-victorias-factory-farming-bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal law in the spotlight: NSW battery hen bill|url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/content/animal-law-spotlight-nsw-battery-hen-bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Beak trimming was used in Denmark until 2014 when it was phased out and made illegal.&lt;ref name="Status of beak trimming in EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of beak trimming in EU|url= http://www.lf.dk/~/media/lf/for-medlemmer/sektioner-og-udvalg/erhvervsfjerkraesektionen/kongres-2016/ana%C3%ABlle-laravoire.pdf?la=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden, Finland and Norway===
Beak trimming is illegal in these countries.&lt;ref name="Status of beak trimming in EU"/&gt;

===Germany===
Agriculture Minister [[Christian Meyer (politician)|Christian Meyer]] announced that Germany would phase out beak trimming by 2017 due to animal welfare concerns.&lt;ref name="niedr"/&gt;

==Costs and benefits==

===Costs===
The costs of beak trimming relate primarily to welfare concerns.  These include acute stress, and acute, possibly chronic, [[pain]] following trimming. A bird’s ability to consume food is impaired following beak trimming because of the new beak shape and pain.  Most studies report reduced body weights and feed intake following beak trimming, however, by sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal.&lt;ref name="Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)"&gt;Hester, P.Y. and Shea-Moore, M., (2003). Beak trimming egg-laying strains of chickens. World’s Poultry Science Journal, 59: 458-474&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustafson et al., (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lagana et al., (2011)" /&gt;  Weight losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with chicks trimmed by a hot-blade.&lt;ref name="Marchant-Forde and Cheng, (2011)"&gt;Marchant-Forde, R.M. and Cheng, H.W., (2011).

Whether beak trimming causes pain is a hotly debated concern.  It is a complex issue as it may involve acute and/or chronic pain, and depends on the age it is performed, the method of trimming and the length of beak that is removed.
Beak trimming in the poultry industry usually occurs without [[anaesthetic]] at 1-day of age or when the chicks are very young, but can occur at a later age if an outbreak of feather pecking occurs, and in some cases, birds may be beak trimmed on repeated occasions. Beak trimming is not permitted in the UK on meat chickens that are aged over 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Defra|title=Guidance on keeping of Chickens|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69382/pb13545-meat-chickens.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Acute pain =====
The beak is a complex, functional organ with an extensive nervous supply including [[nociceptors]] that sense pain and noxious stimuli.&lt;ref name="Breward, (1984)"&gt;Breward, J., (1984).  Cutaneous nociceptors in the chicken beak. Proceedings of the Journal of Physiology, London 346: 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentle, (1992)"&gt;Gentle, M.J., (1992). Pain in birds. Animal Welfare, 1: 235-247&lt;/ref&gt;  These would almost certainly be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks has been based on the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration.&lt;ref name="Gentle et al., (1982)"&gt;Gentle M.J., Hughes B.O. and Hubrecht R.C., (1982).

Behavioural and anatomical consequences of two beak trimming methods in 1- and 10-d-old domestic chicks. British Poultry Science, 38: 453-463&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Japanese quail]], beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming.&lt;ref name="Lagana et al., (2011)"&gt;Lagana, C., Pizzolante, C.C., Togashi, C.K., Kakimoto, S.K., Saldanha, E.S.P.B. and Alvares, V., (2011).  Beak trimming method and drinking system and their effect on the performance and egg quality of Japanese quails. Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia-Brazilian Journal of Animal Science, 40: 1217-1221&lt;/ref&gt;  Beak trimmed [[Muscovy ducks]] spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim.&lt;ref name="Gustafson et al., (2007)"&gt;Gustafson, L.A., Cheng, H.W., Garner, J.P., Pajor, E.A. and Mench, J.A., (2007). Effects of bill-trimming Muscovy ducks on behavior, body weight gain, and bill morphopathology.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 103: 59-74&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Gentle, (1995)"&gt;Hughes, B.O. and Gentle, M.J., (1995). Beak trimming in poultry: Its implications for welfare. World’s Poultry Science Journal, 51: 51–61&lt;/ref&gt;  Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens&lt;ref name="Freire et al., (2008)"&gt;Freire, R., Glatz, P. and Hinch, G., (2008). Self-administration of an analgesic does not alleviate pain in beak trimmed chickens. Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Science, 21: 443–448&lt;/ref&gt; possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.&lt;ref name="Friere et al., (2011)"&gt;Freire, R., Eastwood, M.A. and Joyce, M., (2011).  Minor beak trimming in chickens leads to loss of mechanoreception and magnetoreception.  Journal Animal Science, 89: 1201-1206&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chronic pain=====
Severe beak trimming, or beak trimming birds at an older age is thought to cause chronic pain.  Following beak trimming of older or adult hens, the nociceptors in the beak stump show abnormal patterns of neural discharge, which indicate acute pain.&lt;ref name="Breward, (1984)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breward, (1985)"&gt;Breward, J., (1985). ''An Electrophysiological Investigation of the Effects of Beak Trimming in the Domestic Fowl (''Gallus gallus domesticus'')''.

World’s Poultry Science Journal', 42: 268-275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breward and Gentle, (1985)"&gt;Breward, L. and Gentle, M.J., (1985). Neuroma formation and abnormal afferent nerve discharges after partial break amputation (beak trimming) in poultry.  Experientia, 41: 1132-1134. {{doi|10.1007/BF01951693}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neuromas]], tangled masses of swollen regenerating axon sprouts,&lt;ref name="Devor and Rappaport, (1990)"&gt;Devor, M. and Rappaport, Z.H., (1990). ''Pain Syndromes in Neurology''., edited by H.L. Fields, Butterworths, London, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; are found in the healed stumps of birds beak trimmed at 5 weeks of age or older and in severely beak trimmed birds.&lt;ref name="Lunam et al., (1996)"&gt;Lunam, C.A., Glatz, P.C. and Hsu, Y-J., (1996). The absence of neuromas in beaks of adult hens after conservative trimming at hatch. Australian Veterinary Journal, 74: 46-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuromas have been associated with [[phantom pain]] in human amputees and have therefore been linked to chronic pain in beak trimmed birds.  If beak trimming is severe because of improper procedure or done in older birds, the neuromas will persist which suggests that beak trimmed older birds experience [[chronic pain]], although this has been debated.&lt;ref name="Kuenzel, (2007)"&gt;Kuenzel, W.J. (2001).  Neurobiological basis of sensory perception: welfare implications of beak trimming. Poultry Science, 86: 1273-1282&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
{{Main article|Feather pecking}}
The benefits of beak trimming are mainly welfare advantages for birds kept in close confinement, some of which directly relate to increases (or reduced decreases) in production.  These include reduced feather pecking and cannibalism, better feathering (though they find it hard to preen with shortened beaks, which means they are not cleaning themselves well), less fearfulness and nervousness, less chronic stress, and decreased mortality.&lt;ref name="Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambton et al., (2010)"&gt;Lambton, S.L., Knowles, T.G., Yorke, C. and Nicol, C.J., (2010).  The risk factors affecting the development of gentle and severe feather pecking in loose housed laying hens.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 123: 32–42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A range of options have been proposed as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to [[Vent pecking|cloacal cannibalism]].&lt;ref name="Glatz, (2005)" /&gt;

At the events, participants were encouraged to buy two alcoholic drinks, and give one to a fellow guest.&lt;ref name="chron"/&gt;

Invitations to the initial event, held at the local [[Gordon Biersch]] brewery, were in the form of a mock product announcement press release from LinkExchange, which ended up becoming a local [[viral email]] phenomenon and attracting seventy guests.  Later events drew more than one thousand participants each, included corporate sponsorships, and eventually spread to Tokyo, Sydney, London, Hong Kong, San Diego, and Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="conf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Business Week|url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_38/c3699017.htm|title=E-cocktail Anyone?|author=Steve Hamm|date=September 18, 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828204526/http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_38/c3699017.htm|archivedate=August 28, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parties continued until the "dot com crash" of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkexchange.com/sanfran/ |title=NOTE: DrinkExchange on October 30!!! |date=1999-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991011095757/http://www.drinkexchange.com/sanfran/ |archivedate=October 11, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">A '''fact sheet''', '''factsheet''', '''fact file''' or (in some industries) '''[[one-sheet]]''' is a presentation of [[data]] in a format which emphasizes key points concisely, usually using tables, bullet points and/or headings, on a single printed page.

Fact sheets often contain product information, technical data, lists, [[statistics]], answers to common questions (e.g. [[FAQ]]s), educational material, or how-to, "do-it-yourself" advice. They are sometimes a summary of a longer [[document]].

'''Google Code Jam''' is an international programming competition hosted and administered by [[Google]].{{r|"Dyer Gregersen Christensen 2011 p. 196"}} The competition began in 2003 as a means to identify top engineering talent for potential employment at Google.{{r|"Lowe 2009 p. 284"}} The competition consists of a set of [[algorithm]]ic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any [[programming language]] and [[Development environment (software development process)|development environment]] to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on [[Topcoder]]'s platform and had quite different rule. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure for the contest.

Starting from 2015, Google also runs Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on [[distributed algorithm]]s.{{r|"Ghoshal 2015"}} This is run in parallel with the regular Code Jam, with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of $10,000, but is only open for people who qualify to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3000 people).

Several Google Code Jam problems have lead to academic research.{{r|"acm2696032"}}

'''''Grease: Live''''' (stylized as '''''Grease LIVE!''''') is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by [[Fox network|Fox]] on January 31, 2016. It was a live, televised remake of the 1978 film [[Grease (film)|''Grease'']], executive produced by [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], directed by [[Thomas Kail]], and starring [[Julianne Hough]], [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]] and [[Carlos Pena Jr.|Carlos PenaVega]].

Patterned on similar live television musicals that had recently been produced by [[NBC]], the production incorporated elements and songs from both the original stage musical and the [[Grease (film)|1978 film]] version of ''Grease'', as well as additional songs that were not present in either. In an effort to emulate the "energy" of a theatrical setting, live audiences were incorporated into the production's stagings. ''Grease: Live'' was broadcast from [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]], utilizing two soundstages and the studio's outdoor [[backlot]]—the usage of the latter was notably affected by rain in the Los Angeles area on the day of the broadcast.

Critical reception was positive, with particular praise to the overall atmosphere and production style of the presentation, as well as the performances of the cast, particularly Hudgens as Betty Rizzo—the special was dedicated in the memory of Hudgens' father, who had died from cancer one day prior to the broadcast. The special was nominated for ten [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and won a total of five including Outstanding Special Class Program.

==History==

===Announcement and casting===
On April 28, 2014, Fox announced that it had partnered with [[Paramount Television]] to produce a live, three-hour televised adaptation of the 1971 musical ''Grease'' in 2015.&lt;ref name=Keveney&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/04/28/fox-to-stage-live-production-of-grease/8414769/|title=Fox to go live with 'Grease'|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2016|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move came in the wake of similar live musical adaptations that had been produced by [[NBC]], such as ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]'' and ''[[Peter Pan Live!]]''.&lt;ref name=Keveney/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone-grease" /&gt;

On January 17, 2015, Fox officially announced that [[Julianne Hough]] had been cast as Sandy and [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Rizzo and that the special would air on January 31, 2016. ''Entertainment Weekly'' reported that the special had been delayed from its original target of Summer 2015 due to difficulties in the casting process.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-grease"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fox-grease-live-musical-julianne-hough-vanessa-hudgens-20150117 |title=Fox Plans 'Grease' Live Musical With Julianne Hough and Vanessa Hudgens |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=January 17, 2015 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2015, it was announced that [[Keke Palmer]] would join the broadcast as Marty Maraschino, one of the Pink Ladies.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/keke-palmer-joins-cast-of-foxs-grease-live-350121 |title=Keke Palmer Joins Cast of Fox's Grease: Live! |last=Hetrick |first=Adam |last2=Viagas |first2=Robert |date=May 28, 2015 |website=[[Playbill.com]] |access-date=April 20, 2018 |last3=Gioia |first3=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, it was announced that [[Aaron Tveit]] would star as Danny Zuko in the live TV broadcast, and [[Carlos PenaVega]] would play the role of Kenickie.&lt;ref name=Hibberd/&gt; On September 30, 2015, it was announced that [[Carly Rae Jepsen]], [[Kether Donohue]], and [[David Del Rio]] would play Frenchy, Jan, and Putzie, respectively.&lt;ref name=FrenchyPutzie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/broadways-cinderella-and-glee-choreographer-join-foxs-grease-live-364826 |title=Broadway's Cinderella and "Glee" Choreographer Join Fox's Grease: Live |last=Gans |first=Andrew |website=Playbill |date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, it was announced that [[Jordan Fisher]], Andrew Call and Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer would join the cast as Doody, Sonny and Cha-Cha, respectively.&lt;ref name=DoodySonnyChaCha&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/foxs-grease-live-gets-its-doody-sonny-and-cha-cha-370474 |title=Fox's Grease: Live Gets Its Doody, Sonny and Cha-Cha |last1=Viagas |first1=Andrew |last2=Clement |first2=Olivia |website=Playbill.com |date=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
Director [[Thomas Kail]] envisioned ''Grease: Live'' as being a "combination" of elements from the original musical and the [[Grease (film)|1978 film version of ''Grease'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/thomas-kail-jumps-hamilton-grease-857961 |title='Hamilton's' Thomas Kail Makes the Leap to TV for "Bold" Take on 'Grease: Live' |last1=Rooney |first1=David |date=January 25, 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Lynne Segall |access-date=February 3, 2016 |quote=&amp;nbsp;What we're doing here is taking the spine of the film and then also having access to parts of the stage play.&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the production incorporated songs that were created for the film version, such as a performance of its theme song "[[Grease (song)|Grease (Is The Word)]]" by [[Jessie J]], "[[You're the One That I Want]]", and "[[Hopelessly Devoted to You]]", as well as songs that were exclusive to the stage version, such as "Freddy, My Love" and "Those Magic Changes".&lt;ref name="people-newsongs" /&gt; Kail explained that "very early on as I started imagining what this could be, talking to [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], our executive producer, and the folks at Paramount, one of the things we really were very focused on was trying to capture the spirit of both the original companies of ''Grease'' and that film that has left such an indelible impression on all of us. To try to honor that and pay homage to something that has moved us and we have such a great affection for, and then try to make our own version of it."&lt;ref name="thr-studioaudience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/foxs-grease-live-incorporate-studio-849706 |title=Fox's 'Grease: Live' to Incorporate Studio Audience |last=Rooney |first=David |date=December 17, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production also contained several new songs including the original, "All I Need Is an Angel", which was written for the character of Frenchy ([[Carly Rae Jepsen]]) by [[Tom Kitt (musician)|Tom Kitt]] and [[Brian Yorkey]] of ''[[Next to Normal]]'' fame.&lt;ref name="people-newsongs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/article/grease-live-2016-new-songs |title=Freddy, My Love? The Grease: Live Songs You May Not Recognize |last=Gomez |first=Patrick |date=January 31, 2016 |work=People |access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Jonas]]'s band [[DNCE]] made a cameo appearance as Johnny Casino and The Gamblers during the Rydell High dance where they performed [[The Crickets]]' "[[Maybe Baby (song)|Maybe Baby]]", as well as a 1950s-inspired remix of their own debut single "[[Cake by the Ocean]]" in addition to "Born to Hand Jive" from the stage version and "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" which was previously only part of the film version. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Jonas explained that the band was approached by the producers for the role following a concert they had performed in New York City.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-dnce"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/joe-jonas-talks-dnces-grease-live-cameo-20160127 |title=Joe Jonas Talks DNCE's 'Grease: Live' Cameo |last=Spanos |first=Brittany |date=January 27, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grease: Live'' was broadcast from [[Warner Bros.]] in [[Burbank, California]], using two soundstages, half of its [[backlot]], and 44 cameras.&lt;ref name="adweek-cokesponsor" /&gt; Set designer David Korins explained that the medium of a live, television musical would "really show off what theater does best, and also what film and television does best", having constructed a self-contained "cafegymatorium" set that is designed to provide an "immersive", 360-degree experience, as well as traditional theatrical-style stagings. ''Grease: Live'' was presented to live studio audiences at each of the three filming locations, who were also directly integrated into relevant scenes as extras on-stage, such as in crowds. Kail explained that he wanted to capture the "feeling" of the audiences at live stage productions, as there was "an energy and an undeniable vitality that real humans give back to real humans that are performing". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' believed that the use of live audiences would help to stylistically distinguish ''Grease: Live'' from the NBC live musicals that it was patterned after.&lt;ref name="thr-studioaudience" /&gt;

The price of a 30-second commercial during ''Grease: Live'' was set between $300,000 and $320,000. [[Coca-Cola]] was signed on as a major sponsor of the special; the sponsorship included [[product placement]] of classic Coca-Cola signage and beverages within the special (such as on a vending machine and on the diner set), and sponsored [[social media]] content.&lt;ref name="adweek-cokesponsor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/grease-word-coke-fox-banks-first-live-musical-169290 |title=Fox Finds the Perfect Sponsor for Its 1950s-Era Grease Revival: Coca-Cola |last=Lynch |first=Jason |date=January 29, 2016 |website=Adweek |access-date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-cocacola"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/grease-live-coca-cola-tv-advertising-1201691992/ |title=Coca-Cola Hopes To Cut Through Fox's Live 'Grease' With Ad Play |last=Steinberg |first=Brian |date=January 29, 2016 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be appropriate for broadcast television and to appease advertisers, several songs were edited for content; Platt stated that his goal was to make ''Grease: Live'' a "family-friendly" show, but still wanted to maintain "the appropriate edge" the musical required. Among the edits, "[[Greased Lightnin' (song)|Greased Lightnin']]" changed the lyrics to remove several profane and sexual words (edits that original songwriter [[Jim Jacobs]] had made to the officially licensed versions many years prior), while the Italian profanity "fongool" was replaced with "be cool" within "Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee".&lt;ref name="vf-censor"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |date=January 31, 2016 |title=Why Grease: Live Had to Censor Some of Its Most Famous Lyrics |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/01/grease-live-lyric-change-greased-lightning |magazine=Vanity Fair |publisher=Conde Nast |access-date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weather issues====
The use of outdoor sets for portions of the production led to concerns that it could be affected by weather, especially in the wake of forecasts calling for a 100% chance of precipitation and possible thunderstorms on the day of the telecast.

While prepared for the possibility of rain, wind was also a major factor: at around 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]], an hour before the telecast went live, Platt was informed that a particular structure on the outdoor set could not be used for safety reasons. By 3:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. PT, while the team was in the process of re-staging the opening number to exclude the structure, the rain and wind passed, and engineers cleared the use of the structure—allowing a return to the original staging.&lt;ref name="ew-alternate"/&gt; The broadcast would ultimately feature references to the conditions: emcee [[Mario Lopez]] jokingly introduced "[[El Niño]]" as being a "special guest", while the opening number, "Grease (Is the Word)", was performed with the cast holding umbrellas,&lt;ref name="deadline-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=With Spectacular ‘Grease Live’, Fox &amp; Paramount Raise Bar On Live TV Presentations – Review|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/grease-live-review-1201693976/|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|date=January 31, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during a discussion about having a live broadcast at Rydell High, Principal McGee ([[Ana Gasteyer]]) quipped, "Let's just hope it doesn't rain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/grease-live-preview-final-rehearsal-1201693213/| title='Grease Live': Inside the Final Dress Rehearsal|work=Variety|last=Birnbaum|first=Debra|date=January 31, 2016|access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death of Greg Hudgens====
On the day of the broadcast, Vanessa Hudgens announced on [[Twitter]] that her father, Greg, had died of cancer the night before, and that she would dedicate her performance in ''Grease: Live'' to his memory.&lt;ref name="latimes-hudgensfather"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-vanessa-hudgens-dad-dies-grease-live-dedication-20160201-story.html |title=Vanessa Hudgens dedicates 'Grease: Live' to her father, who died a day before the show |last=Saad |first=Nardine |date=February 1, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/grease-live-stars-father-passes-away-but-she-says-i-do-the-show-in-his-honor-383219# |title=Grease: Live Star's Father Passes Away, But She Says, "I Do The Show In His Honor" |last=Gioia |first=Michael |date=January 31, 2016 |work=[[Playbill]] |access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platt told ''Entertainment Weekly'' that he was "fiercely proud" of Hudgens' handling of the situation, describing her as a "very determined young woman" who "knows that the show has to go on, as any actor of the theater or in a live event knows. So she decided she would take her feelings of loss and sadness and put them in a box for that afternoon, that she would use them to fuel her performance and she would do it in honor of her father."&lt;ref name="ew-alternate"/&gt; Additionally, Fox and Paramount allowed the production to be dedicated in memory of Greg; Platt went on to say that "the cast was behind her and we all joined hands and said, 'We're going to live in this moment. Sometimes life interferes. But you have all worked so hard for this moment and we're going to go for it.'"&lt;ref name="ew-alternate"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''Grease: Live'' received mostly positive reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] listed the special with a 91% rating based on 34 reviews, and an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus states that "''Grease: Live'' took the pressure and threw away conventionality — it belongs to yesterday. There was a chance that it could make it so far; we started believin' we can be who we are. ''Grease: Live'' is the word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grease_live/ | title=Grease: Live! (2016) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] listed a weighted average of 74 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/grease-live|title=Grease: Live Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Megan Vick of ''[[TV Guide]]'' felt that Kail had "upped the standard" for live television musicals, and had "successfully managed to combine all the nostalgic elements of ''Grease'' that everyone expected while creating a new experience. The set changes and scale of what they were able to accomplish—in a rainstorm no less—were incredibly impressive. Grease is the word, and ratings most likely will be too." While praising "All I Need Is an Angel" for demonstrating Carly Rae Jepsen's capabilities as a singer, Vick felt that the song was too modern for a musical that is set in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/grease-live-hits-misses-freddy-my-love-thunder-road-race |title=Grease: Live!

[[File:Vanessa_Hudgens_PCA_2012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Vanessa Hudgens]] received widespread acclaim for her performance and professionalism as her father had died the day before the live show.]]

Jeremmy Gerald of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' noted that ''Grease: Live'' was broadcast "with nary a hitch and one last-minute change in the out-of-doors opening number that paid tribute to the greatest movie musical of all time, ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''". Acknowledging that none of NBC's live musicals had "hit the stratospheric highs of this show", aspects of the production were praised, such as the live audiences and stage design. Vanessa Hudgens was judged to have "stolen" the show, and that Aaron Tveit and Julianne Hough "couldn't be better matched as the head of the T Birds and the sweet new girl from Utah." In conclusion, Gerald felt that he had "never seen a more inventive interplay between a show and just enough of the mechanics of the deal to make it all the more engaging. That, and the audience that played its essential part in moving ''Grease Live'' along with enthusiastic applause replacing the dead air that followed key moments in the earlier live broadcasts, set a new standard for this kind of presentation that will be tough to top."&lt;ref name="deadline-review"/&gt;

''Variety''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan felt that the performance of Hough and Tveit was weak, explaining that "when Danny has all the presence of a glass of milk and even the black-clad Sandy of the final scenes exudes all the sexual danger of a church choir director, well, rest assured that those concerned about the ''Grease'' legacies of [[John Travolta|Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] have nothing to worry about." Despite this and other shortcomings, such as audio issues during "Hopelessly Devoted to You", and the "surreality" of the audience's presence in certain scenes, Ryan felt ''Grease: Live'' got "most of the big things right", and that "by incorporating a live audience, using creative staging and employing energetic camera work", the production "boasted an impressive sense of momentum and even spontaneity." Of the individual performances, Ryan praised Keke Palmer's, Hudgens', and Carly Rae Jepsen's vocal performances, Elle McLemore's "simply terrific" Patty, Kether Donahue's "infectious joy", and Ana Gasteyer's "beautifully droll timing" as Principal McGee. She concluded that "If Fox can get the lead casting right in future and snag Kail again, audiences will surely be hopelessly devoted to the network’s next live endeavor."&lt;ref name="variety-review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: ‘Grease Live!’|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/grease-live-review-fox-julianne-hough-aaron-tveit-1201693411|website=Variety|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', Robert Bianco noted various positive and negative aspects of the broadcast. While he praised performances by the supporting cast, he lamented "the progressive dumbing-down of the material. A Broadway musical that originally spoofed our rose-tinted-glasses view of the '50s has turned into a nostalgic wallow, leaving the show with an odd mix of tones – and in this particular version, a book that sometimes seemed to get lost between songs and inside jokes. ... it was often so flatly acted" that the "kinetic", "visually impressive" musical numbers came as a "much-needed relief".

''Grease: Live'' was seen by 12.18 million viewers, with a 4.3/13 share in the 18–49 demographic, making it the most-watched program of the night. The special brought Fox its best ratings of the 2015–16 television season since the [[Empire (season 2)|second season]] premiere of ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' in September 2015, which was seen by 16.18 million viewers. The overall and demographic ratings also beat NBC's December 2015 presentation of ''The Wiz Live!'', with 6% higher viewership overall, and 30% higher 18-49 ratings. While both competed against [[NFL]] games, ''The Wiz'' competed against a regular-season ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' game on CBS, and ''Grease'' against the [[2016 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] on ESPN. Over 1.2 million [[Twitter]] posts were made throughout the airing, with most providing condolences for Hudgens' father.&lt;ref name="deadline-ratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Grease Live’ Demo Ratings Close In On ‘Sound Of Music Live!’ – Update|url=http://deadline.com/2016/02/grease-live-ratings-vanessa-hudgens-fox-probowl-the-wiz-thes-sound-of-music-1201694028/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An encore of ''Grease: Live'' on March 27, 2016, [[Easter|Easter Sunday]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOX to Air Special 'Tweet Along' Encore of GREASE: LIVE This Sunday|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/FOX-to-Air-Special-Tweet-Along-Encore-of-GREASE-LIVE-This-Sunday-20160325|website=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was seen by 1.54 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunday final ratings: ’60 Minutes’ adjusts up, everything else holds|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2016/03/29/sunday-final-ratings-march-27-2016/|author=Rick Porter|website=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18022">{{Greek economic crisis}}
'''Audits of Greece's public finances during the period 2009–2010''' were undertaken by the EU authorities. Since joining the [[Euro zone]], Greece's public finances markedly deviated from the debt and deficit limits set by [[Stability and Growth Pact]].&lt;ref name="EU-doubts-gr-data"&gt;{{cite news |title=EU casts doubt on Greece economic figures |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-24/greece-failed-to-notify-eu-of-2001-swap-contract-eurostat-says.html |agency=BBC News|newspaper=Business Week |date=13 January 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this backdrop, a [[Greek Financial Audit, 2004|2004 external audit]] exposed creative accounting practices understating the problem, putting the EU authorities on alert thereafter. In 2009, the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] developed, and the EU authorities suspected again a lack of credibility in its book keeping, hence the audits.&lt;ref name="EU-doubts-gr-data"/&gt;

This caused political and [[financial crisis|financial market turmoil]]. For instance, it reignited a controversy about Greece's off-market [[Swap (finance)|swaps]] contracted with [[Goldman Sachs]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="greece-failed-to-notify-eu-of-2001-swap"&gt;{{cite news |title=Greece failed to notify EU of 2001 swap Contract, Eurostat says |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-24/greece-failed-to-notify-eu-of-2001-swap-contract-eurostat-says.html |agency=Bloomberg |newspaper=Business Week |date=24 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  accounts for the period 2006–2009, including debt and deficits levels, were regularized.

== Inside the reports ==
&lt;!--This section explains ONLY what is in the Eurostat reports, not the perception thereof, say, by the markets or political bodies--&gt;
&lt;!--To be found in the exec. summary (ES) of the January 2010 report. The 2009 forecast revision is due to economic factors, not necessarily misreporting, and Eurostat 'deals with estimates of past data only' so not mentioned here--&gt;

As part of an excessive deficit procedure (EDP), the Greek authorities submitted to [[Eurostat]], in October 2009, unusually high upward revisions of the deficit and debt data for the period 2005–2008. [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council|ECOFIN]] commissioned an audit, known as an 'EDP methodological visit'. It began in November 2009, and its results were published in a report dated 8 January 2010.&lt;ref name="report2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:KfuYEIIDHnMJ:eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do%3Furi%3DSPLIT_COM:2010:0001%2801%29:FIN:EN:PDF+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg-AASJuIUWS4skiAZfDqcnMb-YDdC8OkSRUjwOgs2I0-F9zSdJqcy-yV-MW83rAP8pjk4UH77jyLLxv5hw5kTzQLzUHlJlldHVGINUpBC230600ohVl5G2hOp03dx91MZdurZ8&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ0bQXSQXCI8rd2Yvd1GIM5XFhgiw |title= Report on Greek government deficit and debt statistics |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 8 January 2010 |month= |year= |work= |publisher= European Commission|location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |deadurl= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this report&lt;!--'s conclusion--&gt;, Eurostat could not validate Greece's fiscal data, exposing Greece's sub par statistical ability and accountability&lt;!--Exec. summary says: problems related to statistical weaknesses and problems related to failures of the relevant Greek institutions in a broad sense. Conclusion details this further, better put it in a separate section--&gt;, relative to other [[Member states of the European Union|member states]]. This came despite a reinforced EU legal framework for fiscal data following the episode of the [[Greek Financial Audit, 2004|2004 Greek financial audit]]. &lt;!--Exec summary of the Nov 2010 report--&gt;At the request of ECOFIN, Eurostat followed up with a series of EDP methodological visits during 2010, in cooperation with the Greek authorities. As part of this initiative, the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority]] (ELSTAT) was established as an independent authority subject to the control of the Greek Parliament. EDP notification tables are required to be published in April and October by each member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/excessive_deficit/edp_notification_tables |title= EDP notification tables |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=  |month= |year= |work= |publisher= Eurostat|location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011012622/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/excessive_deficit/edp_notification_tables|archivedate=2012-10-11|deadurl=yes|accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Greece, the April 2010 notification contained revised fiscal data for 2006–2009, but with remaining reservations in these areas: statistical classification of public corporations, off-market swaps, social security funds, unaudited budget amounts and payables. These were addressed in the October 2010 EDP notification, a significant revision. However, residual uncertainties, notably for the year 2009, called for another visit, known as "extended". Its outcome is the November 2010 EDP notification (outside the statutory schedule), which is published in a comprehensive report concluding that "revised data for 2006-2009 are sufficiently reliable for EDP purposes".&lt;ref name="report2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:AmRW-cKR4oQJ:epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/documents/Greece%2520-%25202010%2520methodological%2520visits%2520report.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESghn89p-eFk8e3a1--CEuYTGRuvrJyieC4B_uDB9Hv685ND9doNJHsJDcIRRfZHKU9vSpk91OLKFB42Ju_4FHXCiQ1UJ1Nfh7Z_XA-6rvKfckjYCl9UX2NGPRrh6rgeH9K8ZqIJ&amp;sig=AHIEtbT7cwBNX6JvbYndCUyHNv8oXpNh2A |title= Report on the EDP methodological visit to Greece in 2010 |date=November 2010 |publisher= Eurostat}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accompanying information note&lt;ref name="info-note-2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:O-GIiPa8l30J:epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/documents/Report_EDP%2520GR%2520-%2520final.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESga5sviTvSSjfpSpeUqHLT10aoTXesiFFlQXFCQ0A9vW6LrL7jEUc_C2AyvnmfEAPnh9TClyEn98EKu1-5ucbD030_yLrx7nYqYqojpVg0iO6ilAEKsElw3jMN5DgLy-8rwerzX&amp;sig=AHIEtbS_Fe3sxiVDUnDVwCdpyLmcGF2cuQ&amp;pli=1 |title= Information note on Greek fiscal data |date= 15 November 2010 |publisher= Eurostat}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published around the same time.

The methodology of revisions, according to which the cost of aforementioned previous actions such as cross currency swaps, was retroactively added to the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 budget deficits&lt;ref name="2006 2009 revisions 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/08/30/the-road-to-the-greek-hell-is-paved-with-false-eu-and-imf-statistics/| title= The Road to the Greek Hell is Paved with False EU and IMF Statistics|work= Counterpunch|date= 30 August 2017 |accessdate= 30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2006 2009 revisions 2"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.mintpressnews.com/trials-andreas-georgiou-fraud-drove-greece-austerity/235102/| title= the Trials of Andreas Georgiou and the Fraud That Drove Greece into Austerity|work= Mintpressnews= 4 December 2017 |accessdate= 30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with the deficits of several legal entities from the non-financial corporations in the General Government sector, has lead to a certain controversy, with the former head of Greece's statistical agency being accused of inflating these years' budget deficits &lt;ref name="2006 2009 revisions 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2006 2009 revisions 2"/&gt;. Nonetheless, the combined corrections lead to an increase of the Greek debt by about 10% (see below).

We use the convention that a positive deficit means a negative government balance, and conversely{{#tag:ref|Take, for example, the information note.&lt;ref name="info-note-2010"/&gt; In the second table under "1. Overview of the latest revisions", the figure for "Balance sheet corrections" and "change in deficit" is -370. This corresponds, in fact, to "an addition of EUR 370 million to the 2009 deficit".

The figures for % of GDP are computed using the rule of three applied to the data of Annex I. For example, 18,666M€ of debt translates to 8.74% of GDP in 2006. Therefore, the amount attributable to the off-market swaps for that year, 5,125.5M€, is divided by 18,666M€ and multiplied by 8.74, yielding 2.40% of GDP. The report contains the following notes about amortization: "There was a grace period of two years in 2002 and 2003, with no settlements exchanged under the IRS so that the amortization of the original loan starts in 2004" and "grace period” (no settlements under the new swap contract agreed in 2005)" for years 2006 and 2007". |group="Note"}}

The '''Highgate Vampire''' was a media sensation surrounding reports of supposed [[supernatural]] activity at [[Highgate Cemetery]] in [[London]] in the 1970s.

==A modern vampire story==
Many popular books on [[ghosts]], like the book called ''The Highgate Vampire'', mention a [[vampire]] which reportedly haunted Highgate Cemetery in the early 1970s. The growth of its reputation, which can be traced through contemporary media reports and subsequent books by two participants, Seán Manchester and David Farrant, is an example of modern legend-building. The most academic account is given by a folklore scholar, Professor Bill Ellis, in the journal ''Folklore''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1993), p.13-39&lt;/ref&gt; He writes from the viewpoint of sociological legend study; this concerns public perceptions of a real or purported event, and how these are shaped into a narrative by processes of rumour, selection, exaggeration and stereotyping.

Other narratives which treat these purported happenings as fact are available in the books and websites of Seán Manchester and David Farrant.

==Initial publicity==
The publicity was initiated by a group of young people interested in the occult who began roaming the overgrown and dilapidated cemetery in the late 1960s, a time when it was being heavily vandalised by intruders.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. D. Altick]], ''To Be in England'' (1969), 194-95, and various press reports,cited in Ellis (1993) 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 December 1969 one of their members, David Farrant, spent the night there, according to his account written in 1991. In a letter to the ''Hampstead and Highgate Express'' on 6 February 1970, he wrote that when passing the cemetery on 24 December 1969 he had glimpsed "a grey figure", which he considered to be supernatural, and asked if others had seen anything similar. On the 13th, several people replied, describing a variety of ghosts said to haunt the cemetery or the adjoining Swains Lane.  These ghosts were described as a tall man in a hat, a [[Apparitional experience|spectral]] cyclist, a woman in white, a face glaring through the bars of a gate, a figure wading into a pond, a pale gliding form, bells ringing, and voices calling.&lt;ref&gt;''Hampstead and Highgate Express,'' 6 February 1970, 26; 13 February 1970, 25; 20 February 1970, 1, 27; 27 February 1970, 6. Cited in Ellis (1993) 20-21; some also in Farrant (1991) 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hardly two correspondents gave the same story.

==Tottenham Park Cemetery desecration==
According to a report in the ''London Evening News'' of 2 November 1968:

{{quote|On the night of Halloween 1968 a graveyard desecration by persons unknown occurred at [[Tottenham Park Cemetery]] in London. These persons arranged flowers taken from graves in circular patterns with arrows of blooms pointing to a new grave, which was uncovered. A coffin was opened and the body inside "disturbed". But their most macabre act was driving an iron stake in form a cross through the lid and into the breast of the corpse.}}

Though the identities and motivations of those responsible were never ascertained, general consensus at the time linked the desecration to events surrounding the Highgate Vampire case.&lt;ref&gt;Medway, Gareth ''Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism,'' New York University Press (1 April 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The vampire theory==
A second local man, the extremely unhinged Seán Manchester, was just as keen as Farrant to identify and eliminate what he and Farrant believed was a supernatural entity in the cemetery. The ''Hampstead and Highgate Express'' reported him on 27 February 1970 as saying that he believed that 'a King Vampire of the Undead', a medieval nobleman who had practised black magic in medieval [[Valahia|Wallachia]] (Romania), had been brought to England in a coffin in the early eighteenth century, by followers who bought a house for him in the West End. He was buried on the site that later became Highgate Cemetery, and Manchester claimed that modern Satanists had roused him. He said the right thing to do would be to stake the vampire's body, and then behead and burn it, but this would nowadays be illegal. The paper headlined this: "Does a Vampyr walk in Highgate?"

Manchester later claimed, however,&lt;ref&gt;Manchester (1997), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; that the reference to "a King Vampire from Wallachia" was a journalistic embellishment. Nevertheless, the 1985 edition of his book also speaks of an unnamed nobleman's body brought to Highgate in a coffin from somewhere in Europe.

In his interview of 27 February, Manchester offered no evidence in support of his theory. The following week, on 6 March, the same paper reported David Farrant as saying he had seen dead foxes in the cemetery, "and the odd thing was there was no outward sign of how they died." When told of this, Manchester said it seemed to complement his theory.&lt;ref&gt;''Hampstead and Highgate Express,'' 6 March 1970, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In later writings, both men reported seeing other dead foxes with throat wounds and drained of blood.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester 1985, ; Farrant 1991, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrant was more hesitant in identifying the phenomenon he had seen. In some interviews he called it simply a ghost or spectre, sometimes he agreed that it might be vampiric. It is the "vampire" label which has stuck.&lt;ref&gt;''Hampstead and Highgate Express,'' 27 February 1970, 1; Manchester (1991) 75; Manchester (1997) 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mass Vampire Hunt of March 1970==
The ensuing publicity was enhanced by a growing rivalry between Farrant and Manchester, each claiming that he could and would expel or destroy the spectre. Manchester declared to his associates that he would hold an "official" vampire hunt on Friday 13 March—such Fridays are always ominous dates in British and North American superstition ([[Friday the Thirteenth]]), and are frequently chosen for items on occult matters in the media.&lt;ref&gt;''Hampstead and Highgate Express,''6 March 1970, 1; ''Hampstead and Highgate Express,'' 27 February 1970, 1; Manchester (1991) 69-70, 75; Ellis (1993) 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITV Network|ITV]] then set up interviews with both Manchester and Farrant, and with others who claimed to have seen supernatural figures in the cemetery. These were broadcast on ITV early on the evening of the 13th; within two hours a mob of 'hunters' from all over London and beyond swarmed over gates and walls into the locked cemetery, despite police efforts to control them.&lt;ref&gt;Such behaviour exemplifies, in an extreme form, a fondness for [[legend tripping]]. ''Hampstead and Highgate Express,'' 13 March 1970, 1; ''The Evening News'' 14 March 1970, 1; Ellis (1993) 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manchester's exorcism claims==
In later years, Manchester wrote his own account of his doings that night (''The Highgate Vampire'' 1985; 2nd rev. ed. 1991). According to his narrative, he and some companions entered the cemetery, unobserved by the police, via the damaged railings of an adjoining churchyard, and tried to open the door of one particular catacomb to which a supposedly psychic sleepwalking girl had previously led him; but try as they might, it would not budge an inch. Failing in this, they climbed down on a rope through an existing hole in its roof, finding empty coffins into which they put garlic, and sprinkling holy water around.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester (1991), 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some months later, on 1 August 1970 ([[Lammas Day]]), the charred and headless remains of a woman's body were found not far from the catacomb.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Bill. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Raising the Devil: Satanism, New Religions and the Media]'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2000), 215-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BwmGVdVxJ18C&amp;pg=PA341#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead]'' (Detroit, Washington and London, Visible Ink Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  The police suspected that it had been used in black magic.  Soon after this incident, there was a noticeable surge in both Farrant's and Manchester's activities. Farrant was found by police in the churchyard beside Highgate Cemetery one night in August, carrying a crucifix and a wooden stake. He was arrested, but when the case came to court it was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''Camden, Highgate and Hampstead Record,'' 21 August 1970, 1; 28 August 1970, 1; 2 October 1970, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later Manchester returned to Highgate Cemetery, but in the daytime, when visits are allowed. Again, we must depend on his own published book for an account of his actions, since neither press nor police were present.  He claims that this time he and his companions did succeed in forcing open, inch by inch, the heavy and rusty iron doors of a family vault (indicated by his female psychic helper). He lifted the massive lid off one coffin, believing it to have been mysteriously transferred there from the previous catacomb. He was about to drive a stake through the body it contained when a companion persuaded him to desist. Reluctantly, he shut the coffin, put garlic and incense in the vault, and came out from it.&lt;ref&gt;''Hornsey Journal,'' 28 August 1970, 36; Manchester (1991), 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later chapter of Manchester's book claims that three years afterwards he discovered a vampiric corpse (he implies that it was the same one) in the cellar of an empty house in the Highgate/Hornsey area, and staked and burned it.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester (1991), 141-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester's story is full of melodramatic details mirroring the [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] mythos: the sleepwalking girl; the vampire transported to England in a coffin; a coffined corpse "gorged and stinking with the life-blood of others", with fangs and burning eyes; his own role as a Van Helsing figure. If he did indeed act as he describes, it can be regarded as a good example of what folklorists (following terminology established by [[Linda Degh]]) now call "ostension" and [[legend tripping]]. This means the real-life imitation of elements from a well-known tale, often involving role-playing, and sometimes leading to ritual acts of vandalism and desecration.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Aftermath==
There was more publicity about Farrant and Manchester when rumours spread that they would meet in a "magicians' duel" on Parliament Hill on Friday 13 April 1973, which never came off.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday People,'' 8 April 1973; Ellis (1993) 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrant was jailed in 1974 for damaging memorials and interfering with dead remains in Highgate Cemetery—vandalism and desecration which he insisted had been caused by Satanists, not him.&lt;ref&gt;Press coverage was very extensive, in both local and national papers, see Ellis (1993) 31-33 and the list of press sources in his note 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Both episodes kept memories of the Highgate affair vivid. In 1975 Manchester wrote a chapter about it in a book edited by [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]], a well-known popular writer on ghost lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vampire's Bedside Companion: The Amazing World of Vampires in Fact and Fiction|last=Underwood|first=Peter|last2=Manchester|first2=Sean|last3=Turner|first3=James|last4=Allan|first4=Peter|last5=Howard|first5=Richard|date=1975-02-01|publisher=Leslie Frewin|year=|isbn=9780856321016|edition=1st|location=London|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Highgate Vampire is now regularly featured in books and internet sites on occult subjects.

The feud between Manchester and Farrant remains vigorous to this day; each claims to be a competent exorcist and researcher of the paranormal; each pours scorn on the other's alleged expertise. They continue to investigate supposed supernatural phenomena, and have both written and spoken repeatedly about the Highgate events, in every medium available, each stressing his own role to the exclusion of the other.

In her book, ''Blood Lust: Conversations with Real Vampires'', published by [[HarperCollins]] in 1991, author Carol Page describes her lengthy interview with Seán Manchester, further questioning his credibility and describes his self-proclaimed activities as "the real evil in Highgate Cemetery."

==In popular culture==
*According to author Bill Ellis, the [[Hammer Horror]] film ''[[Dracula AD 1972]]'', starring [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Peter Cushing]], was inspired by the Highgate Vampire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ellis | first = Bill | title = The Highgate Cemetery Vampire Hunt | journal = Folklore | volume = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Highgate Vampire appears as a villain in the [[Dark Horse comics]] series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]''. The Highgate Vampire is revealed to be, not a vampire, but an insectoid demon that feeds off its victims' emotional trauma. [[Rupert Giles]] had nearly been killed by the creature in 1972. The Highgate Vampire became a minion of [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] when it returned in the 2010s.

'''''Jerry Springer: The Opera''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Musical theater|musical]] written by [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Stewart Lee]], based on the [[talk show]] ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]''. The musical contains irreverent treatment of [[Christian]] themes, extensive [[profanity]], and [[surrealism|surreal]] images, such as a troupe of [[tap dance|tap-dancing]] [[Ku Klux Klan]] members. The musical is completely sung through, with only two exceptions: the title character, Jerry, who speaks throughout the production; and [[Steve Wilkos]], who has a brief speech.

The musical ran for 609 performances in London from April 2003 to February 2005 before touring the UK in 2006. The production won four [[Laurence Olivier Awards]], including Best New Musical. The first North American performance was at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to benefit [[Golden Rainbow (charity)|Golden Rainbow]], featuring performers for the then-current versions of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', and other [[Las Vegas Strip]] theatrical shows. The musical has been performed by a number of American regional theatre companies and made its New York City debut on 29–30 January 2008 at [[Carnegie Hall]]. [[Harvey Keitel]] starred as [[Jerry Springer]].

In January 2005, its [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[television]] broadcast on [[BBC Two]] elicited 55,000 complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Simon Freeman| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1547719,00.html | title=BBC 'right' to screen Jerry Springer musical| work=The Times| date=30 March 2005| accessdate=22 May 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]] led street protests against the screening at nine [[BBC]] offices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4158977.stm| title=Protest held over Springer show| publisher=BBC News| date=9 January 2005| accessdate=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced their intention to bring [[blasphemy]] charges, due to the depictions of the Christian characters in Act II.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Jerry Springer's frenzied audience greets Jerry as he arrives at his notorious TV talk show. His first guest, Dwight, is cheating on Peaches with Zandra. The three fight, and Jerry's security men break up the battle. Jerry is briefly admonished by his inner [[Valkyrie]]. Dwight is also cheating with a [[transgender]] woman, Tremont. After a commercial break, Jerry's second guest, Montel, tells his partner, Andrea, that he likes to dress as a baby and that he is cheating on her with Baby Jane, a woman who dresses as a little girl. Jerry's Warm-Up Man contributes to Andrea's humiliation and is fired. Jerry again wrestles with his inner [[Valkyrie]]. Jerry's final guests are Shawntel and her husband, Chucky. She wants to be a stripper and demonstrates a dance before her mother, Irene, arrives. Irene attacks Shawntel. Chucky pleads innocence, but Jerry's secret JerryCam camera footage shows that Chucky is a patron of strip clubs and a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member. The Klan comes up on stage, and the Warm Up Man gives Montel a gun. The Warm-Up Man jostles Montel, who accidentally shoots Jerry.

===Act II===
Jerry is found injured in a wheelchair, accompanied by his security man, Steve. The scene is Purgatory, a fog enshrouded wilderness. Jerry meets ghostly versions of his talk show guests, who have all suffered unpleasant fates. Jerry tries to justify his actions to the ghosts. The Warm-Up Man arrives and is revealed to be [[Satan]]. Baby Jane asks Satan to spare Jerry's soul. Satan forces Jerry to return to [[Hell]] with him to do a special show.

===Act III===
Jerry arrives in Hell at a charred version of his Earthly TV studio. The audience is locked into cracks in its walls. Jerry reads cue cards produced by Baby Jane that introduce Satan, who is in charge of the proceedings. Satan seeks an apology for his expulsion from Heaven and wants to reunite Heaven and Hell. Jerry must faithfully read the cue cards, which introduce [[Jesus]], the next guest, who resembles Montel. Jesus and Satan trade accusations. [[Adam and Eve]] are next; they are reminiscent of Chucky and Shawntel. They argue with Jesus, and Eve eventually attacks him. [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], who resembles Irene, condemns Jesus. Everyone turns against Jerry, who hopes for a miracle.

[[God]] and the [[angels]] arrive and ask Jerry to come to Heaven and help God judge Humanity. He accepts the offer, but the angels and devils fight over Jerry; and the talk-show host finds himself suspended over a pit of flame. Jerry launches into a series of glib homilies asking for his life, but finally gives up and makes an honest statement that resounds with his audience. Devils, angels, and everyone sing a hymn of praise to life.

Back on solid ground, Baby Jane tells Jerry that he must go back to Earth. Jerry wakes up in his television studio, having been shot, his life ebbing away as he is cradled in Steve's arms. Jerry gives a final speech, and everyone is joined in sorrow.

==History==

===Battersea Arts Centre and the Edinburgh Festival===
Richard Thomas's one-act opera, ''Tourette's Diva'', was performed at London's [[Battersea Arts Centre]] in May 2000 and featured two members of a [[dysfunctional family]] singing [[swear words|obscenities]] to each other. This led Thomas to create his one-man show ''How to Write an Opera About Jerry Springer'', which was performed at the Centre in February 2001.

In May 2001, Thomas returned to the Battersea Arts Centre with his show ''How to Write an Opera About Jerry Springer'', accompanied by four singers in a tiny studio theatre. It attracted positive press and investment. [[Stewart Lee]] teamed up with Thomas, and the two began to write ''Jerry Springer: The Opera''. The show received its first performance, while still under development, at the Centre in August 2001, with a cast of twelve. It ran for a week, selling out. When the show returned to the Centre in February 2002, the three-week run sold out in advance.

The show was then performed in concert at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in August 2002, selling out. [[Jerry Springer]] came to see the show and endorsed it, stating, "I wish I'd thought of it myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1386327,00.html |title=The Observer, 2005 |work=The Guardian |date= 9 January 2005|accessdate=28 March 2009 | location=London | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edinburgh run included the introduction of character of Tremont – an amalgamation of two previous characters. Australian-born actor, [[Andrew Bevis]], created the new role.

Following the Festival run, [[Nicholas Hytner]] offered to include the show in his opening season as director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London.

===National Theatre and Cambridge Theatre===
The first fully staged production of the musical was performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] on 29 April 2003, with a cast of 33, including Bevis as ''Tremont'' and [[Michael Brandon]] as ''Jerry''. It played to packed audiences and received favourable reviews. The show had its final performance at the National Theatre on 30 September 2003, before moving to the [[West End theatre|West End]].

On 10 November 2003, the show opened at the [[Cambridge Theatre]], with the same cast as the National Theatre production, and ran there until 19 February 2005, before starting a tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. The West End run was sponsored by [[British Sky Broadcasting]]. On 12 July 2004, [[David Soul]] took over the role of ''Jerry'' from [[Michael Brandon]].

In 2004, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was announced, and then cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83830.html |title=Playbill article on the proposed Broadway production |work=Playbill |accessdate=28 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706144703/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83830.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3660763.stm| title=Springer musical set for Broadway| publisher=BBC News| date=27 April 2004| accessdate=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 UK Tour===
In September 2005, seven months after the show closed in London's West End, it was announced that the show would tour 21 regional theatres around the United Kingdom. Nine theatres that were originally scheduled to host the show pulled out after [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]] threatened to picket them. In addition, [[Arts Council England]] turned down a bid for funding, stating that the decision was based on the show's commercial pedigree rather than "pressure from extremist groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/pressnews/press_detail.php?rid=10&amp;id=487&amp;page=2| title=Arts Council England takes a tough stand on attacks against freedom of artistic expression| publisher=[[Arts Council England]]| date=19 August 2005| accessdate=22 May 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000047/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/pressnews/press_detail.php?rid=10&amp;id=487&amp;page=2| archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour ran for 22 weeks, starting at the Theatre Royal in [[Plymouth]] on 27 January 2006. Immediately prior to the show's opening in Plymouth, it was reported that members of the far-right [[British National Party]] were part in a local campaign against the performances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4640588.stm| title=Springer tour faces new protests| publisher=BBC News| date=26 January 2006| accessdate=22 May 2006 | first=Ian | last=Youngs}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Christian Voice claimed to disapprove of their involvement. According to Ticketmaster UK, ticket sales were good throughout the tour, and reviews were positive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The cast for the tour included several cast members from the London cast, and American actor, [[Rolf Saxon]], replaced [[David Soul]] as ''Jerry Springer''. The tour had a scaled-down set and scaled-down effects as well as a smaller on-stage "audience".

=== Jerry Springer's reply ===
{{quote|Well, I saw it. When it opened, they invited me to see it on the West End in London. I thought they did a really good job. I mean, I'd prefer it were about someone else. It was awkward for me to watch it. For one, it's about yourself, so there's no common experience. There's no one I can ask, "Gee, how did you feel?" I can't call Figaro or Carmen and say, "Hey, how did you feel about your opera?" It's just a very personal moment that I can't express to anybody. And then I felt a little bit awkward because, as I was watching it, everyone was looking at me to see what my reaction was. It was uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polk |first=Brian |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jerry-springer-14239 |title=Jerry Springer · Interview · The A.V. Club |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New York===
The show was supposed to open on Broadway in 2005 however it was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playbill.com/article/jerry-springer-to-open-on-broadway-oct-20-2005-after-san-fran-bow-com-119336&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was performed in concert in January 2008 for two performances at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] with [[Harvey Keitel]] playing the title role.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/theater/31springer.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was picketed on 57th Street.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/theater/jerry-springer-the-opera-review-terrence-mann.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's first formal performance in New York City was 23 January 2018 – 11 March 2018 at the [[Off-Broadway]] [[Pershing Square Signature Center]] venue with [[Terrence Mann]] playing the title role and [[Will Swenson (actor)|Will Swenson]] playing Satan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenewgroup.org/jerryspringertheopera.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was produced by [[The New Group]].  It was directed by [[John Rando]]. It was extended until 1 April 2018 with [[Matt McGrath (actor)]] taking over the role of Jerry Springer.

==Protests and controversy==
In addition to the Christian protests at the BBC facilities, several venues throughout the 2006 tour saw protests. The ''Manchester Evening News'' reviewer saw the protests as misplaced, writing "an audacious and scandalous, yet ultimately moral and challenging show that's recommended to anyone who can accept the odd dose of outrage in their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourke |first=Kevin |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/theatre_and_dance/theatre_and_dance_reviews/s/208/208450_jerry_springer__the_opera__opera_house.html |title=Manchester Evening News review |publisher=Manchestereveningnews.co.uk |date=21 March 2006|accessdate=28 March 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184837/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/theatre_and_dance/theatre_and_dance_reviews/s/208/208450_jerry_springer__the_opera__opera_house.html| archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer recommended, "don't get your knickers in such a twist, drop 'em and enjoy yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewsgate.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2721 |title=Reviews Gate.com |publisher=Reviews Gate.com |accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Birmingham, performances attracted a few protesters, and more commotion was made by audience members arguing when being presented with leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2006/02/06/jerry_springer_opening_feature.shtml Protests as Jerry Springer opens] [[BBC News]], February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*In York, leaflets were handed out by small numbers of [[Salvation Army]] and Christian Voice protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/christians.gather.in.yorkshire.to.protest.against.ijerry.springer.the.operai./5450.htm Christians Gather in Yorkshire to Protest Against ''Jerry Springer – The Opera''], [[Christian Today]], 23 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Edinburgh, one man from Christian Voice handed out leaflets on a few of the nights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/festival-news/Pastor-leads-Jerry-Springer-musical.5554816.jp?CommentPage=1&amp;CommentPageLength=1000 Pastor leads Jerry Springer musical protests at theatre], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 14 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*100 church leaders in Cardiff and throughout south Wales signed a letter expressing their wishes for the show to be cancelled.  The Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, expressed his concern, stating that the show was 'gratuitously offensive'.  In further comments he stated, 'The producer of this opera says that if he manages to incite religious hatred then the opera has done its job: I think that is a terrible intention for an opera to have.'  Hundreds of Christians protested outside the Wales Millennium Centre, brandishing placards and singing hymns to theatregoers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/jerry.springer.opens.to.more.protests.in.cardiff/6575.htm|title=Jerry Springer Opens to More Protests in Cardiff - Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stewart Lee said that one of the most vitriolic reactions to the show was during its run at [[His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen|His Majesty's Theatre]] in Aberdeen. The Christian Institute pushed for supporters to lobby local council members, directors on the board of Aberdeen Performing Arts and the Press and Journal. Only a few protesters picketed the theatre, handing out leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christian.org.uk/js_opera/theatres/aberdeen.htm | title=Jerry Springer the Opera His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen | work=christian.org.uk | accessdate=2013-10-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104210359/http://www.christian.org.uk/js_opera/theatres/aberdeen.htm | archivedate=4 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The opposition by Christian Voice caused the cancer charity [[Maggie's Centres]] to reject a £3,000 donation from ''Jerry Springer: The Opera''. Christian Voice threatened to picket their centres, which provide palliative care to cancer sufferers and their families. It claimed it had warned the charity that accepting cash from a show full of "filth and blasphemy" would be a public relations disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4289915.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Row over Springer opera donation |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2005|accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 Christian Voice, represented by Stephen Green, attempted to prosecute BBC director-general [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] for blasphemy over the show. A summons was refused due to lack of [[prima facie]] evidence that a crime had been committed, and a provision of the [[Theatres Act 1968|1968 Theatres Act]] which enshrines the right of free expression in theatrical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/Press/press028.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706125908/http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/Press/press028.html|archivedate=2008-07-06 |title=Press Release |publisher=Christian Voice |accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] was dismissed on 5 December 2007, with the decision of the lower court upheld on all counts and ruling that it was reasonable to conclude that the play "in context" could not be considered as blasphemous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7128552.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Springer opera court fight fails |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2007|accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |country=EW |litigants=Green, R (on the application of) v The City of Westminster Magistrates' Court |court=EWHC |division=Admin |year=2007| num=2785 |para= |date=5 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked about the controversy during an interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2009, Lee stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you have been on the verge of becoming a millionaire and that has not happened because of far-right pressure groups, and your work has been banned and taken apart, and you've been threatened with prosecution, and the police have advised people involved with your production to go into hiding, and bed and breakfasts won't have the cast to stay because they're blasphemers, and you have to cross a BNP picket line to go to work in Plymouth, you do start to think, well, what can be worse than that?&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/dec/06/stewart-lee-comedy-interview|title=Interview: Stewart Lee|last=O'Hagan|first=Sean|date=6 December 2009|work=The Observer|accessdate=6 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asked if the experience affected his stand-up comedy, Lee replied: "It did make me feel there was not much point ever trying to reach a mass audience with anything interesting and provocative. You just run the risk of being misunderstood on a large scale".&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"/&gt;

==Profanity==
The musical contains extensive [[profanity]]. It has been accused of including "8,000 obscenities"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;—it is not known where this count originated, but the 8,000 figure is popularly quoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=929&amp;id=22312005 |title=BBC braced for Springer musical storm |publisher=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=8 January 2005 |accessdate=22 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423083150/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=929&amp;id=22312005 |archivedate=23 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8,000 obscenities over the show's 120 minute runtime would imply that there were 66 obscenities a minute, and thus more than 1 per second. Several publications, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', claimed a figure of "3,168 mentions of the word [[fuck]] and 297 of the word [[cunt]]". According to the BBC investigation, however, there were 96 uses of "fuck" and nine uses of "cunt".  The BBC report said "While a substantial number, this was not necessarily unacceptable in terms of late night terrestrial television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to writer Stewart Lee, there are 174 swear words in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==UK Parliament==

The BBC's role in broadcasting the musical was raised in the UK Parliament. Generally, they voiced more concern over the reactions of Christian groups than over the show itself.

Early Day Motion no 488, THE BBC AND JERRY SPRINGER - THE OPERA, was tabled on 12 January 2005, by [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] MP:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That this House regards with dismay the decision by the BBC to broadcast Jerry Springer - The Opera on   BBC2, causing widespread offence to Christians and those of other faiths by its mocking portrayal of Jesus Christ, Holy Communion and some of the central tenets of the Christian faith; condemns the show's juvenile and offensive use of repeated profanity in an attempt at humour; further notes that it is particularly serious that the show should have been transmitted by the publicly-funded national broadcaster and questions whether it places the Corporation in breach of its Charter; laments the arrogant dismissal of Christian concerns by the content of programmes aired by the BBC; and calls on the government publicly to rebuke the corporation for its attack on the religion adhered to by over 70 per cent. of the UK population and for its lowest common denominator approach to ethics in its attempts to chase ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2004-05/488 |title=Early day motion 488 - THE BBC AND JERRY SPRINGER - THE OPERA - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=2005-01-12 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

EDM no 531, BBC AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, was later tabled on 17 January 2005 by [[Evan Harris]] MP:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That this House applauds the decision by the BBC to stick by its decision to broadcast, 'Jerry Springer - The Opera' on BBC2 on 8 January, despite the orchestrated campaign from religious pressure groups, the irresponsible actions of one of which caused alarm and distress to the families of BBC executives by making public their contact details and exposing them to hate attacks; believes that individuals have a choice whether or not to watch programmes which they are warned might be offensive to them, and that broadcasters have the right and duty to broadcast a variety of work, some of which may receive differing critical opinions; recognises that in any case this particular programme was of undoubted artistic merit as demonstrated by the opera having attracted a record number of awards, and substantial theatre audiences; reminds the BBC that its own study What the World Thinks of God suggested Britain was the most religiously sceptical country in the world and that as a publicly-funded national broadcaster the Corporation has a duty to reflect society in its output which will entail broadcasting programmes which some religious people find offensive; and calls on the BBC to stand firm against the increasingly assertive religious pressure being applied to restrict freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/print/2004-05/531%3E|title=Server Error - Parliament UK|website=www.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

EDM no 1270, JERRY SPRINGER DVD WITHDRAWAL, was tabled on 14 December 2005 by [[Don Foster, Baron Foster of Bath|Don Foster]] MP:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That this House agrees with Noam Chomsky that `if you're really in favour of free speech, then you're in favour of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise. Otherwise, you're not in favour of free speech'; regrets the apparent decision of Sainsbury's and Woolworths to respond to minimal pressure by withdrawing DVDs of Jerry Springer: the Opera from sale in their stores; recognises that Jerry Springer: the Opera is a widely acclaimed work of art having won eight major awards including best musical at the Olivier Awards, the Critics' Circle Awards and the Evening Standard Awards; notes that vociferous minority pressure groups now increasingly target works of art with the outcome that the majority are sometimes denied the choice to judge works for themselves; and calls on the Government to ensure that freedom of expression remains a central principle of society and to protect the ability of individuals to explore comprehensively and lawfully all aspects of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2005-06/1270 |title=Early day motion 1270 - JERRY SPRINGER DVD WITHDRAWAL - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==American regional productions==

===Hollywood Theater, MGM Grand in Las Vegas===
The musical premiered on 17 March 2007. It was performed in semi concert-style with costumes and a minimal set at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas as a benefit for Las Vegas-based HIV/AIDS charity, [[Golden Rainbow (charity)|Golden Rainbow]].

The show had its official American premiere in a non-equity production in [[Chicago]] at the [[Bailiwick Repertory Theatre]] that began on 3 May 2007, with a 14 May opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailiwick.org/calendar/show_detail.php?ID=231 |title=Bailiwick Repertory Theatre &amp;#124; Jerry Springer – The Opera |publisher=Bailiwick.org |accessdate=28 March 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929042927/http://www.bailiwick.org/calendar/show_detail.php?ID=231| archivedate = 29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several regional productions of the show have since been performed, and popularity for the show amongst amateur groups continues to grow.

==Television==
''Jerry Springer: The Opera'' was the subject of controversy when the [[BBC]] televised the musical on 8 January 2005 as part of an evening of Jerry Springer-themed programming on [[BBC Two]]. News of the screening had prompted TV standards campaigners [[mediawatch-uk|Mediawatch]] to write a letter to the BBC Chairman of the BBC Governors, [[Michael Grade]], asking him to reconsider the decision to show the musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January, the day before the broadcast, the BBC announced that it had received over 47,000 complaints about its plans to screen the musical – the most complaints ever received about a British television broadcast.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news

| title=Protests as BBC screens Springer
| publisher=BBC News
| date=10 January 2005
| accessdate=22 May 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators, including the BBC, attributed such a high volume of complaints to an orchestrated campaign by various [[Christianity|Christian]] groups. Supporters of the BBC's broadcasting of the show pointed out that the supposedly blasphemous content was clearly presented as a fantasy in the mind of the dying central character and was not intended to be a serious comment on Christ or Christian theology. John Beyer, chairman of Mediawatch-UK, argued that the BBC should shoulder much of the blame for the campaign against the musical since they had promoted the musical as "pushing back the boundaries of taste" and "controversial" when it had never been intended to offend the groups who campaigned against it.

In November 2005, a [[DVD]] of the show was made available in the UK. However, because of complaints by customers, [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Woolworths Group plc|Woolworths]] decided to stop selling the DVD. Many [[blog]]s and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP, [[Lynne Featherstone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DVD's commentary, it was stated that it would not be possible to tour the show in the UK due to pressure from religious groups, but since the release of the DVD, the UK Tour 2006 went forward. The DVD commentary also stated that Stewart Lee was unhappy with an unscripted action by Alison Jiear. In the "Adam and Eve and Mary" scene in Act II, Jiear runs her hand under Jesus's loincloth, prompting a surprised look from Leon Craig, the actor playing Jesus. Lee said, on the commentary, "I wish she hadn't done that".

'''Karthika Deepam''', '''Karthikai Vilakkidu''' or '''Thrikarthika'''  is a festival of lights that is observed by Hindus of  [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Kerala]]. It falls in the month of ''Kārttikai'' (mid-November to mid-December) as per [[Tamil calendar]].  This occurs on the day when the moon is in conjunction with the [[constellation]] Karthigai ([[Pleiades]]) and pournami. This constellation appears as a group of six stars in the firmament in the shape of a pendant from the ear. In Kerala, this festival is known as Thrikkarthika, celebrate to welcome Goddess Shakti. In the rest of India, a related festival called [[Kartik Purnima]] is celebrated in a different date. It is also termed as 'Lakshabba' in the [[The Nilgiris District|Nilgiris]] district of [[Tamil Nadu]].

==The story of six stars==
Many legends and lyrical poetry have grown around this star. The six stars are considered in Indian mythology as the six celestial nymphs who reared the six babies in the Saravana tank which later were joined together to form the six faced Muruga. He is therefore called ''[[Karthikeya]]'', the incarnation of Lord [[Shiva]] as his second son after Lord [[Ganesha]]. It is believed that Lord Shiva created Muruga from his 3rd eye&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Third eye]] The third eye of Lord Shiva from all his six faces were used to create Lord Muruga as his son&lt;/ref&gt; of six primary faces (Tatpurusam,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Tatpurusam The face of Concealing Grace{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aghoram,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Bhairava|Aghora]] The face of annihilation&lt;/ref&gt; Sadyojatam,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Sadyojata]] The face of Creation&lt;/ref&gt; Vamadevam,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Vamadeva]] The face of Preservation/Healing/Dissolution/Rejuvenation&lt;/ref&gt; Eesanam,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Ishana]] The face of Revealing Grace&lt;/ref&gt; Adhomukam&lt;ref group=note&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SXwDdBdMJPwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Adhomukam&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Adhomukam&amp;f=false The 6th face of shiva specified in literature named ''sri kanda puranam'' ([[Skanda Purana]])]&lt;/ref&gt;). It is believed that the six forms made into six children and each of them brought up by the six Karthigai nymphs and later merged into one by his mother [[Parvati]].

While merging he also formed into a six faced ([[Arumugam]] and twelve handed god. The Lord Muruga is also portrayed with his six plays&lt;ref&gt;[[Six Abodes of Murugan]] The six spiritual temples (homes) of Lord Muruga&lt;/ref&gt; and worshiped with six names.

As the six nymphs helped in growing the child, Lord shiva blessed immortality to the six nymphs as ever living stars on the sky. Any worship performed to this six stars is equal to worshiping Lord Muruga himself. They are worshiped by lighting up rows of oil lamps (''Deepam'') in the evening of the festival day around the houses and streets. Karthikai Deepam is also known as Kartikeya, or Muruga's birthday.

==History==
[[File:Karthikai Deepam.jpg|thumbnail|right|Karthikai Deepam]]
One of the earliest references to the festival is found in the Aganaanooru, a book of poems, which dates back to the Sangam Age (200 B.C. to 300 A.D.). The Aganaanooru clearly states that Karthigai is celebrated on the full moon day (pournami) of the month of Karthigai, as per South Indian calendar. It was one of the most important festivals (peruvizha) of the ancient Tamils, including  now the areas of modern Kerala too. Avaiyyar, the renowned poet of those times, refers to the festival in her songs. Karthikai Deepam is one of the oldest festivals celebrated by Tamil people. The festival finds reference in [[Sangam literature]] like ''[[Akanaṉūṟu]]'' and the poems of [[Auvaiyar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2001/11/29/stories/2001112900030100.htm ''The Hindu'': Glow of prosperity]&lt;/ref&gt; Karthigai is referred in Sangam literature as ''Peruvizha''.&lt;ref name=Balambal&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the History of the Sangam Age|page=6|isbn=978-8185163871|year=1998|last=V.|first=Balambal|publisher=Kalinga Publications|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological references===
Lord [[Shiva]] appeared as an endless flame of light before Lord [[Vishnu]] and Lord [[Brahma]], who each considered himself supreme and said that the matter could be tested if the two could search for Lord Shiva's Head and feet. Lord Vishnu took the form of a boar([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]:''Varaha'', [[Tamil language|Tamil]]:''Varaham(pandri) '') and delved deep into the earth, Lord Brahma that of a swan([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]:''Hansa'', [[Tamil language|Tamil]]:''Annam'') and flew towards the skies. Lord Vishnu failed in his search and returned. But Lord Brahma, chancing upon a piece of ''Thazhambu'', a flower, learnt from it that it had been floating down for thirty thousand years from Lord Shiva's head. He seized upon this and claimed to Lord Shiva that he had seen the other's top. Lord Siva realized the falsehood and pronounced that there would never be a temple for Lord Brahma in this world. He also interdicted the use of the flower Thazhambu in his worship. Lord Shiva appeared as a flame, this day is called ''karthikai maha Deepam''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2007/11/21781_space.html, 'Newspaper Quote']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==
[[File:Karthigai Deepam Celebration at Thiru Nizhal Thangal 10.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Nizhal Thangal, Attoor]] decorated with Agal vilakkus during the Karthikai Deepam celebrations  on 2013-11-16]] Rows of ''Agal vilakku''s (Clay [[Oil lamp]]s) are lit in every house. Karthigai is essentially a festival of lamps. The lighted lamp is considered an auspicious symbol. It is believed to ward off evil forces and usher in prosperity and joy. While the lighted lamp is important for all Hindu rituals and festivals, it is indispensable for Karthigai. This festival is also celebrated to commemorate the bonding between brothers and sisters in south India(analogous to Bhaiya-Dhuj and Raakhi). Sisters pray for the prosperity and success of their brothers and light lamps to mark the occasion.
In Telugu households, Kaartheeka maasam (month) is considered very auspicious. The Kartheeka month starts on the day of Deepawali. From that day till the end of the month, oil lamps are lit every day. On Kartheeka Pournami (full moon of Kartheeka month) oil lamp with 365 wicks, prepared at home, are lit in Lord Shiva temples. Apart from that, Kaartheeka puranam is read and fasting is observed till sunset, every day for the whole month.

=== Celebrations at Tiruvannamalai, Tamil nadu and Koneshwaram, Trincomalee===

Thiruvannamalai Maha Deepam will be lit at around 6 pm at the top of 2668 ft high holy mountain. The entire Mountain is Shiva Linga. Maha Deepam will be lit using nearly 3500&amp;nbsp;kg of Ghee. Sri Arthanareeshwara will bless devotees in the Temple at the time of lighting the Maha Deepam. The Maha Deepam will be visible around the Holy Mountain in a radius of 35 km. Lakhs of devotees will perform 16 km Girivalam (circumambulation of the holy mountain). The Moist Black Ash (what they call as 'Mai' in Tamil) that remains after the lighting of the Ghee &amp; Cotton Wick will be distributed as Prasadam to devotees on the Marghazhi Arudra Darisanam day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=K|first1=Kandaswamy|title=Karthigai Deepam in Thiruvannamalai|url=https://skanda-news.blogspot.com/2016/12/karthigai-deepam-2016-december-12-2016.html|website=Live Trend|publisher=K Kandaswamy|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in [[Tiruvannamalai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], Karthigai festival is also famous in [[Koneswaram temple|Koneshwaram, Trincomalee, Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lakhs-witness-karthigai-deepam/article4140984.ece Lakhs witness Karthigai Deepam] [[The Hindu]] News Paper Article 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is celebrated for three days. The first day is called Appa Karthigai, the second Vadai Karthigai and the final day is called Thiru Karthigai, widely considered as the Karthigai day, when the main pooja is performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bharatmoms.com/blog/thiruvannamalai-karthigai-maha-deepam-the-festival-of-lights/ Tiruvannamalai Karthigai Maha Deepam - The Story Behind, Significance, Pooja Procedure and Food Recipes]&lt;/ref&gt; On Karthigai day, a huge fire lamp is lit up on the hill(in both temples), visible for several kilometers around. The fire (deepam) is called Mahadeepam. Hindu devotees visit the place, to pray and make offerings to lord [[Shiva]]. In 2016, due to the Maha [[Kumbh Mela]] of [[Ujjain Simhastha]], Karthikai Deepam will hold special significance, being celebrated on 12 December 2016, which being a Monday is symbolically attributed to God [[Shiva]], of the twelve [[Jyotirlinga]].&lt;ref&gt;Karthigai Deepam 12 December 2016(Monday)[http://www.drikpanchang.com/festivals/karthigai-deepam/karthigai-deepam-date-time.html#]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kārtikai chutru'''''  or '''''Kārtikai chuḻaṟtu''''' is a homemade [[charcoal]]-based hand-rotating [[Fire cracker|firecracker]]. This is crafted by youngsters and elders at the time of this festival at rural cities at [[Tamil Nadu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/improvised-firework-adds-colour-to-kaarthigai-deepam/article1393675.ece Improvised firework adds colour to Kaarthigai Deepam] [[The Hindu]] news paper December 13, 2008. This news paper refers to the [[Cuddalore district]] and city named [[Cuddalore]] where it is popular even these days people celebrate the festival with this firework&lt;/ref&gt; state in [[India]]. This cracker is very safe as it is made of [[Charcoal]] and constructed as a non-[[explosive]] craft. This cracker is handled with a long rope and rotated over the head clockwise, anti-clockwise, zig zag and any other pattern to make the display more fun. To maintain safety, the ropes used are either [[coir]] rope or [[jute]] rope. While rotating the ignited set-up of this cracker with the wind makes the charcoal to burn and split into small pieces which falls down. This burning effect can be compared with [[Chimney starter]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Chimney starter]] is similar kind of mechanism used, but it uses fuel to burn charcoal&lt;/ref&gt; This display can be compared with a [[fire performance]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rope [[fire performance]] is another form of fire dancing and twirling with fired ropes which needs special skills, because the rope is ignited with fuel&lt;/ref&gt; but the rope will not be ignited.

This cracker is made of Crushed and packed charcoal into [[Coconut]] shell. The packing is tightly placed inside 3 twigs or flexible wood stick or plant stem. The twigs are tied with ropes with a safety distance. Few burning charcoal is placed over the packing and blown hard or rotated until The packing gets slowly ignited. While the packing started ignited then it can be rotated faster with help of the rope. The falling pieces of burning charcoal pieces from the packing gives a fire cracker effect. The charcoal mixture can be mixed with dried [[palm (plant)|palm]] flower pieces for more sparkling effects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Crushed charcoal can be packed into layers of jute sack ([[Gunny sack]]) pieces

'''Lavender Graduation''' is an annual [[Graduation|graduation ceremony]] conducted at [[universities]] to honor [[LGBT]] students and acknowledge their accomplishments and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broderick|first=Patricia M.|date=2003-11-30|title=Colleges and Universities|journal=Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America|language=English|volume=1|pages=232-237|via=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/lavender-graduation|title=Lavender Graduation|work=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by [[Ronni Sanlo]], a Jewish lesbian keynote speaker in LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronnisanlo.com/about.htm|title=About Ronni|publisher=Ronnisanlo.com|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavender Graduation is an informal complement to an institution's formal commencement ceremony, rather than a replacement.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/05/03/lavender-graduation-tradition-celebrates-lgbt-students/|title=Lavender Graduation tradition celebrates LGBT students|work=USA TODAY College|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Sanlo began this tradition because she was denied access to attend her own children's graduations due to her sexual orientation. Sanlo mentions that up "until 1995, there were no ceremonies to honor our LGBT students. There were only ceremonies for students of various ethnicities and for other groups like ROTC, but nothing for our students, those to tend to feel most disenfranchised from their colleges and universities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campuspride.org/tools/lavender-graduation-a-time-for-celebration/|title=Lavender Graduation: A Time for Celebration|work=Campus Pride |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Lavender Graduation took place at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1995 with three graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/lavender-graduation|title=Lavender Graduation {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, over 200 colleges and universities offer lavender graduation ceremonies for their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/lavender-graduation|title=Lavender Graduation {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Ceremony==
Like other commencement ceremonies, lavender graduation ceremonies typically include a speaker—who can be a student or a guest—and a reading of graduates' names.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; Attendance is open to all members of the campus LGBTQ community, and students can also attend traditional commencement ceremonies. It is usually held before formal commencement.

The ceremony takes its name (and sometimes the color of tassels or other items given to students) from the significance of the color lavender in the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/lavender-graduation|title=Lavender Graduation {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Lavender (color)|date=2018-10-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lavender_(color)&amp;oldid=862225834|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Jonathan Saenz, President of Texas Values, a Texas based organization advocating for traditional family values, stated, “This special Texas A&amp;M ceremony essentially promotes and celebrates dangerous and risky sexual activity that can fiercely jeopardize a person’s well-being....I’m not sure this is the most responsible way for a university to prepare students for the real world.” Saenz saw this as a direct violation of the then ban on gay marriage. The A&amp;M Student Senate and one state Legislator unsuccessfully tried to delete funding from the LGBT resource.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, John. "Anti-gay Leader Says A&amp;M’s Lavender Graduation “celebrates Dangerous and Risky Sexual Activity”."

{{for|the Mexican actress|María Duval}}

The '''[[Maria Duval]] [[Psychic]] [[Confidence trick|Scam]]''' is one of the most successful mail scams in history, having [[Fraud|defrauded]] millions of people out of at least $200 million over twenty years. Targeting sick and elderly people through a combination of personalized letters and personal information databases, it has been shut down in the United States in 2016, but is still ongoing in many countries.

==History, scope and method==

[[File:Psychic-Maria-Duval.jpg|thumb|Maria Carolina Gamba as Maria Duval, in 2008.]]The scam originates from a purported psychic of Italian origin named Maria Carolina Gamba, using "Maria Duval" as her trade name. Gamba gave psychic consultations in the South of France and attained some measure of notoriety. Gamba sold the rights to the psychic services of "Maria Duval" and entered into a [[Contract|contractual arrangement]] a group of people who used those to promote the sale of [[astrology]] charts,&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt; possibly in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=cnn3/&gt; The new copyright holders (or perhaps people who bought in a subsequent transaction) developed the scam as it would be known throughout the world: using information available publicly or through newspaper advertising at first, then purchasing [[Data brokers|personal information marketing databases]], they would mail letters to potential victims, offering feats of divination by Maria Duval for $40.&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt;

According to an investigation by CNN journalists Melanie Hicken and Ellis Blake, the scam was controlled for some time by two European companies, Astroforce and Infogest, both being owned by [[Raëlism|Raëlian]] Jean-Claude Reuille, who eventually sold his assets to undisclosed buyers. The group that now operates the Duval scam may be using the same model with other psychics.&lt;ref name=cnn3/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn4/&gt;&lt;ref name=others/&gt;

The scammers targeted aged or sick people, typically promising psychic help to improve their health or finances. The $40 fee applied to each piece of a correspondence that could stretch over years. More expensive forms of assistance such as plastic [[Talisman|talismans]] and [[Crystal|crystals]] were also offered, some victims paying thousands of dollars per year.&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt;

The letters appeared to be hand-written and signed by Duval. They contained enough personal details to lead the victim to believe the person sending them might indeed have psychic powers. Even though at some point thousands of letters were generated per week, the scammers took great care to make them look as authentic as possible, with coffee stains or pages of (computer-generated) paragraphs giving the appearance of a personal letter. Some victims would develop feelings of friendship for the Duval persona, which increased the amount of correspondence. The name Patrick Guérin would be used as Duval's psychic assistant, who also offered services, generating another revenue stream for the scam.&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DoJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=star/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaPresse/&gt;

Letters have been found in a dozen countries and generated revenues in excess of $200 million in the United States and Canada. The scam was managed by a series of successive groups using [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] to hide their involvement. Gamba, however, continued to receive payments and did some promotional work under the name Maria Duval, even occasional news appearances at some point. Gamba's son thinks her mother agreed to be used as the face of the scam out of a desire to become rich and famous, then felt she was unable to stop the ongoing relationship.&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt;

Early law enforcement investigations concluded Maria Duval may not actually exist, being a persona completely fabricated by scammers. That turned out to be incorrect when Ellis and Hicken, assisted by French colleagues, located Duval's residence in the south of France in 2016 and managed to interview her two years later.&lt;ref name=cnn5/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt; In August, 2018, they published "A Deal with the Devil: The Dark &amp; Twisted True Story Of One Of The Biggest Cons In History", which narrates their search for the elusive Maria Duval/Carolina Gamba.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

==Law enforcement investigations==

An investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) concluded in 2014 with some companies associated with the scam paying undisclosed amounts as out-of-court settlements. The DoJ also barred [[Hong Kong]]'s Destiny Research Center and [[Montreal]]'s Infogest Direct Marketing from sending letters to the United States (from Canada) and the criminal investigation targeting those two firms was still ongoing in 2018. Infogest flooded the United States with 56 million Maria Duval letters between 2006 and 2014&lt;ref name=nypost/&gt; and has been investigated for other scams, including one about bogus weight loss products.&lt;ref name=cnn3/&gt;&lt;ref name=DoJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=star/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaPresse/&gt; Canadian financial services PacNet was subsequently accused of laundering money from the American Maria Duval operations, among other questionable clients.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=breaker/&gt;

Investigators concluded the number of people scammed is considerable, including 1.4 million in the United States alone.&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt;

Gamba's residence in Callas was searched by French police and American investigators in March, 2018.&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt; The US Postal Inspection Service confirmed to CNN that a criminal investigation was under way as of July, 2018.&lt;ref name=cnn2018/&gt;

''' Tia Rigg''' (4 January 1998 – 3 April 2010) was a girl who was killed in [[Cheetham Hill]], [[Manchester]], England on 3 April 2010. Twelve-year-old Rigg was [[torture]]d, [[rape]]d and murdered by her maternal uncle, John Maden.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/04/tia-rigg-murdered-by-uncle|title=Tia Rigg tortured and murdered by uncle obsessed with child porn|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=4 October 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2010, 38-year-old Maden, who had pleaded guilty to the crime, was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a [[Life imprisonment (England and Wales)#Whole life tariff|recommendation that he should never be released]], meaning that he will likely remain in prison until he dies.

Sentencing, Mr Justice Keith said: "This is one of those exceptional cases in which the only just punishment requires you to be imprisoned for the rest of your life."&lt;ref name="cassidy"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Girl's Torture Killing: Uncle Jailed For Life|first=Kate|last=Cassidy|work=[[Sky News Online]]|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=4 October 2010|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201010115751526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
At 2:17pm on 3 April 2010, Maden, who had an "obsessive interest" in pornography relating to [[paedophilia]], rape and torture, telephoned Rigg's mother and asked for Tia to go to his home in Dalmain Close, Cheetham Hill, in order to [[babysitting|babysit]] his ten-year-old daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Uncle jailed for life over murder|date=4 October 2010|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/uncle-jailed-for-life-over-murder-14966369.html#ixzz11Qu0bCPk|accessdate=4 October 2010|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|location=Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{Cite news|title="I've just finished killing her now": Pervert uncle's chilling confession after he murdered Tia Rigg|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|location=Manchester|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=4 October 2010|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/crime/s/1341818_ive_just_finished_killing_her_now_pervert_uncles_chilling_confession_after_he_murdered_tia_rigg}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived at 3:00pm he drugged her with [[Olanzapine]], an [[antipsychotic]] [[tranquilizer]] that he had been prescribed.&lt;ref name=men /&gt;

He then inflicted a "horrific catalogue of sexual injuries" on her before stabbing her and strangling her with a [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligature]] made from a [[guitar string]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=men /&gt; At 3:45pm Maden telephoned the [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] [[emergency services]] number and said: "Hi, I would like to report a murder." He then gave his name and address and when asked by the operator what had happened he replied: "My niece has been murdered by me&amp;nbsp;... I have just finished killing her now." Asked why he had killed her he answered: "Because I felt like it" and terminated the call.&lt;ref name="men2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Full transcript of chilling 999 call by Tia Rigg's killer uncle John Maden|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|location=Manchester|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/crime/s/1342017_full_transcript_of_chilling_999_call_by_tia_riggs_killer_uncle_john_maden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers from [[Greater Manchester Police]] arrived at the address two minutes later. Maden opened the door to the officers, who described him as "chillingly calm", and directed them upstairs.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; They found Rigg's body face-up on the floor of a spare bedroom, naked except for her socks, with the ligature still fastened around her neck and her hands tied behind her back with shoelaces. Next to the body were two knives, a broom handle and a sex toy, all of which were stained with blood.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/man-jailed-for-life-for-torture-rape-and-murder-of-niece-12-2097093.html|title=Man jailed for life for torture, rape and murder of niece, 12|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[autopsy]] found that Rigg had suffered severe blood loss from her stab wounds and internal injuries, but the primary cause of death was ligature strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Uncle of Tia Rigg charged with her murder|first=Adam|last=Gabbatt|date=5 April 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=5 October 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/05/tia-rigg-uncle-charged-with-murder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=men/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Maden was tried at Manchester [[Crown Court]] on 4 October 2010. Prosecutor Gordon Cole [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] told the court: "In the year or so prior to April this year, the defendant had developed what can properly be described as an obsessive interest in images and literature relating to paedophilia, rape and torture. He had an extensive library of such materials which included literature dealing with methods of killing."&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

Police had found "hundreds of extreme images of child abuse and violent pornography" on Maden's laptop, plus more material on his mobile phone in folders named "snuff", "snuff stories" and "brutal rape".&lt;ref name=men /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc man"&gt;{{Cite news|date=4 October 2010|title=Manchester man who murdered niece will 'never be freed'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-11465359|accessdate=5 October 2010|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detective Chief Inspector]] David Warren, who led the investigation, revealed that Maden refused to explain his actions and had never shown remorse for the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Judge tells killer John Maden he will never be released from prison|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|location=Manchester|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/crime/s/1342169_judge_tells_killer_john_maden_he_will_never_be_released_from_prison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After pleading guilty to rape and murder, Maden was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Keith told him: "It is inescapable that Tia Rigg died because you decided to realise your fantasies about torturing and killing a young child. It is difficult to know how long Tia's ordeal lasted. The terror, the unimaginable pain you inflicted on her, the indignities you subjected her to while still alive. It was planned, it was premeditated and her agony must have been prolonged. This is one of those exceptional cases in which the only just punishment requires you to be imprisoned for the rest of your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Man jailed for life for rape and murder of his 12-year-old niece|first=Helen|last=Pidd|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/04/ukcrime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report issued regarding the case found problems with how social workers had handled Tia's care.

There have been 90 '''[[gubernatorial election]]s in the state of New York''' since 1777. The next one will be held on [[New York gubernatorial election, 2018|November 6, 2018]].

==General information==
Originally the term was three years long and began on July 1, the election being held in the last week of  April or May 1. In 1817, following the resignation of [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] after serving only eight months of his term, there was a new election, since the [[New York Constitution#Constitution of New York, 1777|1777 Constitution]] did not give the Lt. Gov. the right to succeed to the governor's office, and [[DeWitt Clinton]] was elected for a whole three-year-term. The [[New York State Constitutional Convention]] of 1821 reduced the term to two years – beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 – and moved the election to the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Due to this measure, DeWitt Clinton's own second term was cut short by half a year. Beginning with the election in 1876, the term was increased to three years again, beginning with the election in 1894 reduced to two years, and since the election in 1938 has its present duration of four years.

Although the candidates for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]] have always run on tickets with the governor's candidates, until the election of 1950 they were elected on separate ballots, so on several occasions (1826, 1846, 1850, 1906, and 1924) the governor and his lieutenant were elected of opposing tickets.

In only 15 of the total 89 elections the incumbent ran and was defeated.

The elected candidates are shown in bold face in the tables below.

Note: Governor Tompkins was elected US Vice President in November 1816, and he resigned in February 1817. Article XVII of the [[Constitution of New York, 1777|New York State Constitution of 1777]] said that "...as often as the seat of government shall become vacant, a wise and descreet freeholder of this State shall be, by ballot, elected governor,... which elections shall be always held at the times and places of choosing representatives in assembly..." This meant that, whenever a vacancy occurred, the Lt. Gov. did not succeed to the governor's office but administrated the state only until the end of the yearly term of the [[New York State Assembly]] on June 30, the successor being elected in April.

Note: John Jay received more votes than George Clinton, but on technicalities the votes of Otsego, Tioga and Clinton counties were disqualified and not counted, giving Clinton a slight majority. Under the [[New York Constitution|Constitution of 1777]], the votes were canvassed by a joint committee of the state legislature, six members each from the [[New York State Assembly|assembly]] and the [[New York State Senate|senate]]. The members were [[David Gelston]], [[Thomas Tillotson]], [[Melancton Smith]], David Graham, [[Pierre Van Cortlandt, Jr.]], David McCarty, [[Jonathan N. Havens]], [[Samuel Jones (NY comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], [[Isaac Roosevelt (politician)|Isaac Roosevelt]], [[Leonard Gansevoort]] and [[Joshua Sands (politician)|Joshua Sands]]. The state constitution said that the cast votes shall be delivered to the secretary of state "by the sheriff or his deputy". The ballots from [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]] were forwarded to the secretary of state by Sheriff Smith who was holding over in office until the appointment of a successor after his term had expired. The ballot box from [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]] was delivered to the secretary of state's office by a person without deputation who had received the box from the sheriff. The ballot box from [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]] was delivered to the secretary of state by the clerk of the special deputy appointed by the sheriff. The canvass committee disagreed on whether to allow these ballots to be counted. The question was referred to the [[U.S. Senator]]s from New York, Federalist [[Rufus King]] and Dem.-Rep. [[Aaron Burr]], for arbitration. King said all votes ought to be canvassed. Burr said that the ballots from Clinton County ought to be allowed, and the ones from Otsego and Tioga Counties should be rejected. Thereupon, a majority of the canvass committee (Gelston, Tillotson, Smith, Graham, Van Cortlandt, McCarty, and Havens) rejected the ballots from all three counties and declared George Clinton duly elected governor by a majority of 108 votes. The minority (Jones, Roosevelt, Gansevoort, and Sands) protested in writing. In Otsego County, John Jay had a majority of about 400, and discounting the small majorities for Clinton in Tioga and Clinton Counties, would have won the election. Clinton was accused by the Federalists of [[usurpation]] and the canvass committee of having made a partisan decision against the wishes of the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm04AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 ''History of Political Parties in the State of New-York'' by John S.

Notes:
*The election began on June 1, but due to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] it took some time to collect and count the votes, and the official result was announced on July 9. George Clinton accepted the office of Governor on July 11 and assumed its duties immediately, pending taking the oath as soon as he could safely leave his military command.
*There were no parties yet; the Democratic-Republican and Federalist Parties appeared only in 1789, and until then the candidacies were personal. Besides, the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor were not "running mates"; all candidates were voted for independently.
*The Committee of Safety (the governing body of the State of New York after the Constitutional Convention adjourned) endorsed Philip Schuyler for Governor and George Clinton for Lieutenant Governor, which led to Clinton's receiving votes for both offices and actually winning both. Clinton formally resigned the lieutenant governorship and Pierre Van Cortlandt was elected lieutenant governor in a special election in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IhGflokDzmAC&amp;pg=PA24 ''George Clinton: Yeoman Politician of the New Republic''] by John P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5663">'''NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc.''' was a [[competitive local exchange carrier]] focused on data transmission. It leased copper telephone lines from phone companies, then provided access to [[internet service provider]]s to provide [[DSL]] service to businesses and residents.

The company existed and failed during the [[dot-com bubble]].

==History==
The company was founded in 1997{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and went [[public company|public]] on May 5, 1999 via an [[initial public offering]] in which it sold 15 million shares at $24 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schiffrin--barroway-llp-announces-class-action-suit-against-northpoint-communications-group-inc-74018982.html | title=Schiffrin &amp; Barroway, LLP Announces Class Action Suit Against NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc. | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=November 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2000, [[Verizon]] agreed to acquire a 55% interest in the company and merge the companies' [[DSL]] businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NorthPoint Receives $150 Million Investment from Verizon; Permanent Financing Part of Agreement to Merge Companies' DSL Businesses|date=September 6, 2000|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northpoint-receives-150-million-investment-from-verizon-permanent-financing-part-of-agreement-to-merge-companies-dsl-businesses-73120512.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, as its customers failed to pay their bills, NorthPoint restated downwards its financial performance for the third quarter of 2000, lowering revenue from $30 million to $24 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB974755669583955075 | title=NorthPoint Restates Earnings; Loss Could Affect Verizon Deal | first=Shawn | last=Young | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 21, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abandons" /&gt; After the earnings restatement, Verizon terminated its acquisition agreement, claiming that a [[material adverse change]] had occurred.&lt;ref name="abandons"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/business/verizon-abandons-northpoint-deal.html | title=Verizon Abandons NorthPoint Deal | first=SETH | last=SCHIESEL | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 30, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/verizon-backs-out-of-northpoint-deal | title=Verizon backs out of NorthPoint deal | first=Jeffry | last=Bartash | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=November 29, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northpoint sued Verizon to force it to complete the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2589855/technology-law-regulation/verizon--northpoint-in-heated-dispute-over-dsl-merger-deal.html | title=Verizon, NorthPoint in heated dispute over DSL merger deal | first=Sami | last=Lais | work=[[Computerworld]] | date=November 30, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was settled out of court in July 2002, with Verizon agreeing to pay $175 million to Northpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/24/business/fi-verizon24 | title=Verizon Agrees to Settle NorthPoint Merger Suits | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 24, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Dark Gene''' was an [[aerial reconnaissance]] program run by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[History of the Iranian Air Force|Imperial Iranian Air Force]] from bases inside [[Iran]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. The program was run in conjunction with Project Ibex, which was a more traditional [[ELINT]] mission. The first operations were during the 1960s with support of Iran's former Shah. Dedicated aircraft, air-bases, and U.S. personnel were stationed at numerous sites in Iran and would regularly fly across the border into the USSR through potential holes in their radar coverage. The intention of the program was to test the effectiveness of Soviet air defence and interception and resulted in one confirmed and possibly more combat losses in engagements with Soviet aircraft.&lt;ref name=SpyFlight&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spyflight.co.uk/darkgene.htm |title=Project Dark Gene |date= 15 February 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation details and background==

Direct confrontation between the US and USSR was occurring or brewing in places like Indochina. Confrontation was usually limited to proxy wars often involving the use of advisers, trainers, and other specialised personnel of the proxy states. After the Korean War the USA undertook a series of direct reconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union, some at the time secret and highly successful and others that resulted in shootdowns and tense diplomacy such as the [[1960 U-2 incident]]. In order to continue gathering intelligence the USA needed to develop more and more sophisticated methods as the Soviet Defence became more advanced. Developments like the [[SR-71]] Blackbird and satellites were fueled by this.

The Shah of Iran, a U.S. ally who had come to power with help from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], offered to fund military intelligence operations against the USSR as part of the [[Cold War]]. The Shah feared the Soviet Union, in particular their relationship with neighbouring rival Iraq.&lt;ref name=WikiLeaks1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://213.251.145.96/cable/1972/02/72TEHRAN1164.html|title=72TEHRAN1164, ACCELERATION OF F-4ES FOR IRAN|author=US Embassy, Tehran|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211220556/http://213.251.145.96/cable/1972/02/72TEHRAN1164.html|archivedate=2011-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA, [[Rockwell International]], and Iranian businessman [[Albert Hakim]] (later involved in the [[Iran Contra Affair]]) paid bribes to senior members of the Shah's government and defence establishment to get the funding.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

According to US Embassy cables during the operations the Shah and Iran were of great importance to the US, in part due the close relations with the Iranian government and Iran's proximity to the USSR. In response to a request by the Shah to speed up a similar arms deal the US Embassy in Tehran advised; "Decision should also not overlook or underestimate importance of Iran for vital US national interests." The Embassy suggested that deliveries of an aircraft type to European Allies and even to the USAF should be considered for diversion to Iran due to the strength of this relationship and the urgency of the issue.

Operation Dark Gene and Operation Ibex were two ways the Iranians could help due to their strategic location, between the USSR and the Persian Gulf. The terrain (deep valleys) in the area offered the program a unique advantage as Soviet radar coverage had major holes. At first US pilots flying Iranian aircraft operated independently but over time Iranian personnel became more involved.

At a point during the operations, due to the risk of pilots ejecting over the USSR, excuses were worked out to explain why US pilots were found flying combat aircraft over the Soviet Union. The excuse they settled on was that the USAF pilots were training IIAF pilots in their new aircraft and simply got lost. Typically by this stage an Iranian would pilot while a USAF officer would navigate.

As the operations continued, the US provided the Iranian Air Force with advanced aircraft that were not offered to anyone else at the time such as the [[F-14]]. These operations ended with the [[Iranian Revolution]] and it is assumed that the ELINT equipment was ceded to the successor [[Iranian Air Force|Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]].

===Project Ibex===
Project Ibex was closely linked to Project Dark Gene. The same airfields were used and operations were often run in conjunction. In essence they can be considered the same operation, each with separate and overlapping objectives. One of the advantages of operating them together was the ELINT data that could be gathered when Soviet Air Defences were activated by a Project Dark Gene aircraft that was detected. The resulting emissions and activity would be recorded by Project Ibex aircraft on the Iranian side of the border.&lt;ref name=SpyFlight/&gt;

Funded by the Shah, the listening posts were constructed in Northern Iran by the CIA.&lt;ref name="Emery"&gt;{{cite book |last=Emery |first=Christian |year=2013 |title=US Foreign Policy and the Iranian Revolution: The Cold War Dynamics of Engagement and Strategic Alliance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfXRAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=127 |isbn=9781137329868 |access-date=July 6, 2015|ref={{harvid|Emery|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Iranian Revolution]], Iran maintained the facilities in "impeccable condition" despite having little or no knowledge about how to operate them.{{sfn|Emery|2013|p=123}} With the potential to provide information about Iraqi troop movements, CIA official [[George Cave (CIA agent)|George Cave]] advised [[Interim Government of Iran|Iran's interim government]] to make use the system.{{sfn|Emery|2013|p=127}}

==Combat==

Around four aircraft involved in the project may have been lost to Soviet interceptors during the project. Two of the unconfirmed aircraft are [[RF-5A]]'s piloted by USAF pilots, while a [[Northrop F-5|RF-5B]] with an IIAF pilot, one a reconnaissance mission is confirmed.&lt;ref name=SpyFlight/&gt;&lt;ref name=EjectionHistory/&gt;

===Detailed incident===

One instance of combat during Project Dark Gene was an engagement on November 28, 1973 between an RF-4C aircraft piloted by IIAF Major Shokouhnia and backseater [[USAF]] Colonel John Saunders and a Soviet MiG-21 flown by Captain Gennadii N. Eliseev. The Soviet pilot fired two [[Vympel K-13]] missiles at the Iranian aircraft, failing to destroy it. He was ordered from ground control to press his attack at any cost, and with his cannon jammed after the first shot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rusproject.org/node/1474|title=Captain Eliseev's last MIG(moment in Russian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; he continued by ramming into the Iranian aircraft and losing his life in the process. He struck the RF-4C's tail assembly with his wing and then flew into high ground. It was the first deliberate jet-to-jet ramming by a Soviet aircraft during an interception, a practice common in the propeller age of World War II. Eliseev was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded as a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ussrMedal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warlib.ru/index.php?id=000043 |title=Russian article on practice of ramming in Soviet Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of the RF-4C aircraft were captured by Soviet ground forces and released after 16 days.&lt;ref name=EjectionHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/country-by-country/iranian_f_4_phantom_losses.htm |title=Ejection History by Country |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710211447/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/country-by-country/iranian_f_4_phantom_losses.htm |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeroram.narod.ru/win/teor.htm |title=Article Describing ramming and mentioning this combat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar incidents===

In [[1978 Iranian Chinook shootdown|1978, 4 Iranian Chinooks]] strayed into the Soviet Union while training. One was damaged and one shot down by a Soviet pilot in a [[MiG-23 Flogger]]. The interception was possibly due to Project Dark Gene as the Soviets had increased their air defences on the Iranian border in response to prior incursions.

==Equipment==

Airbases involved were operated jointly by the CIA and IIAF and protected by land mines and razor wire. As part of the connection with IBEX there were 5 dedicated facilities for monitoring communications within the Soviet Union. Their contact with the outside world was maintained by air resupply only via de Havilland Canada [[DHC-4]] aircraft. Special equipment was provided by [[Rockwell International]] and funding was largely provided by the Shah of Iran.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Most of the following aircraft had custom electronic warfare packages installed for their missions. The Boeing 707s, for example, had 13 man crews operating internal surveillance equipment. Broadband and Narrow band receivers were used.&lt;ref name=SpyFlight/&gt;

The '''Pueblo Opera House''' (also known as the '''Grand Opera House''') was a theater built in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], and opened in 1890.  The building was completely destroyed by a fire in 1922.

In June 1888 the architectural firm of [[Adler &amp; Sullivan]] was contracted to design an opera house in Pueblo, Colorado.  They were to be paid $400,000, the largest fee the firm had yet received for a building outside of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Twombly, Robert (1986). ''Louis Sulllivan: His Life and Work''. New York: Elisabeth Sifton Books, Viking Penguin. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the four-story building was designed in a combination [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] and [[Italian Renaissance]] style, with rusticated Manitou red sandstone on a granite base.&lt;ref&gt;Twombly, pp. 244, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall seated 1,200 people, and the balcony was the first in the United States to "span an auditorium without intermediate buttressing".&lt;ref name="Elia"&gt;Elia, Mario Manieri (1996). ''Louis Henry Sullivan''. Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceiling and walls of the auditorium were covered with [[Louis Sullivan]]'s distinctive decorations.

Mario Elia, in his study of Sullivan and his work, suggests that the broad projecting roof was a detail contributed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who was employed at Sullivan's office at the time.&lt;ref name="Elia" /&gt; 

The building was topped by a tower.

On the night of February 28 – March 1, 1922, the Pueblo Grocers' Association's annual ball was held there, and it is believed that a cigarette may have ignited litter left behind after the event. The fire was discovered at 1:15 a.m., the roof collapsed at 1:50, and all the interior floors had given way by 2:10. Despite the fire department's efforts to save the building, it was a total loss.&lt;ref&gt; Engelbrecht, Lloyd C. (June 1985). "Adler &amp; Sullivan’s Pueblo Opera House: City Status for a New Town in the Rockies", ''The Art Bulletin''. College Art Association of America. p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rototom Sunsplash''' is a large European [[reggae]] festival, it takes place every summer at [[Benicassim]], a few miles north of [[Valencia]] in [[Spain]]. Since 1994 calls from various European countries thousands of reggae passionated people, thanks to concerts of international musicians, often many Jamaicans.

==The prelude. The Rototom Association and the disco in Zoppola and Gaio. 1991-1999==
Gaio di Spilimbergo, [[Province of Pordenone]], in the region of [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]]. This small town in Northern Italy between [[Venice]] and [[Udine]] is the starting point for an adventure called Rototom Sunsplash. On 13 December 1991 the Rototom Cultural Association was born and out of it the nightclub of the same name, where everything happened, was created. An alternative music scene, an authentic sound lab, and a stop off point for some of the greatest exponents on the world music scene: from punk to rock, reggae, indie and electronic music. A fusion that that is explained by the instrument that gave it its name: [[Rototom]], able to create different sounds, just like the atmospheres that were created in this venue. On moving in 1997 to what would be its second headquarters in [[Zoppola]], the Rototom Club spreads all of these genres in three different rooms all connected to create a “city of music”. One dedicated to rock, pop and rap; a second to reggae and African music where the typical sounds of the Sunsplash were and another dedicated to electronic music. Over the next nine years, it hosted shows by the [[Ramones]] (1993), [[Massive Attack]] (1998), [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], [[Suede]] and [[Soul Fly]]; legends like the father of Afro beat [[Fela Kuti]] and reggae greats such as [[Burning Spear]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Black Uhuru]], [[Inner Circle (band)|Inner Circle]], [[U-Roy]], [[Yellowman]], [[Itals]], [[The Meditations]], [[Junior Reid]], [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], [[Misty in Roots]], [[The Gladiators (band)]], [[Pablo Moses]], [[Shaggy (musician)]], [[Buju Banton]] among many others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rototomsunsplash.com/en/rototom/our-history/|title=Our history - Rototom Sunsplash|work=Rototom Sunsplash|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1998-1999. Lignano. The Camping Girasole evolution==
The second phase of Rototom Sunsplash has but one name: the camping Girasole. Summer 1998. Unable to absorb the capacity, the festival moves to [[Latisana]] Maritima near [[Lignano]], near the tourist resort town of [[Venice]].

Sunsplash already had the structure that it evokes today: here it transforms a real reggae town with three stages and complementary cultural areas capable of housing thousands of residents: in this new headquarters the 8,000 festivalgoers from the last year in Gaio become 20,000. The event goes from three to four days and with more scheduled timetable. In Lignano the Rototom Sunsplash becomes a mass phenomenon, a pole of attraction for those beyond that of the music or to simply watch the live show of a certain artist, it married with a philosophy that is intrinsic to reggae: peace, love and respect.

The level that the festival reached is reflected in several anecdotes, like for instance that in its premiere in Lignano, the restaurants’ stocks ran out the first day of the four day event. Or that the beer went from being measured in barrels, like in Gaio, to being measured in tanks. Also as a part of this explosive growth the festival include the first international broadcast of its concerts via streaming (1999 through Arcoiris TV), the launch of Reggae Train, departing from Rome and with stops in Florence, Bologna, Padua and Venice, along with a free 24 hour coach service from Lignano and a nursery for young audiences.

It is also here that the ‘Italian Reggae Award‘ is first organised. The director of the Jamaican [[Reggae Sunsplash]], Mr. Rae Barret, was invited to choose from the best Italian bands at the festival, to become the first group to represent Italy at the festival in Jamaica. Reggae National Ticket took the honours, and that marked the launching of the musical career on the Caribbean island of the singer, [[Alborosie]], whose career is directly linked to the Rototom Sunsplash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==2000-2009. Osoppo: The European Leap==
In the summer of 2000 the Rototom Sunsplash changed its surrounds once again and moved its headquarters to [[Osoppo]] ([[Udine]]). If Lignano represented its ‘professionalization’ and consolidation as a cultural and musical landmark event in Italy, Osoppo is crucial to its growth from national meeting to being a European festival. Its proximity to [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Germany]] expanded the boundaries of the event and balanced the handicap of its geographic isolation in a small town of 3,000 inhabitants.

In the 250,000 square meters of the Rivellino Park in Osoppo the festival assumes the dimensions that have accompanied it to the present. It is reconfigured as a holiday destination to spend four to eight days (and subsequently nine and ten days) with a clear differentiation between the festival with ‘day’ activities -the concerts are more spaced out- and night, with all its musical prominence. The '''Camping Area''' becomes a highlight, in the natural park at the foot of [[the Alps]], which favours moments for meeting and socializing among the thousands of festival goers from around the world -150,000 people on average for ten consecutive editions in Osoppo- and helps forge a sense of belonging to the Rototom family. And to create the atmosphere of pacifism, tolerance and multiculturalism that define the event. The number of stages increase (Showcase, Dub Room) and the line-up to continues to add even more of the greats of the reggae scene, with exclusive events in Europe, and the rising stars of the Jamaican genre.

The extra-musical areas take shape, supported by the extension of the space: the '''Social Forum''' dedicated to conferences and debates with sociologists, politicians, religious representatives and intellectuals; '''African Village''' and Living Energy ('''Pachamama''' today) with sessions of capoeira, percussion and African dance courses; spaces for meditation and ones with seminars devoted to natural medicine and to Rastafarian philosophy; as well as areas with creative workshops for children. The '''Reggae University''' is also gestated, for the exchange of experiences between artists and audience.

[[Osoppo]] also represents a change in the organizational structure with more specialized equipment (the Media Office is developed) that include European partners and unquestionable international projection linked to an increase in foreign audiences. The web is translated into seven languages (English, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Slovenian and German) and bus routes are organized across several countries.

The promotion of reggae culture is reflected in initiatives such as the '''European Reggae Contest''' aimed at gathering talent emerging bands (2002-2015).

The self-management system of the Rototom Sunsplash project -based on obtaining income solely through ticket sales and the absence of effective sponsors- proves itself in this phase. In 2003, a decade after its launch, the festival zeroed debt. That same year leaves us a concert to remember, for its hypnotism and intensity, in the history of Rototom: that of [[Burning Spear]].

The golden moment of the Rototom Sunsplash for music, public and projection refers to is darkened by the political and judicial persecution that it begins to suffer from the government in the hands of the right. The fusion and coexistence of cultures that the event promoted clashed with the policy of closing borders that formed a part of the nationalist discourse of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and his Northern League partners. The situation became more complicated following the adoption in 2006 of the Fini-Giovanardi law, declared unconstitutional in 2014 and, which, among other things, proposed up ten years in prison for tolerating the use of drugs such as cannabis inside spaces with leisure and cultural activities. The law criminalized the event –of which it was acquitted in 2015- to the point that it was forced to move from Italy to [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==2010 Up to Today. Benicàssim: Present and Future==
Rototom Sunsplash begins its exodus, and as in all exodus, there is a corresponding promised land. The festival finds it in Spain, in [[Benicàssim]] ([[Province of Castellón]]) to be specific.

On July 12, 2009 the last edition in Osoppo ends and on the 24th of that same month an Italian expedition of five head to Spain. After seven months of searching and tours of [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], [[Salamanca]] and even to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], in February 2010 an agreement with the city of Benicàssim it is reached. The extensive camping area attached to the Benicàssim concerts venue is what shifts the balance. The town in Castellon, that summer hosted the first Spanish Rototom, the 17th in its history, and is where the event continues today.

Benicàssim represents the consolidation of the macrostructure formed in Italy, which continues to grow: more stages and extra-musical areas such as '''Rototom Circus''', in a space of 500,000 square meters that doubles the reggae town created in Osoppo. Its public also grows, with an average of 230,000 people per edition and which has also seen its familiar and child friendly profile grow.

It represents a jump from European to world event. Spain opens the doors for the Rototom Sunsplash to [[Latin America]] and it becomes even more international. Proof of this is the celebration from 2011 to 2015 of the '''Reggae Contest Latino''' and implementation of festival's global presentation road shows.

Benicàssim adds to the festival's lure with beaches, which reinforces its format as a holiday destination during the event's week of celebrations. Anecdotally, it leaves the weather concerns of the pre-Alpine climate in Osoppo and the habitual wind and torrential rain of the environment in Friuli.

The new and current phase of the festival has maintained the principles and values that guide the actions of the Rototom Sunsplash, as an emblem of defending peace, environment, human rights and sustainable development. The slogan linked to the macro-event, another world is possible, is still alive in Benicàssim as is the community born around [[reggae]] and festival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Matisyahu controversy==
In August 2015, the festival took the political stance of disinviting the American reggae artist [[Matisyahu]] after he refused to state his personal opinion regarding the proposed [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.671389 Reggae Singer Matisyahu Disinvited From Music Fest for Not Endorsing Palestinian State]&lt;/ref&gt; Matisyahu is not [[Israel]]i, but he is [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theolympian.com/entertainment/celebrities/article31497305.html Jewish group sends Spain's leader letter about Matisyahu]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matisyahu stated that he never includes his own political views in his shows, he declined to clarify his previous statements in question. It was also reported that other musicians threatened to cancel their performances unless Matisyahu made the declaration supporting Palestinian statehood.

Many human rights groups and the Spanish government suggest that the banning had anti-Semitic overtones. The Spanish foreign minister said: "Imposing a public declaration (from Matisyahu), puts into question the principle of non-discrimination on which all plural and diverse societies are based."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jns.org/news-briefs/2015/8/19/spanish-festival-reinvades-matisyahu-after-anti-semitism-backlash#.VdYw8WJdXy0 Spanish music festival reinvites Matisyahu after anti-Semitism backlash]&lt;/ref&gt; The concert included singer [[Capleton]], whose lyrics call for murder of gays and lesbians, was not disinvited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6664189/spanish-officials-condemn-matisyahu-concert-cancellation Spanish Officials Condemn Matisyahu Concert Cancellation]&lt;/ref&gt;

After strong reactions from various critics and the accusations of anti-Semitism Rototom Sunsplash admitted that cancelling Matisyahu's performance was the wrong decision. The artist was then reinvited to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=412598 Spanish reggae festival re-invites Matisyahu]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an official statement issued on their web page Rototom Sunplash said: «Rototom Sunsplash rejects anti-Semitism and any form of discrimination towards the Jewish community; we respect both their culture as religious beliefs and we sincerely apologize for what has occurred».

'''Scott W. Rothstein''' (born June 10, 1962) is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and [[chief executive officer]] of the now-defunct '''Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler''' law firm. He was accused of funding his philanthropy, political contributions, law firm salaries, and an extravagant lifestyle with a $1.2 billion [[Ponzi scheme]], one of the largest such in history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savemoneytips.com/10-largest-ponzi-scheme-proprietors-of-the-21st-century/10 largest financial fraud proprietors of the 21st century&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 2009, Rothstein turned himself in to authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO).&lt;ref&gt;

Rothstein was denied bond by U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who ruled that due to his ability to forge documents, he was considered a [[fugitive|flight]] risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/media/acrobat/2009-12/50820067.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206014511/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/media/acrobat/2009-12/50820067.pdf# |archive-date=2009-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

On June 9, 2010, Rothstein received a 50-year prison sentence after a hearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale,&lt;ref&gt;

His firm had 70 lawyers and 150 employees, with offices in [[Boca Raton]], [[West Palm Beach]], [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Miami]], [[Tallahassee]], [[Florida]], [[New York City]] and [[Caracas, Venezuela]]. The firm focused on labor and employment matters, [[civil rights]], [[intellectual property]], [[internet law]], [[corporate espionage]], [[personal injury]], [[wrongful death]], commercial [[litigation]], [[real estate]], [[mergers and acquisitions]], and governmental relations.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web

Until he was permanently disbarred by the Florida Supreme Court on November 25, 2009, Rothstein was a member of the [[Florida Bar]] and admitted by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. He had been given an AV Preeminent peer review rating by [[Martindale-Hubbell]]. The AV rating is a significant accomplishment and a testament to the fact that a lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence.

Rothstein may have stolen millions of dollars from an investment side-business.&lt;ref&gt;

On November 3, 2009, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury]] agents served a warrant to search the firm's Fort Lauderdale offices. Rothstein sent an email in recent weeks to firm lawyers asking them to investigate which countries refused to extradite criminal suspects to either the U.S. or [[Israel]], and firm lawyers responded that [[Morocco]] is one such country. Rothstein had wired $16 million to an individual in Casablanca&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;

and left for [[Casablanca]] on October 26, 2009. On October 31, 2009, he sent a [[suicide]] [[text message]] note to all of his law partners:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sorry for letting you all down. I am a fool. I thought I could fix it, but got trapped by my ego and refusal to fail, and now all I have accomplished is hurting the people I love. Please take care of yourselves and please protect Kimmie [Rothstein's wife]. She knew nothing. Neither did she, nor any of you deserve what I did. I hope God allows me to see you on the other side. Love, Scott.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 3, 2009, after many texts by Stuart Rosenfeldt, the president of the firm, urging him to "choose life", Rothstein returned to Fort Lauderdale on a chartered jet, (chartered by the ex-husband of Governor Crist's wife, Todd Rome)&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;

from [[Casablanca]]. On November 2, his law firm with only $117,000 in its operating account filed suit against him, asked a judge to dissolve the firm, accusing him of misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars from investor trust accounts in a Ponzi scheme from an investment business he covertly ran out of his law office.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;

== Background and career ==
Rothstein was born in the [[Bronx]] and moved with his parents to [[Lauderhill, Florida]] as a teenager. A 1988 Juris Doctor graduate of Fort Lauderdale's [[Nova Southeastern University]]'s Law School, and a 1984 Bachelor of Arts graduate of [[University of Florida]], Rothstein's law career began in 1988 and, for nearly fifteen years, he was relatively unknown. His local mentors were wealthy attorneys, [[Donald McClosky]] and [[Bill Scherer]].

In the early 90's, Rothstein first partnered with attorney Howard Kusnick. First located in Plantation, Florida, Kusnick &amp; Rothstein, P.A. subsequently moved to downtown Ft. Lauderdale. Longtime partner Michael Pancier first joined him there.

In 2000, Rothstein joined with Rosenfeldt as a name partner at the Hollywood firm, Phillips Eisinger Koss &amp; Rosenfeldt, P.A., which became known as Phillips Eisinger Koss Rothstein &amp; Rosenfeldt, P.A

In February 2002, Rothstein and Rosenfeldt started their own firm, first known as Rothstein &amp; Rosenfeldt, P.A. Within a month, Pancier was added as a name partner. In July, 2002, adding Susan Dolin, a well-regarded employment lawyer, now practicing on her own in West Broward, the firm became known as Rothstein, Rosenfeldt, Dolin &amp; Pancier, P.A..

In late 2004, the firm became known simply as Rothstein Rosenfeldt, with Adler being added in March 2005. Melissa Britt Lewis, who was murdered in March, 2008, was with Rothstein from the firm's beginning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In seven years, he and his partners expanded the firm to 70 lawyers, including former Boca Raton Mayor and sitting [[Palm Beach County]] Commissioner Steve Abrams; former judges Julio Gonzalez, Barry Stone, and former Palm Beach circuit judge, William Berger; TV and radio legal commentator and former prosecutor, Ken Padowitz; Carlos Reyes, former South Broward Hospital District commissioner and lobbyist; Arthur Neiwirth, a bankruptcy expert; and Les Stracher, former legal counsel for Morse Auto Group, who represents major auto dealers.&lt;ref name="browardbeat.com" /&gt;

Others include: Shawn Birken, son of Circuit Court Judge Arthur Birken; Ben Dishowitz, son of County Court Judge Dishowitz;
and Grant Smith, son of disgraced former Congressman Larry Smith. Andrew Barnett is Corporate Development Officer, and David Boden, a New York attorney not licensed in Florida, was the firm's general counsel.&lt;ref&gt;

== Recent ==
On September 8, 2011, U.S. District Judge James I. Cohn granted the government's motion to prohibit videotaping Rothstein during a scheduled deposition of him, citing "serious harm" and "security reasons that are unusual in nature."  The exact reasons for the judge's decision were sealed.  This fueled speculation that his appearance was altered or he was a mafia target due to his cooperation with the prosecution against the mafia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On June 8, 2011, federal prosecutors filed a motion with the sentencing judge informing him that they would be asking for a sentence reduction for Rothstein.&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"/&gt; However, on September 26, 2017, prosecutors withdrew their motion for a reduced sentence, saying that he had provided "false material information" in violation of his plea agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article175441131.html|title=Why Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein won't get his 50-year sentence reduced|author1=Jay Weaver|publisher=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothstein's name does not appear in the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] inmate database. This indicates he is being held under an alias, which would not be unusual given that he cooperated with the government.

As of November 18, 2009, many of the associates have relocated: Five lawyers moved to Fort Lauderdale-based Rice Pugatch Robinson &amp; Schiller. Steven Lippman and Richard Storfer will be new partners. Riley Cirulnick, George Zinkler and Jodi Cohen are new associates.&lt;ref&gt;

An observant Jew, Rothstein grew up in a small Bronx apartment, sharing a bedroom with his sister. His father was a salesman "back in the days when you carried a bag up and down the streets of New York." The family moved to Lauderhill, Florida in 1977, when Rothstein was 16. His grandmother used her life savings to help put him through school. "I grew up poor. I'm a lunatic about money."

In March 2005, he bought a neighboring home belonging to [[Miami Dolphins]]' [[Ricky Williams]] for $2.73 million.

Rothstein at one time was a minority shareholder of Edify LLC, a health-care benefits consulting company. State Representative Evan Jenne-D-Dania Beach is a $30,000 company consultant, who previously worked a local bank. Rothstein hired Jenne's father, former sheriff and convicted felon, [[Ken Jenne]], as a consultant at his law firm days after Jenne was released from prison on corruption charges. An attorney for Rothstein's law firm serves as the registered agent for Evan Jenne's company, Blue Banyan. Grant Smith, a lifelong friend of Evan Jenne's, is an Edify lobbyist. Edify has worked closely with the state Department of Health to develop wellness programs and also influences certain health-care legislation.&lt;ref&gt;

=== "The Great Gatsby" ===
In the 2008 interview at his law firm, Rothstein described himself and told how he controlled all aspects of the firm's management:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is where the evil happens. Look, I sleep in the bed I make. I tend toward the flashy side, but it's a persona. It's just a fucking persona.... People ask me, 'When do you sleep?' I say I'll sleep when I'm dead. I'm a true [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]. I joke around that there are 43 people living in my head and you never know what you're going to get. There are some philanthropists in there, some good lawyers, and I like to think some good businessmen. There are also some guys from the streets of the Bronx that stay hidden away until I need them. Does that sound crazy? I am crazy, but crazy in a good way.&lt;ref name="browardpalmbeach.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His personal office was opulent, with security and a compartmentalized layout. Anyone entering Rothstein's suite of offices had to use an intercom. He could exit, unseen through a second door. In the hallway, an ordinary looking brown door is actually the elevator door. Dozens of surveillance cameras and microphones hang from office ceilings. On his desk: four computer screens and the [[Five Books of Moses]].&lt;ref name="miamiherald2"&gt;

Outside his personal office hung a painting of [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather]]''. The walls of Rothstein's office and other hallways are lined with photos of himself and politicians including Gov. [[Charlie Crist]], former U.S. Senator [[Mel Martinez]], Senator [[John McCain]], [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] Sheriff [[Al Lamberti]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Joe Lieberman]], and [[Bill McCollum]].&lt;ref name="browardpalmbeach.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miamiherald2" /&gt;

He was ostensibly an affluent and successful attorney with all the material trappings of a flamboyant lifestyle, including armed body guards and police protection. Twenty-eight city police officials, including captains, majors, undercover officers and the department spokesman, helped guard his home and businesses, the only person in the department's history to have permanent round-the-clock off-duty police protection at his home. The department suspended all work for Rothstein on November 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="miamiherald4"&gt;

On August 27, 2009, Stone, the recipient of Rothstein's sponsorship of his blog until July 29, 2009, "StoneZone", wrote a column recommending Rothstein for the seat vacated by Senator [[Mel Martinez]]- a man with "a distinguished legal record, has been a key supporter of Governor Crist and John McCain, has an unmatched record of philanthropic activities and would bring an unconventional style of getting things done to Washington. Add Rothstein to the short list."&lt;ref&gt;

He could not write or read a business plan. Rothstein was a lawyer, not an entrepreneur." Stone claims that Rothstein has [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] (ADD) "so severe he never finished a martini, a cigar, a thought, or a sentence, never mind a transaction." According to Stone, neither law firm name partner Russell Adler nor Stuart Rosenfeldt were signatories on the RRA Trust Account.&lt;ref name="stonezone.com" /&gt;

On October 31, 2009 his firm sponsored at a charity golf tournament featuring former Gov.

Between 2007 and 2008, he donated $2 million to the [[American Heart Association]], [[Women in Distress]], [[Alonzo Mourning]] Charities, Here's Help, and the [[Dan Marino]] Foundation.

Politicians of both parties have pledged to donate to charity or return his political contributions.

=== Law partner murder ===
Debra Villegas, who handles his money, is the law firm's [[chief operating officer]]. She is co-owner with Rothstein in a home at 2307 Castilla Isle, as of May 2009. According to records, Rothstein originally purchased the property in September 2007, for $1.75 million, and sold it for $10 to a shell corporation in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091127060546/http://southflorida.blockshopper.com/property/504212130210/2307_castilla_isle/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the year the Ponzi scheme allegedly began, Villegas earned $80,000 a year. In 2007, her salary had increased to $145,000. Villegas received two Swiss watches — a [[Rolex]] and a Breitling — from her "employer". Rothstein paid off her couch and a bedroom set and held title to her two [[Honda]] water scooters. Villegas was living in a $475,000 Weston home that Rothstein signed over to her in July 2009 for $100 and "love and affection," according to the deed. Villegas registered a 2009 $100,000 [[Maserati]] GranTurismo at the home in January, 2009. In November 2009, Federal prosecutors seized the home, alleging that it was among Rothstein's ill-gotten assets.&lt;ref&gt;

Villegas' estranged husband, Tony Villegas, was charged on [[circumstantial evidence]] in the March 2008 murder in [[Plantation, Florida]] of Melissa Britt Lewis, a partner in Rothstein's firm. Although early news reports wondered at whether the evidence was substantial, according to New Times, "Nine days later, forensic testing revealed that Tony's DNA had been found on Melissa's suit jacket – the same jacket she wore on the day she died."&lt;ref&gt;

As a result of the homicide and the nature of the legal business, Rothstein has a team of "executive protection specialists" to guard the firm and his family, his teen-aged daughter. The prosecutor who had first worked on the Villegas case, Howard Scheinberg, went to work for Rosenfeldt Rothstein Adler. Villegas, a train conductor, remains in jail awaiting trial. The motive was supposedly revenge for Lewis's closeness with Debra.&lt;ref&gt;

=== "Disbarment on consent" ===
On November 17, 2009, the [[Florida Bar]] Executive Committee voted to accept a request by Rothstein to be disbarred. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] entered an order permanently disbarring Rothstein on November 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/summaries/briefs/09/09-2146/Filed_11-25-2009_Order_Disbarment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein was removed from the [[Broward County]] Grievance Committee, and his name has also been removed from the database of '''''The Best Lawyers in America'''''.&lt;ref name="sun-sentinel1" /&gt;

=== Trust account ===
Rothstein, Rosenfeldt, and Adler's trust account was part of the [[Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts]] (IOLTA) program that was paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to the [[Florida Bar]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;

== $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme ==
Rothstein's investment scheme involved purchasing what were initially mislabeled as fabricated "structured settlements," described as where people sell large settlements in legal cases for lump sums of cash. Alan Sakowitz, an attorney and real estate developer in Bay Harbor Islands, said that he contacted the FBI in September with concerns about Rothstein.&lt;ref&gt;

On Sunday, November 8, 2009, Sakowitz appeared with Kendall Coffey, attorney for Rothstein's law partners, on the Michael Putney Show on WPLG-TV, MIAMI, correcting Coffey for claiming that Rothstein's "investments" involved structured settlements, which they did not. (Note: "structured settlements" as defined by Rothstein in press reports do not meet the definition in IRC 5891(C)(1) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]). Rothstein's resemble investments in pre-settlement funding&lt;ref&gt;

or pre-settlement financing. In his December 12, 2011 deposition page 24 lines 15-23, Scott Rothstein himself said "It was intentionally made in a way and presented to that firm and the other firms that were looking at the structure issue that it was merely a purchase of dollars already in-house; '''that it was not a structured settlement''' because the true definition of a structured settlement is when someone is actually receiving payments over time that has some other value. '''We didn't have a true definition of a structured settlement, not by any of the statutes. From that perspective '''we had reason to make sure that this was not structured'''. Because when you're dealing with structured settlements you need other levels of Court approval. It would have required the manufacturer of literally hundreds of phony orders, '''which would have led the entire scheme to detection'''.''''&lt;ref&gt;http://structuredsettlements.typepad.com/structured_settlements_4r/2012/01/scott-rothstein-deposition-ponzi-scheme-not-structured-settlements.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI estimates the loss to be up to a billion dollars from lucrative [[whistle-blower]] and [[employment discrimination]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;

The investors would make up-front cash payments to individuals owed money from the court cases to buy the right to collect the full amount of the settlements later.&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt; The investor was guaranteed a minimum of 20 percent investment returns in as little as three months.

=== Swindle pitch ===
General counsel David Boden was present for at least one of the swindles, and negotiated the final papers with the investors' lawyers. Rothstein greets and informs the investor his firm was the preeminent sexual harassment law firm in the country. He says he'd figured out a basic formula which was that someone with $10 million net worth was usually willing to pay $2 million in cash to pay off their mistress. The key was confidentiality. Rothstein tells the investor that he would meet potential defendants in his office and would question them about affairs they had with an employee. The defendants would deny it. He pointed to artwork, and said there was a television screen behind it. He tells the investor he turned on a video of the guy having sex with his mistress, and told his client "We can either settle this now, or I can depose your wife, your mistress, you and your son about it." Since defendants" often couldn't or wouldn't pay the entire settlement up-front, Rothstein tells the investor that his first harassment case many years ago, involved a $3.5 million settlement and a million-dollar legal fee, so Rothstein assigned the settlement to a good friend and the plaintiff settles for $3 million without a trial. The "good friend" stood to be paid $3.5 million once the defendant paid up, a half-million dollar profit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In 20 years, I have never seen a defendant sue on breach of settlement," Rothstein told them. "The whole idea is that it's secret. Why would they sue?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although it did not appear completely legitimate, and it might have appeared that the plaintiffs were short-changed, it makes sense to the potential investor. The idea seems solid. The investor thinks that with enough of these cases at Rothstein's law firm, he could make huge sums of money.

Rothstein then discusses other larger cases: [[Eli Lilly and Company]], involving $1.4 billion with plaintiff representation by Gary Farmer, a firm attorney who negotiated the settlement and who brought the case with him when he arrived at the firm. Several inside whistleblowers went to the fed with unlawful practices regarding the marketing and sales of an anti-psychotic medication called [[Zyprexa]]. It was one of the largest [[qui tam]] cases in history.

He tells the investor about a potential (allegedly fabricated) case where investors would buy whistle-blower million dollar settlements with a sixty percent short term investor profit. The arrangement would be completely secret; the investor would never know the name of the company or the whistle-blower. The settlement money would be deposited into a trust account at TD Bank, accessible only to the investor at the appropriate time. David Boden follows up with all questions and negotiates the contract.&lt;ref&gt;

On November 2, 2009, Broward Chief Judge Vic Tobin sent an e-mail at 6:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. to judges about the Rothstein case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I learned of some very distressing news yesterday. Whoever draws the case try to set the motion today because of the amount of clients and money involved.

===Shimon Levy and Ovi Levy===
Shimon Levy allegedly has had deep ties to [[Israeli mafia|Israeli organized crime]] and spent a year in an Israeli prison for hiding a mob figure suspected of two "grisly murders". In 1997, his partner at the Sea Club Resort on Fort Lauderdale beach, Zvika Yuz, was a victim of a murder which remains unsolved. His son, Ovi contacted the Plantation Police Department and began receiving protection during the time Rothstein fled to Morocco.&lt;ref name="browardpalmbeach5" /&gt;

=== Banyan Capital ===
Banyan Income Fund, a Fort Lauderdale-based hedge fund, invested hundreds of millions. It was run by Rothstein and involves Fort Lauderdale businessman George G. Levin, who reported Rothstein to the U.S. Attorney's Office for "suspicious activity." According to the lawsuit, Frank J. Preve is [[Chief Operating Officer]] and kept an office inside Rothstein et al. He is a convicted [[bank fraud]] and [[embezzlement]] [[felony|felon]]. He pleaded guilty to bank embezzlement charges in 1985 and received ten years [[probation]] and a $10,000 fine for falsifying loan documents in another fraudulent scheme.&lt;ref name="browardpalmbeach3" /&gt; Banyon and other Rothstein investors' accounts were held at a Toronto-Dominion Bank branch in Fort Lauderdale.&lt;ref name="miamiherald3" /&gt;

Levin has a pattern of filing complaints when his unsavory/fraudulent business ventures are exposed. According to federal court documents, from 1985–1996 Levin's former business GGL Industries, dba Classic Motor Carriages defrauded hundreds of customers, selling kit cars. The federal government filed criminal charges against the company and GGL pleaded guilty to [[mail fraud]] in 1999 and agreed to pay $2.5 million in restitution.

Stuart Rado had been a consumer activist who organized GGL's victims and helped spur the government action. Levin subsequently sued Rado for violating the [[Florida Trade Secrets Act]]. Rado was diagnosed with cancer during the lawsuit. It was a classic frivolous SLAPP suit ("Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation"). On September 19, 1997, the finding against Mr. Rado was that he pay plaintiff's attorneys' fees.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The federal motion states:

GGL's fraudulent scheme necessarily included as an intricate part the silencing of its critics, among whom was Rado. It did this by using the courts to intimidate Rado into being silent and causing Rado to spend money he could not afford. It was GGL's intention (as one of GGL's attorneys said to Rado [in a 1994 deposition]) to make Rado's net worth go south. GGL and its attorneys forced Rado to incur the expenses of defending two lawsuits for over 4 years. Rado had to incur these expenses and live day-to-day with a barrage of pleadings, depositions and other legal maneuvers by GGL. He had to endure this even though he did nothing legally wrong, and even though GGL was in fact at the same time continuing to perpetrate its nationwide fraud. Rado was being put through this because Rado dared to contact some of GGL's victims and tell them that if they were injured by GGL they should contact the Florida Attorney General for help. What is even more despicable is that GGL knew that Rado was dying of cancer but continued to pursue him with motions and notices of trial and other pleadings, one such notice of hearing being served within days of brain surgery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although a convicted felon, GGL hounded Rado's estate for the payment of $80,000 in attorney's fees.

The state of [[Florida]] filed suit against the company alleging deceptive business practices and civil theft. A special assistant attorney general, Herbert Stettin, led the investigation. Stettin is now the [[trustee]] overseeing the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler bankruptcy case.

Levin continues to sell kit cars under a different company name, StreetBeasts.&lt;ref&gt;

According to a [[Florida District Court of Appeals]] case published in 2002, Levin acquired property free and clear for less than the cost of the first mortgage, through a [[fraudulent transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estatetaxlawyers.com/articles/2002%20Bankruptcy%20Reform%20Update.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Partners' income strategy and Rothstein's returns ====
The allegations are: George Levin was the general partner ("GP") who solicited each limited partner ("LP") to contribute at least $1 million. Initially, each LP contributed $250,000, subject to periodic capital calls up to the amount of their commitments. They were promised 12% annually (15% for first $100 million), to be paid quarterly. The general partner had to maintain a balance of not less than 10% of all contributions after any quarterly distributions. The general partner also gave a "clawback" guaranty to all LP's equal to their original contributions. LP's could not request redemptions during an initial one-year "lock-up" period and were required to give 90 days' notice for any withdrawals. Redemptions would be paid from the GP's own capital account "to the extent available" with a 10% hold-back, but otherwise, only from the purchased lawsuits settlement stream.

Banyon had paid Rothstein's firm at least $656 million, but the law firm anticipated $1.1 billion over a maximum 24-month period. It allegedly received and reinvested about $500 million. Levin expected to make 40% over 24 months but to only pay out 24%. Rothstein's law firm's IOLTA trust accounts established "for the plaintiff" in the purported litigation settlements were used to fund the phony settlement accounts, after the law firm had paid its overhead, keeping its insolvent operation afloat, which included "gifts" to partners and money given to politicians, charities, and pay for a massive advertising budget, as well as Rothstein's personal lifestyle, over three years, amounting to approximately a $500 million loss.

The interest on the funded IOLTA accounts went to the Florida Bar monthly, which was many millions, based on the Banyon contributions. In its prospectus, Banyon claimed to have a legal opinion that Banyon's interest in the IOLTA trust accounts "perfected automatically on execution of the transfer documents" – that the lawsuit proceeds assignments created by general counsel, David Boden. The LP's were warned that they could be taxed on the Partnership's income and realized gains even if no distributions were made. As long as reinvestments were ongoing, the ponzi scheme was facilitated.&lt;ref name="browardpalmbeach2" /&gt;

'''Slimelight''' (sometimes referred to as '''Slimes''') is a [[London]] club night.  It is the longest running alternative-dark scene club event in the world, and has been at its present location, [[Electrowerkz]], since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrorizer.com/2010/11/29/slimelight/ |date=29 November 2010|title=Slimelight, London|publisher=terrorizer.com|accessdate=30 June 2013|first1=Miranda|last1=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club takes place every Saturday night from {{nowrap|11 pm}} until {{nowrap|7:30 am}}. The venue has 3 levels with 2 stages, and 5 distinct areas—usually Slimelight has 2 or 3 dance floors open. Most of the ground floor exists in its current state due to a pop up restaurant from [[Carsten Höller]] which co-existed with the club for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedoubleclub.co.uk/about/about.html|title=The Double Club / About|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320171857/http://www.thedoubleclub.co.uk/about/about.html|archivedate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of [[music genre]]s are played, pre-eminently:  [[electronic body music (EBM)]], [[futurepop]], [[electro-industrial]]/[[aggrotech]], [[darkwave]], [[goth rock]]/[[deathrock]], batcave, old-school [[synthpop]], [[coldwave]]/[[new wave music|new wave]], [[old-school EBM]], [[industrial music| industrial]]/[[post-industrial]] and crossover [[electronic music]] including [[minimal tech]], dark [[techno]] and dark [[trance music| trance]] {{ndash}} spread over 2 or 3 dance floors.  

Slimelight  was initially a private members only night club with a bring your own drink policy, and any new members would be required to be nominated by a minimum of two existing members. This changed in the late 90s when it became a licensed premises. During the club nights in the early nineties the club would often show art-house and alternative horror movies to entertain club goers when not dancing on the one dance floor playing a cross section of alternative music  before the second dance floor concentrating on goth music opened in 1991 leaving the existing floor to concentrate on industrial. The nights were frequented by people who wanted to express themselves freely by their sense of fashion with the majority of the club members in the mid nineties would be either new wave hippies, goths, industrial fans, or part of the fetish scene.

Pre Slimelight concerts take place on a regular basis which normally include free entry to the club, and from time to time live acts appear as part of actual club night. Artists who have appeared at Slimelight over the years include [[VNV Nation]], [[The Crüxshadows]], [[Assemblage 23]], [[Velvet Acid Christ]] and [[Nitzer Ebb]].

The club night started out in the 1980s as a squat in Ladbroke Grove, London. At that time it had the name the Kitkat Club at the Pleasure Dive.

The club's facilities were rather basic when it was first started. The name comes from the fact that for a brief period in the summer of 1987 the club was held in a disused church on [[High Holborn]], and "The Slimelight" is a parody of [[The Limelight]], another famous club of that era which was also located in a church in London's Shaftesbury Avenue. Over the years the club has been renovated and upgraded to feature all the mod cons of a proper nightclub, however it retains much of its decaying, abandoned feeling, due partly to the architecture and the state of disrepair of some facilities.

'''''The Jackson 5ive''''' is a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] [[Television series|series]] produced by [[Rankin/Bass]] and [[de Passe Entertainment|Motown Productions]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 11, 1971 to October 14, 1972; a fictionalized portrayal of the careers of [[Motown Records|Motown]] recording group [[the Jackson 5]]. The series was rebroadcast in [[television syndication|syndication]] through during the 1984–1985 Saturday morning season, during a period when [[Michael Jackson]] was riding a major wave of popularity as a solo artist. It also briefly re-aired in 1999 on [[TV Land]] as part of their "Super Retrovision Saturdaze" lineup. The series was animated mainly in London at the studios of [[John Halas|Halas]] and [[Joy Batchelor|Batchelor]], and some animation done at Estudios Moro, [[Barcelona]], Spain and [[Topcraft]], Japan. The director was Spanish-American Robert Balser.

==Overview==
Due to high demands on the group, the roles of [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]], and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] were played by voice actors, with records of the group's songs being used for the musical tracks of the show. The group did make some contribution to the cartoon in the form of live photographs of each member morphing into a cartoon which was shown in the title screen medley. Although the musical scenes of the cartoon were chiefly animation, an occasional live-action footage of a concert or music video of the Jackson 5 would be spliced into the cartoon series. The actual Jackson 5 also contributed to the show by posing for pictures prior to the cartoon's debut which were used as posters, newspaper clips and ''[[TV Guide]]'' spots advertising the forthcoming TV series.

Though [[Berry Gordy]] did not provide the original voice (his character was voiced by [[Paul Frees]]) nor advertised his name, his character was frequently involved as the "adult figure" to the group. [[R&amp;B]]/[[Pop music|Pop singer]] [[Diana Ross]] contributed to voice her fictionalized self in the debut episode. The premise of the show is that the Jackson Five would have adventures similar to ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks]]'' or ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', with the unique addition being that Berry Gordy, the manager of the band in the show's universe, would come up with an idea for [[publicity]] for the band, such as having to do farm work or play a concert for the [[President of the United States]]. The series was followed by ''[[The Jacksons (TV series)|The Jacksons]]'', a live action variety show, in 1976.

===Music===
A specially recorded medley of five Jackson 5 #1 hits—"[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]", and "[[Mama's Pearl]]"—served as the show's theme song.  Each episode would feature 2 songs by the Jackson 5.  The songs were derived from their albums ''[[Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5]]'', ''[[ABC (The Jackson 5 album)|ABC]]'', ''[[Maybe Tomorrow (The Jackson 5 album)|Maybe Tomorrow]]'', and ''[[Third Album]]''. In the newer episodes, from 1972, eight songs were derived from Michael Jackson's album ''[[Got to Be There]]'' and two songs from the Jackson 5 album ''[[Lookin' Through the Windows]]''.

===Pets===
Because Michael Jackson owned many pets in real life, a few pets were added as extra characters to the cartoon.  They included Michael's pet rats, Ray and Charles (alluding to singer [[Ray Charles]], one of his idols), and his pet snake Rosey 'The Crusher' (who is male).  Other than the mice chirping, the pets never spoke, but usually either attributed to assistance, mischief or joining the Jackson brothers in performances on the show.

===Laugh track===
{{Main|Laugh track}}
Like most 1970s-era Saturday morning cartoon series, ''The Jackson 5ive'' contained an adult [[laugh track]]. Rankin-Bass experimented with creating their own laugh track, a practice [[Hanna-Barbera]] had implemented in 1971. This was done to avoid paying large fees to [[Charley Douglass]], who edited laugh tracks onto the majority of network television shows at the time. Like Hanna-Barbera, Rankin/Bass isolated several snippets of canned chuckles from Douglass’ library, and inserted them onto the soundtrack. The laughs initially consisted of only loud eruptions; mild jokes received unnatural bouts of laughter, while other times, the laughter would erupt mid-sentence.

The studio had improved the process by the second season, using more modulated laughs culled from Douglass's 1971-1972 library. Laughs did not erupt mid-sentence like the first season and were better timed by Rankin/Bass sound engineers. The improved technique was also utilized for sister series ''[[The Osmonds (TV series)|The Osmonds]]''.&lt;ref name="Iverson"&gt;Iverson, Paul: "The Advent of the Laugh Track" Hofstra University archives; February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Hanna-Barbera's laugh track, Rankin/Bass provided a larger variety of laughs.&lt;ref name=Iverson /&gt;

Rankin/Bass ceased using laugh tracks after ''The Jackson 5ive'' and ''The Osmonds'' ended their original run.&lt;ref name="Iverson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">{{short description|Late Imperial Roman festival in honor of Tiber}}
[[File:0457 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà romana - Sarcofago Mattei Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|The Tiber, in the characteristic reclining posture of a [[river god]], on the [[Mattei sarcophagus]], in a detail from the scene of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] approaching [[Rhea Silvia]] for the union that produced [[Romulus and Remus]]]]

The '''Tiberinalia''' is a [[Roman festival]] of [[late antiquity]], recorded in the [[Chronography of 354|Calendar of Filocalus]] (354 AD), on August 17 ''([[Sextilis#Dates|XVI Kal. Sept.]])'', the same day as the archaic [[Portunalia]]. As a festival honoring [[Tiberinus (god)|Father Tiber]], it may reflect renewed Imperial patronage of traditional Roman deities, in particular the dedication made to ''Tiberinus'' by  the emperors [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284–305) and [[Maximian]]us.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.773 (= ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 626; Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 156 and 164, concurring with [[Attilio Degrassi|Degrassi]] and citing [[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.7.29–30 and 6.19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

August's festivals deal with themes of agricultural bounty ensured by sun and water, centering on the [[Volcanalia]] of [[Volcanus]] (Vulcan) on August 23.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Boin, ''Ostia in Late Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portunalia, like the Volcanalia, was represented in large letters on [[list of ancient Roman fasti|extant ''fasti'']], indicating that it was regarded as among the most ancient holidays that were on the calendar before 509 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 41, 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]] was originally a guardian of gateways and only later by extension a harbor god, and his relation to Tiber or Tiberinus as god of the [[Tiber river]] is debatable; some have seen the Tiberinalia as assimilating the archaic Portunalia.&lt;ref&gt;Boin, ''Ostia in Late Antiquity'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Mommsen]] inferred that the two gods were the same, but other scholars have rejected the identification.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varro]] says that the Portunalia marks the institution of a shrine ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]])'' to Portunus ''in portu Tiberino'', but the meaning of ''portus'' here is unclear; [[Ovid]] mentions ''atria Tiberina'' ("halls of Tiberinus").&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4.329; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''traffic collision''', also called a '''motor vehicle collision''' ('''MVC''') [[Traffic collision#Terminology|among other terms]], occurs when a [[vehicle]] [[collision|collides]] with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, [[road debris]], or other stationary obstruction, such as a tree, [[Utility pole|pole]] or building. Traffic collisions often result in injury, death, and property damage.

A number of factors contribute to the risk of collision, including [[vehicle design]], speed of operation, [[road design]], road environment, and driver skill, [[Driving under the influence|impairment due to alcohol or drugs]], and behavior, notably [[Speed limit enforcement|speeding]] and [[street racing]]. Worldwide, [[motor vehicle]] collisions lead to death and disability as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved.

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
In 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 68,000 of these occurred in children less than five years old.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt; Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions. Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitants]], accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles. While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants).&lt;ref name=WHO2013report&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2013/en/ |title=Global status report on road safety 2013: Supporting a decade of action |publisher=world health organization WHO |year=2013 |format=PDF |language=English, Russian |location=Geneva, Switzerland |isbn=978 92 4 156456 4 |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology== 
[[File:Car crash.jpg|thumb|An [[Opel Vectra]] involved in a [[rollover]] crash]]
[[File:Indonesian fire fighters during a traffic accident.jpg|thumb|A rolled over [[box truck]] being handled by [[fire fighters]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]
{{see also|Road collision types}}
Traffic collisions can be classified by general types. Types of collision include [[head-on collision|head-on]], [[run-off-road collision|road departure]], [[rear-end collision|rear-end]], [[side collision]]s, and [[rollover]]s.

Many different terms are commonly used to describe vehicle collisions. The [[World Health Organization]] uses the term ''road traffic injury'',&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; World report on road traffic injury prevention |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the U.S. Census Bureau uses the term ''motor vehicle accidents (MVA),''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/transportation/motor_vehicle_accidents_and_fatalities.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225194017/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/transportation/motor_vehicle_accidents_and_fatalities.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 December 2007 |title=The 2009 Statistical Abstract: Motor Vehicle Accidents and Fatalities |work= |accessdate= |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Transport Canada]] uses the term "motor vehicle traffic collision" (MVTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/resources-researchstats-menu-847.htm |title=Statistics and Data - Road and Motor Vehicle Safety - Road Transportation - Transport Canada |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common terms include ''auto accident'', ''car accident'', ''car crash'', ''car smash'', ''car wreck'', ''motor vehicle collision'' (''MVC''), ''personal injury collision'' (''PIC''), ''road accident'', ''road traffic accident'' (''RTA''), ''road traffic collision'' (''RTC''), and ''road traffic incident'' (''RTI'') as well as more unofficial terms including ''smash-up'', ''pile-up'', and ''fender bender''.

Some organizations have begun to avoid the term "accident", instead preferring terms such as "collision", "crash" or "incident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trafficscotland.org/currentincidents/|title=Traffic Scotland &gt; Current Incidents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/travel/8714914/incidents/road|title=M1 Motorway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the term "accident" implies that there is no-one to blame, whereas most traffic collisions are the result of [[driving under the influence]], [[Speed limit#Excessive speed|excessive speed]], distractions such as mobile phones or other risky behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/science/its-no-accident-advocates-want-to-speak-of-car-crashes-instead.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=It's No Accident: Advocates Want to Speak of Car 'Crashes' Instead|date=2016-05-22|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fnews%2fwonk%2fwp%2f2015%2f08%2f24%2fwhen-a-car-crash-isnt-an-accident-and-why-the-difference-matters%2f%3f|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|title=When a car 'crash' isn't an 'accident' — and why the difference matters|date=2015-08-24|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in the United States, the use of terms other than "accidents" had been criticized for holding back safety improvements, based on the idea that a [[Organizational culture#Arthur F Carmazzi|culture of blame]] may discourage the involved parties from fully disclosing the facts, and thus frustrate attempts to address the real [[root cause]]s.&lt;ref name=times69&gt;{{cite news |url= |publisher=The Times |work=The Times |date=11 March 1969 |title=Cars And Drivers Accident prevention instead of blame |first=Geoffrey |last=Charles |quote=Quoting from JJ Leeming in ''Accidents and their prevention'': "Blame for accidents seems to me to be at best irrelevant and at worst actively harmful." ... "Much of the Leeming case is that by attributing blame and instituting proceedings against the motorist, the law virtually guarantees that none of the participants will be wholly truthful, so that the factors that really led to the accident are never discovered." |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

===Psychological===
Following collisions, long-lasting [[psychological trauma]] may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.org.au/nova/070/070key.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106143550/http://www.science.org.au/nova/070/070key.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-06 |title=The Shocking Truth about Road Trauma - Key text |author=Academy staff |publisher=Austrian Academy of Science |date=September 2004 |work=NOVA - Science in the News |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues may make those who have been in a crash afraid to drive again. In some cases, the psychological trauma may affect individuals' life can cause difficulty to go to work, attend school, or perform family responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Dennis J.|last2=Moffic|first2=H. Steven|last3=Turkal|first3=Nick W.|title=Post-traumatic Stress Reactions Following Motor Vehicle Accidents|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 August 1999|volume=60|issue=2|pages=524-530|url=https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0801/p524.html|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
A number of physical injuries can commonly result from the [[Blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] caused by a collision, ranging from bruising and contusions to catastrophic physical injury (e.g., paralysis) or death.

==Causes==
A 1985 study by K. Rumar, using British and American crash reports as data, suggested 57% of crashes were due solely to driver factors, 27% to combined roadway and driver factors, 6% to combined vehicle and driver factors, 3% solely to roadway factors, 3% to combined roadway, driver, and vehicle factors, 2% solely to vehicle factors, and 1% to combined roadway and vehicle factors.&lt;ref name="Lum&amp;Reagan"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Harry Lum |author2=Jerry A. Reagan | title = Interactive Highway Safety Design Model: Accident Predictive Module | publisher = Public Roads Magazine | date = Winter 1995 | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/95winter/p95wi14.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the severity of injury in crashes is more important than reducing incidence and ranking incidence by broad categories of causes is misleading regarding severe injury reduction. Vehicle and road modifications are generally more effective than behavioral change efforts with the exception of certain laws such as required use of seat belts, motorcycle helmets and graduated licensing of teenagers.&lt;ref name=Rob4th&gt;Robertson, LS. Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition. Free online at www.nanlee.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human factors===
 [[File:Novak 7 (5451438566).jpg|thumb|Man with visible facial scars resulting from a car collision]]
Human factors in vehicle collisions include anything related to drivers and other road users that may contribute to a collision. Examples include driver behavior, visual and auditory acuity, decision-making ability, and reaction speed. 

A 1985 report based on British and American crash data found driver error, [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about 93% of crashes.&lt;ref name="Lum&amp;Reagan"/&gt;

[[Distracted driving|Drivers distracted by mobile devices]] had nearly four times greater risk of crashing their cars than those who were not. Dialing a phone is the most dangerous distraction, increasing a drivers’ chance of crashing by 12 times, followed by reading or writing, which increased the risk by 10 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/science/driving-distractions-study.html?ref=technology&amp;_r=0|title=Reading This While You Drive Could Increase Your Risk of Crashing Tenfold|last=ST. FLEUR|first= NICHOLAS|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Royal Automobile Club Foundation|RAC]] survey of British drivers found 78% of drivers thought they were highly skilled at driving, and most thought they were better than other drivers, a result suggesting overconfidence in their abilities. Nearly all drivers who had been in a crash did not believe themselves to be at fault.&lt;ref name=rac&gt;{{cite web | title = I'm a good driver: you're not! | publisher = Drivers.com | url = http://drivers.com/article/157 | date = 11 February 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey of drivers reported that they thought the key elements of good driving were:&lt;ref name=young/&gt;
* controlling a car including a good awareness of the car's size and capabilities
* reading and reacting to road conditions, weather, road signs and the environment
* alertness, reading and anticipating the behavior of other drivers.

Although proficiency in these skills is taught and tested as part of the driving exam, a "good" driver can still be at a high risk of crashing because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the feeling of being confident in more and more challenging situations is experienced as evidence of driving ability, and that 'proven' ability reinforces the feelings of confidence. Confidence feeds itself and grows unchecked until something happens – a near-miss or an accident.&lt;ref name=young/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An [[AXA]] survey concluded Irish drivers are very safety-conscious relative to other European drivers. However, this does not translate to significantly lower crash rates in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/motoring/motoring/8-out-of-10-irish-drivers-feel-safer-on-our-roads-%11-axa-survey/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510030311/http://www.galwayindependent.com/motoring/motoring/8-out-of-10-irish-drivers-feel-safer-on-our-roads-%11-axa-survey/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 May 2009 |title=Home |publisher=Galway Independent |accessdate=15 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying changes to road designs have been wide-scale adoptions of [[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]] alongside law enforcement policies that included drink-driving laws, setting of speed limits, and speed enforcement systems such as [[speed cameras]]. Some countries' [[driving test]]s have been expanded to test a new driver's behavior during emergencies, and their hazard perception.

There are demographic differences in crash rates. For example, although young people tend to have good reaction times, disproportionately more young male drivers feature in collisions,&lt;ref name=rospa&gt;{{cite web | format = PDF | url =http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/conferences/congress2006/proceedings/day2/thew.pdf | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102117/http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/conferences/congress2006/proceedings/day2/thew.pdf | dead-url =yes | archive-date =2008-02-16 | title =
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Conference Proceedings | first = Rosemary | last = Thew | publisher = Driving Standards Agency | year = 2006 | quote = Most at risk are young males between 17 and 25 years }}&lt;/ref&gt;
with researchers observing that many exhibit behaviors and attitudes to risk that can place them in more hazardous situations than other road users.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme2/pdfgoodbadtalenteddriver.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102117/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme2/pdfgoodbadtalenteddriver.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-02-16 | format = PDF | publisher = Transport Research Laboratory | edition = Road Safety Research Report No. 74 | title = The Good, the Bad and the Talented: Young Drivers' Perspectives on Good Driving and Learning to Drive |date=January 2007 | accessdate = 4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is reflected by [[actuaries]] when they set insurance rates for different age groups, partly based on their age, sex, and choice of vehicle. Older drivers with slower reactions might be expected to be involved in more collisions, but this has not been the case as they tend to drive less and, apparently, more cautiously.&lt;ref name=older&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme3/forecastingolderdriveraccide4767 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206140331/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme3/forecastingolderdriveraccide4767 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-02-06 | title = forecasting older driver's accident rates | publisher = [[Department for Transport]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Attempts to impose traffic policies can be complicated by local circumstances and driver behavior. In 1969 Leeming warned that there is a balance to be struck when "improving" the safety of a road:&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt;

Conversely, a location that does not look dangerous may have a high crash frequency. This is, in part, because if drivers perceive a location as hazardous, they take more care. Collisions may be more likely to happen when hazardous road or traffic conditions are not obvious at a glance, or where the conditions are too complicated for the limited [[Human factors|human machine]] to perceive and react in the time and distance available. High incidence of crashes is not indicative of high injury risk. Crashes are common in areas of high vehicle congestion, but fatal crashes occur disproportionately on rural roads at night when traffic is relatively light.

This phenomenon has been observed in [[risk compensation]] research, where the predicted reductions in collision rates have not occurred after legislative or technical changes. One study observed that the introduction of improved brakes resulted in more aggressive driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sagberg, Fosser, &amp; Saetermo | title = An investigation of behavioral adaptation to airbags and antilock brakes among taxi drivers | publisher = Accident Analysis and Prevention | edition = 29 | pages = 293–302 | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another argued that compulsory seat belt laws have not been accompanied by a clearly attributed fall in overall fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | format = PDF | title = The efficacy of seat belt legislation | last = Adams | first = John | publisher = SAE Transactions | year =  1982 | url = http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most claims of risk compensation offsetting the effects of vehicle regulation and belt use laws have been discredited by research using more refined data.&lt;ref name=Rob4th/&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Hans Monderman]]'s studies of driver behavior led him to the realization that signs and regulations had an adverse effect on a driver's ability to interact safely with other road users. Monderman developed [[shared space]] principles, rooted in the principles of the [[woonerf|woonerven]] of the 1970s. He concluded that the removal of highway clutter, while allowing drivers and other road users to mingle with equal priority, could help drivers recognize environmental clues. They relied on their cognitive skills alone, reducing traffic speeds radically and resulting in lower levels of road casualties and lower levels of congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Streets ahead |author=Ben Hamilton-Baillie |date=Autumn 2005 |publisher=Countryside Voice |url=http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/Countryside_Voice1.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2008|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413195637/http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/Countryside_Voice1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some crashes are intended; [[staged crash]]es, for example, involve at least one party who hopes to crash a vehicle in order to submit lucrative claims to an insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;Lascher, Edward L. and Michael R. Powers. "The economics and politics of choice no-fault insurance." Springer, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, in the 1990s, criminals recruited Latin immigrants to deliberately crash cars, usually by cutting in front of another car and slamming on the brakes. It was an illegal and risky job, and they were typically paid only $100. Jose Luis Lopez Perez, a staged crash driver, died after one such maneuver, leading to an investigation that uncovered the increasing frequency of this type of crash.&lt;ref&gt;Dornstein, Ken.

====Motor vehicle speed====
The U.S. Department of Transportation's ''Federal Highway Administration'' review research on traffic speed in 1998.&lt;ref name="usdot_fha"&gt;{{cite web |title= Synthesis of Safety Research Related to Speed and Speed Limits| publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |url=http://www.safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa09028/resources/Synthesis%20of%20Safety%20Researc...pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528062458/http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa09028/resources/Synthesis%20of%20Safety%20Researc...pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The summary says:
* The evidence shows the risk of having a crash is increased both for vehicles traveling slower than the average speed, and for those traveling above the average speed.
* The risk of being injured increases exponentially with speeds much faster than the median speed.
* The severity/lethality of a crash depends on the vehicle speed change at impact.
* There is limited evidence suggesting lower speed limits result in lower speeds on a system-wide basis.
* Most crashes related to speed involve speed too fast for the conditions.
* More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of traffic calming.

The Road and Traffic Authority (RTA) of the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) asserts speeding (traveling too fast for the prevailing conditions or above the posted [[speed limit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Problem definition and countermeasures |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/speedandspeedcameras/problemdefinitionandcountermeasures.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021121013858/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/speedandspeedcameras/problemdefinitionandcountermeasures.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 November 2002 |publisher=NSW Roads and Traffic Authority |accessdate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a factor in about 40 percent of road deaths.&lt;ref name="nswrta_index"&gt;{{cite web |title=The biggest killer on our roads |publisher=NSW Roads and Traffic Authority |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/speedandspeedcameras/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021121011800/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/speedandspeedcameras/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 November 2002 |accessdate=5 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RTA also say speeding increases the risk of a crash and its severity.&lt;ref name="nswrta_index"/&gt;  On another web page, the RTA qualify their claims by referring to one specific piece of research from 1997, and writes "research has shown that the risk of a crash causing death or injury increases rapidly, even with small increases above an appropriately set speed limit."&lt;ref name="nswrta_speeding"&gt;{{cite web |title=Speeding research |publisher=NSW Roads and Traffic Authority |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/speedandspeedcameras/speedingresearch.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021121012527/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/speedandspeedcameras/speedingresearch.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 November 2002 |accessdate=5 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contributory factor report in the [[Road Casualties Great Britain|official British road casualty statistics]] show for 2006, that "exceeding speed limit" was a contributory factor in 5% of all casualty crashes (14% of all fatal crashes), and "traveling too fast for conditions" was a contributory factor in 11% of all casualty crashes (18% of all fatal crashes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Road Casualties Great Britain: 2006 |publisher=UK Department for Transport |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/162469/221412/221549/227755/rcgb2006v1.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2008|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413195635/http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/162469/221412/221549/227755/rcgb2006v1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Driver impairment====
Driver impairment describes factors that prevent the driver from driving at their normal level of skill. Common impairments include:

;Alcohol
{{Main article|Driving under the influence}}

[[File:Relative risk of an accident based on blood alcohol levels.png|thumb|alt=A graph showing exponential growth in collisions with increasing alcohol consumption.|Relative risk of collisions based on blood alcohol levels&lt;ref name="www.infrastructure.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/1997/pdf/Speed_Risk_1.pdf |title=www.infrastructure.gov.au |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to the [[Government of Canada]], coroner reports from 2008 suggested almost 40% of fatally injured drivers consumed some quantity of alcohol before the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/roadsafety/tp15145e.pdf |title=Road Safety in Canada|format=PDF |work=Transport Canada |page=17|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

;Physical impairment
Poor [[Visual perception|eyesight]] and/or [[Disability|physical impairment]], with many jurisdictions setting simple sight tests and/or requiring appropriate vehicle modifications before being allowed to drive;

;Youth
Insurance statistics demonstrate a notably higher incidence of collisions and fatalities among drivers aged in their teens or early twenties, with insurance rates reflecting this data. These drivers have the highest incidence of both collisions and fatalities among all driver age groups, a fact that was observed well before the advent of mobile phones.

Females in this age group exhibit somewhat lower collision and fatality rates than males but still register well above the median for drivers of all ages. Also within this group, the highest collision incidence rate occurs within the first year of licensed driving. For this reason, many US states have enacted a [[zero-tolerance]] policy wherein receiving a moving violation within the first six months to one year of obtaining a license results in automatic license suspension. No US state allows fourteen year-olds to obtain drivers’ licenses any longer.

;Old age
[[Old age]], with some jurisdictions requiring driver retesting for reaction speed and eyesight after a certain age.

;Sleep deprivation
[[Image:Hours of service FMCSA study.svg|thumb|300px|A graph outlining the relationship between number of hours driven and the percent of commercial truck crashes related to driver fatigue.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/regulatory-impact-analysis.htm |title=Regulatory Impact and Small Business Analysis for Hours of Service Options |access-date=February 22, 2008 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BpCaCibk?url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/regulatory-impact-analysis.htm |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Various factors such as fatigue or sleep deprivation might increase the risk, or numbers of hours driving might increase the risk of an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaywood|first1=A|title=Drive Right for Safety and Savings|date=1982|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Drug use
Including some [[prescription drug]]s, [[over the counter drug]]s (notably [[antihistamine]]s, [[opioid]]s and [[muscarinic antagonist]]s), and [[illegal drug]]s.

;Distraction
Research suggests that the driver's attention is affected by distracting sounds such as conversations and [[Mobile phones and driving safety|operating a mobile phone while driving]]. Many jurisdictions now restrict or outlaw the use of some types of phone within the car. Recent research conducted by British scientists suggests that music can also have an effect; [[classical music]] is considered to be calming, yet too much could relax the driver to a condition of distraction. On the other hand, [[hard rock]] may encourage the driver to step on the acceleration pedal, thus creating a potentially dangerous situation on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoniac.com/science/hard-rock-and-classic-music-could-lead-to-road-accidents.html |title=Hard-Rock and Classic Music Could Lead to Road Accidents, New Survey Says |publisher=Infoniac.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell phone use is an increasingly significant problem on the roads and as the U.S. [[National Safety Council]] compiled more than 30 studies postulating that hands-free is not a safer option, because the brain remains distracted by the conversation and cannot focus solely on the task of driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.nsc.org/Portals/0/Documents/DistractedDrivingDocuments/Cognitive-Distraction-White-Paper.pdf|title=Understanding the Distracted Brain, Why Driving While Using Hands-Free Cell Phones is Risky Behavior|publisher=National Safety Council|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intent====
Some traffic collisions are caused intentionally by a driver. For example, an accident may be caused by a driver who intends to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Samantha|title=The Brutal Truth About Car Crash Suicide|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-brutal-truth-about-car-crash-suicide|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=The Daily Beast Company LLC|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accidents may also be intentionally caused by people who hope to make an insurance claim against the other driver, or may be staged for such purposes as insurance fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crosby|first1=Rachel|title=24 face fraud charges in Las Vegas car crash scheme|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/24-face-fraud-charges-in-las-vegas-car-crash-scheme/|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staged Collisions:  Separating Accidents from  Fraud|url=https://www.iii.ie/upload/publications/docs/No.7_StagedCollisions.pdf|website=Insurance Institute of Ireland|accessdate=3 December 2017|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor vehicles may also be involved in collisions as part of a deliberate effort to hurt other people, such as in a [[vehicle-ramming attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Ken|title=Police: Lansing man deliberately caused crash that injured woman|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2017/07/06/police-lansing-man-deliberately-caused-crash-injured-woman/457153001/|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=Lansing State Journal|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Combinations of factors
Several conditions can combine to create a much worse situation, for example:
* Combining low doses of alcohol and [[cannabis]] has a more severe effect on driving performance than either cannabis or alcohol in isolation,&lt;ref name = trl1&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/newsletters/roadsafetypart1alcoholdrugsa4708#TopOfPage| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070129195543/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/newsletters/roadsafetypart1alcoholdrugsa4708| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2007-01-29| title = Road Safety Part 1: Alcohol, drugs, ageing &amp; fatigue | date = Spring 2003 | edition = Research summary, TRL Report 543 | publisher = UK [[Department for Transport]] | accessdate = 1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or
* Taking recommended doses of several drugs together, which individually do not cause impairment, may combine to bring on drowsiness or other impairment. This could be more pronounced in an elderly person whose renal function is less efficient than a younger person's.&lt;ref name = trl2&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/newsletters/roadsafetypart1alcoholdrugsa4708| archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100202152507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/newsletters/roadsafetypart1alcoholdrugsa4708| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2010-02-02| title = Road Safety Part 1: Alcohol, drugs, ageing &amp; fatigue | date = Spring 2003 | edition = Research summary, [[Transport Research Laboratory]] Road Safety Report No. 24 | publisher = UK [[Department for Transport]] | accessdate = 1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, there are situations when a person may be impaired, but still legally allowed to drive, and becomes a potential hazard to themselves and other road users. Pedestrians or cyclists are affected in the same way and can similarly jeopardize themselves or others when on the road.

===Road design===
{{Main article|Highway engineering|Road safety}}
[[File:Ridge Route ca 1920 3.jpg|thumb|A potential long fall stopped by an early guardrail, ca. 1920. [[Guard rail|Guardrails]], [[median barrier]]s, or other physical objects can help reduce the consequences of a collision or minimize damage.]]

A 1985 US study showed that about 34% of serious crashes had contributing factors related to the roadway or its environment. Most of these crashes also involved a human factor.&lt;ref name="Lum&amp;Reagan"/&gt; The road or environmental factor was either noted as making a significant contribution to the circumstances of the crash, or did not allow room to recover. In these circumstances, it is frequently the driver who is blamed rather than the road; those reporting the collisions have a tendency to overlook the [[human factors]] involved, such as the subtleties of design and maintenance that a driver could fail to observe or inadequately compensate for.&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite book | title = Human Factors for Highway Engineers | author = Ray Fuller|author2=Jorge A. Santos  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZadFLmhzEy8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=maintenance%20programme&amp;f=false | page = 15 | year = 2002 | isbn =978-0080434124 | publisher = Emerald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that careful design and maintenance, with well-designed intersections, road surfaces, visibility and traffic control devices, can result in significant improvements in collision rates.

Individual roads also have widely differing performance in the event of an impact. In Europe, there are now [[EuroRAP]] tests that indicate how "self-explaining" and forgiving a particular road and its roadside would be in the event of a major incident.

In the UK, research has shown that investment in a safe road infrastructure program could yield a ⅓ reduction in road deaths, saving as much as £6 billion per year.&lt;ref name="gettingahead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsafetyfoundation.org/media/14940/getting%20ahead.pdf |title=Getting Ahead: Returning Britain to European leadership in road casualty reduction |accessdate=1 October 2008 |last=Hill|first=Joanne |format=PDF |publisher=[[Campaign for Safe Road Design]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A consortium of 13 major road safety stakeholders have formed the [[Campaign for Safe Road Design]], which is calling on the UK Government to make safe road design a national transport priority.

===Vehicle design and maintenance===
{{Main article|Automobile safety}}

[[File:Malibucrash.JPG|thumb|A 2005 [[Chevrolet Malibu]] involved in a [[rollover]] crash]]
;Seat belts
Research has shown that, across all collision types, it is less likely that [[seat belt]]s were worn in collisions involving death or serious injury, rather than light injury; wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of death by about 45 percent.&lt;ref name=ppr172&gt;{{cite book | title = Trends in Fatal Car Accidents: Analyses of data | work = Project Report PPR172 | publisher = [[Transport Research Laboratory]] |date=February 2007 | last = Broughton &amp; Walter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Seat belt legislation|Seat belt use]] is controversial, with notable critics such as [[Professor John Adams]] suggesting that their use may lead to a net increase in road casualties due to a phenomenon known as [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hidden Danger of Seat Belts|author=David Bjerklie|date=30 November 2006|publisher=Time Inc|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1564465,00.html|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, actual observation of driver behaviors before and after seat belt laws does not support the risk compensation hypothesis.
Several important driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law. Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia. Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law. Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund AK, Zador P | year = 1984 | title = Mandatory belt use and driver risk taking | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 41–53 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1984.tb00130.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Maintenance
A well-designed and well-maintained vehicle, with good brakes, tires and well-adjusted suspension will be more controllable in an emergency and thus be better equipped to avoid collisions. Some mandatory [[vehicle inspection]] schemes include tests for some aspects of [[roadworthiness]], such as the UK's [[MOT test]] or German [[TÜV]] conformance inspection.

The design of vehicles has also evolved to improve protection after collision, both for vehicle occupants and for those outside of the vehicle. Much of this work was led by automotive industry competition and technological innovation, leading to measures such as [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'s safety cage and reinforced roof pillars of 1946, Ford´s 1956 [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|''Lifeguard'']] safety package, and Saab and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]'s introduction of standard fit [[seatbelt]]s in 1959. Other initiatives were accelerated as a reaction to consumer pressure, after publications such as [[Ralph Nader]]'s 1965 book ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' accused motor manufacturers of indifference towards safety.

In the early 1970s, [[British Leyland]] started an intensive programme of vehicle safety research, producing a number of prototype [[Experimental Safety Vehicle|experimental safety vehicles]] demonstrating various innovations for occupant and pedestrian protection such as [[air bag]]s, [[anti-lock brakes]], impact-absorbing side-panels, front and rear head restraints, run-flat tires, smooth and deformable front-ends, impact-absorbing bumpers, and retractable headlamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety First: the SSV/SRV cars|work=AROnline|publisher=Keith Adams|url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?researchsrvf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008203617/http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?researchsrvf.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design has also been influenced by government legislation, such as the [[Euro NCAP]] [[Crash test|impact test]].

Common features designed to improve safety include thicker pillars, safety glass, interiors with no sharp edges, [[crumple zone|stronger bodies]], other active or passive safety features, and smooth exteriors to reduce the consequences of an impact with pedestrians.

The UK [[Department for Transport]] publish road casualty statistics for each type of collision and vehicle through its [[Road Casualties Great Britain]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/accidents/ | title = Annual transport accidents and casualties | publisher = UK Department for Transport | accessdate = 1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These statistics show a ten to one ratio of in-vehicle fatalities between types of car. In most cars, occupants have a 2–8% chance of death in a two-car collision.

;Center of gravity
Some crash types tend to have more serious consequences. [[Rollover]]s have become more common in recent years, perhaps due to increased popularity of taller [[SUV]]s, [[people carrier]]s, and [[minivan]]s, which have a higher [[center of gravity]] than standard passenger cars. Rollovers can be fatal, especially if the occupants are ejected because they were not wearing [[seat belts]] (83% of ejections during rollovers were fatal when the driver did not wear a seat belt, compared to 25% when they did).&lt;ref name=ppr172 /&gt;
After a new design of [[Mercedes Benz]] notoriously failed a '[[moose test]]' (sudden swerving to avoid an obstacle), some manufacturers enhanced suspension using [[Electronic Stability Control|stability control]] linked to an [[anti-lock braking system]] to reduce the likelihood of rollover. After retrofitting these systems to its models in 1999–2000, Mercedes saw its models involved in fewer crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fahrunfalle: Dank ESP verunglucken Mercedes-Personenwagen seltener (in German) | url=http://www.whnet.com/4x4/pix/esp_stat.jpg  | accessdate = 28 December 2007 | publisher = Mercedes Benz | format = Graph of accident share | quote = Road accidents are rare with ESP Mercedes passenger cars |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102118/http://www.whnet.com/4x4/pix/esp_stat.jpg &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, about 40% of new US vehicles, mainly the SUVs, vans and pickup trucks that are more susceptible to rollover, are being produced with a lower [[center of gravity]] and enhanced suspension with [[Electronic Stability Control|stability control]] linked to its [[anti-lock braking system]] to reduce the risk of rollover and meet US federal requirements that mandate anti-rollover technology by September 2011.&lt;ref name=ij &gt;{{Citation | title = U.S. to Require Anti-Rollover Technology on New Cars by 2012  | url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2006/09/15/72448.htm  | accessdate = 28 December 2007 | publisher = Insurance Journal | date = 15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Motorcycles
Motorcyclists have little protection other than their [[Motorcycle safety clothing|clothing]] and helmets.  This difference is reflected in the casualty statistics, where they are more than twice as likely to suffer severely after a collision. In 2005, there were 198,735 road crashes with 271,017 reported casualties on roads in Great Britain. This included 3,201 deaths (1.1%) and 28,954 serious injuries (10.7%) overall.
Of these casualties 178,302 (66%) were car users and 24,824 (9%) were motorcyclists, of whom 569 were killed (2.3%) and 5,939 seriously injured (24%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/162469/221412/221549/227864/227892/roadcasualtiesingreatbritain5108 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717143339/http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/162469/221412/221549/227864/227892/roadcasualtiesingreatbritain5108 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 17 July 2007 | publisher = [[Office of National Statistics]] | edition = Transport Statistics Bulletin | year = 2005 | title = Road Casualties in Great Britain, Main Results | accessdate = 1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological factors===
Studies in [[United States]] have shown that poor people have a greater risk of dying in a car crash than people who are well-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/01/the-hidden-inequality-of-who-dies-in-car-crashes/| title=The hidden inequality of who dies in car crashes| publisher=[[The Washington Post]]| date=2015-10-01| quote=''But that progress obscures a surprising type of inequality: The most disadvantaged are more likely — and have grown even more likely over time — to die in car crashes than people who are well-off''| accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car deaths are also higher in poorer states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/10/the-geography-of-car-deaths-in-america/410494/| title=The Geography of Car Deaths in America | publisher=[[The_Atlantic#CityLab|CityLab]]| date=2015-10-15| quote=''Car deaths are also higher in poorer states. The road death rate is negatively associated with GDP per capita (-.47) and even more so with per capita income (-.66).''| accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar studies in [[France]] have shown the same results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2016/08/GROSSETETE/56078a| title=Des accidents de la route pas si accidentels| publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]|language=fr| date=August 2016| first=Mathieu|last=Grossetete| quote=''Alors qu’ils ne représentent que 13,8 % de la population française âgée de 15 ans et plus, les ouvriers comptaient pour 22,1 % des 3 239 personnes décédées sur la route en 2007 et pour 19 % des blessés hospitalisés. À l’inverse, les cadres supérieurs, professions libérales et chefs d’entreprise (8,4 % de la population) ne totalisaient que 2,9 % des morts et blessés''| accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-actes-de-la-recherche-en-sciences-sociales-2010-4-page-38.htm| title=L’enracinement social de la mortalité routière| publisher=Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales|language=fr| date=2010| isbn=9782021030297 | first=Mathieu|last=Grossetete| accessdate=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to working-class people having less access to secure equipment in cars, having older cars which are less protected against crash, and must cover more distance to go to work each day.

===Other===
Other possibly hazardous factors that may alter a driver's soundness on the road includes:
* [[Irritability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mindell|first1=Jodi|title=A Clinical Guide to Pediatric Sleep|date=2010|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Following specifically distinct rules too bureaucratically, inflexibly or rigidly when unique circumstances might suggest otherwise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryan|first1=Carson|title=William Divot Mulligan|date=2008|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sudden swerving into somebody's blind spot without first clearly making oneself visible through the [[wing mirror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Visagie|first1=Brian|title=The K53 Yard Test Made Easy: A Practical Guide for Learner Drivers|date=2014|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unfamiliarity with one's [[dashboard]] features, [[center console (automobile)|center console]] or other interior handling devices after a recent car purchase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Diane|title=Integrated Safe Driving Information System Development: Final report|date=1979|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Traffic safety culture, a variety of aspects of [[safety culture]] could impact on the number of crashes.&lt;ref&gt;Varmazyar, S., Mortazavi, S. B., Arghami, S., &amp; Hajizadeh, E. (2016).

==Prevention==
A large body of knowledge has been amassed on how to prevent car crashes, and reduce the severity of those that do occur. See [[Road Traffic Safety]].

===United Nations===
Owing to the global and massive scale of the issue, with predictions that by 2020 road traffic deaths and injuries will exceed HIV/AIDS as a burden of death and disability,&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-60-PV.38 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=60 |meeting=38 |page=6 |anchor=pg 006-bk04 |date=26 October 2005 |speaker name=Mr. Al Hinai | speaker nation=Oman |accessdate=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies have passed resolutions and held conferences on the issue. The first [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution and debate was in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |doc id=A-57-PV. 86 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=57 |meeting=86 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk09 |date=22 May 2003 |accessdate=9 July 2008 |title=Global road safety crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims]] was declared in 2005. In 2009 the first high level ministerial conference on road safety was held in [[Moscow]].

The [[World Health Organization]], a specialized agency of the [[United Nations Organization]], in its Global Status Report on Road Safety 2009, estimates that over 90% of the world’s fatalities on the roads occur in low-income and middle-income countries, which have only 48% of the world’s registered vehicles, and predicts road traffic injuries will rise to become the fifth leading [[cause of death]] by 2030&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/road_traffic_deaths_country_rankings_2009.html |title=Road Traffic Deaths Index 2009 Country Rankings |work= |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collision migration===
Collisions migration refers to a situation where action to reduce road traffic collisions in one place may result in those collisions resurfacing elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41064(358)94|title=Analysis of Characters and Causes of Road Traffic Accident Migration|publisher=Ninth International Conference of Chinese Transportation Professionals (ICCTP)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[accident blackspot]] may occur at a dangerous bend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trafficresearch.co.uk/Accident-migration-after-remedial-treatment-at-accident-blackspots/32366|title=Accident 'migration' after remedial treatment at accident blackspots|work=trafficresearch.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment for this may be to increase signage, post an advisory speed limit, apply a high-friction road surface, add crash barriers or any one of a number of other visible interventions. The immediate result may be to reduce collisions at the bend, but the subconscious relaxation on leaving the "dangerous" bend may cause drivers to act with fractionally less care on the rest of the road, resulting in an increase in collisions elsewhere on the road, and no overall improvement over the area. In the same way, increasing familiarity with the treated area will often result in a reduction over time to the previous level of care ([[regression to the mean]]) and may result in faster speeds around the bend due to perceived increased safety ([[risk compensation]]).

In Canada, they are the cause of 48% of severe injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_24jan2002_e |title=Motor Vehicle Collisions Most Frequent Cause of Severe Injuries |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crash rates===
The safety performance of roadways is almost always reported as a rate. That is, some measure of harm (deaths, injuries, or number of crashes) divided by some measure of exposure to the risk of this harm. Rates are used so the safety performance of different locations can be compared, and to prioritize safety improvements.

Common rates related to road traffic fatalities include the number of deaths per capita, per registered vehicle, per licensed driver, or per vehicle mile or kilometer traveled. Simple counts are almost never used. The annual count of fatalities is a rate, namely, the number of fatalities per year.

There is no one rate that is superior to others in any general sense. The rate to be selected depends on the question being asked – and often also on what data are available. What is important is to specify exactly what rate is measured and how it relates to the problem being addressed. Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled. Others combine rates. The U.S. state of [[Iowa]], for example, selects high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hallmark |first=Shauna |title=Evaluation of the Iowa DOT's Safety Improvement Candidate List Process |type=Final Report |publisher=Center for Transportation Research and Education, Iowa State university |date=June 2002 |url=http://www.intrans.iastate.edu/reports/SafetyCandidate.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatality===
The definition of a road-traffic fatality varies from country to country. In the United States, the definition used in the [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System]] (FARS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/ |title=FARS |publisher=Fars.nhtsa.dot.gov |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; run by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) is a person who dies within 30 days of a crash on a US public road involving a vehicle with an engine, the death being the result of the crash. In the U.S., therefore, if a driver has a non-fatal heart attack that leads to a road-traffic crash that causes death, that is a road-traffic fatality. However, if the heart attack causes death prior to the crash, then that is not a road-traffic fatality.

The definition of a road-traffic fatality can change with time in the same country. For example, fatality was defined in France as a person who dies in the six days (pre 2005) after the collision and was subsequently changed to the 30 days (post 2005) after the collision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraptranstats.net/defn_safety International Road Assistance Programme] – International Transport Statistics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fardier a vapeur.gif|thumb|left|The ''fardier à vapeur'' of [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] allegedly crashed into a wall in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;However, the first known account of this crash dates to 1801.{{cite web|title=Le fardier de Cugnot|url=http://www.ile-de-france.drire.gouv.fr/vehicules/homolo/cnrv/histoire.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226105105/http://www.ile-de-france.drire.gouv.fr/vehicules/homolo/cnrv/histoire.htm|archivedate=26 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The world's first recorded road traffic death involving a motor vehicle occurred on 31 August 1869.&lt;ref name=OffalyHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/268/1/Mary-Ward-1827-1869/Page1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201221657/http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/268/1/Mary-Ward-1827-1869/Page1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 February 2010 |title=Mary Ward 1827-1869 |publisher=Offaly Historical &amp; Archaeological Society |date=2 September 2007 |series=King's County Chronicle |accessdate=20 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish scientist [[Mary Ward (scientist)|Mary Ward]] died when she fell out of her cousins' steam car and was run over by it.

The British [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|road engineer]] [[J. J. Leeming]], compared the statistics for fatality rates in Great Britain, for transport-related incidents both before and after the introduction of the motor vehicle, for journeys, including those once by water that now are undertaken by motor vehicle:&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt;  For the period 1863–1870 there were: 470 fatalities per million of population (76 on railways, 143 on roads, 251 on water); for the period 1891–1900 the corresponding figures were: 348 (63, 107, 178); for the period 1931–1938: 403 (22, 311, 70) and for the year 1963: 325 (10, 278, 37).&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt;  Leeming concluded that the data showed that "travel accidents may even have been more frequent a century ago than they are now, at least for men".&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt;

[[File:Truck crash on Andrew Street, Compstall 1914.jpg|thumb|Truck collision with house in [[Compstall]], United Kingdom (1914)]]
[[File:Accident at Station 7.jpg|thumb|A traffic collision from 1952]]
In 1969, a British [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|road engineer]] compared the circumstances around road deaths as reported in various American states before the widespread introduction of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} [[speed limit]]s and [[Driving under the influence|drunk-driving]] laws.&lt;ref name=leeming&gt;{{cite book |title=Road Accidents: Prevent or Punish? |first=J.J. |last=Leeming | year=1969 |isbn=0-304-93213-2 |publisher=Cassell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
They took into account thirty factors which it was thought might affect the death rate. Among these were included the annual consumption of wine, of spirits and of malt beverages—taken individually—the amount spent on road maintenance, the minimum temperature, certain of the legal measures such as the amount spent on police, the number of police per 100,000 inhabitants, the follow-up programme on dangerous drivers, the quality of driver testing, and so on. The thirty factors were finally reduced to six by eliminating those found to have small or negligible effect. The final six were:

* (a) The percentage of the total state highway mileage that is rural
* (b) The percent increase in motor vehicle registration
* (c) The extent of motor vehicle inspection
* (d) The percentage of state-administered highway that is surfaced
* (e) The average yearly minimum temperature
* (f) The income per capita

These are placed in descending order of importance. These six accounted for 70% of the variations in the rate.

==Society and culture==

=== Economic costs ===
The global economic cost of MVCs was estimated at $518 billion per year in 2003, and $100 billion in developing countries.&lt;ref name="www.searo.who.int"/&gt; The [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimated the U.S. cost in 2000 at $230 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/MotorVehicleSafety/index.html |title=CDC - Motor Vehicle Safety |work=[[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 US report estimated costs of $277 billion, which included lost productivity, medical costs, legal and court costs, emergency service costs (EMS), insurance administration costs, congestion costs, property damage, and workplace losses. "The value of societal harm from motor vehicle crashes, which includes both economic impacts and valuation for lost quality-of-life, was $870.8 billion in 2010. Sixty-eight percent of this value represents lost quality-of-life, while 32 percent are economic impacts."&lt;ref&gt;"The Economic and Societal Impact of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 2010," by Lawrence Blincoe, Ted R. Miller, Ph.D., Eduard Zaloshnja, Ph.D., Bruce A. Lawrence, Ph.D., DOT HS 812 013, Washington, D.C.: May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal consequences===
{{see also|Vehicle insurance|Hit and run#Country-specific penalties}}
There are a number of possible legal consequences for causing a traffic collision, including:
*'''Traffic citations''': drivers who are involved in a collision may receive one or more traffic citations for improper driving conduct such as speeding, failure to obey a traffic control device, or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Peter J.|title=The relationship between speeding behaviour (as measured by violation convictions) and crash involvement|journal=Journal of Safety Research Volume 28, Issue 2, Summer 1997, Pages 83-95|date=Summer 1997|volume=28|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437596000400|accessdate=31 October 2017|doi=10.1016/S0022-4375(96)00040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convictions for traffic violations are usually penalized with fines, and for more severe offenses, the suspension or revocation of driving privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Joseph|title=Can't Pay Your Fines?

*'''Civil lawsuits''': a driver who causes a traffic collision may be sued for damages resulting from the accident, including damages to property and injuries to other persons.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;
*'''Criminal prosecution''': More severe driving misconduct, including [[Driving under the influence|impaired driving]], may result in criminal charges against the driver. In the event of a fatality, a charge of [[vehicular homicide]] is occasionally prosecuted, especially in cases involving alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roper|first1=Eric|title=In crashes that kill pedestrians, the majority of drivers don't face charges|url=http://www.startribune.com/in-crashes-that-kill-pedestrians-the-majority-of-drivers-don-t-face-charges/380345481/|accessdate=31 October 2017|publisher=Star Tribune|date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convictions for alcohol offenses may result in the revocation or long term suspension of the driver's license, and sometimes jail time, mandatory drug or alcohol rehabilitation, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nichols|first1=James L.|last2=Ross|first2=H.

====Fraud====
Sometimes, people may make false insurance claims or commit [[insurance fraud]] by staging collisions or jumping in front of moving cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galperina|first=Marina|title=Why Russians Are Obsessed With Dash-Cams|url=http://jalopnik.com/5918159/why-russians-are-obsessed-with-dash+cams|publisher=[[Jalopnik]]|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

[[File:American Landscape.jpg|thumb|''American Landscape'' by Jan A. Nelson (graphite on Strathmore rag, 1974)]]
Cars have come to represent a part of the [[American Dream]] of ownership coupled with the freedom of the road.  The violence of a car wreck provides a counterpoint to that promise and is the subject of artwork by a number of artists, such as [[John Salt]], Jan Anders Nelson, and [[Li Yan (artist)|Li Yan]]. Though English, John Salt was drawn to American landscapes of wrecked vehicles like ''Desert Wreck'' (airbrushed oil on linen, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desert Wreck|url=https://es.pinterest.com/pin/429601251925706012/|website=es.pinterest.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Jan Anders Nelson works with the wreck in its resting state in junkyards or forests, or as elements in his paintings and drawings. ''American Landscape'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Landscape|url=http://www.janandersnelsonart.com/#!drawings---art/c1r52|website=www.janandersnelsonart.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one example of Nelson´s focus on the violence of the wreck with cars and trucks piled into a heap, left to the forces of nature and time. This recurring theme of violence is echoed in the work of Li Yan. His painting ''Accident Nº 6'' looks at the energy released during a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accident Nº 6 detail|url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/artpages/li_yan_accident6_7.htm|website=www.saatchigallery.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accident Nº 6 detail|url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/artpages/li_yan_accident6_4.htm|website=www.saatchigallery.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wreckage in Art: A Driving Force in the Work of Jan Anders Nelson|url=https://medium.com/@ladantacantaba/wreckage-in-art-a-driving-force-in-the-work-of-jan-anders-nelson-3048a7c34a61#.w9ma07jiu|website=medium.com|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tygerberg Zoo''' was a {{Convert|24|ha|sing=on}} [[zoo]] near [[Stellenbosch]], [[South Africa]], which was the only zoo in the [[Western Cape]] province and the closest to [[Cape Town]]. Established in 1979, it was privately run, operated for 33 years, and closed in 2012.&lt;ref name=lostzoo/&gt;  It was "once a major tourist attraction and a hot spot for school educational outings" according to ''[[Cape Times]]'' coverage of its closure.&lt;ref name=capetimes/&gt; Featured animals included [[chimpanzees]] and [[tigers]], [[lions]], and [[cheetahs]]. The zoo had 160 bird species and 63 reptile species, and "specialised in breeding rare and endangered animals."&lt;ref name=extended&gt;[http://extended332.rssing.com/chan-5256687/all_p13.html Western Cape Extended], 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo was notable for its breeding successes, including the 1998 birth of "the world's tiniest tortoise", a baby [[Speckled Cape Tortoise|Namaqua Speckled]].&lt;ref name=lostzoo/&gt;

==History==
A predecessor zoo was founded by John Spence and Geoff McLachlan at [[Kraaifontein]] in the outskirts of Cape Town in 1966. This zoo was soon moved, and at its peak had 61 mammal species and 160 bird species. It addressed a void created by decline and closure of the obsolete [[Groote Schuur Zoo]], established in 1897 and known also as the Cape Town Zoo, that had been designed in a completely different era. The Groote Schuur Zoo fully closed in 1975.&lt;ref name=otoole&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-12-21-00-the-closing-of-an-african-zoo |title=The closing of Tygerberg Zoo |author=Sean O'Toole |date=21 December 2012 |publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tygerberg Zoo was established on its 24-acre property in 1979 by John Spence. Lorraine Spence met John in 1985, and came to the zoo later. John was director before his death in 2010; Lorraine, then director, announced and managed its closing in 2012. The zoo had 24 workers, four of whom lived on the property, in 2012.&lt;ref name=lostzoo/&gt;

According to Chandré Gould and Marléne Burger's book, Secrets &amp; Lies: Wouter Basson and South Africa’s Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme, the zoo was acquired in 1989 when, under the instruction of supposed "foreign principles", Dr Wouter Basson, then head of Project Coast, bought the Tygerberg zoo for the purposes of research into crowd control methods. The zoo, at the time, was owned by Basson's uncle, Cyrus Steyn, and the WPW Group purchased the zoo at a cost of R711 928. The intention was to generate funds 'for the CBW project'.

John Spence died in 2010.&lt;ref name=lostzoo/&gt;

The zoo's closure in 2012 was, according to Lorraine Spence, due to decline of visitors during its last ten years, and expenses of animal feed and salaries, that made it no longer financially viable.&lt;ref name=lostzoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewm/&gt; The zoo's animals were to be dispersed to other zoos and to farms.&lt;ref name=lostzoo/&gt; [[Drakenstein Lion Park]], also outside Cape Town, is one zoo that did receive many.

Visitation was high on weekends before the scheduled closure.

===Cape lions===
[[File:Cape Lion.jpg|thumb|The [[Cape lion]], a distinct [[subpopulation]] of the [[Southern African lion]] which had a black mane that extended through its belly, and used to live in the Cape Region]]

It is also attracted international attention for John Spence's finding lions in captivity in [[Russia]] that were covered in the news as possible descendants of the extinct [[Cape lion]] [[population]], and his bringing two of them back to the Tygerberg Zoo. Cape lions were a black-maned, large, and otherwise distinctive [[subpopulation]] of [[Southern African lion]]s&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN |assessor1=Bauer, H. |assessor2=Packer, C. |assessor3=Funston, P.F. |assessor4=Henschel, P. |assessor5=Nowell, K. |last-assessor-amp=yes |year=2015 |id=15951 |taxon=Panthera leo |version=2017-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that were native to the [[Cape Province|Cape region]] of South Africa. They were hunted to extinction in the wild in the 1850s, and soon believed to have no survivors in captivity. John Spence was long intrigued by stories of Cape lions, including their scaling the walls of [[Jan van Riebeeck|General van Riebeeck]]'s castle in the [[17th century]] (1619–1670). Spence believed some Cape lions might have been taken to Europe and interbred with other lions. He spent 30 years searching zoos and circuses world-wide, for lions that looked like Cape lions,&lt;ref name=aparchive/&gt; until a friend sent photographs of lions in the [[Novosibirsk Zoo]] in [[Novosibirsk|Novosibirsk, Russia]] that did, in 2000. A black-maned lion named Simon, descended from lions which the zoo acquired in 1961, perhaps from a traveling circus, was the best specimen. He was exactly like Cape lions' in paintings (the only images available) that Spence had studied.&lt;ref name=sandiego&gt;[http://library.sandiegozoo.org/news/2001%20news/2001_briefs3.htm San Dieqo Zoo newsletter brief in 2001], which uses term "look-alike"]&lt;/ref&gt; John and Lorraine Spence visited and, with the assistance of a [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn|zoo]] in [[Vienna]],&lt;ref name="aparchive"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=AP Archive, of the [[Associated Press]] |title=South Africa: Lion Cubs Thought to Be Cape Lions |url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/SOUTH-AFRICA-LION-CUBS-THOUGHT-TO-BE-CAPE-LIONS/6f868f73b9fd62e43f31a152f6d011cc?query=south+africa&amp;current=4&amp;orderBy=Relevance&amp;hits=16&amp;referrer=search&amp;search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3Dsouth%2520africa%26allFilters%3DMammals%3ASubject%2CAPTN%3ASource%2CAnimals%3ASubject%2CRecreation%2520and%2520leisure%3ASubject&amp;allFilters=Mammals%3ASubject%2CAPTN%3ASource%2CAnimals%3ASubject%2CRecreation+and+leisure%3ASubject&amp;productType=IncludedProducts&amp;page=1&amp;b=d011cc |date=8 November 2000}} (with 2-minute video of cubs at zoo with John Spence, 3 sound-bites, and 15 photos)&lt;/ref&gt; were allowed to bring two of Simon's cubs back to Tygerberg Zoo.&lt;ref name=lostzoo&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-06-04-we-lost-a-zoo-western-capes-only-zoo-closes/#.VRmvpY7F8hY |title=We lost a zoo: Western Cape's only zoo closes |author=Rebecca Davis |work=[[Daily Maverick]] |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcExtinct&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1007452.stm 'Extinct' lions (Cape lion) surface in Siberia].

News coverage during 2000–01 included titles such as the ''[[National Geographic News]]''' "Has Rare Lion of Africa's Cape Eluded Extinction?", for its July 2001 story on Cape lions and John Spence's long search. Shortly before that, ''National Geographic Today'' featured a documentary special on the topic.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0726_capelion.html |title=Has Rare Lion of Africa's Cape Eluded Extinction? |author=Ron Irwin |work=National Geographic News |date=26 July 2001 |id=(link: [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0726_capelion_2.html page 2])}} (note mention of documentary is past end of article, on [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0726_capelion_2.html article's page 2].)&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmed at Tygerberg Zoo in 2001, John Spence explained he hoped to breed lions for the Cape area that looked like Cape lions, but avoided saying the cubs were descendants. He also expressed interest in having DNA-testing done to compare the cubs' DNA to surviving Cape lion DNA,&lt;ref name=aparchive/&gt; but there was never any news of that happening.

The '''''Virginius'' Affair''' was a diplomatic dispute that occurred from October 1873 to February 1875 between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain (then in control of [[Cuba]]), during the [[Ten Years' War]]. ''Virginius'' was a fast American ship hired by Cuban insurrectionists to land men and munitions in Cuba to attack the Spanish regime there. It was captured by the Spanish, who wanted to try the men onboard (many of whom were American and British citizens) as pirates and execute them. The Spanish executed 53 of the men but stopped when the British government demanded it. 

Throughout the ordeal there was loose talk that the U.S. might declare war on Spain. During the lengthy negotiations the Spanish government had undergone several changes in leadership. US consul [[Caleb Cushing]] ended the episode by negotiating $80,000 in reparations to be paid to the families of the Americans who were executed. British families were compensated by the Spanish government through negotiation prior to American compensation. The incident was remarkable for the use of international diplomacy for a peaceful settlement implemented by [[US Secretary of State]] [[Hamilton Fish]], rather than opting for a costly war between the United States and Spain. The ''Virginius'' Affair started a resurgence in the [[US Navy]] following the [[American Civil War]]; its fleet had been heretofore inferior to the superior warships of Spain.

== Ten Years' War ==
After the [[American Civil War]], the island country of Cuba under Spanish rule was one of the few Western Hemisphere countries in which slavery remained legal and was widely practiced.&lt;ref name=Bpp6-7&gt;Bradford, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 1868 a revolution broke out, known as the [[Ten Years' War]], by Cuban landowners, led by [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]].&lt;ref name=Bpp7-8&gt;Bradford, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish, led initially by [[Francisco Lersundi]], used the military to suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref name=Bp8&gt;Bradford, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] persuaded President Grant not to recognize Cuban belligerency, and the United States maintained an unstable peace with Spain.&lt;ref name=Bpp5_14&gt;Bradford, pp. 5, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cuban war continued, international patriotic insurgency began to arise in support of the Cuban rebellion, and war bonds were sold in the US to support the Cuban resistance.&lt;ref name=Bp12&gt;Bradford, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the US Cuban patriots was John F. Patterson, who bought a former Confederate steamer, ''Virgin'', at the [[Washington Navy Yard]], renaming her ''Virginius''.&lt;ref name=Bp16&gt;Bradford, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of Patterson's purchase of ''Virginius'' would later come to national and international attention.&lt;ref name=Bpp100-101&gt;Bradford, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban rebellion ended in an 1878 armistice after Spanish general [[Arsenio Martínez-Campos]] pardoned all Cuban rebels.&lt;ref name=Bpp136-137&gt;Bradford, pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Virginius''==
''Virginius'' was a small, high-speed side-wheel steamer built to serve as a [[blockade runner]] between Havana and Mobile, Alabama, for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.&lt;ref name=Bp25&gt;Bancroft, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sp62&gt;Soodalter, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built as ''Virgin'' by Aitken &amp; Mansel of [[Whiteinch]], [[Glasgow]] in 1864, she became a prize of the United States when captured on April 12, 1865.&lt;ref name=Bp25/&gt; In August 1870, ''Virginius'' was purchased by an American, John F. Patterson, acting secretly as an agent for Cuban insurgent [[Manuel Quesada]] and two US citizens, Marshall O. Roberts and J.K. Roberts.&lt;ref name=Bp25/&gt; The ship was originally captained by Francis Sheppherd. Both Patterson and Shepphard immediately registered the ship in the New York Custom House, having paid $2,000 to be bonded. However, no sureties were listed.&lt;ref name=Bp26&gt;Bancroft, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson took a required oath that he was the sole owner of ''Virginius''. The secret purpose for the purchase of ''Virginius'' was to transport men, munitions, and supplies to aid the Cuban rebellion. For three years the ship aided the Cuban rebellion and was protected by US naval ships, including {{USS|Kansas|1863|6}} and {{USS|Canandaigua|1862|6}}.&lt;ref name=Sp62/&gt; The Spanish said that it was an outlaw ship and aggressively sought to capture it.&lt;ref name=Sp62/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bp26/&gt;

==Capture, trial, and executions==

Captain Joseph Fry was made the new captain of ''Virginius'' from October 1873.&lt;ref name=Sp64&gt;Soodalter, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Fry had served in the US Navy for 15 years, before joining the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the Civil War. Fry was promoted to commodore in the [[Confederate Navy]]. However, after that position disappeared after the Union victory in 1865, Fry was underemployed. In 1873 he took the job as captain of ''Virginius''. ''Virginius'', moored in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] by this time needed repair, and the boilers were breaking down.&lt;ref name=Sp63&gt;Soodalter, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; As most of the previous crew had deserted, Fry recruited a new crew of 52 men, both American and British. Many were inexperienced and apparently did not understand that ''Virginius'' was supporting the Cuban rebellion. Three were very young recruits, no older than 13 years of age.&lt;ref name=Sp64/&gt; ''Virginius'' took on 103 native Cuban soldiers that arrived on board a New York steamer. Fry had been warned by the US Consul at Kingston, Thomas H. Pearne, that he would be shot if captured. However, Fry did not believe the Spanish would shoot a blockade runner.&lt;ref name=H11_22_1873&gt;Hartford Weekly (November 22, 1873), ''The Cuban Massacre''&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-October, Captain Fry, accompanied by four mercenaries, took ''Virginius'' to Haiti and loaded the ship with munitions.&lt;ref name=Spp63-64&gt;Soodalter, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, ''Virginius'' sailed to Comito to pick up more weapons and then on the same day started toward Cuba. The Spanish had been warned when ''Virginius'' left Jamaica and sent out the warship {{ship|Spanish corvette|Tornado||2}} to capture the vessel.&lt;ref name=Sp64/&gt;

On October 30, 1873 ''Tornado'' spotted ''Virginius'' on open water {{convert|6|mi}} from Cuba and gave chase. ''Virginius'' was heavily weighted and the stress from the boilers caused the ship to take on water, significantly slowing any progress.&lt;ref name=Bp40-41&gt;Bradford, pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; As the chase continued, ''Tornado'', a fast warship, fired on ''Virginius'' several times, damaging the top deck. Captain Fry surrendered ''Virginius'', knowing that his ship's overworked boilers and leaking hull could not outrun ''Tornado'' on the open sea. The Spanish quickly boarded and secured the ship. The entire crew was taken prisoner and the ship sailed to [[Santiago de Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Bp43_45&gt;Bradford, pp. 43, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish immediately ordered the entire crew to be put on trial as pirates.&lt;ref name=Bp45&gt;Bradford, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire ''Virginius'' crew, both American and British citizens, were found guilty by a court martial and were sentenced to death. The Spanish ignored the protest of American vice-consul, who attempted to give American citizens legal aid. On November 4, 1873, the four mercenaries who accompanied Capt. Fry were executed by firing squad without trial since he had already been condemned as a pirate. After the executions, the British vice-consul at Santiago, concerned that one of the mercenaries killed, George Washington Ryan, claimed British citizenship, wired Jamaica to receive aid from the British navy to stop further executions.&lt;ref name=Bpp47-48&gt;Bradford, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing news of the ship's capture and the executions, Altamont de Cordova, a Jamaican resident, was able to get British Commodore A.F.R. de Horsey to send the sloop {{HMS|Niobe|1866|6}} under [[Sir Lambton Loraine, 11th Baronet]] to Santiago to stop further executions.&lt;ref name=Bpp48-49&gt;Bradford, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, a further 37 crew members, including Captain Fry, were executed by firing squad.&lt;ref name=Bpp52-53&gt;Bradford, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish soldiers decapitated them and trampled their bodies with horses. On November 8, twelve more crew members were executed until finally, HMS ''Niobe'' reached Santiago.&lt;ref name=Bp54&gt;Bradford, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The carnage stopped on the same day that Lorraine threatened local commander Juan N. Burriel that he would bombard Santiago if there were any more executions.&lt;ref name=Bp54/&gt; A total of 53 were executed at Santiago under Burriel's authority.

==US public reaction==
The initial press reaction to the capture of ''Virginius'' was conservative, but as news of executions poured into the nation, certain newspapers became more aggressive in promoting Cuban intervention and war.&lt;ref name=B64-65&gt;Bradford, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that if the executions of Americans from ''Virginius'' were illegal, war needed to be declared.&lt;ref name=Bp65&gt;Bradford, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' asserted that actions of Burriel and the Cuban Volunteers necessitated "the death knell of Spanish power in America."&lt;ref name=Bp65/&gt; The ''[[New York Herald]]'' demanded Secretary [[Hamilton Fish]]'s resignation and the recognition by the US of the Cuban belligerency.&lt;ref name=Bp65/&gt; ''The National Republican'', believing the threat of war with Spain to be imminent, encouraged the sale of Cuban bonds.&lt;ref name=Bp64&gt;Bradford, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The American public considered the executions as a national insult and rallied for intervention. Protest rallies took place across the nation in [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], encouraging intervention in Cuba and vengeance on Spain.&lt;ref name=Bpp65-66&gt;Bradford, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Minister to the United States, Sir [[Edward Thornton (diplomat)|Edward Thornton]], believed the American public was ready for war with Spain.&lt;ref name=Bp66&gt;Bradford, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; A large rally in New York's [[Steinway Hall]] on November 17, 1873, led by future Secretary of State [[William Evarts]], took a moderate position, and the meeting adopted a resolution that war would be necessary, yet regrettable, if Spain chose to "consider our defense against savage butchery as a cause of war...."&lt;ref name=Bpp70-71&gt;Bradford, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US diplomatic response==
===Hamilton Fish and State Department===
[[File:Hamilton Fish Brady Edited.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|left|[[Hamilton Fish]], US Secretary of State]]
On Wednesday November 5, 1873, the first news from the US Consul-General in [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]], [[Henry C. Hall]], informed the US State Department that ''Virginius'' had been captured.&lt;ref name=Bp57&gt;Bradford, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no knowledge that four mercenaries had already been killed, and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish believed the ''Virginius'' was just another ship captured aiding the Cuban rebellion.&lt;ref name=Bp57/&gt; On November 7, Cuba headed the agenda of US President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s Cabinet meeting as news came in of the deaths of Ryan and three other mercenaries.&lt;ref name=Bpp57-58&gt;Bradford, p. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabinet agreed that the executions would be "regarded as an inhuman act not in accordance with the spirit of the civilization of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name=Bp58&gt;Bradford, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, Fish met with Spanish minister Don José Polo de Barnabé and discussed the legality of the capture of ''Virginius''.&lt;ref name=Bpp58-59&gt;Bradford, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, Grant's Cabinet decided that war with Spain was not desirable, but Cuban intervention was possible.&lt;ref name=Bp59&gt;Bradford, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, five days after the event, Fish received devastating news that 37 crew members of ''Virginius'' had been executed.&lt;ref name=Bp60&gt;Bradford, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish ordered US Minister to Spain [[Daniel Sickles]] to protest the executions and demand reparations for any persons considered US citizens who were killed.&lt;ref name=Bp60/&gt; On November 13, Fish formally protested to Polo and stated that the US had a free hand on Cuba and the ''Virginius'' Affair.&lt;ref name=Bp60/&gt; On November 14, Grant's cabinet agreed that if US demands for reparations were not met, the Spanish legation would be closed. An exaggerated report came into the White House that more crew members had been shot. In reality, twelve crew members had been executed.&lt;ref name=Bp61&gt;Bradford, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, Polo visited Fish and stated that ''Virginius'' was a pirate ship and that her crew had been a hostile threat to Cuba.&lt;ref name=Bpp62-62&gt;Bradford, p. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish, although doubtful of the legality of the ship's US ownership, was determined to be an advocate of the nation's honor in demanding reparations from Spain.&lt;ref name=Bp63&gt;Bradford, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; l

On the same day, a cable from Fish arrived in Spain for Sickles demanding the return of ''Virginius'' to the US, the release of the crew that had escaped execution, a salute from Spain to the US flag, punishment for the perpetrators, and reparations for families.&lt;ref name=Bp79&gt;Bradford, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emilio Castelar.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Emilio Castelar]], President of Spain]]
Negotiations in Spain between Sickles and Minister of State José de Carvajal became heated, and progress towards a settlement became unlikely.&lt;ref name=Bpp80-81&gt;Bradford, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish press openly attacked Sickles, the US and Britain, intending to promote war between the three countries.&lt;ref name=Bp83&gt;Bradford, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; As the Sickles-Carvajal negotiations broke down, President [[Emilio Castelar]] decided to settle the ''Virginius'' matter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Castelar y Ripoll, Emilio |volume=5 |page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Fish and Polo in Washington.&lt;ref name=Bp89&gt;Bradford, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Thanksgiving Day]], November 27, Polo proposed to Fish that Spain would give up the ''Virginius'' and the remaining crew if the US would investigate the legal status of its ownership.&lt;ref name=Bp93&gt;Bradford, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Fish and Grant agreed to Polo's offer and that the Spanish salute to the US flag would be dispensed with if ''Virginius'' was found not have legal US private citizen ownership.&lt;ref name=Bp93/&gt; On November 28, Polo and Fish met at the State Department and signed a formal agreement that included the return of ''Virginius'' and crew and an investigation by both governments of the legal ownership of ''Virginius'' and of any crimes committed by the Spanish Volunteers.&lt;ref name=Bp94&gt;Bradford, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of war between the two countries had been averted through negotiations, but the time and place of the surrender of the ''Virginius'' and the remaining crew remained undetermined for several days.&lt;ref name=Bpp94-95&gt;Bradford, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, Fish and Polo signed an agreement that ''Virginius'', with the US flag flying, would be turned over to the US Navy on December 16 at the port of [[Bahía Honda, Cuba|Bahía Honda]].&lt;ref name=Bpp.99-100&gt;Bradford, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Sickles, having lost the confidence of Grant and Fish, resigned on December 20, 1873.&lt;ref name=Bp117&gt;Bradford, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, 1874, after advice from Fish on a replacement for Sickles, Grant appointed eminent attorney and Spanish scholar [[Caleb Cushing]] as Minister to Spain.&lt;ref name=Bpp120_122&gt;Bradford, pp. 120, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Virginius'' and crew returned===
On December 16, ''Virginius'', now in complete disrepair and taking on water, was towed out to open sea with the US flag flying to be turned over to the US Navy. US Captain W.D. Whiting on board {{USS|Despatch|1873|6}} agreed with Spanish Commander [[Manuel de la Cámara]] to turn over ''Virginius'' the following day.&lt;ref name=Bpp109-110&gt;Bradford, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; l On December 17, at exactly 9:00 a.m., ''Virginius'' was formally turned over to the US Navy without incident.&lt;ref name=Bp111&gt;Bradford, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, after an investigation, US Attorney [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]] ruled that the US ownership of ''Virginius'' had been fraudulent and that she had no right to fly the US flag; however, Spain had no right to capture ''Virginius'' and her crew on the open sea.&lt;ref name=Bp102&gt;Bradford, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:17 a.m., on December 26, while under tow by {{USS|Ossipee|1861|6}}, ''Virginius'' [[foundered]] off [[Cape Hatteras]] en route to the United States.&lt;ref name=Bp114&gt;Bradford, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 91 remaining crewmen, who had been held as prisoners under harsh conditions, were handed over to Captain D.L. Braine of ''Juanita'' and were taken safely to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Bpp106-107&gt;Bradford, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparations awarded===
[[File:Caleb Cushing by Mathew B Brady.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|[[Caleb Cushing]], U.S. Consul to Spain]]
On January 3, 1874, Spanish President [[Emilio Castelar y Ripoll|Emilio Castelar]] was voted out of office and replaced by [[Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre|Francisco Serrano]].&lt;ref name=Bp119&gt;Bradford, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Cushing, who had replaced Sickles as US Consul to Spain, stated that the US had been fortunate that Castelar, a university scholar, had been President of Spain, given that his replacement, Serrano, might have been more apt to go to war over the affair.&lt;ref name=Bp120&gt;Bradford, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Cushing's primary duty was to get Spanish reparations for ''Virginius'' family victims and punishment of Burriel for the 53 Santiago executions.&lt;ref name=Bp123&gt;Bradford, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Cushing met Serrano in May on June 26, [[Augusto Ulloa]].&lt;ref name=Bp123/&gt; On July 5, Cushing, now well respected by Spanish authority, wrote to Fish that Spain was ready to make reparations.&lt;ref name=Bpp123-124&gt;Bradford, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Cushing was informed that President Castelar had secretly negotiated reparations between Spain and Britain that totalled £7,700, but black British citizen families were given less money.&lt;ref name=Bp124&gt;Bradford, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, Grant and Fish demanded $2,500 from Spain for each US citizen shot regardless of race.&lt;ref name=Bp124/&gt;

On November 28, 1874 Fish gave instructions to Cushing that all ''Virginius'' crew members not considered British would be considered American.&lt;ref name=Bp125&gt;Bradford, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish Consul Antonio Mantilla, Polo's replacement, agreed with the reparations. Grant's 1875 State of the Union Address announced that reparations were near, quieting anger over the ''Virginius'' affair.&lt;ref name=Bp125/&gt; Reparations, however, were put on hold, as Spain changed governments on December 28, [[First Spanish Republic|from a republic]] back to a monarchy. [[Alfonso XII]] became King of Spain on January 11, 1875.&lt;ref name=Bp125/&gt;

On January 16, Cushings met with the new Spanish state minister [[Alejandro de Castro y Casal|Castro]], urged settlement before the US Congress adjourned, and noted that reparations would be a minor matter compared to an all-out war between Spain and the US.&lt;ref name=Bpp125-126&gt;Bradford, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under an agreement of February 7, 1875, signed on March 5, the Spanish government paid to the US anindemnity of $80,000 for the execution of the Americans.&lt;ref name=Bp126&gt;Bradford, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Burriel's Santiago executions were considered illegal by Spain, and he had been condemned by President Serrano and King Alfonso.&lt;ref name=Bp127&gt;Bradford, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The case against Burriel was taken up by the Spanish Tribunal of the Navy in June 1876. However, Burriel died on December 24, 1877 before any trial could take place.&lt;ref name=Bp128&gt;Bradford, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the reparation, a private indemnity in St. Louis was given to Captain Fry's financially troubled family, which had been unable to pay rent and had no permanent place to live.&lt;ref name=Bp138&gt;Bradford, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
When the ''Virginius'' affair first broke out, a Spanish [[ironclad]]—the ''[[Spanish ironclad Arapiles|Arapiles]]''—happened to be anchored in [[New York Harbor]] for repairs, leading to the uncomfortable realization on the part of the US Navy that it had no ship capable of defeating such a vessel. US Secretary of War [[George M. Robeson]] believed a US naval resurgence was necessary. Congress hastily issued contracts for the construction of five new ironclads, and accelerated its existing repair program for several more.&lt;ref&gt;Home Squadron: The U.S. Navy on the North Atlantic Station, James B Rentfrew, Annapolis: Naval Inst. Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; {{USS|Puritan|BM-1|6}} and the four {{sclass-|Amphitrite|monitor|0}} monitors were subsequently built as a result of the ''Virginius'' war scare.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, pp. 138, 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; All five vessels would later take part in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898.

'''Winfried Freudenberg''' (29 August 1956 &amp;ndash; 8 March 1989) was the [[Deaths at the Berlin Wall|last person to die]] in an attempt to escape from [[East Germany]] to [[West Berlin]] across the [[Berlin Wall]] as he fell from an improvised gas balloon at high altitude over West Berlin.&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Start/Detail/id/593906/page/2|publisher=Deutschlandradio|title=Chronicle of the Berlin Wall|author1=Martin Ahrends |author2=Udo Baron |author3=Hans-Hermann Hertle  |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Weekly World News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-wDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=Winfried+Freudenberg|date=1989-05-02|title=Balloon Tragedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,605967,00.html|title=Berlin Pays Tribute to Last Person Shot Crossing Wall|date=2009-02-06|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Freudenberg was born in [[Osterwieck]], and grew up in the [[Saxony-Anhalt]] town of [[Lüttgenrode]], near what was then the border between his native [[East Germany]], which was then a part of the [[communist state|communist]] [[Eastern Bloc]], as a [[satellite state]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and [[West Germany]]. After completing an apprenticeship as electrician, he obtained his secondary education diploma in [[night school]], then trained in information technology, receiving a diploma as electronics engineer. In the autumn of 1988 he married his wife Sabine, a chemist he had met while both were students at [[Technische Universität Ilmenau|Ilmenau University]]. East Germany cutting them off from the professional opportunities that existed in the West, the couple, especially Winfried, had become increasingly disappointed about being unable to cross the border.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; Immediately after the wedding the two began planning their escape to the west by a homemade [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]] filled with [[natural gas]]&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; (because its main component, [[methane]], is [[lighter than air]], natural gas can serve as a [[lifting gas]]).

==Escape and Death==
As part of their plan, Freudenberg took a job in a public utility also supplying natural gas, and the two took an apartment in the [[East Berlin]] neighborhood of [[Prenzlauer Berg]]. In January and February 1989, they began assembling a 13 metre tall by 11 metre diameter balloon envelope out of [[polythene]], which they cut into strips, taped together, and engirded with a string net. There was no basket, only a narrow wooden beam. On the evening of 7 March they decided that the wind conditions were favourable for their escape. They drove to a pressure regulating station in [[Blankenburg (Berlin)|Blankenburg]] neighborhood to which Freudenberg had the keys and at midnight began to fill their balloon with gas. From some time after 1:00 am the balloon was visible from a distance. A waiter on his way home from work which had ended at 1:30 am noticed the balloon, and called the ''[[Volkspolizei]]''. When the couple heard a patrol car arriving shortly after 2:00 am the balloon was not yet completely filled. Because they feared it would not lift both of them they quickly decided for Freudenberg to escape alone, his wife always having been doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/der-ddr-entkommen-flucht-ueber-den-geteilten-himmel/9559152.html|publisher=Der Tagesspiegel|title=Flucht über den geteilten Himmel|author=Gerd Nowakowski|date=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He occupied the beam and cut the tethers. With only one person aboard the balloon had a very high [[buoyancy]] and rose fast. Ballast bags hanging down on lines severed a power line shortly after launching and caused it to short-cut and spark. Although East German security had often shot and killed citizens attempting to escape, they decided against shooting because of the possibility of triggering an explosion of the natural gas now leaking. Also, they believed Freudenberg to have been killed by the current which was not the case. Freudenberg's 23 year old wife was able to get back home, where the [[Stasi]] were already waiting for her.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

However, with the balloon having too much [[buoyancy]], it rose much faster, and, because there was no properly working valve in the improvised balloon, much higher than planned. Freudenberg couldn't sink and spent more than five hours aloft. At first the course was west-south-west. With wind velocities of about 20 km/h at the time he must have reached [[West Berlin]] after about 20 minutes. Later Freudenberg passed over the [[Berlin Tegel Airport]] where he lost or dropped some ballast. His altitude must at this point have increased to more than 2,000 meters (6,500 feet), as his course now changed to south due to different direction of higher altitude winds. The balloon was sighted over [[Teufelsberg]] hill at dawn and held for a weather balloon. Shortly before flying into East German territory again, at 7:30 Freudenberg fell into the garden of a villa in the suburb of [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. The remains of the balloon came down about one kilometer away on the median strip of a thoroughfare. Freudenberg's body was discovered only hours later. He evidently died instantly from injuries sustained in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/revealed-tragic-victims-of-the-berlin-wall-411504.html|publisher=The Independent|title=Revealed: Tragic victims of the Berlin Wall|author=Tony Paterson|date=2006-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly every bone in his body had been broken and virtually every internal organ had been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9NJVstXCXMC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;lpg=PA430&amp;dq=%22Winfried+Freudenberg%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7gYDh3P4ea&amp;sig=alPPaDIlu5JptqNw5Yv_095SoTI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qzFeTpe4JcfTiALIjY2zBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Winfried%20Freudenberg%22&amp;f=false The Victims at the Berlin Wall 1961-1989: A Biographical Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; The direct cause of the crash is not clear. West Berlin police supposed that Freudenberg climbed the net to cut the envelope in which he obviously succeeded, and in the ensuing events lost his hold.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

After the incident, East German police investigated the friends, family, acquaintances, and colleagues of Freudenberg and his wife, to determine whether any had participated in the escape attempt. Because of international attention and pressure over the recent shooting over [[Chris Gueffroy]], the last refugee to be shot by East German border guards, Sabine Freudenberg was given the relatively lenient sentence of three years of probation, and then granted [[amnesty]] in October 1989. The next month East Germany began allowing its citizens to travel to the west, and several months later the [[Berlin Wall]] was dismantled and the two countries [[German reunification|reunified]].&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;
