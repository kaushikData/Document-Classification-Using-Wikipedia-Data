The '''1913 Great Meteor Procession''' occurred on February 9, 1913.&lt;ref name=rasc&gt;[http://www.rasc.ca/meteor-procession-1913 RASC.ca – The Great Meteor Procession (GMP) of 1913 February 9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redorbit&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112769773/great-meteor-procession-1913-range-uncovered-012413/ RedOrbit – 100th Anniversary: Uncovering The Range Of The Great Meteor Procession Of 1913]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a unique [[meteor]]ic phenomenon reported from locations across Canada, the northeastern United States, and [[Bermuda]], and from many ships at sea, including eight off Brazil, giving a total recorded [[ground track]] of over 7,000 miles (11,000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=pickering632&gt;Pickering, W. H. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1922PA.....30..632P The Meteoric Procession of February 9, 1913, Part I]" in ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'', Vol. 30 (1922), 632&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=okeefe68&gt;O'Keefe, J. A. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1968JRASC..62...97O New Data on Cyrillids]", ''Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada'', Vol. 62 (1968), 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Great Meteor Procession of 1913", Sky &amp; Telescope, Vol. 125 No. 2 (February 2013), pages 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The meteors were particularly unusual in that there was no apparent [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]], that is to say, no point in the sky from which the meteors appeared to originate. The observations were analysed in detail, later the same year, by the astronomer [[Clarence Chant]], leading him to conclude that as all accounts were positioned along a [[great circle]] arc, the source had been a small, short-lived [[natural satellite]] of the Earth.&lt;ref name=okeefe&gt;O'Keefe, J. A. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991LPI....22..995O The Cyrillid Shower: Remnant of a Circumterrestrial Ring?]", ''Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'', vol. 22 (1991), 995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chant /&gt;

[[John A. O'Keefe (astronomer)|John A. O'Keefe]], who conducted several studies of the event, proposed that the meteors should be referred to as the ''Cyrillids'', in reference to the feast day of [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (February 9 in the [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|Roman Catholic calendar]] from 1882–1969).

==Events of February 9==
The evening of February 9 was cloudy across much of the densely populated [[northeast United States]], meaning that some 30 million potential observers were for the most part unaware of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=pickering633&gt;Pickering, 1922 (Part I), 633&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, more than a hundred individual reports – largely from more remote areas of Canada – were later collected by [[Clarence Chant]], with additional observations unearthed by later researchers.&lt;ref name=chant&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chant, C. | authorlink = Clarence Chant | bibcode = 1913JRASC...7..145C | title = An Extraordinary Meteoric Display | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] | volume = 7 | date = 1913 | pages = 145–19 }}. Contains numerous witness statements and drawings.&lt;/ref&gt; At around 21hr [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]], witnesses were surprised to see a procession of between 40 and 60 bright, slow-moving fireballs moving from horizon to horizon in a practically identical path.&lt;ref name=pickering632/&gt; Individual fireballs were visible for at least 30 to 40 seconds, and the entire procession took some 5 minutes to cross the sky. An observer at [[Appin, Ontario]], described its appearance at one of the most easterly parts of its track across Canada:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A huge meteor appeared travelling from northwest by west to southeast, which, as it approached, was seen to be in two parts and looked like two bars of flaming material, one following the other. They were throwing out a constant stream of sparks and after they had passed they shot out balls of fire straight ahead that travelled more rapidly than the main bodies. They seemed to pass over slowly and were in sight about five minutes. Immediately after their disappearance in the southeast a ball of clear fire, that looked like a big star, passed across the sky in their wake. This ball did not have a tail or show sparks of any kind. Instead of being yellow like the meteors, it was clear like a star.&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent observers also noted a large, white, tail-less body bringing up the rear, but the various bodies making up the [[meteor procession]] continued to disintegrate and to travel at different rates throughout their course, so that by the time observations were made in Bermuda, the leading bodies were described as "like large arc lights in appearance, slightly violet in colour", followed closely by yellow and red fragments.&lt;ref name=pickering102&gt;Pickering, 1923 (Part II), 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Research carried out in the 1950s by Alexander D. Mebane uncovered a handful of reports from newspaper archives in the northern United States. At [[Escanaba, Michigan]], the ''[[Daily Press (Michigan)|Press]]'' stated the "end of the world was apprehended by many" as numerous meteors travelled across the northern horizon.&lt;ref name=mebane410&gt;Mebane, A. D. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1956Metic...1..405M/0000406.000.html Observations of the Great Fireball Procession of 1913 February 9, Made in the United States], ''[[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science|Meteoritics]]'', v. 1 (1956), number 4, 405&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia, New York]], a few observers saw the meteors and many people heard a thundering noise, while other reports were made in [[Nunda, New York|Nunda]]-[[Dansville, Livingston County, New York|Dansville]], New York (where several residents again thought the world was ending) and [[Osceola, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=mebane413&gt;Mebane, 413-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==February 10==
One curious feature of the reports, highlighted by Mebane, was that several appeared to indicate a second meteor procession on the same course around 5 hours later, although the Earth's rotation meant that there was no obvious mechanism to explain this. One observer, an A. W. Brown from [[Thamesville, Ontario]], reported seeing both the initial meteor procession and a second one on the same course at 02:20 the next morning.&lt;ref name=mebane418&gt;Mebane, 418&lt;/ref&gt; Chant's original report also referred to a series of three groups of "dark objects" which passed, on the same course as the previous meteors, from west to east over Toronto on the afternoon of February 10, which he suggested were "something of a meteoric nature".&lt;ref name="mebane418" /&gt;

==Accompanying sounds==
[[William Henry Pickering]] noted that at eight stations in Canada a trembling of the house or ground was felt.&lt;ref name=pickering96&gt;Pickering, 1923 (Part II), 96&lt;/ref&gt; In many other places loud, thunder-like sounds were heard, occasionally by people who had not seen the meteors themselves. Pickering used the sound reports to perform a check on the height of the meteors, which he calculated at 35 miles (56&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=pickering100&gt;Pickering, 1923 (Part II), 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The first detailed study of the reports was produced by the Canadian astronomer [[Clarence Chant]], who wrote about the meteors in vol. 7 of the ''Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada''. The orbit was later discussed by Pickering and G. J. Burns, who concluded that it was essentially satellitic.&lt;ref name=okeefe59&gt;O'Keefe, J. A. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1959JRASC..53...59O A Probable Natural Satellite: The Meteor Procession of February 9, 1913]", ''Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada'', Vol. 53 (1959), 59&lt;/ref&gt; Although this explanation was later attacked by [[Charles Wylie (astronomer)|Charles Wylie]], who attempted to prove that the shower had a radiant, further studies by [[Lincoln LaPaz]] (who criticised Wylie's methods as "unscientific")&lt;ref name=lapaz&gt;LaPaz, L. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1956Metic...1..402L/0000402.000.html The Canadian Fireball Procession of 1913 February 9]", ''Meteoritics'', vol. 1 (1956), 4, 402&lt;/ref&gt; and John O'Keefe showed that the meteors had most likely represented a body, or group of bodies, which had been temporarily captured into orbit about the Earth before disintegrating.&lt;ref name=okeefe59 /&gt;

O'Keefe later suggested that the meteors, which he referred to as the "Cyrillids", could have in fact represented the last remnant of a circumterrestrial [[planetary ring|ring]], formed from the ejecta of a postulated lunar volcano.&lt;ref name="okeefe" /&gt; This theory was a development of O'Keefe's unusual hypothesis on the origin of [[tektites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowman|first=Paul D.|title=Memorial: John A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6982">[[Image:Protonshower.jpg|thumb|right|Cosmic ray air shower created by a 1TeV proton hitting the atmosphere 20 km above the Earth. The shower was simulated using the [[AIRshower Extended Simulations|AIRES]] package. Animated 3d models of this and other showers can be found on [[COSMUS]].]]  
[[File:Air shower detected in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|Air shower detected in a [[cloud chamber]].]]
An '''air shower''' is an extensive (many kilometres wide) [[Particle shower|cascade]] of [[Ion|ionized particles]] and [[electromagnetic radiation]] produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] when a ''primary'' [[cosmic ray]] (i.e. one of extraterrestrial origin) enters the atmosphere. When a particle, which could be a [[proton]], a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], an [[electron]], a [[photon]], or (rarely) a [[positron]], strikes an atom's nucleus in the air it produces many energetic [[hadrons]]. The unstable hadrons decay in the air speedily into other particles and electromagnetic radiation, which are part of the shower components. The secondary radiation rains down, including [[x-rays]], [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[antiproton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[neutron]]s.

The [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, with a dose rate that varies in different parts of the world and based largely on the geomagnetic field, altitude, and solar cycle. Airline crews receive more cosmic rays if they routinely work flight routes that take them close to the North or South pole at high altitudes, where this type of radiation is maximal.

The air shower was discovered by [[Bruno Rossi]] in 1934. By observing the cosmic ray with the detectors placed apart from each other, Rossi recognized that many particles arrive simultaneously at the detectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is now called an air shower.

==Air shower formation==
[[Image:AirShower.svg|thumb|310px|Air shower formation in the atmosphere. First proton collides with a particle in the air creating pions, protons and neutrons.]]
After the primary cosmic particle has collided with the air molecule, the main part of the first interactions are [[pion]]s. Also [[kaon]]s and [[baryon]]s may be created. Pions and kaons are not stable, thus they may decay into other particles.

The neutral pions &lt;math&gt;\pi^0&lt;/math&gt; decay into photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in a process &lt;math&gt;\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma &lt;/math&gt;. The photons produced form an electromagnetic cascade by [[pair production|creating]] more photons, protons, antiprotons, electrons and positrons.&lt;ref name="rao10"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

The charged pions &lt;math&gt;\pi^\pm&lt;/math&gt; preferentially decay into muons and neutrinos in the processes &lt;math&gt;\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\pi^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \nu&lt;/math&gt;. This is how the muons and neutrinos are produced in the air shower.&lt;ref name="rao10"/&gt;

Also, kaon may be an origin of muons, which means the decay process is &lt;math&gt; K^{+/-} \rightarrow \mu^{+/-} + \nu&lt;/math&gt;. In the other hand kaons can produce also pions via the decay mode &lt;math&gt; K^{+/-} \rightarrow \pi^{+/-} + \pi^0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="rao10"/&gt;

==Detection==
The original particle arrives with high energy and hence a velocity near the [[speed of light]], so the products of the collisions tend also to move generally in the same direction as the primary, while to some extent spreading sidewise. In addition, the secondary particles produce a widespread flash of light in forward direction due to the [[Cherenkov effect]], as well as [[Fluorescence|fluorescence light]] that is emitted isotropically from the excitation of nitrogen molecules. The particle cascade and the light produced in the atmosphere can be detected with surface detector arrays and optical telescopes. Surface detectors typically use [[Cherenkov detector]]s or [[Scintillation counter]]s to detect the charged secondary particles at ground level. The telescopes used to measure the fluorescence and Cherenkov light use large mirrors to focus the light on [[Photomultiplier|PMT]] clusters. Finally, air showers emit radio waves due to the deflection of electrons and positrons by the geomagnetic field. As advantage over the optical techniques, radio detection is possible around the clock and not only during dark and clear nights. Thus, several modern experiments, e.g., [[Tunka experiment|TAIGA]], [[LOFAR]], or the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] use radio antennas in addition to particle detectors and optical techniques.

The longitudinal profile of the number of charged particles can be parameterized by the [[Gaisser–Hillas function]].

'''Airgap''' is an invention in microelectronic fabrication by [[IBM]]. 

== Description ==
By insulating copper wires within a chip with [[vacuum]] holes, [[capacitance]] can be minimized enabling chips to work faster or draw less power. A vacuum is believed to be the ultimate insulator for wiring capacitance, which occurs when two adjacent wires on a chip draw electrical energy from one another, generating undesirable heat and slowing the speed at which [[data]] can move through a chip. IBM estimates that this technology alone can lead to 35% higher speeds in [[Electric current|current flow]] or 15% lower power consumption.

== Fabrication techniques ==
IBM researchers have figured out a way to manufacture these "airgaps" on a massive scale, using the [[self-assembly]] properties of certain [[polymer]]s, and then combine this with regular [[CMOS]] [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacturing techniques]], saving enormous resources since they don't have to retool the entire process. When making the chips the entire [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] is prepared with a polymer material that when removed at a later stage leaves [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]s of holes, just 20 [[nanometer]]s in [[diameter]], evenly spaced. Even though the name suggests that the holes are filled with air, they are in fact filled with nothing, vacuum. IBM has already proven this technique in their labs, and is already deployed in their manufacturing plant in [[East Fishkill, New York]] where they have made prototype [[POWER6]] processors using this technology. Full scale deployment is scheduled for IBM's [[45 nm]] node in 2009 after which this technology will also be available to IBM's customers. 

== History ==
Airgap was developed in a collaborative effort between IBM's [[Almaden Research Center]] and [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|T.J. Watson Research Center]], and the [[University of Albany#College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering|University of Albany, New York]].

'''''American Threnody''''' is a 2007 American documentary film, directed by [[Robert Rex Jackson]]. It concerns the [[Maxey Flat]] [[Low Level Radioactive Waste]] facility in eastern Kentucky. The facility was built on the former site of the farm where the filmmaker's grandfather was born. The film examines the impact of the facility on the community and examines the persistent containment problems that have been the subject of media coverage. Current methods of storing and disposing of transuranic isotopes and how they differ from the techniques used at Maxey Flat are also explored.

Tissues that have been preserved with [[formaldehyde]], a highly reactive compound, contain a variety of chemical modifications that can reduce the detectability of proteins in biomedical procedures such as [[immunohistochemistry]]. '''Antigen retrieval''' is an approach to reducing or eliminating these chemical modifications. The two primary methods of [[antigen]] retrieval are heat-mediated [[epitope]] retrieval (HIER) and [[proteolytic]] induced epitope retrieval (PIER).

== Protease-induced epitope retrieval (PIER) ==
It's the cleavage of peptides, exposing the antigen; uses enzymes including Proteinase K, Trypsin, and Pepsin.

It has low success rate for restoring immunoreactivity and potentially destroys both tissue morphology and the antigen of interest.

== Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) ==
It's the reversal of cross-links and restoration of protein structures by heat; method efficiency dependent on time, temperature, buffer and pH. In general HIER allows better antigen retrieval than PIER.

== Room Temperature Epitope Retrieval (RTER) ==
It's the reversal of cross-links using acids such as hydrochloric acid (pH 1) or formic acid (pH 2).

&lt;/ref&gt;  The German onshore section was to include a compressor station and a connection to the existing gas network. The length of planned offshore section was around {{convert|200|km|mi}}. The Danish landing point was to be in [[Avedøre]], and the pipeline was planned to connect with the [[Avedøre power plant]]. In Sweden, the landing point was to be in [[Trelleborg]] and the Swedish onshore section was to continue approximately {{convert|20|km|mi}} to the existing gas grid.

==Technical features==
The pipeline was designed for a pressure of {{convert|150|bar|MPa}} with a diameter of {{convert|28|to|32|in|mm|-1}}. The planned annual capacity was {{convert|3|e9m3|abbr=off}} with option for later increase up to {{convert|10|e9m3|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=sweden2008&gt;

The consortium to build the Baltic Gas Interconnector consisted of [[DONG Energy]] (originally Energi E2), [[Hovedstadsregionens Naturgas]] (HNG), [[VNG - Verbundnetz Gas AG]], [[E.ON Sverige]] AB, [[Göteborgs Energi]], [[Lunds Energi]] and [[Öresundskraft]].&lt;ref name=BGI/&gt;&lt;ref name=sweden2008/&gt;

==Feasibility study==
The feasibility study which was completed in 2001 included market assessment, seabed survey, offshore and onshore installations estimated total cost to be €225&amp;nbsp;million ($202.3&amp;nbsp;million). The pipeline was scheduled to become operational circa 2004–2005.&lt;ref name&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental impact assessment started in 2002. Authorization from Swedish government was given in 2004, by Denmark – in 2005. The last phase of authorization was to come from Germany, in 2006. The project has not been implemented yet.

During the initial stages of the project, gas was planned to transported from the [[North Sea]] which is now in depletion. Consequently, Russian gas has been considered as an alternative source for the pipeline. However, due to considerations for linking [[Nord Stream]] pipeline to Swedish pipeline network, implementation of BGI is being revisited.

The '''Bhabha Atomic Research Centre''' ('''BARC''') is [[India]]'s premier [[nuclear research]] facility headquartered in [[Trombay]], [[Mumbai]], [[Maharashtra]]. BARC is a multi-disciplinary research centre with extensive infrastructure for advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of [[nuclear science]], [[nuclear engineering|engineering]] and related areas.

BARC's core mandate is to sustain peaceful applications of nuclear energy, primarily for power generation. It manages all facts of nuclear power generation, from theoretical design of reactors to, computerised modelling and simulation, risk analysis, development and testing of new reactor fuel materials, etc. It also conducts research in spent fuel processing, and safe disposal of nuclear waste. Its other research focus areas are applications for isotopes in industries, medicine, agriculture, etc. BARC operates a number of [[research reactor]]s across the country.&lt;ref name=barc-milestones&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barc.ernet.in/about/mile.htm|title=Milestones|publisher=Bhabha Atomic Research Centre|accessdate=2012-02-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207170320/http://www.barc.ernet.in/about/mile.htm|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Trombay.jpg|left|thumb|India's first reactor and a plutonium reprocessing facility, [[Mumbai]], as photographed by a US satellite on 19 February 1966.]]

The Government of India created the '''Atomic Energy Establishment, [[Trombay]]''' (AEET) on 3 January 1954. It was established to consolidate all the research and development activity for nuclear reactors and technology under the Atomic Energy Commission. All scientists and engineers engaged in the fields of reactor design and development, instrumentation, metallurgy and material science etc. were transferred with their respective programmes from the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR) to AEET, with TIFR retaining its original focus for fundamental research in the sciences. After [[Homi J. Bhabha]]'s death in 1966, the centre was renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre on 22 January 1967. All the directors of the BARC were highly qualified doctorates in their discipline and were internationally recognised for their contribution in academia, who were the crown of this prestigious research organisation.&lt;ref name=barc-about/&gt;

The first reactors at BARC and its affiliated power generation centres were imported from the west. India's first power reactors, installed at the [[Tarapur Atomic Power Station]] were from the United States.

The primary importance of BARC is as a research centre. The BARC and the Indian government has consistently maintained that the reactors are used for this purpose only: Apsara (1956; named by the then Prime Minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] when he likened the blue [[Cerenkov radiation]] to the beauty of the [[Apsaras]]), [[CIRUS]] (1960; the "Canada-India Reactor" with assistance from the US), the now-defunct ZERLINA (1961; Zero Energy Reactor for Lattice Investigations and Neutron Assay), Purnima I (1972), Purnima II (1984), [[Dhruva reactor|Dhruva]] (1985), Purnima III (1990), and [[KAMINI]].
[[Image:BARC nuclear reactor.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Digitally altered image of BARC (view from [[Arabian sea|seaside]])]]
The plutonium used in India's 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear test came from CIRUS. The 1974 test (and the 1998 tests that followed) gave Indian scientists the technological know-how and confidence not only to develop nuclear fuel for future reactors to be used in power generation and research, but also the capacity to refine the same fuel into weapons-grade fuel to be used in the development of nuclear weapons. It is one of the world's most important ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTRE. 

BARC also designed and built India's first [[Pressurised water reactor]] at [[Kalpakkam]], a 80MW land based prototype of [[INS Arihant]]'s nuclear power unit,&lt;ref name=telegraph-elder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090803/jsp/nation/story_11313999.jsp |title=Unveiled: Arihant’s elder brother |publisher=The Telegraph|date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Arihant's propulsion reactor.&lt;ref name=hindu-indiandesign&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/16/stories/2009081655260900.htm|title=INS Arihant is an Indian design: Anil Kakodkar|publisher=The Hindu|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu-pwr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/03/stories/2009080353810100.htm |title=PWR building shows indigenous capability, says Kakodkar |publisher=The Hindu |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808043941/http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/03/stories/2009080353810100.htm |archivedate=8 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India and the NPT ==
India is not a part of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), citing concerns that it unfairly favours the established nuclear powers, and provides no provision for complete nuclear disarmament. Indian officials argued that India's refusal to sign the treaty stemmed from its fundamentally discriminatory character; the treaty places restrictions on the non-nuclear weapons states but does little to curb the modernisation and expansion of the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear weapons states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2029293.stm|title=A-bomb victims warn of nuclear horror|date=2002-06-06|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whereincity.com/news/3/15197 |title=India seeks Japan's support, calls NPT 'flawed' |date=2012-01-12 |access-date=2016-05-08 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112151514/http://www.whereincity.com/news/3/15197 |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, India and the United States signed an agreement to enhance nuclear cooperation between the two countries, and for India to participate in an international consortium on fusion research, [[ITER]] (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) so there are signs that the west wants to bring India in the Nuclear mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Civilian research ==
The BARC also conducts research in [[biotechnology]] at the Gamma Gardens, and has developed numerous disease resistant and high-yielding crop varieties, particularly groundnuts. It also conducts research in Liquid Metal Magnetohydrodynamics for power generation.

On 4 June 2005, with the goal of encouraging research in basic sciences, BARC started the [[Homi Bhabha National Institute]]. Research institutions affiliated to BARC(Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) include IGCAR ([[Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research]]), RRCAT ([[Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology]]), and VECC ([[Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre]]).

Power projects that have benefited from BARC expertise but which fall under the NPCIL ([[Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited]]) are KAPP ([[Kakrapar Atomic Power Project]]), RAPP ([[Rajasthan Atomic Power Project]]), and TAPP ([[Tarapur Atomic Power Station|Tarapur Atomic Power Project]]).

The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in addition to its nuclear research mandate, also conducts research in other high technology areas like accelerators, micro electron beams, materials design, supercomputers, and computer vision among the few. The BARC has dedicated departments for these specialised fields. BARC has designed and developed, for its own use an infrastructure of supercomputers, [[Anupam (supercomputer)|Anupam]] using state of the art technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6388">[[File:Biomes of Brazil.png|thumb|A map of the distribution of [[biome]]s in [[Brazil]].]]

According to [[IBGE]] (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrabrasilis.org.br/ecotecadigital/index.php/estantes/mapas/563-mapa-de-biomas-do-brasil |title=Mapas e Cartografia - Mapa de Biomas do Brasil |website=Terrabrasilis.org.br |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]] has its territory occupied by six terrestrial [[biome]]s and one marine [[biome]].

==Terminology==
The term "[[biome]]" has several meanings. In a narrow sense (e.g., Whittaker, 1975; Coutinho, 2006), used in literature, it names physio-functionally defined small-scale areas, habitat types or ecosystem types. Although it includes both the plants and the animals and microorganisms of a community, in practice, it is defined by the climate and physiognomy or general appearance of the plants of the community.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coutinho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-33062006000100002 |title=The biome concept |website=Scielo.br |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coutinho"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1676-06032011000100001 |title=The Brazilian cerrado is not a biome |website=Scielo.br |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broad sense, adopted by Joly et al. (1978) and the IBGE (2016), biome can be understood as a synonym of "biogeographic province" (e.g., Rizzini, 1963, Eiten 1977, Cabrera and Willink 1980, the term "floristic province" or "phytogeographic" is used when considering plant species only), or as an approximate synonym of "morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain" (Ab'Sáber, 1967, 2003).&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|author=Walter, B. M. T.|date=2006|title=Fitofisionomias do bioma Cerrado: síntese terminológica e relações florísticas|publisher=Tese de Doutorado, Universidade de Brasília|pages=53–55|url=http://www.pgecl.unb.br/images/sampledata/arquivos/teses/2000a2010/2006/Bruno%20M.T.%20Walter.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this broad sense, the "Projeto Radam" (Veloso et al., 1973) applies the term "phytoecological region", and IBGE (2012) adopts the term "floristic region".&lt;ref name="IBGE 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/geociencias/recursosnaturais/vegetacao/manual_vegetacao.shtm |title=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística |website=Ibge.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "region" must be understood, in this case, in the generalist sense of "area". The terms "region" and "province" have specific traditional meanings in phytogeography: regions are areas characterized by endemic families, and provinces are areas characterized by endemic genera and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Braun-Blanquet, J.|date=1932|title=Plant sociology; the study of plant communities|location=New York and London|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7161#/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the 'domains' of Ab'Sáber (1967, 2003), the defined area is characterized by the predominance of certain geomorphological and climatic characteristics, and also by a certain predominant floristic province (vegetative type). However, there is no uniformity: enclaves from other provinces, characteristics of other domains, may occur within this area.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;

==Terrestrial biomes==
===Amazônia===
[[Image:Aerial view of the Amazon Rainforest.jpg|thumb|[[Rain forest]]]]
The [[Amazon Forest]] is the largest forest formation on the planet, conditioned by the humid equatorial climate. It is equivalent to 35% of the forest areas of the planet. It has a wide variety of plant formations.

===Cerrado===
The [[Cerrado]] presents diverse regions, ranging from clean fields devoid of woody vegetation to [[cerradão]], a dense tree formation. Its climate is particularly striking, presenting two well-defined seasons.

===Mata Atlântica===
[[Image:Baía de Antonina vista da Serra do Mar2.JPG|thumb|[[Mata Atlântica]]]]
The [[Atlantic Forest]] is composed of a series of ecosystems with very different structures and composition of flowers, as well as the climatic characteristics of the region where it occurs, having as a common element the exposure to the humid winds that blow from the ocean.

===Caatinga===
The [[Caatinga]] has dry soils and its vegetation is formed by palm trees, such as buriti, oiticica, babassu and carnauba. Much of its northeastern part suffers a high risk of desertification due to the degradation of vegetation cover and soil.

===Pampa===
[[Image:P1240007.JPG|thumb|[[Pampa]]]]
The [[Pampa]] is characterized by the amount of herbaceous species and several typologies of the country, composing in some regions, environments integrated with the [[Araucária forest]]. The flat plains of the Gaucho plains and plateaus and the soft-wavy reliefs are colonized by pioneering  species that form an open savanna vegetation.

===Pantanal===
The [[Pantanal]] is an alluvial plain influenced by rivers that drain the basin of the Upper Paraguay, where it develops a fauna and flora of rare beauty and abundance. This ecosystem is formed by largely sandy terrains, covered by different physiognomies due to the variety of microregions and flood regimes.

==Marine biome==
[[Image:Mergulho em Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Brasil.jpg|thumb|The [[Fernando de Noronha]] archipelago.]]
The Brazilian marine biome is located on the "Marine Zone of Brazil", the continental shelf biotope, and presents several ecosystems.

The Brazilian Coastal Zone has as distinctive aspects in its long extension through different biomes that arrive until the coast, the biome of the [[Amazônia]], the biome of the [[Caatinga]] and bioma of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. These biomes with wide variety of species and ecosystems, cover more than 8,500&amp;nbsp;km of coastline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6742">'''Mohamad "Bob" Hasan''' (born 1931) is an [[Indonesia]]n businessman, former Minister of Trade and Industry, and friend of former [[president of Indonesia]], [[Suharto]].

==Early life==
Hasan, was born in [[Semarang]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia in February 1931. He is a legally adopted son of [[Gatot Soebroto|Gatot Subroto]], a general in the [[Indonesian Army]], who commanded then-Colonel Suharto in the 1950s, and through whom Hasan met Suharto.

==Business career==
After Suharto replaced Subroto as commander of the Army's Diponegoro Division, Hasan worked with Suharto to develop a wide range of side businesses, controlled by the military, that provided much of the funding for the Division as well as extra income for its officers.&lt;ref name="barr1998"&gt;Barr, Christopher M (1998). [http://cip.cornell.edu/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/seap.indo/1106953918 Bob Hasan, the rise of Apkindo, and the shifting dynamics of control in Indonesia's timber sector]. ''Indonesia'' 65:1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Suharto took the presidency in 1966, he initiated a massive expansion of Indonesian commercial logging, especially in the islands outside of [[Java]].  In the 1970s Hasan served as the required Indonesian "partner" for foreign companies wanting to harvest timber in Indonesia, working most notably with the [[United States]] corporation [[Georgia Pacific]], and also established a number of joint ventures between his and government-owned companies. In 1981 the government banned the export of unmilled timber, leading to many foreign companies selling their Indonesian operations to domestic owners interested in establishing processing operations; Hasan, already a major shareholder in Georgia Pacific's Indonesia operation, became its sole owner when the company left Indonesia in 1983.&lt;ref name="barr1998"/&gt;  Starting from timber, he expanded his business interests into financial, insurance, automotive, and other industries, primarily through his Kalimanis [[holding company]].&lt;ref name="saragosa"&gt;Saragosa, Manuel (1997). Indonesian tycoon plays influential role. ''Financial Times'' February 13. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan's Kalimanis group was reported to control over 2 million hectares (7,700 square miles) of prime concessions in [[Kalimantan]].&lt;ref name="Economist1997"/&gt;

Hasan was also Chairman of the Indonesian Wood Panel Association (Apkindo) Under Hasan, Apkindo was given complete control of plywood pricing, marketing, and exports. Apkindo helped Indonesia gain about three-quarters of the worldwide plywood export market by the early 1990s, sometimes using techniques described by observers as "[[predatory pricing]]". Hasan personally profited from his chairmanship both by supporting business he owned, and through control of the fees paid to the organization by other members.&lt;ref name="barr1998"/&gt;

Hasan ran PT Nusantara Ampera Bakti (Nusamba) which is 80%-owned by foundations controlled by Suharto.&lt;ref name="Economist1997"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia’s Uncle Bob (Mar 27, 1997)|url=http://www.economist.com/node/367251?_ga=1.41763362.1244557049.1469992653|publisher=The economist|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ021697&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borsuk|first1=Richard|title=Freeport Beats Out Canadians To Develop Busang Gold Mine|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB856111694777478500|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=Feb 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hasan was said to become the mediator in disputes between Suharto's six children, after the death of Suharto's wife.&lt;ref name="Economist1997"/&gt; He was reported to orchestrate the deal of settling shareholder dispute of the Busang gold deposit found by [[Bre-X Minerals]] in Kalimantan.&lt;ref name="Economist1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ021697/&gt;

==Indonesian cabinet ministry==
Suharto appointed Hasan Minister of Trade and Industry in 1998, making him the only Indonesian of Chinese descent ever to join Suharto's cabinet.  His appointment was criticised by some foreign financial analysts as evidence that Suharto was not interested in substantial fiscal changes after the [[East Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Barry (1998). Suharto cronies dominate new financial team. ''South China Morning Post'' March 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) requirements during the crisis, Apkindo was closed down in 1998.&lt;ref name="cotton1999"&gt;Cotton, James (1999). The "haze" over Southeast Asia: challenging the ASEAN mode of regional engagement. ''Pacific Affairs'' 72(3):331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption convictions and imprisonment==
Hasan was frequently the subject of allegations of corruption as a result of his business dealings and control of much of Indonesian industry; after Suharto stepped down in 1998, a series of court judgements found evidence of crimes.  He was fined 50 billion [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] ([[United States dollar|US$]]7 million) as a result of a lawsuit filed by several youth organisations, alleging that Hasan had ordered the burning of  forests in [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name="cotton1999"/&gt; In February 2001, a court unanimously convicted him of causing a US$244 million loss to the Indonesian government through a fraudulent forest-mapping project in Java in the early 1990s, leading to imprisonment. He was imprisoned at [[Cipinang prison]] and then at the more secure [[Nusa Kambangan]], an island off the coast of south-central Java, until his release on [[parole]] in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Donnan, Shawn (2004). Jailed ex-tycoon Hasan is released early in Indonesia. ''Financial Times'' February 23. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan was the first and among the most prominent of former Suharto associates convicted of fraud and corruption after Suharto resigned in May 1998.

Hasan was a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] from 1994 to 2004, when the IOC expelled him due to his corruption conviction.  The IOC was criticised by the Indonesian government in 2000 after the IOC argued that Hasan should be allowed to attend the [[2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, Australia despite his being under arrest at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bita, Natasha (2000). IOC tries to get its own out of jail. ''The Australian''. September 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bronze wool''' is a bundle of very fine [[bronze]] filaments, used in finishing and repair work to polish wood or metal objects. Bronze wool is similar to [[steel wool]], but is used in its place to avoid some problems associated with broken filaments: steel [[rust]]s quickly, especially in a marine environment.  Furthermore, steel is [[magnetic]] and can affect the operation of marine equipment, such as a compass. [[Steel]] can also discolor some materials, such as [[oak]]. This discoloration results from a reaction between the [[tannates]] in the oak and the [[iron]] in the steel, forming iron tannate, a black compound.

Bronze wool also has uses for filter elements, again when rusting would be a problem.

The main US retail supplier of bronze wool is Homax Group, under their Rhodes American brand.

Bronze wool has largely been replaced for cost reasons, by plastic mesh abrasives from makers such as Webrax and [[3M]] [[Scotch-Brite]]. These use grains of [[aluminium oxide]] or [[silicon carbide]], bonded to a non-woven web of [[Nylon|nylon fibres]]. Like bronze wool, they avoid rust problems.

The material is provided in bulk or logs.

BMC is manufactured by mixing strands (&gt;1”) of chopped [[glass fiber]]s in a mixer with a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset resin]] (commonly [[polyester resin]], [[vinyl ester resin]] or [[epoxy resin]]). The glass fibers in BMC result in better strength properties than standard thermoplastic products. Typical applications include demanding electrical applications, corrosion resistant needs, appliance, automotive, and transit.

fabric or fibre's are pre-impregneted under pre-catalysed (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precatalyst) resin.The catalyst is largely content at ambient temperature giving the material useful like when difrested.They are nearly solid at ambient temperature so appeared to be adhesive. The prepregs are laid on to the mold by hand.Then vacuum forged and heated to 120-180°c. this allow the resin to flow followed by carrying addition pressure can be applied by autoclave.

'''CANFLEX'''; the name is derived from its function: CANDU FLEXible fuelling, is an advanced fuel bundle design developed by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. ([[AECL]]), along with the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute ([[KAERI]]) for use in [[CANDU]] design [[nuclear reactors]]. The designers claim that it will deliver many benefits to current and future CANDU reactors-using [[natural uranium]] or other advanced [[nuclear fuel cycle]]s. These include greater operating and safety margins, extended plant life, better economics and increased power.

The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is about 10 cm (four inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20 inches) long and weighs about 20 kg (44 lbs) and  replaces 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. This reduces the power rating of the hottest pins in the bundles, for the same total bundle power output. Also, the design incorporates special geometry modifications that enhance the heat transfer between the fuel and surrounding coolant.  Twenty-four of these fuel bundles have been tested in the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station|Point Lepreau CANDU 6 reactor]] in New Brunswick, Canada, and results indicate CANFLEX meets all expectations and regulatory requirements.

The [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] has recently announced a conversion to CANFLEX fuel for their reactors, in 2006.

The '''Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT)''' is a student-run sustainability organization located at [[Humboldt State University]] in [[Arcata, California]]. CCAT has partnered with [[Appropedia]] to bring over 30 years of student-based [[open-source appropriate technology]] solutions to the world.

The organization is housed in a 70-year-old house and contains scores of resource-saving devices such as solar roof panels, a gravity-based rainwater collection system to water the gardens, and an electrical generator which runs on biodiesel made from cooking oil from the school's cafeteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Harnessing the Power Within; After 20 Years, California University House Is a Showcase of Energy Efficiency'' |author=John M.

A '''carbon footprint''' is historically defined as the total emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, or product, expressed as [[carbon dioxide equivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a carbon footprint? |url=http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/solutions/CarbonFootprinting/what_is_a_carbon_footprint.htm |doi= |accessdate=24 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511102744/http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/solutions/CarbonFootprinting/what_is_a_carbon_footprint.htm |archivedate=11 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the total carbon footprint cannot be exactly calculated because of inadequate knowledge of and data about the complex interactions between contributing processes, including the influence of natural processes that store or release carbon dioxide. For this reason, Wright, Kemp, and Williams, have suggested to define the carbon footprint as:

:: A measure of the total amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest. Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year [[global warming potential]] (GWP100).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=L.|author2=Kemp, S.|author3=Williams, I.|title='Carbon footprinting': towards a universally accepted definition|journal=Carbon Management|year=2011|volume=2|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.4155/CMT.10.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be emitted through land clearance and the production and consumption of food, fuels, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CO2 list (and original sources cited therein)|url=http://the.co2list.org/|doi=|accessdate= 18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For simplicity of reporting, it is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent of other GHGs, emitted.

Most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U.S. household come from "indirect" sources, e.g. fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final consumer. These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in one's car or stove, commonly referred to as "direct" sources of the consumer's carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

The concept name of the carbon footprint originates from [[ecological footprint]], discussion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17wwln-safire-t.html | work=The New York Times | title=Footprint | first=William | last=Safire | date=17 February 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed by [[William E. Rees]] and [[Mathis Wackernagel]] in the 1990s. This accounting approach compares how much people demand compared to what the planet can renew. This allows to assess the number of "earths" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint. The carbon Footprint is one part of the ecological footprint. The carbon part was popularized by a large campaign of BP in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17wwln-safire-t.html|title=William Safire - On Language - Grammar - Usage - English Language|last=Safire|first=William|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, carbon footprint was used as a measure of carbon emissions to develop the energy plan for City of Lynnwood, Washington. Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they measure merely emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.

Carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also includes [[water footprint]] and [[land footprint]].

==Measuring carbon footprints==

An individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment or other calculative activities denoted as [[carbon accounting]]. Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, e.g. by technological developments, better process and product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP), [[carbon capture]], consumption strategies, carbon offsetting and others.

Several free online carbon footprint calculators exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co2list.org/files/calculators.htm|title=Carbon Footprint Calculators |publisher=CO2List.org |accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a few supported by publicly available peer-reviewed data and calculations including the University of California, Berkeley's CoolClimate Network research consortium and CarbonStory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/carboncalculator|title=CoolClimate Carbon Footprint Calculator for U.S. Households and Individuals|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwI9ptFQU1QiM2IzNWE0YTQtNjY4NS00MzM5LWFkZDUtOWNkY2NkNTMxOTM4/edit?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1|title=Online supporting data, calculations &amp; methodologies for paper: Jones, Kammen "Quantifying Carbon Footprint Reduction Opportunities for U.S. Households and Communities" ES&amp;T, 2011 (publicly available)|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonstory.org/calculator/overview|website=carbonstory.org|title=Calculator|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These websites ask you to answer more or less detailed questions about your diet, transportation choices, home size, shopping and recreational activities, usage of electricity, heating, and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators, and so on. The website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions. A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual/household carbon footprints. This review identified 13 calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the 15 most popular online carbon footprint calculators. A recent study’s results by Carnegie Mellon's Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties. The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production, shipment, and previous technology used to make that product, can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint. It is important to question, and address the accuracy of Carbon Footprint techniques, especially due to its overwhelming popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, Robert William, and Debra Ann Schwartz.

Accessed 5 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon Footprints can be reduced through the development of alternative projects, such as solar and wind energy, which are environment friendly, renewable resources, or reforestation, the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted. These examples are known as Carbon Offsetting, the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, James.

The main influences on carbon footprints include population, economic output, and energy and carbon intensity of the economy.&lt;ref name="Brown, Marilyn A. 2008"&gt;Brown, Marilyn A., Frank Southworth, and Andrea Sarzynski. Shrinking The Carbon Footprint of Metropolitan America. Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, May 2008. Web. 23 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are the main targets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints. Production creates a large carbon footprint, scholars suggest that decreasing the amount of energy needed for production would be one of the most effective ways to decrease a carbon footprint. This is due to the fact that Electricity is responsible for roughly 37% of Carbon Dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;

== Average carbon footprint per person by country ==

The global average carbon footprint in 2007 was around 5.7 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/cap. The [[EU]] average for this time was about 13.8 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/cap, whereas for the [[U.S.]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Australia]] it was over 25 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/cap. The footprints per capita of countries in [[Africa]] and [[India]] were well below average. To set this numbers into context, assuming a [[global population]] around 9-10 billion by 2050 a carbon footprint of about 2 - 2.5 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e per capita is needed to stay within a 2&amp;nbsp;°C target. The carbon footprint calculations are based on a consumption based approach using a Multi-Regional [[Input–output model|Input-Output]] database, which accounts for all [[Greenhouse Gas]] (GHG) emissions in the global supply chain and allocates them to the final consumer of the purchased commodities. GHG emissions related to [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|land use cover change]] are not included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Mobility (driving, flying &amp; small amount from public transit), shelter (electricity, heating, construction) and food are the most important consumption categories determining the carbon footprint of a person. In the [[EU]], the carbon footprint of mobility is evenly split between direct emissions (e.g. from driving private cars) and emissions embodied in purchased products related to mobility (air transport service, emissions occurring during the production of cars and during the extraction of fuel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The carbon footprint of U.S. households is about 5 times greater than the global average. For most U.S. households the single most important action to reduce their carbon footprint is driving less or switching to a more efficient vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Note: 3.6 MJ = megajoule(s) == 1&amp;nbsp;kW·h = kilowatt-hour(s), thus 1 g/MJ = 3.6 g/kW·h.&lt;br&gt;Legend:&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Black&amp;nbsp;coal&amp;nbsp;(supercritical)–(new&amp;nbsp;subcritical), Br&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Brown&amp;nbsp;coal&amp;nbsp;(new&amp;nbsp;subcritical), cc&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;combined&amp;nbsp;cycle, oc&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;open&amp;nbsp;cycle, T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;low-temperature/closed-circuit&amp;nbsp;(geothermal&amp;nbsp;doublet), T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;high-temperature/open-circuit, W&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Light&amp;nbsp;Water&amp;nbsp;Reactors, W&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Heavy&amp;nbsp;Water&amp;nbsp;Reactors, #Educated&amp;nbsp;estimate.

These three studies thus concluded that hydroelectric, wind, and nuclear power produced the least CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per kilowatt-hour of any other electricity sources.
These figures do not allow for emissions due to accidents or terrorism. [[Wind power]] and [[solar power]], emit no carbon from the operation, but do leave a footprint during construction phase and maintenance during operation. [[Hydropower]] from reservoirs also has large footprints from initial removal of vegetation and ongoing methane (stream detritus decays anaerobically to methane in bottom of reservoir, rather than aerobically to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if it had stayed in an unrestricted stream).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectricity

The table above gives the carbon footprint per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, which is about half the world's man-made CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output.

This section gives representative figures for the carbon footprint of the fuel burned by different transport types (not including the carbon footprints of the vehicles or related infrastructure themselves). The precise figures vary according to a wide range of factors.

{{main|Environmental impact of aviation}}

Some representative figures for CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are provided by LIPASTO's survey of average direct emissions (not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects) of airliners expressed as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent per passenger kilometre:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipasto.vtt.fi/yksikkopaastot/henkiloliikennee/ilmaliikennee/ilmae.htm|title=Average passenger aircraft emissions and energy consumption per passenger kilometre in Finland 2008|website=lipasto.vtt.fi|accessdate= 3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Domestic, short distance, less than {{convert|463|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}: 257 g/km CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 259 g/km (14.7 oz/mile) CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e
* Long distance flights: 113 g/km CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 114 g/km (6.5 oz/mile) CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e

However, emissions per unit distance traveled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel, because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel. It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint, not the merely rate of emissions. For example, a greatly more distant holiday destination may be chosen than if another mode of travel were used, because air travel makes the longer distance feasible in the limited time available.&lt;ref&gt;Gössling S., Upham P.

==Indirect carbon emissions: the carbon footprints of products==

Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use, and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://The.CO2List.org|title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Released when Making &amp; Using Products|accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Environmental Protection Agency has addressed paper, plastic (candy wrappers), glass, cans, computers, carpet and tires. Australia has addressed lumber and other building materials. Academics in Australia, Korea and the US have addressed paved roads. Companies, nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages. Carnegie Mellon University has estimated the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; footprints of 46 large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries. Carnegie Mellon, Sweden and the Carbon Trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants.
	
The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods, shirts and detergents, introducing a [[carbon emission label|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; label]] in March 2007. The label is intended to comply with a new British [[Publicly Available Specification]] (i.e. not a standard), PAS 2050,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/PAS2050|title=PAS 2050|work=bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/carbon/briefing/carbon_label.htm |title=Certification  - Carbon Trust |work=carbontrust.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033219/http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/carbon/briefing/carbon_label.htm |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27,000 certifiable product carbon footprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/client-services/footprinting/footprint-measurement|title=Footprint measurement|publisher=The Carbon Trust|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026087741000542X|title=The carbon footprint and energy consumption of beverage packaging selection and disposal|first1=Jorgelina|last1=Pasqualino|first2=Montse|last2=Meneses|first3=Francesc|last3=Castells|date=1 April 2011|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|volume=103|issue=4|pages=357–365|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item. For example, a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton, a beer can is made of aluminum, and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic. The larger the size, the larger the footprint will be.'''

===Food===
{{main|Low carbon diet}}
In a 2014 study by Scarborough et al., the real-life diets of British people were surveyed and their dietary [[GHG footprint|greenhouse gas footprints]] estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1|pmid=25834298|pmc=4372775|title=Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK|journal=Climatic Change|volume=125|issue=2|pages=179–192|year=2014|last1=Scarborough|first1=Peter|last2=Appleby|first2=Paul N.|last3=Mizdrak|first3=Anja|last4=Briggs|first4=Adam D. M.|last5=Travis|first5=Ruth C.|last6=Bradbury|first6=Kathryn E.|last7=Key|first7=Timothy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day (in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent) were:

*7.19 for high meat-eaters
*5.63 for medium meat-eaters
*4.67 for low meat-eaters
*3.91 for fish-eaters
*3.81 for vegetarians
*2.89 for vegans

===Textiles===

The precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors. However, studies of textile production in Europe suggest the following carbon dioxide equivalent emissions footprints per kilo of textile at the point of purchase by a consumer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mike |last=Berners-Lee|title=How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything (London: Profile, 2010), pp. 93, 112 (table 6.1)|url= https://books.google.com/?id=zs13m5JquBwC|isbn=978-1847651822|date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Cotton: 8 
*Nylon: 5.43 
*PET (e.g. synthetic fleece): 5.55
*Wool: 5.48

Accounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products, synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mike |last=Berners-Lee|title=How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything'' (London: Profile, 2010), pp. 93-94|url= https://books.google.com/?id=zs13m5JquBwC|isbn=978-1847651822|date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
The carbon footprint of materials (also known as embodied carbon) varies widely. The carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the Inventory of Carbon &amp; Energy database,&lt;ref name="ICE Database"&gt;G.P.Hammond and C.I.Jones (2011) ''[http://www.circularecology.com/embodied-energy-and-carbon-footprint-database.html Embodied energy and carbon footprint database]''&lt;/ref&gt; the GREET databases and models,&lt;ref name="GREET databases and models"&gt;GREET databases ''[https://greet.es.anl.gov/ GREET databases and models]''&lt;/ref&gt; and LCA databases via openLCA Nexus&lt;ref name="LCA databases via openLCA Nexus"&gt;LCA databases via openLCA Nexus ''[http://www.openlca.org/lca-data LCA databases via openLCA Nexus]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schemes to reduce carbon emissions: Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates ==

Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, [[carbon offset]]s can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.

The [[Kyoto Protocol]] defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a ''mandatory market'' and a ''voluntary market''. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:

* [[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)
* [[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)
* [[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)

=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===
To reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:

* [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)
* [[Joint Implementation]] (JI)
* [[Emissions trading]]

The CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.

- Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).&lt;br /&gt;  - Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).

The CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:

- Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;br /&gt;
- Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.

Nations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.

A well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).

New changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.&lt;ref name="Callick, Rowan 2011"&gt;Callick, Rowan. "Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions." The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few year. These nations include China, India and the United States.&lt;ref name="Callick, Rowan 2011"/&gt;

=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===
In contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in the mandatory market.

The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.

There are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain—from project developer to retailer.&lt;ref name=ecosysmarket&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170031/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that [[forestry]] projects foster.
Project types in the voluntary market range from avoided [[deforestation]], afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestration]], increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], fuel switching, [[Carbon capture and storage|methane capture]] from coal plants and [[Climate change and agriculture#Livestock|livestock]], and even [[renewable energy]]. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to [[Carbon credit#Additionality and its importance|additionality]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acore.org/renewableenergyinfo/includes/resource-files/bios.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707112535/http://www.acore.org/renewableenergyinfo/includes/resource-files/bios.doc |archivedate=7 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs. Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit; which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market.

The size and activity of the voluntary carbon market is difficult to measure. The most comprehensive report on the voluntary carbon markets to date was released by Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance in July 2007.&lt;ref name=ecosysmarket/&gt;

[[ÆON]] of Japan is firstly approved by Japanese authority to indicate carbon footprint on three [[private brand]] goods in October 2009.

==Ways to reduce carbon footprint==

The most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to [[Waste hierarchy|Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse]]. In manufacturing this can be done by recycling the packing materials, by selling the obsolete inventory of one industry to the industry who is looking to buy unused items at lesser price to become competitive. Nothing should be disposed off into the soil, all the ferrous materials which are prone to degrade or oxidize with time should be sold as early as possible at reduced price.

This can also be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones. If that option isn't available, it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use. When one household recycles at least half of their household waste, they can save 1.2 tons of carbon dioxide annually&lt;ref name="environment.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.about.com/od/globalwarming/tp/globalwarmtips.htm|title=Personal Steps You Can Take to Fight Global Warming|author=Larry West|work=About.com News &amp; Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=December 2012}}.

Another easy option is to drive less. By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving, not only is a person going to save money on gas, but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere. However, if walking is not an option, one can look into [[carpooling]] or [[mass transportation]] options in their area.

Yet another option for reducing the [[carbon]] footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing [[weather stripping]] or [[caulking]] around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. Similarly, one can very inexpensively upgrade the "insulation" (clothing) worn by residents of the home.&lt;ref name="aquarianonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquarianonline.com/dressed-not-to-chill/|title=Dressed Not to Chill|work=Enlighten Up! with The Aquarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear (top and bottom) made from a lightweight, super insulating fabric like microfleece (''aka'' Polartec®, Capilene®) can conserve as much body heat as a full set of clothing, allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="aquarianonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/02/body-insulation-thermal-underwear.html|title=LOW-TECH MAGAZINE|work=lowtechmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day, and keep temperatures moderate at all times. Setting the thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about 1 ton of [[carbon dioxide]] each year.&lt;ref name="environment.about.com"/&gt;{{reliable source|date=December 2012}}

Choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long distance and/or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet. Scientists at the University of Chicago have estimated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Diet, Energy, and Global Warming|journal=Ametsoc.org|volume=10|issue=9|pages=1–17|doi=10.1175/EI167.1|year = 2006|last1 = Eshel|first1 = Gidon|last2=Martin|first2=Pamela A.|citeseerx=10.1.1.394.3094}}&lt;/ref&gt; "that the average American diet – which derives 28% of its calories from animal foods – is responsible for approximately one and a half more tonnes of greenhouse gasses – as {{CO2}} equivalents – per person, per year than a fully plant-based, or vegan, diet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cecmanitoba.ca/resource/hearings/22/WPG2-006.pdf Presentation to the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission "Hog Production Industry Review" by Syd Baumel, April 27, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014225/http://cecmanitoba.ca/resource/hearings/22/WPG2-006.pdf |date=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their calculations suggest that even replacing one third of the animal protein in the average American's diet with plant protein (e.g., beans, grains) can reduce the diet's carbon footprint by half a tonne. Exchanging two thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius. Finally, throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint, it adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition, mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas, methane.

The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting, like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions, to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their "handprint."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2108015,00.html|title=Handprints, Not Footprints|journal=Time|volume=45|issue=9|pages=4088–4095|accessdate=4 March 2012|doi=10.1021/es102221h|pmid=21449584|date=2012-03-12|last1=Jones|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Kammen|first2=Daniel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[carbon]] footprint in the [[food]] industry can be reduced by optimizing the [[supply chain]]. A life cycle or supply chain [[carbon]] footprint  study can provide useful data which  will help the business to identify critical areas for improvement and provides a  focus. Such studies also demonstrate a company’s commitment to reducing  carbon footprint now ahead of other  competitors as well as preparing  companies for potential regulation. In addition to increased market advantage  and differentiation eco-efficiency can also help to reduce costs where [[alternative energy]] systems are implemented.

A July 2017 study published in ''[[Environmental Research Letters]]'' argued that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children, followed by living without a vehicle, forgoing air travel and adopting a plant-based diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=  Perkins|first=Sid|date=July 11, 2017|title=The best way to reduce your carbon footprint is one the government isn’t telling you about|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about|work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |location= |access-date=December 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sec_construction_with_set_designer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Theatre carpenters work to construct sets for [[theatrical production]]s.]]
In [[theatre]], a '''carpenter''' is a [[stagehand]] who builds [[Set construction|sets]] and stage elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = W. Oren | title = Scene Design and Stage Lighting | isbn = 0-03-028777-4 | publisher = [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] | year = 1990 | page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually are hired by the [[Production_management_(theater)|production manager]], crew chief or [[technical director]] and in some less common cases they may be hired by [[theatre director|director]] or [[theatrical producer|producer]]. They are usually paid by the hour.

Carpenters receive [[Technical drawing|drafting]] from the technical director who uses the designers' renderings, models, and/or drafting of the set  to create the technical drawings for the production. Working mainly with [[wood]]s and [[metal]]s, they use techniques that include [[woodworking]] and [[welding]]. They build set pieces, including some standard elements&amp;mdash;[[Flats (theatre)|flats]], [[Platform (theatre)|platforms]] and columns&amp;mdash;as well as pieces of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]]. For example, a carpenter may be responsible for building stairs and ramps on and off of the performance area and for leveling the stage floor itself.

Only carpenters trained as riggers are trusted to do [[rigging (theatre)|rigging]] (see [[fly crew]]). Often union houses and some larger theatres make distinctions between carpenters and riggers, but most smaller theatres do not, due to staffing limitations.  

Professional carpenters do not work on anything with an electrical component (see [[electrician (theatre)|electrician]]).  They also do not paint the set, as this is the job of a [[Charge_scenic_artist|scenic artist]].

Often, stage carpentry for a large production is organized with one "master carpenter" or "shop foreman" and many subordinate carpenters.

A '''carpenter pencil''' ('''carpentry pencil''', '''carpenter's pencil''') is a [[pencil]] that has a body with a rectangular or elliptical cross-section to prevent it from rolling away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pencilrevolution.com/category/history/ |title=Pencil Revolution |publisher=Pencil Revolution |date=1971-06-07 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter pencils are easier to grip than standard pencils, because they have a larger surface area. The non-round core allows thick or thin lines to be drawn by rotating the pencil. Thin lines are required for high precision markings and are easy to erase, but thick markings are needed to mark on rough surfaces.&lt;ref name="pencilpages.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pencilpages.com/articles/carpentr.htm |title=Carpenter's Pencils |publisher=Pencilpages.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead is strong to withstand the stress of marking on such surfaces.&lt;ref name="pencilpages.com"/&gt; The pencil is robust to survive in a construction environment, for example when placed in a bag together with heavy tools. The core is often stronger than in other pencils. Carpenter pencils are also used by builders, because they are suitable for marking on rough surfaces, such as [[concrete]] or [[Dimension stone|stone]]. This shape and lead density aid in marking legible lines with a straight edge that are clear and easy to follow with a saw blade.

Carpenter pencils are typically manually sharpened with a knife, since sharpeners for round pencils do not work. 

Notching the middle of the lead with the corner of a [[file (tool)|file]] makes it possible to draw two parallel lines at once.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/popular-mechanics/The-Boy-Mechanic-700-Things-for-Boys-to-Do/Lines-And-Letters-Made-With-A-Carpenter-s-Pencil.html |title=Lines And Letters Made With A Carpenter's Pencil |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flat pencil is one of the oldest pencil types. The first versions were made by hollowing out sticks of juniper wood. A superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved with a groove running down them, a [[graphite|plumbago]] stick placed in one of the grooves, and the two halves then glued together&amp;mdash;essentially the same method in use to this day.

Similar pencils (called 'jumbo pencils') are sometimes used by children. A pencil that is designed for a child rather than a carpenter would have a softer core, enabling the user to draw with less physical effort. Carpenter pencils are sometimes used by artists and designers to draw a thick line easily when needed. For instance, [[Blackletter|Old English]] letters are easier to draw with a carpenter pencil than with an ordinary pen.&lt;ref name="as"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="975">The '''charged-device model (CDM)''' is a model for characterizing the susceptibility of an electronic device to damage from [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD). The model is an alternative to the [[human-body model]] (HBM). 

Devices that are classified according to CDM are exposed to a charge at a standardized voltage level, and then tested for survival. If it withstands this voltage level, it is tested at the next level and so on, until the device fails. 

CDM is standardized as ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC joint standard JS-002.

'''Ecological fitting''' is "the process whereby organisms colonize and persist in novel environments, use novel resources or form novel associations with other species as a result of the suites of traits that they carry at the time they encounter the novel condition."&lt;ref name="Agosta"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ecological fitting by phenotypically flexible genotypes: implications for species associations, community assembly and evolution|author1=Agosta, Salvatore J. |author2=Jeffrey A. Klemens|journal= Ecology Letters|year= 2008|volume= 11|issue= 11|pages= 1123–1134|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01237.x|pmid=18778274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It can be understood as a situation in which a species' interactions with its [[biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] environment seem to indicate a history of [[coevolution]], when in actuality the relevant traits evolved in response to a different set of biotic and abiotic conditions.&lt;ref name="Agosta" /&gt;  The simplest form of ecological fitting is resource tracking, in which an organism continues to exploit the same resources, but in a new host or environment. In this framework, the organism occupies a multidimensional operative environment defined by the conditions in which it can persist, similar to the idea of the [[Hutchinsonian niche]].&lt;ref name=Hutchinson1957&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hutchinson, G.E.| year = 1957| title = Concluding remarks| journal = Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology| volume = 22| issue = 2| pages = 415–427| url = http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Hutchinson1957.pdf | accessdate = 2011-01-30| format = PDF| doi=10.1101/sqb.1957.022.01.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, a species can colonize new environments (e.g. an area with the same temperature and water regime) and/or form new species interactions (e.g. a parasite infecting a new host) which can lead to the misinterpretation of the relationship as coevolution, although the organism has not evolved and is continuing to exploit the same resources it always has.&lt;ref name="Agosta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agosta 3"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resource specialization in a phytophagous insect: no evidence for genetically based performance trade-offs across hosts in the field or laboratory|author1=Agosta, Salvatore J.  |author2=J.

This strict form of ecological fitting can also be expressed either as colonization of new habitat or the formation of new species interactions.&lt;ref name="Agosta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Ecological Fitting: Use of Floral Nectar in Heliconia stilesii Daniels by Three Species of Hermit Hummingbirds|author=Gill, Frank B.|journal= The Condor|year= 1987|volume= 89|issue= 4|pages= 779–787|jstor= 1368525|doi=10.2307/1368525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The evolutionary ecologist Dr. [[Daniel Janzen]] began to explicate the idea of ecological fitting with a 1980 paper that observed that many instances of ecological interactions were inferred to be the result of [[coevolution]] when this was not necessarily the case, and encouraged ecologists to use the term coevolution more strictly. He observed that the existing defense traits of plants were likely produced by co-evolution with herbivores or parasites that no longer co-occurred with the plants, but that these traits were continuing to protect the plants against new attacks.&lt;ref name="Janzen 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|title=When is it Coevolution?|author=Janzen, Daniel H.|journal= Evolution|year= 1980|volume= 34|issue= 3|pages= 611–612|jstor=2408229|doi=10.2307/2408229|pmid=28568694}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He expanded this idea in a 1985 paper written while visiting [[Santa Rosa National Park]] in [[Costa Rica]].  While there, he observed that almost all of the species in the park occupied large geographic ranges, and despite the [[heterogeneity]] of habitats across these ranges, individuals were mostly identical across locations, indicating that little local adaptation had taken place.&lt;ref name="Janzen 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|title=On Ecological Fitting|author=Janzen, Daniel H.|journal= Oikos|year= 1985|volume= 45|issue= 3|pages= 308–310|jstor=3565565|doi=10.2307/3565565}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the cyclical life history pattern he believed responsible for this pattern: a species begins as a small population occupying a small area with little [[genetic variation]], but then over the course of a few generations grows to occupy a large area, either because of the emergence of a [[genotype]] successful over a wider range, or because of the removal of a geographic barrier.  This large interconnected population is now subject to many contradictory selection pressures and thus remains evolutionarily static until a disturbance separates populations, restarting the cycle.&lt;ref name="Janzen 1985" /&gt;  This cyclic life history pattern is dependent on three premises: that the ancestral range of most species is smaller than the ones now occupied, that biological communities have porous borders and are thus subject to invasion, and that species possess robust genotypes that allow them to colonize new habitats without evolution.&lt;ref name="Janzen 1985" /&gt; Thus, many biological communities may be made up of organisms that despite their complex biological interactions have very little evolutionary history with each other.

== Contrasting views ==
Ecological fitting represents a contrasting view to, and [[null hypothesis]] for, the hypothesis that current species interactions are evidence of [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Agosta" /&gt; [[Coevolution]] occurs when each species in a relationship imposes evolutionary selection on the other(s).  Examples could include [[mutualisms]] or predator-prey systems.  The traditional view of plant-insect, host-parasite, and other tightly associated species, explained by Ehrlich &amp; Raven (1964) defines coevolution as the primary mechanism for these associations &lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution|author1=Ehrlich, P.R. |author2=Raven, P.H.|journal= Evolution|year= 1964|volume= 18|issue= 4|pages= 586–608|url= http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/elrich1.pdf|doi=10.2307/2406212|jstor=2406212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1980 paper, Janzen gives a response to these [[adaptationist]] explanations of why a [[phenotype]] or species might exist in a particular environment, and expressed his concern with what he perceived as an overuse of coevolutionary explanations for current species associations.  He stated that it would be difficult to distinguish between coevolution and ecological fitting, leading ecologists to potentially spurious explanations of current species associations.&lt;ref name="Agosta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janzen 1980" /&gt;  It is difficult to determine whether a close relationship is the result of coevolution or of ecological fitting because ecological fitting is a sorting process in which only associations that 'fit', or increase [[fitness (biology)]], will be maintained.&lt;ref name="Agosta 2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=On ecological fitting, plant-insect associations, herbivore host shifts, and host plant selection|author=Agosta, Salvatore J.|journal= Oikos|year= 2006|volume= 114|issue= 3|pages= 556–565|issn= 0030-1299|doi=10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15025.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When trying to determine which process is at work in a particular interaction, it is important to remember that species can only come into contact through biotic expansion and ecological fitting, followed by [[adaptation]] or coevolution.  Thus, both processes are important in shaping interactions and communities.&lt;ref name="Janz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janz | first1=N.| last2=Nylin| first2=S.| first3=K.J.

== Mechanisms ==
Ecological fitting can occur by a variety of mechanisms, and can help to explain some ecological phenomena.  Resource tracking can help to explain the parasite paradox: that parasites are specialists with narrow environmental ranges, which would encourage host fidelity, yet scientists commonly observe parasite shifts onto novel hosts, both in the [[phylogenetic]] record and in ecological time.&lt;ref name="Agosta 4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Specialists Can Be Generalists: Resolving the Parasite Paradox and Implications for Emerging Infectious Disease|author1=Agosta, Salvatore J. |author2=Niklas Janz |author3=Daniel R.

== Theoretical Applications ==

=== Explaining Diversity Patterns ===
Ecological fitting can influence species diversity either by promoting diversification through genetic drift, or by maintaining evolutionary [[punctuated equilibrium|stasis]] through [[gene flow]].&lt;ref name="Agosta" /&gt; Research has shown that ecological fitting can result in parasite assemblages that are just as diverse as those created over evolutionary time, indicating the importance of ecological factors for biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Poulin" /&gt; Ecological fitting can contribute to 3 types of evolutionary transition.&lt;ref name="Brooks 5" /&gt; The first is simple ecological fitting, in which organisms track resources to form novel species interactions and increase individual fitness.&lt;ref name="Agosta 4" /&gt;  The second is a shift from an organism's ancestral ecology to a derived ecology, or a more true form of ecological fitting: traits are [[exapted]] from their original purpose to increase fitness.&lt;ref name="Brooks 5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Taking Evolutionary Transitions Seriously|author=Brooks, Daniel R.|journal= Semiotics, Evolution, Energy, and Development|year= 2002|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 6–24|url= http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/parasitologyfacpubs/311/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, a more dramatic form involves the creation of new evolutionary arenas, requiring morphological or ecological changes to gain fitness under new conditions.&lt;ref name="Brooks 5" /&gt;  Any of these processes can promote [[speciation]] or diversification under the right circumstances.  Each form of ecological fitting can encourage speciation only if the population is sufficiently isolated from other populations to prevent [[gene flow]] from swamping local adaptation to newly formed species associations.&lt;ref name="Agosta 4" /&gt; Host-plant or other specialized relationships have been previously regarded as an evolutionary 'dead-end' because they seem to limit diversity, but they can actually promote it according to coevolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Jermy" /&gt; Insects that feed on plants induce them to develop new defense mechanisms, which frees them from [[herbivory]].  In this new adaptive zone, or [[ecospace]], plant clades can undergo [[evolutionary radiation]], in which diversification of the clade occurs quickly due to adaptive change.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt; The herbivorous insects may eventually succeed in adapting to the plants' defenses, and would also be capable of diversifying, in the absence of competition by other herbivorous insects.&lt;ref name="Janz" /&gt;  Thus, species associations can lead to rapid diversification of both lineages and contribute to overall community diversity.&lt;ref name="Jermy" /&gt;

Ecological fitting can also maintain populations in stasis, influencing diversity by limiting it.  If populations are well connected through [[gene flow]], local adaptation may not be able to occur (known as antagonistic gene flow), or the well-connected population could evolve as a whole without [[speciation]] occurring.  The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution theory can help to explain this: it suggests that [[coevolution]] or [[speciation]] of a species occurs across a wide geographic scale, rather than at the level of populations, so that populations experiencing selection for a particular trait affect gene frequencies across the geographic region due to [[gene flow]].  Populations of a species interact with different species in different parts of its range, so populations may be experiencing a small sub-set of the interactions to which the species as a whole is adapted.&lt;ref name="Agosta 4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=John N|title=The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution (Interspecific Interactions)|year=2005|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-79762-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=John N|title=Specific Hypotheses on the Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution |year=1999|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|volume=153|pages=S1–S14|doi=10.1086/303208|issn=1537-5323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on three premises: there is an environmental and biotic interaction mosaic affecting fitness in different areas, there are certain areas where species are more coevolved than others, and that there is mixing of allele frequencies and traits between the regions to create more homogeneous populations.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2" /&gt; Thus, depending on connectivity of populations and strength of selection pressure in different arenas, a widespread population can coevolve with another species, or individual populations can specialize, potentially resulting in diversification.&lt;ref name="Zamora" /&gt;

=== Community Assembly ===
Ecological fitting can explain aspects of species associations and community assembly, as well as invasion ecology.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; It is another mechanism, in addition to coevolution and in situ evolution (in which new phenotypes evolve and travel sympatrically), that can explain the creation and maintenance of species associations within a community.&lt;ref name="Agosta 2" /&gt; The phenomenon of ecological fitting helps to weigh in on some of the great debates in community ecology.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;  The Clementisian school of community ecology, based on the work of [[Frederic Clements]], a plant ecologist who studied [[ecological succession]], holds that communities are constructed by deterministic processes that assemble a 'superorganism' from the individual species present.&lt;ref name="Clements"&gt;{{cite book |title= Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation|last= Clements|first= Frederic E.|year= 1916|publisher= Carnegie Institution of Washington|location= Washington D.C.|isbn= 978-1-162-21647-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the removal or exchange of a species, the community would be unstable.  On the other hand, the Gleasonian view, promoted by [[Henry Gleason]], who was also a plant ecologist studying successional communities, is more individualistic and emphasizes the role of random processes such as dispersal in community assembly.&lt;ref name="Gleason"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Structure and Development of the Plant Association|author=Gleason, Henry A.|journal= Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|year= 1917|volume= 44|issue= 10|pages= 463–481|jstor= 2479596|doi=10.2307/2479596}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clementsian view would emphasize coevolution and strict niche fidelity as a major factor structuring communities, also known as the niche-assembly perspective, whereas the Gleasonian, or dispersal assembly view emphasizes neutral and historical processes, including ecological fitting.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavender"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The merging of community ecology and phylogenetic biology|author=Cavender-Bares, Jeannine, Kenneth H. Kozak, Paul V. A. Fine, and Steven W. Kembel|journal= Ecology Letters|year= 2006|volume= 12|issue= 7|pages= 693–715|doi= 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01314.x|pmid=19473217}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views of community assembly raise the question: do species continue stable relationships over time, or do all individuals represent "asymmetrical pegs in square holes"? &lt;ref name="Janzen 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavender" /&gt; Some of these question can be answered through phylogenetic studies, which can determine when certain traits arose, and thus whether species interactions and community assembly occurs primarily through coevolution or through dispersal and ecological fitting.  Support exists for each, indicating that each has a varied role to play, depending on the community and on historical factors.&lt;ref name="Cavender" /&gt;

=== Emerging Infectious Diseases ===

A field of recent importance for the application of ecological fitting is that of [[emerging infectious disease]]: infectious diseases that have emerged or increased incidence in the last 20 years, as a result of evolution, range expansion, or ecological changes.  Climate change represents an ecological perturbation that induces range and phenological shifts in many species, which can encourage parasite transmission and host switching without any evolutionary change occurring.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How will global climate change affect parasite–host assemblages?|author1=Brooks, Daniel R.  |author2=Eric P. Hoberg|journal= Trends in Parasitology|year= 2007|volume= 23|issue= 12|pages= 571–574|doi= 10.1016/j.pt.2007.08.016|pmid=17962073  |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/parasitologyfacpubs/606  |format=Submitted manuscript  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When species begin to infect host species with which they were not previously associated, it may be the result of ecological fitting.&lt;ref name="Agosta 4" /&gt; Even organisms with complex life histories can switch hosts as long as the resource required by each life stage is phylogenetically conserved and geographically widespread, meaning that it is difficult to predict based on life history complexity or other external factors.&lt;ref name="Brooks 4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phylogeny, ecological fitting and lung flukes: helping solve the problem of emerging infectious diseases|author=Brooks, Daniel R., Deborah A.

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Heat]], a form of energy, is partly [[potential energy]] and partly [[kinetic energy]]]]

'''Energy quality''' is the contrast between different [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], the different [[trophic level]]s in [[ecology|ecological]] systems and the propensity of [[energy]] to convert from one form to another. The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or [[qualia]], of different energy forms as they [[Energy flow (ecology)|flow]] and transform. It appeals to our common [[perception]] of the [[heat]] value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy [[physical state]] and energy. For example the transition from a [[solid]] state to [[liquid]] may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.

==Introduction==
Since before [[ancient history|antiquity]] there has been deep [[philosophical]], [[aesthetic]] and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with [[quantity]]. In some respects the history of [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] thought can be characterized by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no "rational quality", or [[quale]] ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, [[spirituality]], and [[astrology]] to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by [[scientific methods]], and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand.

At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their [[opposable thumb]]. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and [[genome]] [[structure]], while others chose [[energetics|energetic]] function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide.

==Ohta==

According to Ohta (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] under the concept of "availability". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, "die Exergie" (the [[exergy]]). It was later continued and standardised in [[Japan]]. [[Exergy]] analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in [[steam power]] [[engineering]] industry. Here the "quality index" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of [[Value theory|value]] – for example A. Thumann wrote, "The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'" (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;113) – which brings into play the question of [[teleology]] and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy "with a built-in measure of quality like energy" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;392).

==Energy quality evaluation methods==
There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process.

'''Receiver methods:''' view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Transition_in_Energy_Use/transitions-euse-ene_encyclop_2004.pdf] used two types of indicators of energetic quality ''pars pro toto'': the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the [[carbon intensity]] of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a [[hydrogen production]] system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;125).

'''Donor methods:''' view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality ''is'' upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the ''usefulness'' of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy.

==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) ==
===Constant energy form but variable energy flow===
T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the [[Energy#Forms of energy|form of energy]] remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of  energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.

===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow===
The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the '''transformation''' of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the '''relative ease''' with which the energy transforms, from form to form.

If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nomenclature:''' Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing "energy A", like Ohta above, Culp referred to "J&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;", to specify electrical form of energy, where" J" refers to "energy", and the "''e''"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript.

==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)==
The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of [[biophysical economics]] energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with [[embodied energy]] methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the "Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator." (2006; p.&amp;nbsp;10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input.

==Ranking energy quality==
===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position===

Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p.&amp;nbsp;90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of "relative ease" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, "the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, "the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist." (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in [http://www.exergy.se/ftp/japan85.pdf Wall's article] for another example ranking of energy quality).

===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank===

Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodyanmics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called [[transformity]]: "the [[Emergy|EMERGY]] per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule" (H.T.Odum 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;1135).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8574">{{about| Foil (fluid mechanics)|other types of foil|Foil (disambiguation)}}
A '''foil''' is a solid object with a shape such that when placed in a moving [[fluid]] at a suitable [[angle of attack]] the [[lift (force)|lift]] (force generated perpendicular to the fluid flow) is substantially larger than the [[drag (physics)|drag]] (force generated parallel to the fluid flow).  If the fluid is a [[gas]], the foil is called an [[airfoil]] or aerofoil, and if the fluid is [[water]] the foil is called a [[hydrofoil]].

==Physics of foils==
[[Image:Streamlines around a NACA 0012.svg|frame|300px|Streamlines around a NACA 0012 airfoil at moderate angle of attack]]

A foil generates lift primarily as a result of its shape and [[angle of attack]]. When oriented at a suitable angle, the foil deflects the oncoming fluid, resulting in a force on the foil in the direction opposite to the deflection. This force can be resolved into two components: [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]].  This "turning" of the fluid in the vicinity of the foil creates curved streamlines which results in lower pressure on one side and higher pressure on the other.  This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via [[Bernoulli's principle]], so the resulting flowfield about the foil has a higher average velocity on the upper surface than on the lower surface.&lt;ref name=HR_378a&gt;"...the effect of the wing is to give the air stream a downward velocity component. The reaction force of the deflected air mass must then act on the wing to give it an equal and opposite upward component." In: {{citation

A more detailed description of the flowfield is given by the [[Navier-Stokes equations#Incompressible flow of Newtonian fluids|simplified Navier-Stokes equations]], applicable when the fluid is [[incompressible]].  However, since the effects of the compressibility of air at low speeds is negligible, these simplified equations can be used for both airfoils and hydrofoils as long as the fluid flow is substantially less than the speed of sound (up to about [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.3).&lt;ref&gt;"...the motion of objects in air and in water obeys identical laws until their speed approaches the speed of sound."(page 41)  "... air too can be regarded as incompressible as long as flow speeds remain reasonably low. This assumption is roughly valid as long as airplanes fly slower than... about one-third of the speed of sound."(page 61) ''What Makes Airplanes Fly?'' Wegener, Peter P. Springer-Verlag 1991 {{ISBN|0-387-97513-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...the low-speed flow of air, where V &lt; 100 m/s (or V &lt; 225 mi/hr) can also be assumed to be incompressible to a close approximation." in Anderson, John D. Jr. ''Introduction to Flight'' 4th ed McGraw-Hill 2000 {{ISBN|0-07-109282-X}} pg 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic design considerations==
The [[degenerate case]] of a foil is a simple flat plate.  When set at an angle (the [[angle of attack]]) to the flow the plate will deflect the fluid passing over and under it, and this [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]] will result in a lift force on the plate. However, while it does generate lift, it also generates a large amount of drag.&lt;ref&gt;"A flat plate held at the proper angle of attack does generate lift, but also generates a lot of drag. Sir George Cayley and Otto Lilienthal during the 1800s showed that curved surfaces generate more lift and less drag than flat surfaces." http://quest.nasa.gov/aero/planetary/atmospheric/aerodynamiclift.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since even a simple flat plate can generate lift, a significant factor in foil design is the minimization of drag.  An example of this is the [[rudder]] of a boat or aircraft.  When designing a rudder a key design factor is the minimization of drag in its neutral position, which is balanced with the need to produce sufficient lift with which to turn the craft at a reasonable rate.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NASA|title=What is lift?|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/lift1.html|accessdate=7-5-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other types of foils, both natural and man-made, seen both in air and water, have features that delay or control the onset of [[lift-induced drag]], ''[[flow separation]]'', and [[stall (flight)|stall]] (see [[Bird flight]], [[Fin]], [[Airfoil]], [[Placoid scale]], [[Tubercle]], [[Vortex generator]], [[Canard (aeronautics)|Canard]] (close-coupled), [[Blown flap]], [[Leading edge slot]], [[Leading edge slats]]), as well as [[Wingtip vortices]] (see [[Winglet]]).

==Lifted Weight==
[[File:Lifted Weight as a Function of Altitude and Depth 1.svg|thumb|Lifted Weight as a Function of Altitude and Depth from 20 km above to 10 km below sea level: by a wing of 100 m by square (aspect ratio 10:1) at speed of 10 m/s.]]
[[File:Lifted Weight as a Function of Altitude and Depth 2.svg|thumb|Lifted Weight as a Function of Altitude and Depth from 10 m above to 5 m below sea level: by a wing of 100 m by square (aspect ratio 10:1) at speed of 10 m/s.]]
Lifted weight is proportional to lift coefficient, density of fluid, wing area and true speed by square. A comparison of lifted weight as a function of altitude and depth reveals big differences by a factor of about 3’000 in total from 11&amp;nbsp;km above sea level to 10 km below sea level, divided into factors of:
~  4 between summit and sea level,
~  400 between flying close to the ground
and planing on water,
~  2 between planing on water
and in a fully submerged state.
The most dramatic changes are due to different fluids and levels of altitude. The most interesting sector to discuss lift is close to sea level: aircraft approaching the ground, plates planing on water and hydrofoils only barely submerged in water. There is one basic similarity across of these: Almost any shape, as long as it is not too thick, will work as an (air)foil and produce lift when the angle of attack is in the right range.&lt;ref name=„Lifted_Weight_from_Summit_to_Seafloor“ &gt; „Lifted_Weight_as_a_Function_of_Altitude_and_Depth_by_Rolf_Steinegger“ https://doi.org/10.21256/zhaw-4058 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Escape''' is a [[crossover (automobile)|compact crossover vehicle]] sold by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] since 2000 over three generations. Ford released the original model in 2000 for the 2001 [[model year]]—a model jointly developed and released with [[Mazda]] of Japan—who took a lead in the engineering of the two models and sold their version as the '''Mazda Tribute'''. Although the Escape and Tribute share the same underpinnings constructed from the [[Ford CD2 platform]] (based on [[Mazda G platform#GF|Mazda GF underpinnings]]), the only panels common to the two vehicles are the roof and floor pressings. Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base [[inline-four engine]], with Ford providing the optional [[V6 engine|V6]]. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the [[Mazda B-Series|Ford Courier]] in the 1970s. Ford also sold the first generation Escape in Europe and China as the '''Ford Maverick''', replacing the [[Nissan Terrano II|previous Nissan-sourced model]]. Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford's luxury [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division released a rebadged version called the '''Mercury Mariner''', sold mainly in North America. The first iteration Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid drivetrain]] option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only.

Mainstream production of the first generation Escape/Tribute ended in late 2006. For Asia-Pacific markets, both received respective facelifts in 2006 and had production fully transferred to [[Ford Lio Ho]] in Taiwan. Extended production of the Mazda lasted until 2010, with the Ford lingering on until 2012.

Second generations of the Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute were released in 2007 for the 2008 model year, but mostly restricted to North America. In other markets, the first generation models were either replaced by updated first series versions built in Taiwan, and/or by the unrelated [[Mazda CX-7]] (2006) and [[Ford Kuga]] (2008). The North American second generations were merely reskins of the first, with carry-over mechanicals, but with restyled hanging panels and a redesigned interior. Unlike the collaborative approach taken with the previous model, this time the design and engineering was carried out by Ford. A hybrid option was again available. The Mercury version lasted until late 2010, withdrawn from the market as part of the closure of the Mercury brand, with Mazda's Tribute ending production in late 2011. Ford ended manufacture of the second series Escape in 2012.

Ford released a third generation in 2012 for the 2013 model year, again, limited to North America. This time, rather than issuing an indigenous, albeit Mazda-derived model, Ford rebadged the Europe-designed [[Ford Kuga]]. Although still manufactured in the US, and fitted with slightly different powertrains, the third generation Escape is fully aligned with the Kuga as per the "One Ford" plan of having only one vehicle per segment internationally.

The first generation of Ford Escape was released in 2000 for the 2001 model year. It was jointly developed with [[Mazda]], in which Ford owned a controlling interest, and was released simultaneously with the Mazda Tribute. Both are built on the [[Ford CD2 platform]], in turn based on the [[Mazda G platform#GF|Mazda GF platform]].

At the time, larger sport-utility vehicles tended to use [[pickup truck]]-based, [[body-on-frame]] designs. Other car makers, [[Jeep]], [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] had been offering smaller [[unibody]] designs, the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]], [[RAV4]] and [[CR-V]] respectively. [[Beam axle|Solid rear axles]] were commonly used on the full-sized truck-based SUVs and Jeep Cherokee due to their ability to carry heavy loads at the expense of a comfortable ride and good handling. Ford and Mazda decided to offer a car-like, [[unibody]] design with a fully [[independent suspension]] and [[rack and pinion]] steering similar to the RAV4 and CR-V, the Escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/escape/2001/road-test.html |title=2001 Escape First Drive |website=[[Edmunds.com]] |date=January 1, 1999 |accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not meant for serious off-roading, a full-time [[all-wheel-drive]] (AWD) system supplied by [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] was optional, which included a [[Locking differential|locking center differential]] activated by a switch on the dashboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dana Gets 4WD Contract for Ford/Mazda SUVs |journal=Autoparts Report |date=April 25, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UDO/is_22_13/ai_63676658 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AWD system normally sends most of the power from the engine to the front wheels. If slipping is detected at the front, more power will be sent to the rear wheels in a fraction of a second. The four wheel drive system was a newer version of Ford's "Control Trac" 4x4 system, dubbed the Control Trac II 4WD in the Escape. This system allowed the front wheels to receive 100% of the torque until a slip was detected. Using a Rotary Blade Coupling, the rear wheels could be sent up to 100% of the power in fractions of a second. When switching the system from "Auto" to "On," the front and rear axles are locked at a 50/50 split; the reaction time necessary to engage the rear wheels is reduced via an integrated bypass clutch. The Control Trac II system allows for a four-wheel drive vehicle without the use of a center differential. The entire braking system was built by [[Continental AG|Continental Teves]], including the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] and various related suspension components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Continental Teves Supplies Brake System To Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute |journal=Autoparts Report |date=June 2, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UDO/is_2000_June_2/ai_63676728 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Complete knock down|CKD]] production began in 2002 at Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. in Taiwan for various Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dana Corp.

One main difference between the Tribute and the Ford Escape is that the Tribute's suspension is tuned for a firmer ride than the Escape, in order to correspond with Mazda's sporty image.

;2000–2004 (BA, ZA)
In North America, it slotted below the larger, truck-based [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]] in Ford's lineup, but was larger than the small SUV offerings from [[Honda CR-V|Honda]] and [[Toyota RAV4|Toyota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jamieson |first=Scott |title=Escaping debt: a reasonably priced alternative to full-sized pickups and SUVs, the Ford Escape has all the power and comforts required |journal=Canadian Forest Industries |date=August 2001 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3764/is_200108/ai_n8957516 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is technically a crossover vehicle, it is marketed by Ford as part of its traditional [[SUV]] lineup (Escape, Explorer, Expedition) rather than its separate crossover lineup (Edge, Flex).

[[File:Ford Escape XLT interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]

From 2001 to 2004, the Ford Escape was sold in Europe under the Maverick name, and replaced a rebadged version of the [[Nissan Mistral|Nissan Mistral/Terrano II]]. Only two versions were made, the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Zetec [[Straight-4|inline 4]] engine with [[manual transmission]] and 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec [[V6]] with [[automatic transmission]], both using gasoline as fuel. The absence of a diesel version did not help sales and the vehicle was temporarily discontinued in late 2003. However, the Maverick, in the UK for example, was only available in XLT trim. Plus, the dashboard was not the same as the US Escape; it was instead taken from the Mazda Tribute. The Maverick was reintroduced in 2005 in certain European markets with the Duratec V6 engine. It was announced that the Maverick would be assembled in Russia for the Russian market. As of 2006, the Maverick was no longer sold in Europe, leaving Ford without a compact SUV until the 2008 [[Ford Kuga]] was introduced. The Maverick was primarily designed for on-road use – sold with normal road tires, and to be used with [[front-wheel drive]] most of the time.

Crash-test results for the Escape have been mixed. In the New Car Assessment Program administered by the USA-based [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], the car received five out of five stars for driver protection and four out of five stars for passenger protection in a {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} frontal impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Car Assessment Program: 2001 Ford Escape |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |year=2001 |url=http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid=c95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&amp;model=6698 |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SUV received five stars for both driver and rear passenger in the side impact test. In the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s {{convert|40|mph|km/h||abbr=on}} frontal offset test, 2001–2004 Escapes received a score of "Marginal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=IIHS-HLDI |year=2001 |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=2 |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the side impact crash test, vehicles equipped with the optional side air bags received a score of "Good" in the {{convert|31|mph|km/h||abbr=on}}, while those without the optional air bags received a score of "Poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=IIHS-HLDI |year=2003 |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=244 |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Escapes are equipped with a passive 'Immobiliser' called SecuriLock. This feature includes an 'RFID' chip embedded in the key which is read by the car each time the vehicle is started. If the vehicle fails to receive a valid confirmation signal from the key, the vehicle will not run, even if the key is perfectly cut to match the original. Theft, injury, and collision losses reported to insurance companies for the Escape are among the lowest in its class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Injury, Collision, &amp; Theft Losses 2001–2003 |publisher=HLDI |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.iihs.org/research/hldi/ictl_pdf/ictl_0904.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;North America
In the United States, all Escapes included standard equipment such as power windows, power door locks, [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), keyless entry, a folding rear-bench seat, 16-inch wheels, and air conditioning. In addition, an Escape buyer could choose from one of several different trim levels that were available, which included:

'''XLS''' (2001–2007): As the most basic trim level of the Escape, the XLS included: the 2.0-liter ''Zetec'' (2001–2004) and the 2.3-liter ''DuraTec'' (2005–2007) engines, a five-speed manual transmission, 15-inch steel wheels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players (later, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer) and four speakers, high-back front bucket seats, and cloth-and-vinyl seating surfaces. Options include 15- or 16-inch alloy wheels, the 3.0-liter V6 engine (2001–2004), and a four-speed automatic transmission (some of which was available as the '''XLS Popular Group''').

'''XLT''' (2001–2007): As the top-of-the-line trim level of the Escape in 2001, and the most popular trim level of the Escape throughout its entire run (2001–2007), the XLT added the following equipment to the base XLS trim level: 16-inch alloy wheels, cloth seating surfaces, and an enhanced interior. Options included an AM/FM stereo with a six-disc, in-dash CD changer (which later became standard equipment on all Escapes), the 3.0-liter V6 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, a power sunroof, leather-and-vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, and the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer.

'''XLT Sport''' (2002–2007): The XLT Sport was one of the more popular trim levels of the Escape from 2002 to 2007. It added equipment to the standard XLT equipment: the V6 engine, four-speed automatic transmission, sport interior trim, and 16-inch machined alloy wheels. Options were the same as the standard XLT trim level.

'''Limited''' (2003–2007): As the top-of-the-line trim level of the Escape from 2002–2007, the Limited trim level added the following equipment to the XLT Sport trim level: an AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD/MP3 changer, the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer, low-back front bucket seats, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power heated front bucket seats, a security system, color-keyed exterior trim, luxury interior trim, and a unique front grille. Options were limited, but included a power sunroof.

'''Hybrid''' (2005–2007): Based on the midrange XLT trim level, the Hybrid included: the 2.3-liter ''DuraTec'' inline-four engine with an electric motor, power front bucket seats, low-back front bucket seats, enhanced partially-recycled cloth seating surfaces, and unique 16-inch alloy wheels. Options included a powered sunroof, a unique integrated GPS navigational system with hybrid information system, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, and a "two-tone" exterior paint scheme, with silver-painted lower exterior trim and front and rear bumpers.

;2004–2006 (ZB)
The Escape and Tribute were updated in February 2004 for the 2005 model year with a new base engine (the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L {{nowrap|[2261 cc, 140 cu in]}} [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 23|Duratec 23]]), which replaced the Zetec 2.0&amp;nbsp;L {{nowrap|(1983 cc, 121 cu in)}} {{convert|127|hp|abbr=on}} 4-cylinder. The most powerful engine remained the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} Duratec 3.0 L {{nowrap|(2976 cc, 181 cu in)}} V6, with new engine mounts. Ford also added advanced airbag and seatbelt safety systems, an intelligent AWD system, and exterior changes, which included a redesigned front bumper. The 2005 model year was the first with an automatic transmission available on the base four-cylinder models. The automatic shifter was moved from the column to the console on all models equipped with automatic transmissions. Ford also deleted the recline feature on the rear seats to improve the safety of occupants in the rear seats in the case of a rear crash.

;2006–2008 (ZC; Asia-Pacific)
[[File:2007 Ford Escape (ZC) XLS wagon (2011-04-22) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Escape (ZC) XLS (Australia)]]

A revamped ZC Escape designed in Taiwan went on sale in the second half of 2006 for the Asian and Pacific markets (except [[South Korea]], where the North American-market Escape is sold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autoincar.blogspot.com/2007/09/ford-thailand-has-launched-revised.html |title=Ford Thailand has launched a revised Escape suv |work=AUTO in CAR |publisher=Autoincar.blogspot.com |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}} {{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major external changes included a redesigned front bumper, grille, headlights and hood, and rear bumper, as well as [[LED]] taillights.

On the inside, changes included a floor-mounted automatic-transmission shifter, in place of the column shifter, as well as a redesigned center stack containing audio and climate controls. Climate control is automatic on all models except the XLS. The Limited model also featured full color-coded bumpers, wheel arches and side moldings, as well as side mirrors with integrated LED indicators. Rear drum brakes have been replaced by disc brakes all round.

The 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} while the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder has improved midrange torque and an electronic throttle, as well as a slight increase in power to {{convert|109|kW|abbr=on}}. Both engines had been certified to meet [[Euro III]] emission regulations. A four-speed automatic carried over and was the sole transmission choice. Two different four-speed automatic transmissions were used,  [[Ford CD4E transmission|CD4E]] for 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 and [[Mazda G4A-EL transmission|GF4AX-EL]] for 2.3&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder.

;2008–2009 (ZD; Asia-Pacific)
[[File: 2009 Ford Escape (ZD) 2.3 wagon (2018-11-02) 01.jpg|thumb|2008–2009 Ford Escape (ZD)]]

The ZD Escape went on sale in mid-2008, bringing numerous changes. In Australia, the V6 engine was dropped, leaving only the 2.3-liter four-cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brogan |first=Matt |date=August 25, 2008 |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/15622/2008-ford-escape-xlt-review/ |title=2008 Ford Escape XLT Review |publisher=CarAdvice |accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model range was also simplified, with only a single specification available. Changes to the body included an all-new front bumper, grille, headlights and bonnet, featuring an enlarged Ford emblem set upon a three-bar chrome grille. At the rear, new, slimmer tail lights were featured, which were arranged horizontally, rather than vertically. In addition, the B-pillar was now painted black, rather than body-colour. Compared with the previous model, all external bumpers, mirrors, and cladding were painted the same colour as the body (previously, this was only available on the upscale Limited model). Equipment levels have also improved. Compared to the base model ZC Escape, the ZD included standard side airbags, automatic climate control, 16" alloy wheels, and mirrors with integrated indicators. Unlike most other competitors in its class, curtain airbags and electronic stability control were not available.

In 2009, another facelift of the ZD Escape brought about a new grille and front bumper. Chrome trim was completely removed from the grille, replaced with a smaller, black honeycomb grille as the last ever Ford Escape. In its final years, it was sold side by side with its successor, [[Ford Kuga]] until the Kuga replaced it in 2013.

;2000–2004
[[File:2001-2004 Mazda Tribute Classic V6 wagon (2007-12-12).jpg|thumb|left|2000–2004 Mazda Tribute]]

The Tribute made its debut at the 2000 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] as a compact crossover SUV, a segment pioneered by the [[Toyota RAV4]] in 1994. It was the first SUV offered by Mazda since the [[Navajo|Mazda Navajo]], a rebadged two-door [[Ford Explorer]] which was retired after the 1994 model year. In Japan, Mazda had an SUV called the [[Suzuki Escudo|Mazda Proceed Levante]], a rebadged [[Suzuki Escudo]], but the Tribute was Mazda's first original SUV. The Ford plant in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] assembled Tribute for the North American market, alongside Ford Escape. The [[Hofu Plant|Mazda plant]] in [[Hofu]], Japan and the [[Ford Lio Ho]] plant in [[Taiwan]] assembled Tribute for their respective markets.

The 2001–2006 Mazda Tribute was available as front- or four-wheel drive and featured a plain-looking but comfortable roomy interior, decent handling and car-like ride. The Tribute and Escape debuted in 2000, offering front or [[all wheel drive]] and a choice of a [[Transversely mounted engine|transversely mounted]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Ford Zetec [[Ford engines|4-cylinder]] engine with 129&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower#PS|PS]] (95&amp;nbsp;kW)/183&amp;nbsp;[[Newton metre|N·m]] (135&amp;nbsp;[[foot-pound force|lb·ft]]), or 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec]] [[V6]] with 203&amp;nbsp;PS (150&amp;nbsp;kW)/265&amp;nbsp;N·m (195&amp;nbsp;lb·ft). The 2.0&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine had [[Timing belt (camshaft)|Timing belt]] driven [[Camshaft]]s, while the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Duratec#Duratec 30|Duratec]] [[V6]] featured a maintenance-free timing chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samarins.com/reviews/tribute.html |title=2001–2011 Mazda Tribute |website=Samarins.com |accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:05-07 Mazda Tribute .jpg|thumb|2005–2007 Mazda Tribute (US)]]

;2004–2006
Both the Escape and Tribute were refreshed in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The base engine became the Mazda 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Mazda MZR engine|MZR]] [[straight-4|4]] with 153&amp;nbsp;PS (114&amp;nbsp;kW)/206&amp;nbsp;N·m (152&amp;nbsp;lb·ft), and the top remained the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Duratec#Duratec 30|Duratec]] [[V6]], now with torque down to 261&amp;nbsp;N·m (193&amp;nbsp;lb·ft). In North American-built models, a floor-mounted [[automatic transmission]] shifter replaced the column shifter. However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. Mazda decided to halt production after the 2006 [[model year]]

Mazda Japan released a limited version, the Mazdaspeed Tribute, in the year 2004 with a 2.3-liter MZR engine that has 220 PS (164.05&amp;nbsp;kW)/ 254 N·m (195&amp;nbsp;lb·ft) that is utilized by a column shifter. However, Mazda Japan decided to end its production in 2005.

;2006–2008 (Asia-Pacific)
[[File:2007 Mazda Tribute (MY06) V6 wagon (2010-09-19).jpg|thumb|2006–2008 Mazda Tribute (Australia)]]

A significantly face-lifted version of the Tribute was released in the second half of 2006 for [[Asia Pacific]] markets. The updated Tribute featured a larger, bolder grille, with an enlarged Mazda emblem, as well as restyled front bumper and headlights. Side mirrors featured integrated indicators.

On the inside, changes included a new floor-mounted automatic-transmission shifter, in place of the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only; US-built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dash was updated with a brand-new radio and automatic climate control with digital read-out, on certain models. Mechanically, the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. Engines remain the same, but the [[V6]] has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet [[Euro III]] emission regulations.

Starting from 2006, Mazda stopped selling and producing Tribute in Japan, and replaced it with the similar-sized [[Mazda CX-7|CX-7]]. In 2008, Mazda Australia also discontinued the Tribute, the absence of the Tribute being filled by the Mazda CX-7 introduced in the previous year. For other Asia-Pacific markets, the production of Tribute was shifted to the [[Ford Lio Ho]] plant in [[Zhongli District|Zhongli]], [[Taiwan]], which also produces Tribute's twin, Ford Escape, for Asia-Pacific markets. This arrangement continued until early 2010, when the Tribute for the Asia-Pacific markets ceased production, being fully replaced by the CX-7 imported from Japan.

}}
Introduced in 2004 for the 2005-model-year refresh of the Ford Escape in the US, Ford's [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division released a luxury version called the Mercury Mariner. The Mariner sits above the Escape in the Ford-Mercury-Lincoln hierarchy. The Mariner is Mercury's first car-based SUV, and is slotted below the [[Mercury Mountaineer|Mountaineer]] in the lineup. The Mariner was officially offered in the US, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. The Mercury includes stylistic differences, such as a two-tone interior, turn signal repeaters borrowed from the European-market Ford Maverick (the Escape's name in Europe), monotone cladding, and the signature [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] "waterfall" front grille. Unlike its counterparts, a manual transmission was not part of the powertrain lineup. The Mariner was the first Mercury with a [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] since the [[Mercury Cougar#Seventh generation|Mercury Cougar]] was dropped in 2002. For 2006, the lineup was expanded with the introduction of the Mariner Hybrid. Sales ended after the 2007 model, replaced by a second generation, again a rebadged Ford Escape.

On September 7, 2006, Ford delivered a special "Presidential Edition" Mercury Mariner Hybrid to former President [[Bill Clinton]]. Its custom features include: LED lighting, 110-volt outlet, rear bucket seats, center console &amp; rear seat fold-out writing desks, personal DVD players for each seat, refrigerator, increased rear seat legroom. There have also been several undisclosed security modifications made to the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/09/07/clinton_hybrid/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Clinton to get custom hybrid SUV |date=September 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mariner Hybrid [[powertrain]] was identical to its sibling, the Ford Escape Hybrid. It was launched to the U.S. market in 2006 and was discontinued in 2010 (in the second generation) with the rest of the brand. The Mariner hybrid sold a total of 12,300 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1076382_green-car-death-list-2012-models-to-which-we-bid-adieu |title=Green-Car Death List: 2012 Models To Which We Bid Adieu |author=John Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Ford Escape Hybrid, the Mariner Hybrid is a "full" hybrid electric system, meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Mariner's hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. With {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the Mariner Hybrid has nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} [[V6]] Mariner. Again, just like the Escape Hybrid, it gets a respectable average of {{convert|34|mpgUS|L/100 km mpgimp}} and is sometimes said to be the most fuel efficient [[sport utility vehicle]] on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2008/11/11/2009-mercury-mariner-hybrid-review/ |title=2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid Review |publisher=Automoblog.net |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:05-07 Ford Escape Hybrid .jpg|thumb|2005–2007 Ford Escape Hybrid]]

The Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid are the [[gas-electric hybrid vehicle|gasoline-electric hybrid]] powered versions that launched in the U.S. in 2004 for the 2005 model year. Built in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], it was the first hybrid SUV to hit the market. The Ford Escape Hybrid was the first American-built hybrid and the first hybrid vehicle from an American automaker, joined by the [[Chevrolet Silverado|Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra Hybrids]] during the same model year. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the first generation Ford Escape Hybrid is 70% more efficient than the regular Escape. The Mercury Mariner Hybrid is a rebadged version of the Escape Hybrid. It features revised front-end styling and a more luxurious interior.

Escape hybrid versions can be identified by the "Hybrid" badges located on the front driver's and passenger's doors as well as near the right tailgate. In addition, the driver's side window in the cargo area is smaller in size in order to accommodate a ventilation slot for the high voltage battery. There was also a "Special Appearance Package" available as an option on the 2005–2007 Hybrid models. This package replaced the traditional lower cladding of the Escape with a silver finish. Standard equipment on the Escape Hybrid includes: an eight-way [[power seat|power adjustable driver's seat]], dual-zone automatic [[air conditioning]], [[cruise control]], a six-[[Compact Disc player|CD]] stereo, 16-inch [[alloy wheels]], power door locks with remote [[keyless entry]], and [[power windows]].

Ford built 17,000 Escape Hybrids in the second half of 2004, four times as many as it had originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricdrive.org/index.php?tg=articles&amp;topics=7 Hybrid Sales Figures/Tax Credits for Hybrids] Electric Drive Transportation Association.

The Escape Hybrid uses technology similar to that used in the [[Toyota Prius]]. Ford engineers realized their technology may conflict with patents held by Toyota, which led to a 2004 patent-sharing accord between the companies, licensing Ford's use of some of Toyota's hybrid technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB107880303676250060 |title=Wall Street Journal Online – ''Toyota to License Hybrid Patents For Use by Ford'' – MARCH 9, 2004 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 9, 2004 |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange for Toyota's use of some of Ford's diesel and direct-injection engine technology.&lt;ref name="Detroit News - Aug 8, 2005"&gt;[http://www.cars.com/go/news/Story.jsp?section=news&amp;subject=recent&amp;story=080805storyaDN&amp;referer= Cars.com – ''Ford Slams Toyota on Hybrids''] – Reported by Christine Tierney, Detroit News, August 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ford maintains that Ford received no technical assistance from Toyota in developing the hybrid powertrain, but that some hybrid engine technologies developed by Ford independently were found to be similar to technologies previously patented by Toyota, so licenses were obtained.&lt;ref name="Detroit News - Aug 8, 2005"/&gt; [[Aisin Seiki Co.|Aisin Seiki Co.

[[File:2006 Mercury Mariner Hybrid engine.jpg|thumb|Engine compartment]]

The Escape Hybrid is a [[full hybrid]], meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Escape's hybrid system uses [[regenerative braking]], where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. The Escape Hybrid's 133 [[horsepower]] (99&amp;nbsp;kW) Atkinson cycle gasoline [[Straight-4|I4]] engine and electric motor combine to give {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which gives the Hybrid Escape nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} [[V6]] Escape due to the electric motor's torque being available from zero rpm.

The hybrid is said to give approximately 75% greater efficiency, the FWD version has EPA ratings of 30 mpg and 28 highway, with combined 29 mpg. The AWD version EPA ratings 28 city and 26 highway, combined 27 mpg &lt;sub&gt;-U.S.&lt;/sub&gt; in city traffic, and has demonstrated it can travel 400–500 miles (644–805&amp;nbsp;km) on a single {{convert|15.0|U.S.gal|L impgal|adj=on}} mpg&lt;sub&gt;-U.S.&lt;/sub&gt; (7.6L-8.1 L/100&amp;nbsp;km; 35–37&amp;nbsp;mpg&lt;sub&gt;-imp&lt;/sub&gt;) on the highway. To obtain these mileage figures, the owners manual states that pure gasoline, not ethanol blends, must be used. Unlike conventional vehicles, hybrids often achieve better figures in the city because they do not waste power idling and can recover some power when stopping (by using [[regenerative braking]]) that would be wasted in a conventional vehicle.

In 2006, Ford showed an Escape that could run on E85 fuel.

The second generation Ford Escape debuted at the 2006 [[Los Angeles International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061129/FREE/61129001/1064/cara_submit |title=Ford toughens Escape for 2008 |publisher=AutoWeek.com |accessdate=November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American-market Escape and its Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner siblings were redesigned in order to stay competitive with other new compact SUVs, however most of the internals have been carried over for the 2008 model year. The Escape still uses the [[Ford CD2 platform|CD2 platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=109656 |title=2008 Ford Escape gets new look |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]] |accessdate=March 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211015853/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId%3D109656 |archivedate=December 11, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also included an electronic stability control system standard on the 2008 Escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=116798/ |title=Ford To Make Stability Control Standard by 2009 |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]] |accessdate=September 13, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504191817/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D116798/ |archivedate=May 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The updated Escape received some styling cues from the [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], [[Ford Edge|Edge]], and [[Ford Expedition|Expedition]]. Changes include a new grille with larger headlamps in the front fascia, while the sides were revised with cleaner lines and rounder wheel arches. The interior is also completely redesigned, including the newest standard Ford family navigation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060419/AUTO03/604190322/1149 |title=Sneak Peek: 2008 Ford Escape |work=[[Detroit News]] |accessdate=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Escape and its [[Mercury Mariner#Second generation|Mercury Mariner]] sibling were the first vehicles to feature Ford's pull-drift steering mode, an enhancement made possible by applying software control to the [[Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30019 |title=Ford Builds on Electric Power Steering Technology To Enhance Drift Mode, Enable More Features &amp;#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2010, it was announced that Ford would end production on the second generation Escape in 2011 and move production to its Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where it was slated to be succeeded by a Taiwanese version of its European CUV counterpart, the [[Ford Kuga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/06/23/report-ford-to-halt-missouri-escape-production-in-2011?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_autoblog "Report: Ford to halt Missouri Escape production in 2011"] from Autoblog (June 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ford ===
A new concept version for the Asian market, called the ''Ford Escape Adventure Concept'', was revealed at the 2007 [[Tokyo Motor Show]]. It features a revised front and rear fascia, incorporating Ford's three-bar grille styling theme and restyled LED tail lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paultan.org/archives/2007/10/24/tokyo-2007-live-ford-escape-adventure-concept/ Paultan.org – TOKYO 2007 LIVE: Ford Escape Adventure Concept] – October 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Duratec 23 was replaced by a new 2.5&amp;nbsp;L {{nowrap|(2488 cc, 152 cu in)}} Duratec 25,&lt;ref name="burgess09"/&gt; which boosted standard power to {{convert|171|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque, while increasing fuel economy by 1 mpg (~2L/100&amp;nbsp;km) on both urban and extra-urban cycles. The optional 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec 30 V6 was thoroughly updated, resulting in a {{convert|40|hp|abbr=on}} increase, bringing power output to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|223|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. The Duratec 30 also sees a {{convert|1|mpgus|abbr=on}} fuel economy improvement. The "Escape" badge is entirely removed from the front doors.

The Hybrid is also upgraded to use the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L (albeit still using the [[Atkinson cycle]] for better fuel economy). Efficiency improved to {{convert|34|mpgus|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|31|mpgus|abbr=on}} highway according to the USEPA. The 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine brings the Hybrid's power output up by {{convert|22|hp|abbr=on}} when the electric motor is added in.

Other mechanical changes include a new {{convert|18.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} rear stabilizer bar, revised suspension tuning, upgrades to the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 that brought power to 240&amp;nbsp;hp,&lt;ref name="burgess09"/&gt; and a new exhaust system on all Escapes. The braking system for the Hybrid versions has been revised with a vacuum assist unit that reviewers have said give the brakes a consistent feel over the entire travel of the brake pedal.&lt;ref name="burgess09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/autoreviews/index.php?id=30578 |author=Burgess, Scott |title=Ford Escape adds power, refinement |date=May 28, 2008 |work=The Detroit News |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130208033001/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/autoreviews/index.php?id=30578 |archivedate=February 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous versions of the Hybrid were reported to have a slightly mushy brake feel, primarily due to the fact that for the first part of the brake travel and braking the system is regenerating power instead of engaging the brake pads against the rotors. However, the brakes, when tested, gave the Escape extremely long stops.

Also in 2009, [[Ford Sync|Ford's SYNC]] system is standard on the Hybrid, Hybrid Limited, and conventional Limited models, and optional on the XLS and XLT.

The Escape underwent some minor aerodynamic changes for 2009, including a revised front chin spoiler and rear tire spoilers. Along with the addition of rear tire spoilers is an optional 17" chrome-clad wheel equipped with a new Michelin "Low-Rolling-Resistance-Tire", slightly increasing ground clearance and improving traction over the standard 16" wheels and tires. Another new feature is Ford's Easy-Fuel capless fuel filling system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27548- media.ford.com Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525174153/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27548- |date=May 25, 2011 }} – February 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2009 the Escape was among the four Ford vehicles, along with the Focus, F-Series and Ranger, to benefit the most from the [[Cash for Clunkers]] program, where it showed a 49 percent increase in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Auto-sales-post-best-month-of-apf-4058866656.html?x=0&amp;.v=24 |title=Auto sales post best month of year but could slow |publisher=Yahoo!

In 2009 for the 2010 model year, the Escape will add three new features that will be standard on all trims: Ford's MyKey, trailer sway controls and Integrated Spotter Mirror for better blind spot viewing. Everything else added in the 2008 and 2009 model years will be carried over, but the optional orders have been renamed to Rapid Specification Codes (100s for XLS, 200s for XLT, and 300s for Limited).

New optional features for 2010: active park assist (APA) is a new feature available since mid-2009 as an option on the 2010 Ford Escape Limited (currently only optional on the Ford Flex, Lincoln MKT, and Lincoln MKS). Active Park Assist will detect an available parallel parking space and automatically steer the vehicle into the space (hands free) while the driver controls the accelerator, gearshift and brakes. The system will visually and audibly instruct the driver to park the vehicle. Active Park Assist system uses sensors on the front and rear of the vehicle to guide the vehicle into a parking space. Rear-view camera system – uses an exterior camera embedded in the rear of the vehicle that sends images to a video display in the rearview mirror or the navigation system screen to help enhance visibility directly behind the vehicle when it is in reverse.

No cosmetic changes were made for the 2011 model year. The only minor change is the standardization of SYNC Traffic &amp; Directions on any models coming equipped with Sync.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptcarz.com/z18486/Ford-Escape.aspx 2011 Ford Escape] from conceptcarz (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no cosmetic or equipment changes for the 2012 model year. The third-generation Escape was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

Previously unavailable [[Electronic Stability Control]] system became standard on the second generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |title=IIHS-HLDI |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407160743/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] [[crash test]]s the Escape along with its cousins, the Mercury Mariner and the Mazda Tribute, are rated "Good" in both frontal and side impact crash tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1022 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=Iihs.org |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=943 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=Iihs.org |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are rated "Good" for rear crash protection as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/head_restraints/headrestraints.aspx?ford |title=Head restraints: Ford |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209030759/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/head_restraints/headrestraints.aspx?ford |archivedate=December 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were given the "Top Safety Pick" award until 2010.

[[File:08 Mazda Tribute.jpg|thumb|Mazda Tribute]]

In 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Tribute was significantly revamped, like its Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner siblings. Originally set to be renamed the [[Mazda CX-5]], the vehicle kept the Tribute name. The changes were significant, but fell short of a "clean sheet" redesign, as the vehicles remained on the [[Ford CD2 platform|CD2 platform]], and kept the old 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Mazda MZR engine|MZR]] [[straight 4|I4]], and 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|AJ]] [[V6]] engines. Visible changes include all new sheet metal and interior. The interior was significantly upgraded using all new components and higher quality materials, and was generally praised by automotive journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060419/AUTO03/604190322/1149 |title=Sneak Peek: 2008 Ford Escape |work=[[Detroit News]] |accessdate=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the first generation of the Tribute, which had unique exterior and interior from its siblings, the new model only differs from its siblings in the "nose" (front fenders, hood, and front fascia), tail lights and detailing. Notable changes to the exterior include higher belt line, and more pronounced wheel arches. Overall the car was to look larger and more substantial than the previous model. As a cost-saving measure, the rear brake was reverted to [[drum brake]], with predictable criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/previews/13141/first-drive-2008-mazda-tribute-s-touring.html |title=2008 Mazda Tribute s Touring – First Drive Review |publisher=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/tribute/2009/review.html |title=2009 Mazda Tribute Review |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Mazda Tribute (non-hybrid) was first unveiled at the 2007 [[Montreal International Auto Show]], and the 2008 Mazda Tribute went on sale in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=d08b99a1-df2d-4c1e-ab70-814788edf7b9 |title=New CX-9 is Mazda's latest crossover |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324203955/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=d08b99a1-df2d-4c1e-ab70-814788edf7b9 |archivedate=March 24, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new addition was the Hybrid model which was previously only available on the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner.

The Tribute received additional major changes to improve performance for the 2009 model year, mostly by way of mechanical upgrades. Most significantly, all new engines replaced the increasingly outmatched 2.3L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] and 3.0L V6. Mazda's new MZR 2.5L I4 replaced the 2.3L, boosting horsepower to {{convert|171|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000 rpm.&lt;ref name=2009specs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mazdausamedia.com/content/2009-tribute |title=2009 Tribute |publisher=MazdaUSAMedia |accessdate=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increased horsepower, fuel economy also increased by {{convert|1|mpgus|abbr=on}} on both urban and extra-urban cycles. The optional 3.0&amp;nbsp;L ([[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|AJ]]) [[V6]] was thoroughly updated, resulting in a {{convert|40|hp|abbr=on}} increase, bringing power output to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|223|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. It also sees a 1 mpg improvement. The Tribute Hybrid was dropped after the 2009 model year.

Another significant change was the switch to Ford's new [[Ford 6F transmission|6F]] 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], which became standard on all V6 equipped models and optional on the I4. As well, new front and {{convert|18.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} rear stabilizer bars were added for 2009 to improve ride handling after complaints about diminished performance following the 2008 changes. Others changes included redesigned seats, daytime running lamps, optional steering mounted audio controls, and other additional features. The Tribute was discontinued in November 2011 at the end of the 2011 model year, replaced by the [[Mazda CX-5]] for 2012.

For the 2008 model year the Mariner was significantly updated with a new look although it remained on the [[Ford CD2 platform]] used by the previous generation. The first 2008 Mercury Mariner was unveiled at the South Florida International Auto Show on October 6, 2006. The changes included a new seats, headlights, taillights, a new liftgate, a higher beltline and new doors and wheels. The interior was also significantly updated with higher quality materials and more refined features. The engines remained the same but the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec [[V6]] has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by 10%.

The 2009 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner were unveiled at the 2008 Washington Auto Show. Sporting a 2.5-liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission that replaced the four-speed [[automatic transmission]], the new powertrain improved the EPA fuel economy by 1 mile per gallon and increased power by 11% to {{convert|170|hp}}. Also, the existing 3.0-liter Duratec V6 was bumped from {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}}. The new engine was also the new basis for Ford's hybrid models, including the Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid. "For every eight Escape and Mariner vehicles we sell, one of them is a hybrid, and the appeal is growing," says Sue Ciscke, Ford senior vice president, Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering.

For the 2010 model year, the Mariner added Ford's MyKey and trailer sway controls as standard on all trim levels. The Mariner engine has a [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flex-Fuel]] option on all of them which features being able to use E85 fuel and/or regular unleaded only on the optional V6 engine. Ford has also done away with the Euro-style turn signal repeaters for this model year. For the 2011 model year, the Mariner featured [[HD Radio]] as a standard, but continued with the same features as the 2010 models. This version of the Mariner was its last, as Ford discontinued the Mercury brand due to declining sales. Ford ended production of the Mariner in October 2010. The last one rolled off the assembly line on October 5, 2010.

The second generation Ford Escape Hybrid received some styling tweaks inside and out. The major cosmetic changes included new bumpers, grille, headlights and taillights to match Ford's new edge style. But the drivetrain was essentially the same mechanically but has had extensive software modifications.&lt;ref name="cars.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?makeid=14&amp;modelid=8592&amp;year=2008&amp;section=reviews |title=2008 Ford Escape Hybrid Reviews by Cars.com Experts and Consumers |publisher=Cars.com |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2009, a larger, more powerful engine was introduced, together with a revised suspension, addition of stability control, the debut of "Sync" voice-control system and a capless fuel filler system.&lt;ref name=Edmunds2009test/&gt; The batteries and other hybrid components in a 2009 Escape hybrid added about 136&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lbs) to the vehicle.

The second generation Escape Hybrid was offered in two levels of specification, an undesignated ''base'' model and the more expensive "Limited" trim. The ''base'' included: a 60/40 split-fold rear bench seat, ''[[electronic stability control|AdvanceTrac]]'' with roll stability control, and a single-disc four-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] compatibility. The "Limited" adds: a chrome front grille, heated front seats, a six-way power driver's seat and full leather upholstery, [[rear park assist]], ambient lighting, and 16-inch six-spoke alloy wheels. For the 2009 model year, [[Ford SYNC]] became standard on both Hybrid trims and the Ford Escape Hybrid replaced the "ESCAPE" badges on doors with "''HYBRID''," while relocating the logo for Ford hybrid models from near the driver's side doors next to the "''HYBRID''" text. 2010 models saw the addition of [[MyKey]], trailer sway controls, and integrated spotter mirror for better blind spot viewing. New optional extras are active park assist and a rear-view camera.

Ford announced the development of a prototype [[E85]] Hybrid Escape, the first [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible fuel]] [[hybrid electric vehicle]] capable of running on 85% ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22474 Ford Develop's World's First Ethanol-Fueled Hybrid Marrying Two Gasoline-Saving Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204185203/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22474 |date=2006-02-04 }}.

By early 2012 Ford discontinued the production of the Escape Hybrid due to the introduction of the third generation Escape. Two of the new 2013 [[model year]] Escapes have direct-injected and turbocharged [[EcoBoost]] units (of 1.6 and 2.0 liters) that deliver a higher fuel economy than the 2012 model. A total of 122,850 Escape Hybrids were built since 2005, along with 12,300 units of its sibling the [[Mercury Mariner Hybrid]], discontinued in 2010.&lt;ref name=Discontinued&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1076382_green-car-death-list-2012-models-to-which-we-bid-adieu |title=Green-Car Death List: 2012 Models To Which We Bid Adieu |author=John Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three companies have converted Ford Escape Hybrids to [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] under a contract with the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority|NYSERDA]] and delivered them in 2007: Electrovaya of [[Toronto]] Canada, [[Hymotion]] also of Toronto Canada, [[Hybrids Plus]] of Boulder Colorado, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/620.html |title=NYS Governor Announces Winners for PHEV Conversions |publisher=Calcars.org |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ford]] developed a research Escape Plug-in Hybrid and delivered the first of a fleet of 20 to [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) in December 2007 to begin road testing. This project is a collaboration aimed to explore the future of [[plug-in hybrid]]s and evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated "in typical customer settings", according to Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27333 |title=Ford Delivers First Escape Plug-In Hybrid To Southern California Edison |publisher=Media.Ford.Com |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118130826/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27333 |archivedate=November 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11093 |title=EERE News: EERE Network News |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=26326 Ford Motor Company – Press Release – Ford Motor Company And Southern California Edison Join Forces To Advance A New Transportation And Energy Vision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516102806/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=26326 |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also developed the first ever [[flexible-fuel]] [[plug-in hybrid]] [[SUV]], which was delivered to the [[United States Department of Energy]] in June 2008. This plug-in version of the Escape Hybrid runs on gasoline or [[E85]] and is also part of the demonstration fleet Ford developed in a partnership with Southern California Edison and the [[Electric Power Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=USDoE&gt;[http://www.ford.com/about-ford/news-announcements/press-releases/press-releases-detail/pr-ford-motor-company-delivers-28424 Ford Motor Company – Press Release – Ford Motor Company Delivers Flexible Fuel, Plug-In Vehicle to Department of Energy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622032409/http://www.ford.com/about-ford/news-announcements/press-releases/press-releases-detail/pr-ford-motor-company-delivers-28424 |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the E85 version and the conventional gasoline engine version use a 10 [[kwh]] [[lithium-ion battery]], which allows for a {{convert|30|mi|adj=on}} range at {{convert|40|mph}} or less. When the battery's charge drops to 30%, the vehicle switches to its four-cylinder engine, assisted by the batteries, operating as a regular [[hybrid electric vehicle]]. The vehicle has a display system which shows the driver how efficient the vehicle is at any given time. If the vehicle uses its engine and is running in traditional hybrid mode, [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is rated at {{convert|88|mpgU.S.}} in the city and {{convert|50|mpgU.S.}} on the highway.&lt;ref name=USDoE/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC032009/&gt;

This fleet of 20 Ford Escape Plug-ins has been running in field testing with utility company fleets in California, New York, [[Ohio]], [[North Carolina]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], and [[Quebec]], Canada. About 130 more will be produced for testing with financing from a $30 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. Sales are scheduled for 2012.&lt;ref name=HC032009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/vehicle/ford-escape-plug-hybrid.html |title=Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid |publisher=hybridCars.com |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912034932/http://www.hybridcars.com/vehicle/ford-escape-plug-hybrid.html |archive-date=September 12, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/engine-block/2009/05/100_mpg_in_ford_escape_plugin.html |title=100 MPG in Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid |publisher=The Birmingham News |author=Joddy Potter |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2009 Ford delivered the first Escape Plug-in equipped with intelligent [[vehicle-to-grid]] (V2G) communications and control system technology to [[American Electric Power]] of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This technology allows the vehicle operator to program when to recharge the vehicle, for how long and at what utility rate. The battery systems communicate directly with the electrical grid via smart meters provided by utility companies through wireless networking.&lt;ref name="Autoblog.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/18/ford-announces-electric-vehicle-to-grid-communications-system |title=Ford announces electric vehicle-to-grid communications system |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two years since the demonstration program began, the fleet of Escape Plug-ins has logged more than {{convert|75000|mi|km}}, and Ford plans to equip all 21 plug-in hybrid Escapes with the vehicle-to-grid communications technology.&lt;ref name="Autoblog.com"/&gt;

The Ford demonstration vehicles and Hybrids Plus conversions are similar. The conversion involves the replacement of the original [[NiMH battery]], located on the floor of the trunk, with a larger capacity [[Li-ion battery]], in the same location and substantially the same volume as the original battery. The Electrovaya and Hymotion conversions retain the original battery, and augment its capacity with a Li-ion battery that occupies a significant portion of the trunk. In all cases, the conversion also involves the addition of a charger and of a power plug.

{{More citations needed|date=September 2008}}In [[solid-state physics]], the '''free electron model''' is a simple model for the behaviour of [[charge carrier]]s in a [[metal]]lic solid. It was developed in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommerfeld|first=Arnold|author-link=Arnold Sommerfeld|date=1928-01-01|title=Zur Elektronentheorie der Metalle auf Grund der Fermischen Statistik|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|language=de|volume=47|issue=1–2|pages=1–32|doi=10.1007/bf01391052|issn=0044-3328|bibcode=1928ZPhy...47....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] who combined the [[Classical physics|classical]] [[Drude model]] with [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and hence it is also known as the '''Drude–Sommerfeld model'''.

Given its simplicity, it is surprisingly successful in explaining many experimental phenomena, especially
* the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]] which relates [[electrical conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]];
* the temperature dependence of the [[electron heat capacity]];
* the shape of the electronic [[density of states]];
* the range of binding energy values;
* electrical conductivities;
* the [[Seebeck coefficient]] of the [[thermoelectric effect]];
* [[thermionic emission|thermal electron emission]] and [[field electron emission]] from bulk metals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The free electron model solved many of the inconsistencies related to the Drude model and gave insight into several other properties of metals. The model considers that metals are composed of a quantum electron gas where [[ion]]s play almost no role. The model can be very predictive when applied to [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[noble metal]]s.

==Ideas and assumptions==

In the free electron model four main assumptions are taken into account:
*Free electron approximation: The interaction between the ions and the valence electrons is mostly neglected, except in boundary conditions. The ions only keep the charge neutrality in the metal. Unlike in the Drude model, the ions are not necessarily the source of collisions.
*[[Independent electron approximation]]: The interactions between electrons are ignored. The electrostatic fields in metals are weak because of the [[screening effect]].
*Relaxation-time approximation: There is some unknown scattering mechanism such that the electron probability of collision is inversely proportional to the relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the average time between collisions. The collisions do not depend on the electronic configuration.
*[[Pauli exclusion principle]]: Each quantum state of the system can only be occupied by a single electron. This restriction of available electron states is taken into account by [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] (see also [[Fermi gas]]). Main predictions of the free-electron model are derived by the [[Sommerfeld expansion]] of the Fermi–Dirac occupancy for energies around the [[Fermi level]].

The name of the model comes from the first two assumptions, as each electron can be treated as [[free particle]] with a respective quadratic relation between energy and momentum.

The crystal lattice is not explicitly taken into account in the free electron model, but a quantum-mechanical justification was given a year later (1928) by [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]]:&lt;!-- Is this Bloch theorem? We must check the validity of this paragraph --&gt; an unbound electron moves in a periodic potential as a free electron in vacuum, except for the [[electron mass]] ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' becoming an [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] ''m*'' which may deviate considerably from ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' (one can even use negative effective mass to describe conduction by [[electron hole]]s). Effective masses can be derived from [[band structure]] computations that were not originally taken into account in the free electron model.

== From the Drude model ==
{{main|Drude model}}
Many physical properties follow directly from the Drude model as some equations do not depend on the statistical distribution of the particles. Taking the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|classical velocity distribution]] of an ideal gas or the velocity distribution of a Fermi gas only changes the results related to the speed of the electrons.

Mainly, the free electron model and the Drude model predict the same DC electrical conductivity ''σ'' for [[Ohm's law]], that is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}\quad&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\quad\sigma = \frac{ne^2\tau}{m_e},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[current density]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the external electric field, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electronic density]] (number of electrons/volume) and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge|electron electric charge]].&lt;!-- , and  &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron rest mass|electron mass]]. To include if paragraph above about Bloch's theorem disappears --&gt;

Other quantities that remain the same under the free electron model as under Drude's are the AC susceptibility, the [[plasma oscillation|plasma frequency]],  the [[magnetoresistance]], and the Hall coefficient related to the [[Hall effect]].

== Properties of an electron gas ==
{{main|Fermi gas}}
Many properties of the free electron model follow directly from equations related to the Fermi gas, as the independent electron approximation leads to an ensemble of non-interacting electrons. For a three-dimensional electron gas we can define the [[Fermi energy]] as
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\left(3\pi^2n\right)^\frac{2}{3},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. The Fermi energy defines the [[Fermi level]], ''i.e.'' the maximal energy an electron in the metal can have at zero temperature. For metals the Fermi energy is in the order of units of [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/fermi.html|title=Fermi Energies, Fermi Temperatures, and Fermi Velocities|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=|publisher=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|In three dimensions, the [[density of states]] of a gas of [[fermion]]s is proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy of the particles.]]

=== Density of states ===
The 3D [[density of states]] (number of energy states, per energy per volume) of a non-interacting electron gas is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;g(E) = \frac{m_e}{\pi^2\hbar^3}\sqrt{2m_eE} = \frac{3}{2}\frac{n}{E_{\rm F}}\sqrt{\frac{E}{E_{\rm F}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a given electron. This formula takes into account the spin degeneracy but does not consider a possible energy shift due to the bottom of the [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction band]]. For 2D the density of states is constant and for 1D is inversely proportional to the square root of the electron energy.

=== Chemical potential ===
Additionally the Fermi energy is used to define [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. [[Sommerfeld expansion]] is a technique used to calculate the chemical potential for higher energies, that is
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(T) = E_{\rm F} \left[1 - \frac{\pi ^2}{12} \left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm F}}\right) ^2 - \frac{\pi^4}{80} \left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm F}}\right)^4 + \cdots \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and we define &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_{\rm F} = E_{\rm F}/k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Fermi temperature]] (&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann constant]]). The perturbative approach is justified as the Fermi temperature is usually of about 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K for a metal, hence at room temperature or lower the Fermi energy and the chemical potential are practically equivalent.

=== Compressibility of metals and degeneracy pressure ===
The total energy per unit volume (at &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T = 0&lt;/math&gt;) can also be calculated by integrating over the [[phase space]] of the system, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;u(0) = \frac{3}{5}nE_{\rm F},&lt;/math&gt;

which does not depend on temperature. Compare with the energy per electron of an ideal gas: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{3}{2}k_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;, which is null at zero temperature. For an ideal gas to have the same energy as the electron gas, the temperatures would need to be of the order of the Fermi temperature. Thermodynamically, this energy of the electron gas corresponds to a zero-temperature pressure given by
: &lt;math&gt;P = -\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu} = \frac{2}{3}u(0),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U(T) = u(T) V&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy, the derivative performed at temperature and chemical potential constant. This pressure is called the [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and does not come from repulsion or motion of the electrons but from the restriction that no more than two electrons (due to the two values of spin) can occupy the same energy level. This pressure defines the compressibility or [[bulk modulus]] of the metal
:&lt;math&gt;B = -V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\mu} = \frac{5}{3}P = \frac{2}{3}nE_{\rm F}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression gives the right order of magnitude for the bulk modulus for alkali metals and noble metals, which show that this pressure is as important as other effects inside the metal. For other metals the crystalline structure has to be taken into account.

== Additional predictions ==

=== Heat capacity ===
{{See|Electron heat capacity}}
One open problem in solid-state physics before the arrival of the free electron model was related to the low [[heat capacity]] of metals. Even when the Drude model was a good approximation for the Lorenz number of the Wiedemann-Franz law, the classical argument is based on the idea that the [[volumetric heat capacity]] of an ideal gas is
:&lt;math&gt;c^\text{Drude}_V = \frac{3}{2}nk_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt;.

If this was the case, the heat capacity of a metal could be much higher due to this electronic contribution. Nevertheless, such a large heat capacity was never measured, rising suspicions about the argument. By using Sommerfeld's expansion one can obtain corrections of the energy density at finite temperature and obtain the volumetric heat capacity of an electron gas, given by:
:&lt;math&gt;c_V=\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_{n}=\frac{\pi^2}{2}\frac{T}{T_{\rm F}} nk_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the prefactor to &lt;math&gt;nk_B&lt;/math&gt;is considerably smaller than the 3/2 found in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c^{\text{Drude}}_V&lt;/math&gt;, about 100 times smaller at room temperature and much smaller at lower &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. The good estimation of the Lorenz number in the Drude model was a result of the classical mean velocity of electron being about 100 larger than the quantum version, compensating the large value of the classical heat capacity. The free electron model calculation of the Lorenz factor is about twice the value of Drude's and its closer to the experimental value. With this heat capacity the free electron model is also able to predict the right order of magnitude and temperature dependence at low ''T'' for the [[Seebeck coefficient]] of the [[thermoelectric effect]].

Evidently, the electronic contribution alone does not predict the [[Dulong–Petit law]], i.e. the observation that the heat capacity of a metal is constant at high temperatures. The free electron model can be improved in this sense by adding the lattice vibrations contribution. Two famous schemes to include the lattice into the problem are the [[Einstein solid]] model and [[Debye model]]. With the addition of the later, the volumetric heat capacity of a metal at low temperatures can be more precisely written in the form, 
:&lt;math&gt;c_V\approx\gamma T + AT^3&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are constants of related to the material. The linear term comes from the electronic contribution while the cubic term comes from Debye model. At high temperature this expression is no longer correct, the electronic heat capacity can be neglected, and the total heat capacity of the metal tends to a constant.

=== Mean free path ===
Notice that without the relaxation time approximation, there is no reason for the electrons to deflect their motion, as there are no interactions, thus the [[mean free path]] should be infinite. Drude model considered the mean free path of electrons to be close to the distance between ions in the material, implying the earlier conclusion that the [[Diffusion|diffusive motion]] of the electrons was due to collisions with the ions. The mean free paths in the free electron model are instead given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lambda=v_{\rm F}\tau&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v_{\rm F}=\sqrt{2E_{\rm F}/m_e}&lt;/math&gt; is the Fermi speed) and are in the order of hundreds of [[ångström]]s, at least one order of magnitude larger than any possible classical calculation. The mean free path is then not a result electron-ion collisions but instead is related to imperfections in the material, either due to [[Crystallographic defect|defects]] and impurities in the metal, or due to thermal fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unlcms.unl.edu/cas/physics/tsymbal/teaching/SSP-927/Section%2008_Electron_Transport.pdf|title=Electronic Transport|last=Tsymbal|first=Evgeny|date=2008|website=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inaccuracies and extensions==
The free electron model presents several inadequacies that are contradicted by experimental observation. We list some inaccuracies below:
; Temperature dependence: The free electron model presents several physical quantities that have the wrong temperature dependence, or no dependence at all like the electrical conductivity. The thermal conductivity and specific heat are well predicted for alkali metals at low temperatures, but fails to predict high temperature behaviour coming from ion motion and [[phonon]] scattering.
; Hall effect and magnetoresistance:The Hall coefficient has a constant value {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} -1/(''ne'')}} in Drude's model and in the free electron model. This value is independent of temperature and the strength of the magnetic field. The Hall coefficient is actually dependent on the [[band structure]] and the difference with the model can be quite dramatic when studying elements like [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]] that have a strong magnetic field dependence. The free electron model also predicts that the traverse magnetoresistance, the resistance in the direction of the current, does not depend on the strength of the field. In almost all the cases it does.
; Directional: The conductivity of some metals can depend of the orientation of the sample with respect to the electric field. Sometimes even the electrical current is not parallel to the field.  This possibility is not described because the model does not integrate the crystallinity of metals, i.e. the existence of a periodic lattice of ions. 
; Diversity in the conductivity: Not all metals are [[electrical conductor]]s,  some do not conduct electricity very well ([[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]]), some can conduct when impurities are added like [[semiconductor]]s. [[Semimetal]]s, with narrow conduction bands also exist. This diversity is not predicted by the model and can only by explained by analysing the [[valence and conduction bands]]. Additionally, electrons are not the only charge carriers in a metal, electron vacancies or [[Electron hole|holes]] can be seen as [[quasiparticle]]s carrying positive electric charge. Conduction of holes leads to an opposite sign for the Hall and Seebeck coefficients predicted by the model.

Other inadequacies are present in the Wiedemann-Franz law at intermediate temperatures and the frequency-dependence of metals in the optical spectrum.

More exact values for the electrical conductivity and Wiedemann-Franz law can be obtained by softening the relaxation-time approximation by appealing to [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann transport equations]] or [[Kubo formula]].

The spin is mostly neglected in the free electron model and its consequences can lead to emergent magnetic phenomena like [[Paramagnetism|Pauli paramagnetism]] and [[ferromagnetism]].

An immediate continuation to the free electron model can be obtained by assuming the [[empty lattice approximation]], which forms the basis of the band structure model known as the [[nearly free electron model]].

Adding repulsive interactions between electrons does not change very much the picture presented here. [[Lev Landau]] showed that a Fermi gas under repulsive interactions, can be seen as a gas of equivalent quasiparticles that slightly modify the properties of the metal. Landau's model is now known as the [[Fermi liquid theory]]. More exotic phenomena like [[superconductivity]], where interactions can be attractive, require a more refined theory.

[[File:Gravitational field Earth lines equipotentials.svg|right|thumb|Image depicting [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]]. Objects accelerate towards the Earth, thus losing their gravitational energy and transforming it into [[kinetic energy]].]]
'''Gravitational energy''' is the [[potential energy]] a [[body (physics)|body]] with [[mass]] has in relation to another massive object due to [[gravity]]. It is potential energy associated with the [[gravitational field]]. Gravitational energy is dependent on the [[mass]]es of two bodies, their distance apart and the [[gravitational constant]] ({{math|''G''}}).&lt;ref name=gpe&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational Potential Energy|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/gpot.html|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In everyday cases only one body is accelerating measurably, and its acceleration is constant (for example, dropping a ball on Earth). For such scenarios the Newtonian formula can – for the potential energy of the accelerating body with respect to the stationary – be reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;U = mgh&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational potential energy, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object accelerating, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the bodies.&lt;ref name=gpe/&gt; Note that this formula treats the potential energy as a positive quantity.

== Newtonian mechanics ==

In [[classical mechanics]], two or more [[mass]]es always have a gravitational [[potential (physics)|potential]]. [[Conservation of energy]] requires that this gravitational field energy is always [[Negative energy|negative]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The gravitational potential energy is the potential energy an object has because it is within a gravitational field.

The force one point mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; exerts onto another point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]]: &lt;math&gt;F = G\frac {mM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To get the total work done by an external force to bring point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; from infinity to the final distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (for example the radius of Earth) of the two mass points, the force is integrated with respect to displacement:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\int_\infty^R G\frac {mM}{r^2}dr = &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-G\left . {mM\over r} \right \vert _{\infty}^{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{r}=0&lt;/math&gt;, the total work done on the object can be written as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics for the IB Diploma Full Colour |edition=revised |first1=K.

== General relativity ==

{{Main article|Mass in general relativity}}
[[File:Spacetime lattice analogy.svg|thumb|right|A depiction of curved [[geodesics]] ("world lines"). According to [[general relativity]], mass distorts [[spacetime]] and gravity is a natural consequence of Newton's First Law.]]
In [[general relativity]] gravitational energy is extremely complex, and there is no single agreed upon definition of the concept. It is sometimes modeled via the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Davidovich Landau]] &amp; [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz]], ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', (1951), Pergamon Press, {{ISBN|7-5062-4256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows retention for the energy-momentum conservation laws of [[classical mechanics]]. Addition of the matter [[stress–energy–momentum tensor]] to the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor results in a combined matter plus gravitational energy pseudotensor that has a vanishing [[Four-vector|4]]-[[divergence]] in all frames - ensuring the conservation law. Some people object to this derivation on the grounds that [[pseudotensor]]s are inappropriate in general relativity, but the divergence of the combined matter plus gravitational energy pseudotensor is a [[tensor]].

{{infobox hassium}}
'''Hassium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Hs''' and [[atomic number]] 108. It is named after the German state of [[Hesse]]. It is a [[synthetic element]] and [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;seconds.

In the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. Hassium is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 8 elements]]: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[osmium]] in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with [[oxygen]] in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.

===Reports===
The synthesis of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a research team led by [[Yuri Oganessian]] at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. The team used a reaction that would generate &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;108 from [[radium]] and [[calcium]]. The researchers were uncertain in interpreting result data; the paper did not unambiguously claim discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|first1=Yu.

New experiments were performed in 1983. In each experiment, a thin layer of a target material was installed on a rotating wheel and bombarded at a shallow angle. This was made so that fission fragments from spontaneously fissioning nuclides formed could escape the target and be detected in a number of fission track detectors surrounding the wheel. The experiments probably resulted in synthesis of element 108: [[bismuth]] was bombarded with [[manganese]] to obtain &lt;sup&gt;263&lt;/sup&gt;108, [[lead]] was bombarded with [[iron]] to obtain &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;108, and [[californium]] was bombarded with [[neon]] to obtain &lt;sup&gt;264&lt;/sup&gt;108.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/108/hassium|title=Hassium|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|language=en|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments were not claimed as a discovery and were only announced by Oganessian in a conference rather than in a written report.&lt;ref name="1993 report"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barber|first1=Robert C.|last2=Greenwood|first2=N.

In 1984, researchers in Dubna published a written report. The researchers performed a number of experiments set up as the previous ones with, bombarding target materials (bismuth and lead) with ions of lighter element (manganese and iron, correspondingly).&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

Also in 1984, a research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]] at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI; ''Institute for Heavy Ion Research'') in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], [[West Germany]], attempted to create element 108. The team bombarded a target of lead with accelerated nuclei of iron. They reported synthesis of 3&amp;nbsp;atoms of &lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;108.&lt;ref name="84Mu01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Münzenberg|first1=G.|author-link=Gottfried Münzenberg|last2=Armbruster|first2=P.|author-link2=Peter Armbruster|last3=Folger|first3=H.|last4=Heßberger|first4=F.

===Arbitration===

In 1985, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) formed a [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] (JWP) to assess [[discovery of the chemical elements|discoveries]] and establish final names for the elements with atomic number greater than 100. The party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognition of an element, and in 1991, they finished the work on assessing discoveries, and disbanded. These results were published in 1993.&lt;ref name="1993 report" /&gt;

[[File:Bohrium hassium meitnerium ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|Naming ceremony conducted at the GSI on 7 September 1992 for the namings of elements 107, 108, and 109 as nielsbohrium, hassium, and meitnerium]]

According to the report, the 1984 works from JINR and GSI simultaneously independently established synthesis of element 108. Of the two 1984 works, the one from GSI was said to be sufficient as a discovery on its own, while the JINR work, which preceded the GSI one, "very probably" displayed synthesis of element 108, but that is determined in retrospect given the work from Darmstadt. The report concluded that the major credit should be awarded to GSI.&lt;ref name="emsley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="93TWG"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

===Naming===
According to [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], hassium should be known as ''eka-[[osmium]]''. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''unniloctium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uno''),&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1979|volume=51|pages=381–384|title=Recommendations for the naming of elements of atomic numbers greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[systematic element name]] as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]], until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it "element 108", with the symbol of ''E108'', ''(108)'', or even simply ''108'', or used the proposed name "hassium".&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt;

The name ''hassium'' was proposed by Peter Armbruster and his colleagues, the officially recognised German discoverers, in September 1992. It is derived from the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] name ''Hassia'' for the German state of [[Hesse]] where the institute is located.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref name="1993 responses"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|year=1993|title=Responses on the report 'Discovery of the Transfermium elements' followed by reply to the responses by Transfermium Working Group|url=https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1993/pdf/6508x1815.pdf|deadurl=no|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=65|issue=8|pages=1815–1824|doi=10.1351/pac199365081815|pmid=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125223512/http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1993/pdf/6508x1815.pdf|archivedate=25 November 2013|access-date=7 September 2016|via=|df=|last1=Ghiorso|first1=A.|last2=Seaborg|first2=G.

==Natural occurrence==
[[File:Molybdenit 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Molybdenite]]]]
Hassium is not known to occur naturally on Earth; the [[half-life|half-lives]] of all its known isotopes are short enough that no [[primordial element|primordial]] hassium would have survived to the present day. This does not rule out the possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or [[nuclear isomer]]s existing, some of which could still exist in [[trace radioisotope|trace]] quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural [[radioisotope]]s, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.&lt;ref name="emsley"/&gt;

In 1963, Soviet scientist Viktor Cherdyntsev, who had previously claimed the existence of primordial [[curium]]-247,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cherdyntsev |first1=V. V. |last2=Mikhailov |first2=V. F. |date=1963 |title=The Primordial Transuranium Isotope in Nature |journal=Geokhimiya |volume=1 |pages=3–14 |osti=4748393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500&amp;nbsp;million years) in natural [[molybdenite]] and suggested the name ''sergenium'' (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol had not yet been taken by [[seaborgium]]) for it; this name takes its origin in the name for the [[Silk Road]] and was explained as "coming from [[Kazakhstan]]".&lt;ref name="emsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikitin|first=A.|date=1970|title=Новый трансуран найден в природе|trans-title=New transuranium found in nature|url=|journal=[[Nauka i zhizn]]|language=Russian|volume=2|pages=102–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in [[nitric acid]], similarly to osmium. His findings were criticized by Soviet physicist Vladimir Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kulakov |first1=V. M. |date=1970 |title=Has element 108 been discovered? |journal=Soviet Atomic Energy |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1166–8 |doi=10.1007/BF01666716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief questions raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, but at the same time a corrected half-life in the region of 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100&amp;nbsp;milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different [[hyperdeformation|hyperdeformed]] states of a hassium isotope around &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marinov |first1=A.|last2=Gelberg |first2=S. |last3=Kolb |first3=D. |last4=Brandt |first4=R. |last5=Pape |first5=A. |title=New outlook on the possible existence of superheavy elements in nature |journal=Physics of Atomic Nuclei |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1137–45 |doi=10.1134/1.1586428 |arxiv = nucl-ex/0210039 |bibcode = 2003PAN....66.1137M |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research conducted a search for natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and [[false positive]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.&lt;ref name="emsley"/&gt;

In 2006, it was hypothesized that an isomer of &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs might have a half-life of around {{val|2.5e8|0.5}} years, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] in some samples of molybdenite and [[osmiridium]].&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; This isomer of &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs could be produced from the [[beta decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;[[bohrium|Bh]] and &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;[[seaborgium|Sg]], which, being homologous to [[rhenium]] and molybdenum&lt;!--don't change it to tungsten. the point is that Hs is being predicted to occur in molybdenite, which has Mo and some Re in it. W is speculation not supported by the source. This is ALREADY speculation so we should be cautious.--&gt; respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; It is possible that more &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the [[Solar System]] travels through the spiral arms of the [[Milky Way]], which would also explain excesses of [[plutonium-239]] found on the floors of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Gulf of Finland]], but minerals enriched with &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs are predicted to also have excesses of [[uranium-235]] and [[lead]]-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during [[spontaneous fission]], such as [[krypton]], [[zirconium]], and [[xenon]]. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivanov|first1=A.

Hassium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 (with the exceptions of 272, 274, and 276), three of which, hassium-265, hassium-267, hassium-269, have known [[metastable state]]s. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some also undergo spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;&lt;ref name="273Hs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2010/10/26/six-new-isotopes/ |title=Six New Isotopes of the Superheavy Elements Discovered " Berkeley Lab News Center |publisher=Newscenter.lbl.gov |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lightest isotopes, which usually have shorter half-lives were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers.

===&lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs: prospects for a deformed doubly magic nucleus===
According to calculations, 108 is a [[proton]] [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] for deformed nuclei (nuclei that are far from [[sphere|spherical]]), and 162 is a [[neutron]] magic number for deformed nuclei. This means that such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high, narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life-times to spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=Focus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dvorak/&gt; The spontaneous fission half-lives in this region are typically reduced by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; in comparison with those in the vicinity of the spherical doubly magic nucleus &lt;sup&gt;298&lt;/sup&gt;[[flerovium|Fl]], caused by the narrower fission barrier for such deformed nuclei.&lt;ref name=Smolanczuk/&gt; Hence, the nucleus &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs has promise as a deformed doubly magic nucleus. Experimental data from the decay of the [[darmstadtium]] (Z=110) isotopes &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Ds and &lt;sup&gt;273&lt;/sup&gt;Ds provides strong evidence for the magic nature of the [[neutron number|N]]=162 [[nuclear shell|sub-shell]]. The syntheses of &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs, &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs, and &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Hs also fully support the assignment of N=162 as a magic number. In particular, the low decay energy for &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs is in complete agreement with calculations.&lt;ref name=Focus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v18/st19|title=A Nuclear Magic Trick|accessdate=2006-12-25|author=Mason Inman|date=2006-12-14|website= Physical Review Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dvorak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dvorak|first1=J.|last2=Brüchle|first2=W.|last3=Chelnokov|first3=M.|last4=Dressler|first4=R.|last5=Düllmann|first5=Ch.

==Predicted properties==
Various calculations show that hassium should be the heaviest known [[group 8 element]], consistent with the [[periodic law]]. Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of [[osmium]], with a few deviations arising from [[relativistic effects]].

===Physical and atomic===
The previous members of group 8 have relatively high [[melting point]]s ([[iron|Fe]], 1538&amp;nbsp;°C; [[ruthenium|Ru]], 2334&amp;nbsp;°C; [[osmium|Os]], 3033&amp;nbsp;°C). Much like them, hassium is predicted to be a [[solid]] at room temperature,&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt; although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the [[hexagonal close-packed]] structure (&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.59), similarly to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] osmium.&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt; Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a [[bulk modulus]] (resistance to uniform compression) comparable to that of [[diamond]]&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossman |first1=Jeffery C. |last2=Mizel |first2=Ari |last3=Côté |first3=Michel |last4=Cohen |first4=Marvin L. |last5=Louie |first5=Steven G. |date=1999 |title=Transition metals and their carbides and nitrides: Trends in electronic and structural properties |journal=Phys.

==Experimental chemistry==
Despite the fact that the selection of a volatile hassium compound (hassium tetroxide) for gas-phase chemical studies was clear from the beginning,&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; the chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time.&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; Although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized. Unfortunately, this hassium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs, was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of &lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;[[copernicium|Cn]];&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies,&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; but also the reaction that produced the isotope &lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;Cn had a low yield (its cross-section was only 1&amp;nbsp;[[barn (unit)|pb]]),&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation.&lt;ref name="DoiX" /&gt; The direct synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs and &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs in the reaction &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg,xn)&lt;sup&gt;274−x&lt;/sup&gt;Hs (x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 or 5) appeared more promising, as the cross-section for this reaction was somewhat larger, at 7&amp;nbsp;pb.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of [[bohrium]].&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt;

Ruthenium and osmium have very similar chemistry due to the [[lanthanide contraction]], but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not.&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FeO4"/&gt; Consequently, in preparation for the chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron,&lt;ref name="superheavy-chemistry"/&gt; as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the [[lanthanide contraction|actinide contraction]].&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs([[cyclopentadienyl|C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[ferrocene]] may also be used for comparison along with [[ruthenocene]] and [[osmocene]].&lt;ref name="hassocene"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Düllmann |first1=Ch.

The first chemistry experiments were performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001, using &lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;Os and &lt;sup&gt;173&lt;/sup&gt;Os as a reference. During the experiment, 5 hassium atoms were synthesized using the reaction &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg,5n)&lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs. They were then thermalized and oxidized in a mixture of [[helium]] and [[oxygen]] gas to form the tetroxide.

:&lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;HsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The measured [[deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] temperature indicated that hassium(VIII) oxide is less volatile than osmium tetroxide, OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and places hassium firmly in group 8.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duellmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSI-Hs"/&gt; However, the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; measured, {{val|−46|2|u=[[kilojoule per mole|kJ/mol]]}}, was significantly lower than what was predicted, {{val|−36.7|1.5|u=kJ/mol}}, indicating that OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was more volatile than HsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, contradicting earlier calculations, which implied that they should have very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is {{val|−39|1|u=kJ/mol}}.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals ([[silicon nitride]] and [[silicon dioxide]]) used for the detector; further research is required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs and comparisons with RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in addition to OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

In 2004 scientists reacted hassium tetroxide and sodium hydroxide to form sodium hassate(VIII), a reaction well known with osmium. This was the first acid-base reaction with a hassium compound, forming sodium hassate(VIII):&lt;ref name="CALLISTO"&gt;[http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2003/files/172.pdf CALLISTO result] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528125643/http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2003/files/172.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{chem|HsO|4}} + 2 [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] → {{chem|Na|2|[HsO|4|(OH)|2|]}}

The team from the [[University of Mainz]] were planning to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,4n)&lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-win.gsi.de/tasca08/contributions/TASCA08_Cont_Kratz.pdf Electrodeposition experiments with hassium] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034301/http://www-win.gsi.de/tasca08/contributions/TASCA08_Cont_Kratz.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}, J. Even et al., TASCA 08, 7th Workshop Recoil Separator for Superheavy Element Chemistry October 31, 2008, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs([[Cyclopentadienyl|C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, using the reaction &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,xn). This compound is analogous to the lighter [[ferrocene]], [[ruthenocene]], and [[osmocene]], and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an [[eclipsed conformation]] like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a [[staggered conformation]] like ferrocene.&lt;ref name="hassocene"/&gt; Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in [[metallocene]]s) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state.&lt;ref name="hassocene"/&gt; Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.&lt;ref name="hassocene"/&gt;

'''Hoop rolling''', also called '''hoop trundling''', is both a sport and a [[child's game]] in which a large [[hoop (rhythmic gymnastics)|hoop]] is [[rolling|rolled]] along the ground, generally by means of an object wielded by the player. The aim of the game is to keep the hoop upright for long periods of time, or to do various [[juggling trick|tricks]].

Hoop rolling has been documented since antiquity in Africa, Asia and Europe. Played as a [[target practice|target game]], it is an ancient tradition widely dispersed among different societies. In Asia, the earliest records date from Ancient China, and in Europe from Ancient Greece.

In the West, the most common materials for the equipment have been wood and metal. Wooden hoops, driven with a stick about one foot long, are struck with the centre or the 2/3 point of the stick in order to ensure good progress. Metal hoops, instead of being struck, are often guided by a metal hook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boy's Treasury of Sports, Pastimes, and Recreations: With Nearly Four Hundred Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvQ-AAAAYAAJ|year=1848|publisher=J.P. Hill|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A version of hoop rolling played as a target game is encountered as an ancient tradition among aboriginal peoples in many parts of the world. The game, known as hoop-and-pole, is ubiquitous throughout most of Africa. It is also found on other continents. In America, where it has been played by a great number of unrelated tribes and is known in English as hoop-and-stick or hoop-and-dart, the game has exhibited many variations of materials and size of implements and rules of play.&lt;ref name="Andrew McFarland Davis p44-56"&gt;Andrew McFarland Davis [https://archive.org/details/indiangamesanhis06857gut ''Indian Games'']. pp. 44–56. {{ISBN|1595406042}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is postulated that its wide distribution is a factor of the rich symbolical possibilities of the game, rather than indicating radial diffusion from a single center of invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00020185308706913|title=The rolling target (hoop‐and‐pole) game in Africa|journal=African Studies|volume=12|issue=3|pages=104|year=1953|author=O.

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Eromenos hoop Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2674 n2.jpg|thumb|left|A Greek youth depicted playing with a hoop]]
The Greeks referred to the hoop as the ''trochus''. Hoop rolling was practised in the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], and the prop was also used for tumbling and dance with different techniques.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith (1859) [https://archive.org/details/adictionarygree05smitgoog A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities]. Little, Brown, and Co. p. 1020&lt;/ref&gt; Although a popular form of recreation, hoop rolling was not featured in competition at the [[Panhellenic Games|major sports festivals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason König|title=Athletics and Literature in the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WypKKCGev2wC|date=21 April 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83845-0|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoops, also called ''krikoi,'' were probably made of bronze, iron, or copper, and were driven with a stick called the ''elater''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M Plummer (1856) [https://archive.org/details/athleticsgamesof0203plum ''Athletics and Games of the Ancient Greeks'']. Cambridge, Mass., Lombard &amp; Caustic, Printers. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The hoop was sized according to the player, as it had to come up to the level of the chest. Greek vases generally show the elater as a short, straight stick. The sport was regarded as healthful, and was recommended by [[Hippocrates]] for strengthening weak constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Hippocrates recommended playing with a hoop as a cure for weak people" {{cite book|author=Mary Mathews Gedo|title=Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Art: PPA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbDpAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Analytic Press|isbn=978-0-88163-030-5|volume =1|page =97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even very young children would play with hoops.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Augustus St. John]] (1878) [https://archive.org/details/mannerscustomsof01wilk ''The history of the manners and customs of ancient Greece'']. Volume 1. London, J. Murray. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoop thus held symbolic meanings in Greek myth and culture. A bronze hoop was one of the toys of the infant [[Dionysus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Legge]] (1915) [https://archive.org/details/forerunnersandri008464mbp ''Forerunners and Rivals of Christianity: Being Studies in Religious History from 330 B.C. to 330 A.D.'']. The University Press. p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; and hoop driving is an attribute of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], often depicted on [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] vase paintings from the 5th century BCE. Images of the hoop are sometimes presented in the context of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederastic tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigel Spivey|authorlink=Nigel Spivey|title=The Ancient Olympics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgkzWTugSj0C|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280604-8|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome and Byzantium===
[[File:Child playing with hoops mosaic.jpg|right|thumb|A boy playing with hoops, depicted in the 6th-century CE mosaics of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]]]]
The Romans learned hoop driving from the Greeks and generally held the sport in high regard.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Groos]] (1901) "Playful Use of the Motor Apparatus." Chapter 2 in ''The Play of Man'', translated by Elizabeth L. Baldwin. New York: Appleton: [https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Groos/Groos_1901/chapter2.html pp. 74–121]. "Other rolling toys, such as wheels and hoops, whose motion is kept up by means of continuous striking, offer a very different kind of amusement. The violent running, combining as it does something of the zest of the chase with the pleasure of overcoming a difficulty, forms a delightful compound with the enjoyment of the rolling as such. The Greeks called the hoop trocoVor krikoV. They were rather large, and made of metal studded with tinkling bells and propelled by a metal rod. Ganymede is often represented with such a hoop. The Romans had an extraordinary fondness for this sport, and Ovid, who refers to a teacher of the art of hoop rolling, says in one of his enumerations of the spring games "Usus equi nunc est, levibus nunc luditur armis, Nunc pila, nunc celeri volvitur orbe trochus." Fouquières cites a passage from Martial about youths rolling hoops on frozen streams.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] term for hoop is also ''trochus,'' at times referred to as the "Greek hoop." The stick was known as a ''clavis'' &lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Dudley Fosbroke]] (1843) [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofan02fosb ''Encyclopædia of antiquities: and elements of archaeology ...'']. Vol. 2. N3. London : M. A. Nattali. p. 619&lt;/ref&gt; or ''radius,'' had the shape of a key, and was made of metal with a wooden handle. Roman hoops were fitted with metal rings that slid freely along the rim. According to [[Martial]], this was done so that the tinkling of the rings would warn passers by of the hoop's approach: "Why do these jingling rings move about upon the rolling wheel? In order that the passers-by may get out of the way of the hoop."(14. CLXIX) He also indicates that the metal tires of wooden cart wheels could be used as hoops: "A wheel must be protected. You make me a useful present. It will be a hoop to children, but to me a tyre for my wheel."(14. CLXVIII)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]], pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt; Martial also mentions the sport was practised by [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] boys, who rolled their hoops on the frozen [[Danube]] river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Dalby|title=Empire of Pleasures: Luxury and Indulgence in the Roman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXAq6YkI5XgC|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28073-0|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]], one of the popular Roman venues for practising the sport was the [[Campus Martius]], which was large enough to accommodate a wide variety of activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gempf, Conrad|title=The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-L1DA1ptKQC|date=1 May 1994|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4847-5|page=458, note 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman game was to roll the hoop while throwing a spear or stick through it. For Romans, this was more an entertainment and military development, not a philosophical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sociology of Sports: An Introduction | author=Tim Delaney, Tim Madigan | publisher = McFarland |year = 2009| page = 43| isbn=978-0-7864-4169-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ancient sources praise the sport. According to [[Horace]], hoop driving was one of the manly sports.&lt;ref name=p139&gt;William Pulleyn (1830) [https://archive.org/details/etymologicalcom00pullgoog The etymological compendium, or, Portfolio of origins and inventions]. T. Tegg. p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] in his [[Tristia]] is more specific, putting the sport in the same category with horsemanship, javelin throwing and weapon practice: ''Usus equi nunc est, levibus nunc luditur armis, Nunc pila, nunc celeri volvitur orbe trochus.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; It was also presented as a virtue in the [[Distichs of Cato]], which enjoin youth to ''Trocho lude; aleam fuge'' – "Play with the hoop, flee the dice."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]], p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; A 2nd-century CE medical text by [[Antyllus]], preserved in an anthology of [[Oribasius]], [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]]'s physician, describes hoop rolling as a form of physical and mental therapy. Antyllus indicates that at first the player should roll the hoop maintaining an upright posture, but after warming up he can begin to jump and run through the hoop. Such exercises, he holds, are best done before a meal or a bath, as with any physical exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]], pp. 133 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 19th-century travellers saw children playing with hoops over much of Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[[François-René de Chateaubriand]] (1838) [https://archive.org/details/voyageenamriq00chat ''Voyage en Amérique''].

The game was also a common pastime of African village children on the [[Tanganyika]] plateau,&lt;ref&gt;Cullen Gouldsbury (1911) [https://archive.org/details/greatplateauofno00go The Great Plateau of Northern Rhodesia, Being Some Impressions of the ...]. E. Arnold. p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; and not long after it is recorded in the [[Freetown]] settler community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Benjamin Ageh Wellesley Cole]] (1960) ''Kossoh Town Boy''. University Press. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the game may well go back to 1000 BCE or further.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Corfield (2009) "Ancient China" in ''Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society'' By Rodney P. Carlisle; p. 24. {{ISBN|1412966701}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionaries encountered it there in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"They also delight in rolling the hoop", p. 69 in ''The Gospel in all lands''. &lt;/ref&gt; Children in late [[Edo period]] Japan also were known to play the game.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Rutherford Alcock (1863) [https://archive.org/details/capitaloftycoonn01alcoiala ''The capital of the tycoon: a narrative of a three years' residence in Japan'']. New York: Bradley Co. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

In English the sport is known by several names, ''hoop and stick,'' ''bowling hoops,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bowling hoops|author=Layne Cameron|date=June 1994|journal=Child Life|volume=73|issue =4|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''gird and cleek'' in [[Scotland]], where the gird is the hoop and the cleek, the stick.

In the west, around the end of the 19th century, the game was played by boys up to about twelve years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cassellscomplet00longoog ''Cassell's complete book of sports and pastimes''] (1896). Cassell. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoops would at times have pairs of tin squares nailed to the inside of the circle, to jingle as the hoop was rolled.&lt;ref name=c28&gt;William Clarke (1829) [https://archive.org/details/boysownbookacom01clargoog ''The boy's own book: a complete encyclopedia of all the diversions athletic'']. Vizetelly, Branston and Co. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Up to a dozen such pairs of rattles might be placed around the rim of the hoop. Some preferred the ashen hoops, round on the outside and flat on the inside, to the ones made of iron, as the latter could break windows and hurt the legs of the passers by and horses.

===Games===
Among the games played with the hoops—besides simply trundling them, which is a matter of driving them forward while keeping them upright—are hoop races, as well as games of dexterity. Among these are "toll," in which the player has to drive his hoop between two stones placed two to three inches apart without touching either one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Kemp Philp]] (1856) ''The Corner cupboard, by the ed. of "[[Enquire Within Upon Everything]]"''. p. 56; 1858&lt;/ref&gt; Another such game is "turnpike", in which one player drives the hoop between pairs of objects, such as bricks, at first placed so that the opening is about a foot wide, with each gate kept by a different player. After running all the gates, the openings are made smaller by one inch, and the player trundling the hoop runs the course again. The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places.

Conflict games such as "hoop battle" or "tournament" can also be played. For this game, boys organise into opposing teams that drive their hoops against each other with the aim of knocking down as many of the opponents' hoops as possible. Only those hoops which fall as a result of a strike by another hoop are counted out.&lt;ref&gt;John Kendrick (1852) ''Every boy's book of games, sports, and diversions, or The school-boy's manual of amusement, instruction and health''. London: Grieves. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of England, boys played a similar game called "encounters," where two boys would drive their hoops against each other, with the one whose hoop was left standing being declared the winner.&lt;ref name=c28/&gt;

The "hoop hunt" is yet another game, in which one or more hoops are allowed to roll down a hill, with the double aim of rolling as far as possible and then of locating the hoop wherever it may have ended up.&lt;ref&gt;William Chambers, Robert Chambers (1864) ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|Chamber's Journal of Popular Literature, Science, and Arts]]''. p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Empire===
In England, children are known to have played the game as early as the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pictorial History of England'' vol. 2,  by [[George Lillie Craik]], [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], [[Charles MacFarlane]], [[Harriet Martineau]]; p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, boys driving hoops in the London streets had become a nuisance, according to [[Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)|Joseph Strutt]].&lt;ref name=p139/&gt; Throughout the 1840s, a barrage of denunciations appeared in the papers against "The Hoop Nuisance," in which their iron hoops were blamed for inflicting severe injuries to pedestrians' shins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Jackson|title=A Dictionary of Victorian London: An A-Z of the Great Metropolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEswrOisKB0C|date=1 August 2006|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-711-3|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London police attempted to eradicate the practice, confiscating the iron hoops of boys and girls trundling them through the streets and parks. That campaign, however, seems to have failed, as it was accompanied by renewed complaints about the increase of the nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Goodway|authorlink=David Goodway|title=London Chartism 1838–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1BOgOAJLoIC|date=10 October 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89364-0|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers mocked the complainers as grumblers depriving the "juvenile community" of a healthy and harmless pastime that had been practised for hundreds of years "without any apparent inconvenience to the public at large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Englishman's Privilege|journal=Chambers's Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YRTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|year=1844|page=353|volume=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The passion for passing laws was ridiculed: "Enact, say our modern philosophers, enact.

Rivington|page=200|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, the anti-trundling campaign was taken up by [[Charles Babbage]], who blamed the boys for driving iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Babbage]] (1864) [https://archive.org/details/passagesfromlif01babbgoog Passages from the life of a philosopher]. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press; Piscataway, N.J. : IEEE Press. p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for "commencing a crusade against the popular game of [[tip-cat]] and the trundling of hoops."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard's parliamentary debates.

The fuss over boys playing with hoops reached halfway around the globe. In the [[Colony of Tasmania]], boys trundling hoops were blamed for endangering horsemen and rending ladies' dresses, and the [[Hobart]] paper called for their banishment to the suburbs, bye-laws, and police attention.&lt;ref&gt;"The Hoop Nuisance-The practice pursued by boys in trundling their hoops on the streets and footpaths has become a dangerous nuisance. The other day a gentleman was riding a rather spirited horse in Macquarie-street when
a careless urchin drove his hoop against the animal's legs, when it instantly reared and plunged, and would have thrown its rider had not his good horsemanship enabled him to keep his seat, and, eventually, to quiet the frightened horse. On another occasion an elderly lady was crossing Davey-street, where three boys were vigorously racing with their hoops, one of which came in contact with the lady's silk dress, and damaged it by a considerable rent. We are not averse to boyish games or amusements, and as there are numerous quiet localities in the suburbs, but little frequented by passengers, either on horse or foot, the boys ought to be compelled to quiet the public thoroughfares, and to resort to places where no injury could arise from the pursuit of their pastimes. The Corporation could effect this by a bye-law, and tin Police ought to receive strict directions rigidly to enforce it." ''The Hobart Town Daily Mercury''. 18 August 1858.

Not only schoolboys, but even graduate students at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] enjoyed trundling hoops after their lectures. The practice, however, was brought to an end sometime before 1816, by means of a statute that forbade Masters of Arts to roll hoops or play marbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139566100.010|title=Essay on Triposes|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=13|pages=83|year=2013|isbn=9781139566100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 19th century, the game was already part of the standard physical education of girls, together with [[jumping rope]] and [[dumbbells]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] (1858) ''[[New American Cyclopedia]]'', Vol. 8.

===America===
A great number of widely separated Native American peoples play or played an ancient target-shooting version of hoop rolling currently known as [[chunkey]]. Though the forms of the game exhibited great variation, generally certain elements were present, namely a prepared terrain over which a disc or hoop was rolled at high speed, at which implements similar to spears were thrown.&lt;ref name="Andrew McFarland Davis p44-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynette Perry|author2=Manny Skolnick|title=Keeper of the Delaware Dolls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2Z1AAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-8759-4|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game, when played by adults, was often associated with gambling; and quite often, very valuable prizes, such as horses, exchanged hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Augustus Murray]] (1839) [https://archive.org/details/travelsinnortham01murr Travels in North America: including a summer residence with the ...] Vol. 2.

Among the European settlers, hoop-rolling was a seasonal sport, seeing the greatest activity in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;''American education'' (1910), Vols. 14–15.

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports.

* On January 14, a fire broke out at an oil pipeline pump station, in [[Texas City, Texas]]. Texas City fire officials said that company officials reported that there had been issues with the pump station over the weekend. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.galvnews.com/news/free/article_699f91e8-9c22-11e4-97c3-63576ec5ef16.html|title=Pipeline fire shuts down FM 2004 in Texas City|first=T.J.

* On January 14, during work to free a trapped inline inspection unit, a leak was discovered on the Evangeline Pipeline, near [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana]]. This pipeline had been given a Corrective Action Order in October 2014, due to a number of leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/resources/news/2015/01/14/9853014/us-evangeline-pipeline-shuts-down-after-leak-discovered/ |title=US Evangeline Pipeline shuts down after leak discovered |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702011745/http://www.icis.com/resources/news/2015/01/14/9853014/us-evangeline-pipeline-shuts-down-after-leak-discovered/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argusmedia.com/News/Article?id=976846 |title=News – Argus Media |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516143633/http://www.argusmedia.com/News/Article?id=976846 |archivedate=May 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No.: 4-2014-5027H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420145027H/420145027H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_10202014_text.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209132956/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420145027H/420145027H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_10202014_text.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also on January 14, a gas pipeline exploded near the [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]] in [[Brandon, Mississippi]], creating a sizable crater in the ground and burning 6 acres of vegetation before the fire was extinguished. No injuries were reported. The failure was due to a "hard spot" from manufacturing, that already had a repair sleeve on it. There are 788 sleeves on the Index 129 pipeline from Edna, Texas, to Sterlington, Louisiana; and, 726 sleeves on the Index 130 pipeline from Marchand Junction, Louisiana to Kosciusko, Mississippi. Both were built from pipe made in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wapt.com/news/central-mississippi/gas-line-explodes-burns-at-reservoir/30695664 |title=Gas line explodes, burns near reservoir |date=January 14, 2015 |publisher=[[WAPT]] News |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218044130/http://www.wapt.com/news/central-mississippi/gas-line-explodes-burns-at-reservoir/30695664 |archivedate=February 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/01/14/reservoir-explosion/21740325/|title=Reservoir gas pipeline fire extinguished|date=January 14, 2015|publisher=[[The Clarion-Ledger]]|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF 2-2015-1001S |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220151001S/220151001S_nopso_03272015_text.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211115940/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220151001S/220151001S_nopso_03272015_text.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 16, a transmission pipeline operated by [[Kinder Morgan]] subsidiary [[Southern Natural Gas]] had an equipment malfunction in [[Walthall County, Mississippi]]. The cause was cold weather; ice build-up caused a regulator to malfunction.&lt;ref name="primis"&gt;Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration operator data, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603005753/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/ |date=June 3, 2017 }}, Retrieved April 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 17, oil from a broken pipeline seeped into the [[Yellowstone River]], and contaminated the water supply 10 miles south of Glendive, Montana. The release was from Bridger Pipeline LLC's 12-inch Poplar line, which can carry 42,000 barrels a day of crude from the [[Bakken Formation]] and runs from Canada south to Baker, Montana. Bridger Pipeline is a subsidiary of True Cos., a privately held Wyoming-based company. The company said in a statement that the pipeline was shut down within an hour of the leak. About 30,000 gallons of crude were spilled, with about 28,000 gallons of crude being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sider |first1=Alison |title=Oil Spill Contaminates Montana Town's Water Supply, EPA Says |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-spills-into-yellowstone-river-after-pipeline-leak-1421688172 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206043411/https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-spills-into-yellowstone-river-after-pipeline-leak-1421688172 |archivedate=February 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inforum.com/news/accidents/3661267-clean-water-likely-be-restored-glendive-thursday-after-oil-spill-along |title=Clean water likely to be restored to Glendive on Thursday after oil spill along Yellowstone |author=Tom Lutey |work=INFORUM |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128204750/http://www.inforum.com/news/accidents/3661267-clean-water-likely-be-restored-glendive-thursday-after-oil-spill-along |archivedate=January 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_31878.html?nocache=4750#_Incidents_tab_3 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications – Operator Information |author= |date= |work=dot.gov |accessdate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308070842/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_31878.html?nocache=4750 |archivedate=March 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 21, a petroleum products pipeline in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] ruptured, due to external corrosion, spilling about 42,000 gallons of petroleum product, of which about 22,000 gallons was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_31056.html?nocache=5782#_Incidents_tab_3 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications – Operator Information |author= |date= |work=dot.gov |accessdate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308054320/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_31056.html?nocache=5782 |archivedate=March 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 21, a crude oil pipeline pump station caught fire northwest of [[Texas City, Texas]]. Texas City fire officials said that company officials reported that there had been issues with the pump station over the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galvestondailynews.com/free/article_699f91e8-9c22-11e4-97c3-63576ec5ef16.html|title=Pipeline fire shuts down FM 2004 in Texas City|work=The Galveston County Daily News|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 26, a 20-inch [[Enterprise Products]] ATEX pipeline carrying ethane exploded and burned, in [[Brooke County, West Virginia]]. Despite snow in the area, five acres of woodlands burned, and 1,283,000 gallons of ethane were consumed, or lost. The fireball melted siding on nearby homes and damaged power lines; it is believed that day’s snowy weather lessened the damage. Reports suspect a girth weld failure from ductile tensile overload, with the pipeline being less than two years old. Survey showed that the pipeline had slumped three feet since being built. A geotechnical survey conducted by Pennsylvania Soil and Rock determined that the failed pipe was installed across a transition area or “head wall” of an old underground mine and surface strip mine. There were no injuries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_31618.html?nocache=6119#_Incidents_tab_5 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications - Operator Information |work=dot.gov |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227132036/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_31618.html?nocache=6119 |archivedate=December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theintelligencer.net/page/content.detail/id/623827/Fire-Burned-24-000-Barrels-of-Ethane.html?nav=515 |title=24,000 Ethane Barrels Burned |work=The Intelligencer |accessdate=September 16, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055110/http://www.theintelligencer.net/page/content.detail/id/623827/Fire-Burned-24-000-Barrels-of-Ethane.html?nav=515 |archivedate=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cms.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/inspections-and-investigations/17866/149469enterpriseproductsoperatingllcfir2015126reportandappendices.pdf |title=Report |website=cms.phmsa.dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 29, near [[Bowling Green, Missouri]], a rupture in a Rockies Express 42-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline blew a 20 by 20-foot crater and forced a six-hour evacuation of 50 families. The rupture occurred in a vacant field a few yards east of Pike County Road 43. Strong winds dissipated gas until a temporary cap was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pipeline Ruptures Near Pike 43 {{!}} The People's Tribune|url=http://thepeoplestribune.com/?p=25397|website=thepeoplestribune.com|accessdate=28 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206054424/http://thepeoplestribune.com/?p=25397|archivedate=February 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explosion did $2,672,345 in property damage and was caused by a faulty weld; the pipe was manufactured in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Operator Information, Pipeline &amp; Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030030518/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/ |date=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 10 in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]], low temperatures caused freezing rain to do "natural force damage" to a [[Kinder Morgan]] Tennessee Gas Pipeline, causing $55,150 worth of property damage.&lt;ref name="primis"/&gt;
* On February 17, a suspected electrical arc made a hole in a [[Marathon Petroleum]] pipeline in [[Shively, Kentucky]], spilling about 6,700 gallons of jet fuel.

'''''Louisiana Story''''' ([[1948 in film|1948]]) is a 78-minute black-and-white American film. Although the events and characters depicted are fictional and the film was commissioned by the [[Standard Oil Company]] to promote its drilling ventures in the Louisiana bayoux, it is often misidentified as a [[documentary film]], when in fact, it is a [[docufiction]]. The script was written by [[Frances H. Flaherty]] and [[Robert J. Flaherty]], directed by Robert J. Flaherty.  

==Plot==
The film deals with the adventures of a young [[Cajun]] boy and his pet [[raccoon]], who live a somewhat idyllic existence playing in the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]]. A sub-plot involves his elderly father's allowing an oil company to drill for oil in the inlet that runs behind their house. A completely assembled miniature [[Oil platform|oil rig]] on a slender barge is towed into the inlet from connecting narrow waterways. Although there is a moment of crisis when the rig strikes a gas pocket, most of this is dealt with swiftly and off-camera, and the barge, rig, and friendly drillers depart expeditiously, leaving behind a phenomenally clean environment and a wealthy Cajun family.

Conflict and action for the plot is provided by the presence of a giant [[alligator]] in the area, which is believed to have eaten the pet [[raccoon]] and which is hunted in revenge. There is no individual or organized resistance to the incursion of the oil seekers, even after the (brief, offscreen) disaster, who are unequivocally portrayed as friendly, progressive humanitarians.

The boy, named in the film as Alexander Napoleon Ulysses Le Tour but in the credits just identified as "the boy", was played by [[Joseph Boudreaux]]. The film was photographed by [[Richard Leacock]] and edited by [[Helen van Dongen]], who were also the associate producers. Original release was through independent film distributor [[Lopert Films]].

==Production==
The film was shot on location in the Louisiana bayou country,&lt;ref name="Inc1949"&gt;{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hk4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|date=2 May 1949|publisher=Time Inc|page=137|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; using local residents for actors. However, none of the members of the Cajun family (boy, father and mother) were actually related, and the film does not deal with Cajun culture, the reality of the hard lives of the Cajun people, or with the mechanics of drilling for oil. The story itself is completely fictional.

In 1952, it was reissued by an [[exploitation film]] outfit with a new title, ''Cajun'', on the bottom-half of a double-bill with another film called ''Watusi''.&lt;ref name="Calder-MarshallRotha1963"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calder-Marshall|first1=Arthur|last2=Rotha|first2=Paul|last3=Wright|first3=Basil|title=The Innocent Eye: The Life of Robert J. Flaherty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1M5ZAAAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and awards==
The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Motion Picture Story]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="Gevinson1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevinson|first=Alan|title=Within Our Gates: Ethnicity in American Feature Films, 1911-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsoUXGZSxZcC&amp;pg=PA614|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20964-0|page=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Virgil Thomson]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] for his score to the film (which is based on a famous field tape of indigenous Cajun musicians and was performed by the Philadelphia Symphony). Through 2016, this has remained the only Pulitzer Prize awarded for a film score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLane |first=Barbara A. |title=A New History of Documentary Film: Second Edition |page=68 |date=2012 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1441124579 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt0Wwjs4zyYC&amp;pg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;[[Pulitzer Prize for Music |Wikipedia list of Pulitzer Prizes for Music]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, ''Louisiana Story'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The movie was also in the top 10 of the first British Film Institute's Sight and Sound poll in 1952.


The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9647">A flavor of the [[k·p perturbation theory|'''k·p''' perturbation theory]] used for calculating the structure of multiple, degenerate electronic bands in bulk and [[quantum well]] [[semiconductors]]. The method is a generalization of the single band '''k[[k·p perturbation theory|·]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;p''' theory.

In this model the influence of all other bands is taken into account by using [[Per-Olov Löwdin|Löwdin]]'s perturbation method.&lt;ref name=Chuang1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

All bands can be subdivided into two classes:

* '''Class A''': six valence bands (heavy hole, light hole, split off band and their spin counterparts) and two conduction bands.
* '''Class B''': all other bands.

The method concentrates on the bands in ''Class A'', and takes into account ''Class B'' bands perturbatively.

We can write the perturbed solution &lt;math&gt;\phi^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of the unperturbed eigenstates &lt;math&gt;\phi^{(0)}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \sum^{A,B}_{n} a_{n} \phi^{(0)}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the unperturbed eigenstates are orthonormalized, the eigenequation are:

:&lt;math&gt;(E-H_{mm})a_m = \sum^{A}_{n\neq m}H_{mn}a_{n} + \sum^{B}_{\alpha \neq m}H_{m\alpha}a_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;,

where

:&lt;math&gt;H_{mn} = \int \phi^{(0)\dagger}_{m} H  \phi^{(0)}_{n}d^3 \mathbf{r} = E^{(0)}_{n}\delta_{mn}+H^{'}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;.

From this expression we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{m} = \sum^{A}_{n\neq m} \frac{H_{mn}}{E-H_{mm}} a_{n} + \sum^{B}_{\alpha\neq m} \frac{H_{m\alpha}}{E-H_{mm}} a_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;,

where the first sum on the right-hand side is over the states in class A only, while the second sum is over the states on class B. Since we are interested in the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_{m}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m'' in class A, we may eliminate those in class B by an iteration procedure to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{m} = \sum^{A}_{n\neq m} \frac{U^{A}_{mn} - H_{mn}}{E-H_{mm}} a_{n} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;U^{A}_{mn} = H_{mn} + \sum^{B}_{\alpha\neq m} \frac{H_{m\alpha}H_{\alpha n}}{E-H_{\alpha\alpha}} + \sum_{\alpha,\beta\neq m,n;\alpha\neq\beta} \frac{H_{m \alpha} H_{\alpha\beta}H_{\beta n} }{(E-H_{\alpha\alpha})(E-H_{\beta\beta})} + \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, for &lt;math&gt; a_{n} &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; n \in A &lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n} = \sum^{A}_{n} (U^{A}_{mn} - E\delta_{mn})a_{n} = 0,   m \in A &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; a_{\gamma} = \sum^{A}_{n} \frac{ U^{A}_{\gamma n} - H_{\gamma n}\delta_{\gamma n}}{E-H_{\gamma\gamma}} a_{n} = 0,   \gamma \in B &lt;/math&gt;.

When the coefficients  &lt;math&gt; a_{n} &lt;/math&gt; belonging to Class A are determined so are &lt;math&gt; a_{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Schrödinger equation and basis functions ==

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] including the spin-orbit interaction can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; H = H_0 + \frac{\hbar}{4m_{0}^{2}c^{2}}\bar{\sigma}\cdot\nabla V \times \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \bar{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Pauli spin matrix]] vector. Substituting into the [[Schrödinger equation]] we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; H u_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) = \left( H_0 + \frac{\hbar}{m_{0}}\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{\Pi} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{4m_{0}^{2}c^{2}} \nabla V \times \mathbf{p} \cdot \bar{\sigma} \right) u_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) = E_{n}(\mathbf{k}) u_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;,

where

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\Pi} = \mathbf{p} + \frac{\hbar}{4m_{0}^{2}c^{2}}\bar{\sigma} \times \nabla V &lt;/math&gt;

and the perturbation Hamiltonian can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;  H' = \frac{\hbar}{m_0}\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{\Pi}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The unperturbed Hamiltonian refers to the band-edge spin-orbit system (for ''k''=0). At the band edge, conduction band [[Bloch waves]] exhibit s-like symmetry, while valence band states are p-like (3-fold degenerate without spin). Let us denote these states as &lt;math&gt; |S \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; |X \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; |Y \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; |Z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; respectively. These Bloch functions can be pictured as periodic repetition of atomic orbitals, repeated at intervals corresponding to the lattice spacing. The Bloch function can be expanded in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt; u_{n \mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) = \sum^{A}_{j'} a_{j'}(\mathbf{k}) u_{j'0}(\mathbf{r}) + \sum^{B}_{\gamma} a_{\gamma}(\mathbf{k}) u_{\gamma 0}(\mathbf{r})  &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''j' '' is in Class A and &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is in Class B. The basis functions can be chosen to be

:&lt;math&gt;  u_{10}(\mathbf{r}) = u_{el}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | S\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right \rangle = \left|S\uparrow\right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{20}(\mathbf{r}) = u_{SO}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} |(X+iY)\downarrow\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} |Z\uparrow\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{30}(\mathbf{r}) = u_{lh}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | \frac{3}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt 6} |(X+iY)\downarrow\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} |Z\uparrow\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{40}(\mathbf{r}) = u_{hh}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | \frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{2} \right \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|(X+iY)\uparrow\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{50}(\mathbf{r}) = \bar{u}_{el}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | S\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2} \right \rangle  = -|S\downarrow\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{60}(\mathbf{r}) = \bar{u}_{SO}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | \frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2} \right \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} |(X-iY)\uparrow\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} |Z\downarrow\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{70}(\mathbf{r}) = \bar{u}_{lh}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | \frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{2} \right \rangle  = \frac{1}{\sqrt 6} |(X-iY)\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} |Z\downarrow\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  u_{80}(\mathbf{r}) = \bar{u}_{hh}(\mathbf{r}) = \left | \frac{3}{2},-\frac{3}{2} \right \rangle =  -\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|(X-iY)\downarrow\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;.

Using Löwdin's method, only the following eigenvalue problem needs to be solved

:&lt;math&gt; \sum^{A}_{j'} (U^{A}_{jj'}-E\delta_{jj'})a_{j'}(\mathbf{k}) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; U^{A}_{jj'} = H_{jj'} +  \sum^{B}_{\gamma \neq j,j'} \frac{H_{j\gamma}H_{\gamma j'}}{E_0-E_{\gamma}} =  H_{jj'} +  \sum^{B}_{\gamma \neq j,j'} \frac{H^{'}_{j\gamma}H^{'}_{\gamma j'}}{E_0-E_{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; H^{'}_{j\gamma} = \left \langle u_{j0} \right | \frac{\hbar}{m_0} \mathbf{k} \cdot \left ( \mathbf{p} + \frac{\hbar}{4 m_0 c^2} \bar{\sigma} \times \nabla V \right ) \left | u_{\gamma 0} \right \rangle \approx \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\hbar k_{\alpha}}{m_0}p^{\alpha}_{j \gamma}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The second term of '''&lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt;''' can be neglected compared to the similar term with '''p''' instead of '''k'''. Similarly to the single band case, we can write for &lt;math&gt; U^{A}_{jj'} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D_{jj'} \equiv U^{A}_{jj'} = E_{j}(0)\delta_{jj'} + \sum_{\alpha\beta} D^{\alpha\beta}_{jj'}k_{\alpha}k_{\beta}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D^{\alpha\beta}_{jj'} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_0} \left [ \delta_{jj'}\delta_{\alpha\beta} + \sum^{B}_{\gamma} \frac{ p^{\alpha}_{j\gamma}p^{\beta}_{\gamma j'} + p^{\beta}_{j\gamma}p^{\alpha}_{\gamma j'} }{ m_0 (E_0-E_{\gamma}) } \right ].  &lt;/math&gt;

We now define the following parameters

:&lt;math&gt;  A_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_0} + \frac{\hbar^2}{m_0^2} \sum^{B}_{\gamma} \frac{ p^{x}_{x\gamma}p^{x}_{\gamma x} }{ E_0-E_{\gamma} },  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  B_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_0} + \frac{\hbar^2}{m_0^2} \sum^{B}_{\gamma} \frac{ p^{y}_{x\gamma}p^{y}_{\gamma x} }{ E_0-E_{\gamma} },  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  C_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{m_0^2} \sum^{B}_{\gamma} \frac{ p^{x}_{x\gamma}p^{y}_{\gamma y} + p^{y}_{x\gamma}p^{x}_{\gamma y} }{ E_0-E_{\gamma} },  &lt;/math&gt;

and the band structure parameters (or the '''[[Luttinger parameter]]s''') can be defined to be

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_1 = - \frac{1}{3} \frac{2 m_0}{\hbar^2} (A_0 + 2B_0),  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_2 = - \frac{1}{6} \frac{2 m_0}{\hbar^2} (A_0 - B_0),  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_3 = - \frac{1}{6} \frac{2 m_0}{\hbar^2} C_0,  &lt;/math&gt;

These parameters are very closely related to the effective masses of the holes in various valence bands. &lt;math&gt; \gamma_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \gamma_2 &lt;/math&gt; describe the coupling of the &lt;math&gt; |X \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; |Y \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; |Z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; states to the other states. The third parameter &lt;math&gt; \gamma_3 &lt;/math&gt; relates to the anisotropy of the energy band structure around the &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; point when &lt;math&gt; \gamma_2 \neq \gamma_3 &lt;/math&gt;.

== Explicit Hamiltonian matrix ==

The Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{D_{jj'}} &lt;/math&gt; can be written explicitly as a 8X8 matrix (taking into account 8 bands - 2 conduction, 2 heavy-holes, 2 light-holes and 2 split-off)

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H} = \left(  \begin{array}{cccccccc}

E_{el} &amp; P_z &amp; \sqrt{2}P_z &amp; -\sqrt{3}P_{+} &amp; 0 &amp; \sqrt{2}P_{-} &amp; P_{-} &amp; 0 \\

'''Magnesioferrite''' is a magnesium iron [[oxide]] mineral, a member of the [[magnetite]] series of [[spinel group|spinel]]s. 
Magnesioferrite crystallizes as black metallic [[octahedral]] crystals. It is named after its chemical composition of [[magnesium]] and ferric [[iron]].
The density is 4.6 - 4.7 (average = 4.65), and the diaphaniety is opaque. Occurs as well-formed fine sized crystals or massive and granular. 
Its hardness is  6-6.5. It has a metallic luster and a dark red streak.

==Occurrence==
It occurs in [[fumarole]]s, as a result of [[combustion metamorphism]] and [[Coal fire|coal seam fires]], in glass spherules related to [[meteorite impact]]s, and as accessory phase in [[kimberlite]]s and [[carbonatite]]s.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

It has been reported from [[Vesuvius]] and [[Stromboli]], [[Italy]].

The '''March 1969 nor'easter''' was an [[extratropical cyclone]] that moved into the Gulf of Mexico on March 5, moving through southern Georgia, then deepened as it moved along the lower Eastern Seaboard, before swinging wide of New England and Atlantic Canada.  Heavy snows fell across eastern Maryland, southern Delaware, and [[Martha's Vineyard]] in Massachusetts.   It was a strong system, with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of {{convert|80|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} a central pressure close to {{convert|950|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}} while south of Atlantic Canada.  The system then moved into the far northern Atlantic Ocean while splitting into two [[low pressure area]]s on March 10.

==Evolution==
Late on March 5, a frontal wave moved offshore Galveston, Texas.  The system moved along the Gulf coast on March 6.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mariners Weather Log|page=160|date=July 1969|volume=13|number=4|editor=Richard W. Schwerdt|publisher=Department of Commerce|title=Letter to the Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gale-force winds were confined to behind its prefrontal [[squall line]] on March 6.  The cyclone moved along the Florida-Georgia border with a central pressure down to {{convert|995.0|hPa|inHg}}.  The low tracked up the Eastern Seaboard from the late on the 6th through the morning of the 7th while strengthening quickly, with its central pressure falling to {{convert|969.0|hPa|inHg}}, then with storm-force winds offshore [[Cape Charles, Virginia]].  The cyclone tracked offshore New England.  By the morning of the 8th, the cyclone's center pressure had fallen to {{convert|950.0|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}} while the system developed maximum sustained winds of {{convert|80|kn|km/h}} south of Newfoundland.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; During the day, the cyclone absorbed a previously strong cyclone to its north near [[Anticosti Island]].  The system slowly weakened while moving slowly northeast offshore eastern Newfoundland on the 9th and 10th, losing hurricane-force winds on the 9th.  The system split into two distinct low pressure centers on 10th as it approached southern Greenland.&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mariners Weather Log|pages=181–182|date=July 1969|volume=13|number=4|editor=Richard W. Schwerdt|publisher=Department of Commerce|title=Rough Log, North Atlantic Weather March–May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The cyclone's pre-frontal squall line moved into western Florida between 4:30 and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on March 6.  Winds gusted to between {{convert|45|mph|km/h}} and {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} across Sarasota and Levy counties.  Tides rose to between {{convert|3|ft|m}} and {{convert|4|ft|m}} above normal.  Damage caused was between $50,000 and $500,000.  A heavy wet snow fell across the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the southern half of Delaware from late on March 6 into March 7, up to a depth of {{convert|7|in|cm}} in Maryland and {{convert|12.5|in|cm}} in [[Lewes, Delaware]].  At Martha's Vineyard, heavy snow and winds up to {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} created snow drifts exceeding {{convert|3|ft|m}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Storm Data|volume=11|number=3|date=March 1969|pages=20–21|publisher=Environmental Data Service|title=Delaware, Florida, Maryland, and Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Con Ed steam stack 7th Ave and 20th Street from north.jpg|thumb|250px|Steam vapor being vented through a typical [[Consolidated Edison|Con Edison]] orange and white [[smokestack|stack]] on [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] at [[22nd Street (Manhattan)|West 22nd Street]]. Steam vapor such as this can be caused by a leak in Con Ed's steam system &amp;ndash; which heats and cools buildings in [[Manhattan]] up to [[89th Street (Manhattan)|East 89th]] and [[96th Street (Manhattan)|West 96th Street]] &amp;ndash; or by cooler water contacting the outside of a steam pipe.&lt;ref name=conedsteam&gt;[http://www.coned.com/steam/kc_faqs.asp "Steam operations FAQ"] on the Con Edison website&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''New York City steam systems''' include [[Con Edison|Con Edison’s]] Steam Operations, and other smaller steam systems that provide steam to [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]]. Many individual buildings in New York have their own steam systems.

==Con Edison’s Steam Operations==

Con Edison’s Steam Operations is a [[district heating]] system which takes [[steam]] produced by steam generating stations and carries it under the streets of [[Manhattan]] to heat and cool high rise buildings and businesses. Some New York businesses and facilities also use the steam for cleaning and disinfection.

The '''New York Steam Company''' began providing service in [[lower Manhattan]] on March 3, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coned.com/history/steam.asp |title=A Brief History of Con Edison |publisher=Con Edison |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312062632/http://www.coned.com/history/steam.asp |archivedate=2006-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Consolidated Edison]] operates the largest commercial [[District heating|steam system]] in the world. It's bigger than the next nine put together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/nyregion/miles-of-steam-pipes-snake-beneath-new-york.html|title=Miles of Steam Pipes Snake Beneath New York|first=Greg|last=Moyer|date=9 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization within Con Edison that is responsible for the system's operation is known as '''Steam Operations''', providing steam service to over 1,700 customers and serving commercial and residential establishments in Manhattan from [[Battery Park]] to [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]] uptown on the West side and 89th Street on the East side of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coned.com/-/media/files/coned/documents/for-commercial-industries/steam/steamenergybrochure.pdf |title=Steam Energy |publisher=Con Edison |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly {{convert|24|e9lb|tonnes}} of steam flow through the system every year.&lt;ref name=conedsteam /&gt;

==Uses==
Steam provides heat and cooling to many buildings in New York.  The steam system provides humidity to art museums, steam cleaning for restaurants to clean dishes, and other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/nyregion/miles-of-steam-pipes-snake-beneath-new-york.html|title=Miles of Steam Pipes Snake Beneath New York|first=Greg|last=Moyer|date=9 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
Approximately 30% of the ConEd steam system’s installed capacity and 50% of the annual steam generated comes from cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coned.com/publicissues/PDF/Steam%20Long%20Range%20Plan%20Final%20December%202010.pdf "Con Edison Steam Long Range Plan 2010-2030"], p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cogeneration]] and Heat Recovery Steam Generation (HRSG) significantly increases the fuel efficiency of cogenerated electricity and thereby reduces the [[air pollution|emission of pollutants]], such as [[NOx]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], and particulate matter, and reduces the city's [[carbon footprint]]. Con Edison is promoting the use of steam for cooling in the summer months, something that can be accomplished with the installation of [[absorption chiller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coned.com/steam/PDF/May2_Seminar/HYBRID%20Cooling.pdf Benefits and Case Studies of Hybrid Cooling Using Steam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008014254/http://www.coned.com/steam/PDF/May2_Seminar/HYBRID%20Cooling.pdf |date=2007-10-08 }}, Consolidated Edison&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[trigeneration]] systems reduce peak electrical loads and save construction costs associated with expanding electrical infrastructure.

Clouds of condensation can sometimes be seen rising from [[manhole]]s in Manhattan through orange and white "chimneys". This can be caused by external water being boiled by contact with the steam pipes or by leaks in the steam system itself.&lt;ref name=conedsteam /&gt;

==Systems for individual buildings==

In New York City, many individual buildings use either a hot water or a steam system for heating, and will have a boiler in the basement.  A boiler is an enclosed vessel or tank that heats water using oil or gas.

A steam boiler will usually keep the heat at 180 degrees F, then when the thermostat indicates that heat is needed it will increase the temperature to above the boiling point, 212 degrees F.  This will send steam, which is lighter than air, to rise through pipes into the building’s radiators. Many thermostats measures outdoor air temperature instead of room temperature to determine — this is less efficient

There are differences between hot water heat and steam heat.  Steam heat is noisier, but it delivers heat quicker.  Steam systems can produce more uneven heat, and the radiators are generally larger.

The noise known as a “steam-hammer” sounds like someone hammering on a pipe.  It is caused when water condenses and is trapped in a horizontal section of pipe so it cannot drain back to the boiler. Then when the system is next turned on, this water is hurled by the steam into the pipe fittings, creating the loud bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/10087_EDF_BottomBarrel_ch2.pdf] Environmental Defense Fund webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5519">[[Image:Proton Exchange Fuel Cell Diagram.svg|thumb|Scheme of a phosphoric acid fuel cell]]
'''Phosphoric acid fuel cells''' ('''PAFC''') are a type of [[fuel cell]] that uses liquid [[phosphoric acid]] as an [[electrolyte]]. They were the first fuel cells to be commercialized. Developed in the mid-1960s and field-tested since the 1970s, they have improved significantly in stability, performance, and cost. Such characteristics have made the PAFC a good candidate for early stationary applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/types-fuel-cells#phosphoric.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Electrolyte is highly concentrated or pure liquid phosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) saturated in a [[silicon carbide]] matrix (SiC). Operating range is about 150 to 210 °C. The [[electrode]]s are made of [[carbon paper]] coated with a finely dispersed [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].

==Electrode reactions==

Anode reaction: 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e‾

Cathode reaction: O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e‾ → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Overall cell reaction: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Advantages and disadvantages==
At an operating range of 150 to 200 °C, the expelled water can be converted to steam for air and water heating ([[Cogeneration|combined heat and power]]). This potentially allows [[thermodynamic efficiency|efficiency]] increases of up to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energycenter.org/index.php/technical-assistance/renewables/fuel-cells Fuel Cells&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123204231/http://energycenter.org/index.php/technical-assistance/renewables/fuel-cells |date=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
PAFCs are [[carbon dioxide | CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-tolerant and even can tolerate a [[carbon monoxide | CO]] concentration of about 1.5%, which broadens the choice of fuels they can use. If gasoline is used, the sulfur must be removed.&lt;ref name="FCorg"&gt;[http://www.fuelcells.org/basics/types.html Fuel Cells 2000 : Fuel Cell Basics : Types&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;  At lower temperatures phosphoric acid is a poor ionic conductor, and CO poisoning of the platinum electro-catalyst in the anode becomes severe.&lt;ref name="FuelcellHandbook"&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/fuelcells/seca/pubs/fchandbook7.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123023857/http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/fuelcells/seca/pubs/fchandbook7.pdf |date=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are much less sensitive to CO than PEFCs and AFCs.

Disadvantages include rather low power density and aggressive electrolyte.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}

==Applications==
[[File:PureCell System 400 CEP.jpg|thumb|PureCell System 400 CEP]]
PAFC have been used for stationary power generators with output in the 100&amp;nbsp;kW to 400&amp;nbsp;kW range and are also finding application in large vehicles such as buses.&lt;ref name="FCToday"&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/about-fuel-cells/technologies/pafc Fuel Cell Today - Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Pluto''' was a [[United States]] government program to develop [[Nuclear-powered aircraft|nuclear-powered]] [[ramjet]] engines for use in [[cruise missile]]s. Two experimental engines were tested at the [[United States Department of Energy]] [[Nevada Test Site]] ('''NTS''') in 1961 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/factsheets/DOENV_763.pdf DOE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303003018/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/factsheets/DOENV_763.pdf |date=2012-03-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On January 1, 1957, the [[U.S. Air Force]] and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] selected the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]] (the predecessor of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]'s, LLNL) to study the feasibility of applying heat from [[nuclear reactor]]s to [[ramjet]] engines. This research became known as "'''Project Pluto'''". The work was directed by Dr. [[Ted Merkle]], leader of the laboratory's R-Division.

[[Image:Tory-IIC nuclear ramjet at Jackass Flats in 1955.jpg|right|thumb|The "Tory-IIC" prototype]]
Originally carried out at [[Livermore, California]], the work was moved to new facilities constructed for $1.2 million on {{convert|8|sqmi}} of [[Jackass Flats]] at the NTS, known as Site 401. The complex consisted of {{convert|6|mi|0}} of roads, critical-assembly building, control building, assembly and shop buildings, and utilities. Also required for the construction was {{convert|25|mi}} of oil well casing, which was necessary to store the approximately {{convert|1000000|lb}} of pressurized air used to simulate ramjet flight conditions for Pluto.

The principle behind the nuclear ramjet was relatively simple: motion of the vehicle pushed air in through the front of the vehicle (ram effect), a nuclear reactor heated the air, and then the hot air expanded at high speed out through a nozzle at the back, providing thrust.

The notion of using a nuclear reactor to heat the air was fundamentally new. Unlike commercial reactors, which are surrounded by concrete, the Pluto reactor had to be small and compact enough to fly, but durable enough to survive a {{convert|7000|mi|adj=on}} trip to a potential target. The nuclear engine could, in principle, operate for months, so a Pluto cruise missile could be left airborne for a prolonged time before being directed to carry out its attack.

The success of this project would depend upon a series of technological advances in [[metallurgy]] and [[materials science]]. [[Pneumatic motor]]s necessary to control the reactor in flight had to operate while red-hot and in the presence of intense [[ionizing radiation|radiation]]. The need to maintain [[supersonic]] speed at low altitude and in all kinds of weather meant that the reactor, code-named "Tory", had to survive high temperatures and conditions that would melt the metals used in most [[jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket engine]]s. [[Ceramic]] fuel elements would have to be used; the contract to manufacture the 500,000 pencil-sized elements was given to the [[Coors Porcelain Company]].

The proposed use for nuclear-powered ramjets would be to power a [[cruise missile]], called SLAM, for [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]]. In order to reach ramjet speed, it would be launched from the ground by a cluster of conventional rocket boosters. Once it reached cruising altitude and was far away from populated areas, the nuclear reactor would be made critical. Since nuclear power gave it almost unlimited range, the missile could cruise in circles over the ocean until ordered "down to the deck" for its supersonic dash to targets in the Soviet Union. The SLAM, as proposed, would carry a payload of many nuclear weapons to be dropped on multiple targets, making the cruise missile into an unmanned bomber. After delivering all its warheads, the missile could then spend weeks flying over populated areas at low altitudes, causing tremendous ground damage with its shock wave and fallout. When it finally lost enough power to fly, and crash-landed, the engine would have a good chance of spewing deadly radiation for months to come.

On May 14, 1961, the world's first nuclear ramjet engine, "Tory-IIA", mounted on a railroad car, roared to life for a few seconds. Three years later, "Tory-IIC" was run for five minutes at full power. Despite these and other successful tests, [[the Pentagon]], sponsor of the "Pluto project", had second thoughts. The weapon was considered "too provocative",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vought.org/special/html/sslam4.html |title=Muscle in Mothballs |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was believed that it would compel the Soviets to construct a similar device, against which there was no known defense. [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] technology had proven to be more easily developed than previously thought, reducing the need for such highly capable cruise missiles. On July 1, 1964, seven years and six months after it was started, "Project Pluto" was canceled.

'''Renewable Energy Certificates''' ('''RECs'''), also known as '''Green tags''', '''Renewable Energy Credits''', '''Renewable Electricity Certificates''', or '''Tradable Renewable Certificates''' ('''TRC'''s), are tradable, non-tangible energy commodities in the United States that represent proof that 1 [[megawatt-hour]] (MWh) of [[electricity]] was generated from an eligible [[renewable energy]] resource ([[renewable electricity]]) and was fed into the shared system of power lines which transport energy. [[Solar renewable energy certificates]] ('''SRECs''') are RECs that are specifically generated by solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Green Power Partnership|url = http://www3.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/rec.htm|website = www3.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-30|language = en|first = US|last = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable Energy Certificates provide a mechanism for the purchase of renewable energy that is added to and pulled from the [[electrical grid]]. The updated Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghgprotocol.org/scope_2_guidance features&lt;/ref&gt;  [[guarantee of origin|guarantees of origin]], RECs and [[I-RECs]] as mainstream instruments for documenting and tracking electricity consumed from renewable sources. 

These certificates can be sold and traded or bartered, and the owner of the REC can claim to have purchased renewable energy. According to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]]'s Green Power Network,&lt;ref name="usdoe_gpn"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; RECs represent the environmental attributes of the power produced from renewable energy projects and are sold separately from commodity electricity.  While traditional carbon [[emissions trading]] programs use penalties and incentives to achieve established emissions targets, RECs simply incentivize [[carbon-neutral]] renewable energy by providing a production subsidy to electricity generated from renewable sources.  

A green energy provider (such as a wind farm) is credited with one REC for every 1,000 kWh or 1 MWh of electricity it produces (for reference, an average residential customer consumes about 800 kWh in a month&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3|title=How much electricity does an American home use? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A certifying agency gives each REC a unique identification number to make sure it doesn't get double-counted. The green energy is then fed into the [[electrical grid]] (by mandate), and the accompanying REC can then be sold on the open market.  "Retirement occurs when a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) is used by the owner of the REC.  Use of the REC may include, but is not limited to, (1) use of the REC by an end-use customer, marketer, generator, or utility to comply with a statutory or regulatory requirement, (2) a public claim associated with a purchase of RECs by an end-use customer, or (3) the sale of any component attributes of a REC for any purpose.  Once a REC is retired, it may not be sold, donated, or transferred to any other party.  No party other than the owner may make claims associated with retired RECs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-e.org/learn_dictionary.shtml|title=Learn|author=|date=11 September 2017|website=green-e.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy from any grid-tied source is bought and sold with contracts specifying the generator and purchaser. In the trade of renewable energy, RECs specify that a unit of renewable energy was generated.  Because once electricity is placed on the [[electrical grid]] it mixes with electricity from multiple sources and becomes indistinguishable, RECs are used to track the ownership of environmental and social benefits of the renewable energy.  The majority of RECs are sold separately from the electricity itself.  In these cases, the electricity is sold as "null" energy without its environmental and social benefits, as if it were generated by non-renewable resources such as coal or natural gas.  When RECs are purchased in combination with non-renewable electricity this constitutes the legal purchase of renewable energy.  This is how [[electrical grid]] connected renewable energy is traded in the U.S.  Grid-connected renewable energy is used by electric utility companies in meeting their regulatory requirements and by individuals and businesses wishing to lessen their environmental impact.  RECs allow for purchasers to support renewable energy generation and allows the economic forces of supply and demand to spur the further development of renewable energy generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/rec.htm|title=Green Power Partnership – US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,OAP,CPPD|date=|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
There are two main markets for renewable energy certificates in the United States – compliance markets and voluntary markets. 

'''Compliance markets''' are created by a policy that exists in 29 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, called [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]]. In these states, the electric companies are required to supply a certain percent of their electricity from [[renewable energy|renewable]] [[electric generator|generators]] by a specified year. For example, in California the law is 33% renewable by 2020, whereas New York has a 24% requirement by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;For a full listing of state renewable portfolio standards, see: http://www.dsireusa.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric utilities]] in these states demonstrate compliance with their requirements by purchasing RECs; in the California example, the electric companies would need to hold RECs equivalent to 33% of their electricity sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Compliance Markets {{!}} evomarkets|url = http://www.evomarkets.com/environment/renewable/compliance_markets|website = www.evomarkets.com|accessdate = 2015-12-30|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305100728/http://www.evomarkets.com/environment/renewable/compliance_markets|archivedate = 2016-03-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voluntary markets''' are ones in which customers choose to buy renewable power out of a desire to use renewable energy. Most corporate and household purchases of renewable energy are voluntary purchases. Renewable energy generators located in states that do not have a [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]] can sell their RECs to voluntary buyers, usually at a cheaper price than compliance market RECs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voluntary Markets {{!}} evomarkets|url = http://www.evomarkets.com/environment/renewable/voluntary_markets|website = www.evomarkets.com|accessdate = 2015-12-30|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053936/http://www.evomarkets.com/environment/renewable/voluntary_markets|archivedate = 2016-03-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketers==
RECs can be traded directly from buyer to seller, but third party marketers, brokers, or asset managers are commonly found in the marketplace. Renewable generation facilities will often sell their credits to these entities, who then resell them on the market at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps3.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/markets/certificates.shtml?page=2 Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): REC Marketers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015034118/http://apps3.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/markets/certificates.shtml?page=2 |date=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas developed the first comprehensive RECs system in the U.S., a web-based platform that provides for the issuance, registration, trade, and retirement of RECs. The Texas REC Program, which only tracks renewable energy certificates, started operating in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wingate|first1=Meredith|last2=Lehman|first2=Matthew|title=THE CURRENT STATUS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATE TRACKING SYSTEMS IN NORTH AMERICA|url=http://www3.cec.org/islandora/en/item/2093-current-status-renewable-energy-certificate-tracking-systems-in-north-america-en.pdf|publisher=The Center for Resource Solutions|page=6|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Prices ==
Prices depend on many factors, such as the vintage year the RECs were generated, location of the facility, whether there is a tight supply/demand situation, whether the REC is used for RPS compliance, even the type of power created. Solar renewable energy certificates or [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates|SRECs]], for example, tend to be more valuable in the 16 states that have set aside a portion of the RPS specifically for solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=21 DSIRE Solar Set-Asides in Renewable Portfolio Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172843/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=21 |date=2012-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation is intended to promote diversity in the renewable energy mix which in an undifferentiated, competitive REC market, favors the economics and scale achieved by wind farms.  

In the United States, spot prices for SRECs generally decreased from 2010 to 2014. In New Jersey, the spot price for a 2010 SREC was $665.04 in July 2010 and about $160 in May 2014 for SRECs generated in different years. In Delaware, the spot price for a 2010 SREC was $255 in July 2010 and about $50 in May 2014 for SRECs generated in different years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srectrade.com/srec_markets/introduction |title=SREC Markets |publisher=SRECTrade |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srectrade.com/srec_markets/delaware |title=SREC Markets &amp;#124; Delaware |publisher=SRECTrade |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srectrade.com/srec_markets/new_jersey |title=SREC Markets &amp;#124; New Jersey |publisher=SRECTrade |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Forand |first1=Rebecca  |title=Solar panel investors upset as SREC values drop |url=http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2011/10/solar_panel_investors_upset_as.html  |date=October 23, 2011 |newspaper=NJ.com |publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates for 2015 to 2017 RECS purchased have averaged between $0.15—$0.045 per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Power Markets|url=http://apps3.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/markets/certificates.shtml?page=1|website=U.S. Department of Energy|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234954/http://apps3.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/markets/certificates.shtml?page=1 |archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, 2008–09 BCHydro offers $3 /MWh for "green attributes", for long-term contracts, 20 plus years.  Many Independent Power Producers (IPPs) believe that this is much less than "fair market value", but have no alternative.

While the value of RECs fluctuate, most sellers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoelectrons.com/green-power-or-renewable-energy-how-it-works/ |title=Green Power or Renewable Energy: How It Works |publisher=Ecoelectrons.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; are legally obligated to "deliver" RECs to their customers within a few months of their generation date. Other organizations will sell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativeenergy.com/WB_ClimateCrisis.html?ClimateCrisis |title=Carbon Offsets for an Inconvenient Truth |publisher=Nativeenergy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many RECs as possible and then use the funds to guarantee a specific fixed price per MWh generated by a future wind farm, for example, making the building of the wind farm a financially viable prospect. The income provided by RECs, and a long-term stabilized market for tags can generate the additional incentive needed to build renewable energy plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awea.org/greenpower/gp_how2.html What are TRC's?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710041020/http://www.awea.org/greenpower/gp_how2.html |date=2009-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
RECs are known under functionally equivalent names, such as Green Tags or Tradable Renewable Certificates (TRCs), depending on the market. The U.S. currently does not have a national registry of RECs issued. The [[Center for Resource Solutions]] administers a voluntary program which ensures that RECs are properly accounted for and that no double counting takes place. Under the Green-e Energy program, participants are required to submit to an annual Verification Process Audit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-e.org/getcert_re_veri.shtml |title=Programs » Green-e Energy » Verification |publisher=Green-e |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all eligible transactions to ensure the RECs meet the requirements for certification. The certification process requires 3rd party verification to be performed by an independent certified public accountant or a certified internal auditor.  CRS maintains a list of auditors who meet the criteria to be listed on the program website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-e.org/auditors.html |title=Green-e Auditors |publisher=Green-e.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly RECs are being assigned unique ID numbers and tracked through regional tracking systems/registries such as [http://www.wregis.org/ WREGIS], [http://www.nepoolgis.com/ NEPOOL], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716124408/http://www.pjm-eis.com/gats/about-gats.html GATS], [http://www.texasrenewables.com/ ERCOT], NARR, MIRECS, NRTEC, NC-RETS and [http://www.mrets.net/ M-RETS].

==Additionality==
"Additionality" in the context of greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations means that a purchased renewable energy certificate introduces new renewable energy onto the electricity grid beyond what would have happened without the project or  "business as usual".  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) favors performance based measures of additionality, such as the megawatt hour (MWh) equivalent per REC.

Whereas air and water pollution travels across state and national boundaries irrespective of its origin, the value of RECs and the emergence of RECs markets depend very much on the markets created state by state through legislative action to mandate a [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]]. Such a balkanized approach to establishing RECs markets and incentives state by state creates issues of equity as some states could legitimately claim that their neighboring states (and their electricity consumers) with voluntary RPS are operating as free riders of pollution prevention, paid for by states (and their electricity consumers) with mandatory RPS.  We can learn from [http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/nbp08.html EPA's SOx and NOx cap and trade program] regarding how the principle of additionality with a national standard provided a benchmark for measuring and validating the commodification of pollution prevention credits that lead to market-driven initiatives with proven results in improving regional and national air quality.

In states with a [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]], a RECs purchase enables the utility company to meet its minimum renewable electricity percentage without having to install that renewable generating capacity itself, regardless of the source of generating renewable energy.  By analogy, in the EPA cap and trade program, a "clean" utility in one state can sell its NOx credits to a "dirty" utility in another state that would otherwise have to install additional smokestack scrubbers.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] claims to have the highest percentage use of green power of any federal agency. In 2007, it offset the electricity use of 100% of its offices. The Air Force is the largest purchaser in the US government in absolute terms, purchasing 899,142 MWh worth of RECs.  Among colleges and universities, the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia is the largest purchaser of RECs, buying 192,727 MWh of RECs from wind power.  The corporate leader is Intel, with 1,302,040 MWh purchased in 2007, and the largest purchaser among retailers is Whole Foods, which purchased 509,104 MWH, or enough RECs to offset 100% of its electricity needs.

Note that research shows that RECs purchased and retired voluntarily in the United States (i.e., not for compliance with a Renewable Portfolio Standard) do  not lead to any significant additional renewable energy investment or generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillenwater|first=Michael|last2=Lu|first2=Xi|last3=Fischlein|first3=Miriam|date=2014-03-01|title=Additionality of wind energy investments in the U.S. voluntary green power market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113005338|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=63|pages=452–457|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillenwater|first=Michael|date=2013-12-01|title=Probabilistic decision model of wind power investment and influence of green power market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513009737|journal=Energy Policy|volume=63|pages=1111–1125|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.09.049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2395">[[File:Ring-Flip.png|450px|right|thumb|Ring flip]]

'''Ring flipping''' (also known as '''ring inversion''' or '''ring reversal''') is a phenomenon involving the interconversion (by [[rotation]]) about single [[chemical bond|bonds]] of cyclic [[conformer]]s having equivalent ring shapes but not necessarily equivalent [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] positions of substituent [[atom]]s.

The six-membered ring of the [[alkane]], [[cyclohexane]], has the 'chair' as its preferred conformation and through [[proton]] [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|NMR]] it would be expected that the produced spectrum would show the different sorts of protons (axial and equatorial) resonating at different [[frequency|frequencies]], and so two [[Wiktionary:signal|signals]] would be seen, due to the protons being in slightly different chemical environments. However, only one signal can be seen as the two isomers are rapidly interconverting. This also occurs with monosubstituted cyclohexanes. This changes with the use of low [[temperature]], as the two isomers visible interconvert much more slowly than at room temperature.

When cyclohexane undergoes a ring inversion, '''all''' axial bonds become equatorial, or vice versa. The half-chair conformation is the energy maximum when proceeding from the 'chair' to the 'twisted boat' conformation. The 'true boat' conformation is the energy maximum for the interchanging of the two [[mirror image]] twist boat conformers, the second of which is converted to the other chair confirmation through another half-chair.

However, the chemical [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of cyclohexane, is inconsistent with two types of hydrogens in a stable form of the molecule (for example, there is only one monochlorocyclohexane, not two, as would be predicted if axial and equatorial hydrogens could be replaced independently), and this is due to the presence of rapid ring inversion as explained above. In substituted cyclohexanes, [[steric repulsion]] can be minimised by the substituents occupying positions along the equatorial [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] rather than axial positions, and this would also lead to greater stability in the molecule.

There are currently many '''research groups active in the field of [[photovoltaics]]''' in [[universities]] and research institutions around the world. This research can be categorized into three areas: making current technology [[solar cells]] cheaper and/or more efficient to effectively compete with other energy sources; developing new technologies based on new solar cell architectural designs; and developing new materials to serve as more efficient energy converters from light energy into electric current or light absorbers and charge carriers.

==Silicon processing==
One way of reducing the cost is to develop cheaper methods of obtaining silicon that is sufficiently pure. Silicon is a very common element, but is normally bound in silica, or [[sand|silica sand]]. Processing silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to produce silicon is a very high energy process - at current efficiencies, it takes one to two years for a conventional solar cell to generate as much energy as was used to make the silicon it contains. More energy efficient methods of synthesis are not only beneficial to the solar industry, but also to industries surrounding silicon technology as a whole.

The current industrial production of silicon is via the reaction between carbon (charcoal) and silica at a temperature around 1700&amp;nbsp;°C. In this process, known as carbothermic reduction, each tonne of silicon (metallurgical grade, about 98% pure) is produced with the emission of about 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

Solid silica can be directly converted (reduced) to pure silicon by electrolysis in a molten salt bath at a fairly mild temperature (800 to 900&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nohira T, Yasuda K, Ito Y |title=Pinpoint and bulk electrochemical reduction of insulating silicon dioxide to scon |journal=Nat Mater |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=397–401 |year=2003 |pmid=12754498 |doi=10.1038/nmat900|bibcode=2003NatMa...2..397N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Jin X, Gao P, Wang D, Hu X, Chen GZ |title=Electrochemical preparation of silicon and its alloys from solid oxides in molten calcium chloride |journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=733–6 |year=2004 |pmid=14755706 |doi=10.1002/anie.200352786 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this new process is in principle the same as the [[FFC Cambridge Process]] which was first discovered in late 1996, the interesting laboratory finding is that such electrolytic silicon is in the form of porous silicon which turns readily into a fine powder, with a particle size of a few micrometers, and may therefore offer new opportunities for development of solar cell technologies.

Another approach is also to reduce the amount of silicon used and thus cost, is by micromachining wafers into very thin, virtually transparent layers that could be used as transparent architectural coverings.&lt;ref name=sliver&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://solar.anu.edu.au/research/sliver.php|title=Sliver Technology Research at the Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique involves taking a silicon wafer, typically 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and making a multitude of parallel, transverse slices across the wafer, creating a large number of slivers that have a thickness of 50 micrometres and a width equal to the thickness of the original wafer. These slices are rotated 90 degrees, so that the surfaces corresponding to the faces of the original wafer become the edges of the slivers. The result is to convert, for example, a 150&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, 2&amp;nbsp;mm-thick wafer having an exposed silicon surface area of about 175&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per side into about 1000 slivers having dimensions of 100&amp;nbsp;mm × 2&amp;nbsp;mm × 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm, yielding a total exposed silicon surface area of about 2000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per side. As a result of this rotation, the electrical doping and contacts that were on the face of the wafer are located at the edges of the sliver, rather than at the front and rear as in the case of conventional wafer cells. This has the interesting effect of making the cell sensitive from both the front and rear of the cell (a property known as bifaciality).&lt;ref name=sliver/&gt; Using this technique, one silicon wafer is enough to build a 140 watt panel, compared to about 60 wafers needed for conventional modules of same power output.

===Nanocrystalline solar cells===
{{Main|Nanocrystal solar cell}}

These structures make use of some of the same thin-film light absorbing materials but are overlain as an extremely thin absorber on a supporting matrix of conductive polymer or mesoporous metal oxide having a very high surface area to increase internal reflections (and hence increase the probability of light absorption). Using nanocrystals allows one to design architectures on the length scale of nanometers, the typical exciton diffusion length. In particular, single-nanocrystal ('channel') devices, an array of single p-n junctions between the electrodes and separated by a period of about a diffusion length, represent a new architecture for solar cells and potentially high efficiency.

==Thin-film processing==
{{Main|Thin-film}}

[[Thin-film]] photovoltaic cells can use less than 1% of the expensive raw material (silicon or other light absorbers) compared to wafer-based solar cells, leading to a significant price drop per Watt peak capacity. There are many research groups around the world actively researching different thin-film approaches and/or materials.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Green, "Consolidation of Thin-film Photovoltaic Technology: The Coming Decade of Opportunity," Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, vol. 14, pp. 383-392, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly promising technology is [[crystalline silicon]] thin films on glass substrates. This technology combines the advantages of crystalline silicon as a solar cell material (abundance, non-toxicity, high efficiency, long-term stability) with the cost savings of using a thin-film approach.&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Basore, "CSG-1: Manufacturing a New Polycrystalline Silicon PV Technology," in Conference Record of the 2006 IEEE 4th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, Hawaii, 2006, pp. 2089-2093.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Green, P. A. Basore, N. Chang, D. Clugston, R. Egan, R. Evans, D. Hogg, S. Jarnason, M. Keevers, P. Lasswell, J. O'Sullivan, U. Schubert, A. Turner, S. R. Wenham, and T. Young, "Crystalline silicon on glass (CSG) thin-film solar cell modules," Solar Energy, vol. 77, pp. 857-863, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting aspect of thin-film solar cells is the possibility to deposit the cells on all kind of materials, including [[flexible substrate]]s ([[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] for example), which opens a new dimension for new applications.&lt;ref&gt;V. Terrazzoni-Daudrix, F.-J. Haug, C. Ballif, et al., "The European Project Flexcellence Roll to Roll Technology for the Production of High Efficiency Low Cost Thin Film Solar Cells," in Proc. of the 21st European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference, 4–8 September 2006, pp. 1669-1672.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metamorphic multijunction solar cell==
[[File:PVeff(rev100414).png|thumb|right|[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|NREL]] compilation of best research solar cell efficiencies from 1976 to 2010]]
As of December 2014, the world record for solar cell efficiency at 46% was achieved by using [[Multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction]] [[Concentrator photovoltaics|concentrator]] solar cells, developed from collaboration efforts of [[Soitec]], [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|CEA-Leti]], France together with [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|Fraunhofer ISE]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-media/press-releases/press-releases-2014/new-world-record-for-solar-cell-efficiency-at-46-percent |title=New world record for solar cell efficiency at 46% French-German cooperation confirms competitive advantage of European photovoltaic industry |publisher=Fraunhofer ISE |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) won one of ''[http://rdmag.com R&amp;D Magazine]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[R&amp;D 100 Awards]] for its Metamorphic [[Multijunction photovoltaic cell]], an ultra-light and [[flexible electronics|flexible cell]] that converts solar energy with record efficiency.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/features/0708_rd100.html NREL: Feature Story - Photovoltaics Innovations Win 2 R&amp;D 100 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultra-light, highly efficient solar cell was developed at NREL and is being commercialized by Emcore Corp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emcore.com/ Emcore Corporation|Fiber Optics · Solar Power]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Albuquerque, N.M.]], in partnership with the [[Air Force Research Laboratories Space Vehicles Directorate]] at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in Albuquerque.

It represents a new class of solar cells with clear advantages in performance, engineering design, operation and cost. For decades, conventional cells have featured wafers of semiconducting materials with similar [[crystalline]] structure. Their performance and cost effectiveness is constrained by growing the cells in an upright configuration. Meanwhile, the cells are rigid, heavy and thick with a bottom layer made of [[germanium]].

In the new method, the cell is grown upside down. These layers use high-energy materials with extremely high quality crystals, especially in the upper layers of the cell where most of the power is produced. Not all of the layers follow the [[wikt:lattice|lattice]] pattern of even atomic spacing. Instead, the cell includes a full range of atomic spacing, which allows for greater absorption and use of sunlight. The thick, rigid germanium layer is removed, reducing the cell's cost and 94% of its weight. By turning the conventional approach to cells on its head, the result is an ultra-light and flexible cell that also converts solar energy with record efficiency (40.8% under 326 suns concentration).

==Polymer processing==
The invention of [[conductive polymers]] (for which [[Alan Heeger]], [[Alan G. MacDiarmid]] and [[Hideki Shirakawa]] were awarded a [[Nobel prize]]) may lead to the development of [[low cost solar cell|much cheaper cells]] that are based on inexpensive plastics. However, [[organic solar cells]] generally suffer from [[UV degradation|degradation upon exposure to UV]] light, and hence have lifetimes which are far too short to be viable. The bonds in the polymers, are always susceptible to breaking up when radiated with shorter wavelengths. Additionally, the [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bond systems in the polymers which carry the charge, react more readily with light and [[oxygen]]. So most conductive polymers, being highly unsaturated and reactive, are highly sensitive to atmospheric moisture and oxidation, making commercial applications difficult.

==Nanoparticle processing==
Experimental non-silicon solar panels can be made of [[quantum heterostructure]]s, e.g. [[carbon nanotube]]s or [[quantum dot]]s, embedded in [[conductive polymers]] or mesoporous metal oxides. In addition, thin films of many of these materials on conventional silicon solar cells can increase the optical coupling efficiency into the silicon cell, thus boosting the overall efficiency. By varying the size of the quantum dots, the cells can be tuned to absorb different wavelengths. Although the research is still in its infancy, [[quantum dot]] modified photovoltaics may be able to achieve up to 42% energy conversion efficiency due to [[multiple exciton generation]] (MEG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/7397/title/Quantum-Dot_Leap|title=Quantum-Dot Leap| author="Peter Weiss"| publisher=Science News Online|accessdate=2005-06-17}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT researchers have found a way of using a virus to improve solar cell efficiency by a third.

==Transparent conductors==
{{Main|Transparent conducting film}}
Many new solar cells use transparent thin films that are also conductors of electrical charge. The dominant conductive thin films used in research now are transparent conductive oxides (abbreviated "TCO"), and include fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:F, or "FTO"), doped [[zinc oxide]] (e.g.: ZnO:Al), and [[indium tin oxide]] (abbreviated "ITO"). These conductive films are also used in the LCD industry for flat panel displays. The dual function of a TCO allows light to pass through a substrate window to the active light-absorbing material beneath, and also serves as an ohmic contact to transport photogenerated charge carriers away from that light-absorbing material. The present TCO materials are effective for research, but perhaps are not yet optimized for large-scale photovoltaic production. They require very special deposition conditions at high vacuum, they can sometimes suffer from poor mechanical strength, and most have poor transmittance in the infrared portion of the spectrum (e.g.: ITO thin films can also be used as infrared filters in airplane windows). These factors make large-scale manufacturing more costly.

A relatively new area has emerged using [[carbon nanotube]] networks as a transparent conductor for [[organic solar cells]]. Nanotube networks are flexible and can be deposited on surfaces a variety of ways. With some treatment, nanotube films can be highly transparent in the infrared, possibly enabling efficient low-bandgap solar cells. Nanotube networks are p-type conductors, whereas traditional transparent conductors are exclusively [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]]. The availability of a [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] transparent conductor could lead to new cell designs that simplify manufacturing and improve efficiency.

==Silicon wafer-based solar cells==
Despite the numerous attempts at making better solar cells by using new and exotic materials, the reality is that the photovoltaics market is still dominated by silicon wafer-based solar cells (first-generation solar cells). This means that most solar cell manufacturers are currently equipped to produce this type of solar cells. Consequently, a large body of research is being done all over the world to manufacture silicon wafer-based solar cells at lower cost and to increase the conversion efficiencies without an exorbitant increase in production cost. The ultimate goal for both wafer-based and alternative photovoltaic concepts is to produce solar electricity at a cost comparable to currently market-dominant coal, natural gas, and nuclear power in order to make it the leading primary energy source. To achieve this it may be necessary to reduce the cost of installed solar systems from currently about US$1.80 (for bulk Si technologies) to about US$0.50 per Watt peak power.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Swanson, "A Vision for Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaics," Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, vol. 14, pp. 443-453, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a major part of the final cost of a traditional bulk silicon module is related to the high cost of solar grade polysilicon feedstock (about US$0.4/Watt peak) there exists substantial drive to make Si solar cells thinner (material savings) or to make solar cells from cheaper upgraded metallurgical silicon (so called "dirty Si").

[[IBM]] has a semiconductor wafer reclamation process that uses a specialized pattern removal technique to repurpose scrap semiconductor wafers to a form used to manufacture silicon-based solar panels. The new process was recently awarded the “2007 Most Valuable Pollution Prevention Award” from The National Pollution Prevention Roundtable (NPPR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/22504.wss IBM Press room - 2007-10-30 IBM Pioneers Process to Turn Waste into Solar Energy - United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrared solar cells==
Researchers at [[Idaho National Laboratory]], along with partners at Lightwave Power Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081026064449/http://www.lightwavepower.com/ Lightwave Power, Inc]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cambridge, MA]] and Patrick Pinhero of the [[University of Missouri]], have devised an inexpensive way to produce plastic sheets containing billions of [[nanoantenna]]s that collect heat energy generated by the sun and other sources, which garnered two 2007 Nano50 awards. The company ceased operations in 2010. While methods to convert the energy into usable electricity still need to be developed, the sheets could one day be manufactured as lightweight "skins" that power everything from [[hybrid car]]s to [[computer]]s and [[iPod]]s with higher efficiency than traditional solar cells. The nanoantennas target mid-infrared rays, which the Earth continuously radiates as heat after absorbing energy from the sun during the day; also double-sided nanoantenna sheets can harvest energy from different parts of the Sun's spectrum. In contrast, traditional solar cells can only use visible light, rendering them idle after dark.

==UV solar cells==
Japan's [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology]] (AIST) has succeeded in developing a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] solar cell that uses [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light to generate electricity but allows visible light to pass through it. Most conventional solar cells use visible and infrared light to generate electricity. Used to replace conventional window glass, the installation surface area could be large, leading to potential uses that take advantage of the combined functions of power generation, lighting and temperature control.

This transparent, UV-absorbing system was achieved by using an [[Organic compound|organic]]-[[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[Heterojunction|heterostructure]] made of the p-type [[Semiconductor|semiconducting]] polymer [[PEDOT:PSS]] film deposited on a [[Niobium|Nb]]-doped [[strontium titanate]] substrate. PEDOT:PSS is easily fabricated into thin films due to its stability in air and its solubility in water. These solar cells are only activated in the UV region and result in a relatively high quantum yield of 16% [[electron]]/[[photon]]. Future work in this technology involves replacing the strontium titanate substrate with a strontium titanate film deposited on a glass substrate in order to achieve a low-cost, large-area manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. Yamaura|title=Ultraviolet light selective photodiode based on an organic–inorganic heterostructure|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=83|page=2097|year=2003| doi=10.1063/1.1610793|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2003ApPhL..83.2097Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, other methods have been discovered to include the UV wavelengths in solar cell power generation. Some companies report using nano-[[phosphors]] as a transparent coating to turn UV light into visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turbo-Solar|url=http://www.turbo-solar.com/|publisher=Sun Innovations, Inc.|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have reported extending the absorption range of single-junction photovoltaic cells by doping a wide [[band gap]] transparent semiconductor such as [[Gallium nitride|GaN]] with a [[transition metal]] such as [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New PV cell generates electricity from UV and IR light|url=http://www.gizmag.com/pv-cell-ultraviolet-infrared-light/14708/|publisher=Gizmag|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexible solar cell research==
{{main|Flexible solar cell research}}
Flexible solar cell research is a research-level technology, an example of which was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in which [[solar panel|solar cells]] are manufactured by depositing photovoltaic material on flexible substrates, such as ordinary paper, using [[chemical vapor deposition]] technology.&lt;ref name=green-buildings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-buildings.com/content/782022-flexible-solar-panels-printing-photovoltaic-cells-paper|title=Flexible Solar Panels: Printing Photovoltaic Cells on Paper|publisher=green-buildings.com|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology for manufacturing solar cells on paper was developed by a group of researchers from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with support from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the Eni-MIT Alliance Solar Frontiers Program.

==3D solar cells==
Three-dimensional solar cells that capture nearly all of the light that strikes them and could boost the efficiency of photovoltaic systems while reducing their size, weight and mechanical complexity. The new 3D solar cells, created at the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]], capture photons from sunlight using an array of miniature “tower” structures that resemble high-rise buildings in a city street grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/3d-solar.htm|title=3D Solar Cells Boost Efficiency While Reducing Size, Weight and Complexity of Photovoltaic Arrays|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|date=2007-04-11|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/casestudy/georgia-tech-advances-solar-energy-research|title=A Sunny Past and Future: Georgia Tech Advances Solar Energy Research|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/gtri75/innovations/here-comes-sun|title=Here comes the sun|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar3D, Inc. plans to commercialize such 3D cells, but its technology is currently patent-pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsofscience.org/3d-solar-cell-energy-efficiency-6206/|title=Worlds first 3D solar cell is surprisingly efficient|publisher=[http://www.bitsofscience.org]|accessdate=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luminescent solar concentrator===
{{Main|Luminescent solar concentrator}}
[[Luminescent solar concentrator]]s convert sunlight or other sources of light into preferred frequencies; they concentrate the output for conversion into desirable forms of power, such as electricity.  They rely on [[luminescence]], typically [[fluorescence]], in media such as liquids, glasses, or plastics treated with a suitable coating or [[dopant]]. The structures are configured to direct the output from a large input area onto a small converter, where the concentrated energy generates [[photoelectricity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm What is a luminsecent solar concentrator?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyresearch.nl/energy-options/solar-cells/research/ru-nijmegen/new-concepts/ How a LSC with PV cell works]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etd.caltech.edu/etd/available/etd-11152004-162115/ Description of the LSC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922060949/http://etd.caltech.edu/etd/available/etd-11152004-162115/ |date=2008-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is to collect light over a large area at low cost; luminescent concentrator panels can be made cheaply from materials such as glasses or plastics, while photovoltaic cells are high-precision, high-technology devices, and accordingly expensive to construct in large sizes.

Research is in progress at universities such as [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] and [[Delft University of Technology]]. For example, at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] researchers have developed approaches for conversion of windows into sunlight concentrators for generation of electricity. They paint a mixture of dyes onto a pane of glass or plastic. The dyes absorb sunlight and re-emit it as fluorescence within the glass, where it is confined by [[internal reflection]], emerging at the edges of the glass, where it encounters solar cells optimized for conversion of such concentrated sunlight. The concentration factor is about 40, and the optical design yields a [[Concentrating solar power|solar concentrator]] that unlike lens-based concentrators, need not be directed accurately at the sun, and can produce output even from diffuse light. [http://www.covalentsolar.com/technology.html Covalent Solar] is working on commercialization of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=11936|date=om/technology.html Covalent Solar: Technology]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metamaterials==
{{Main|Metamaterial}}

Metamaterials are heterogeneous materials employing the juxtaposition of many microscopic elements, giving rise to properties not seen in ordinary solids. Using these, it ''may'' become possible to fashion solar cells that are excellent absorbers over a narrow range of wavelengths. High absorption in the microwave regime has been demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news131730850.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v100/i20/e207402&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet in the 300-1100-nm wavelength regime.

==Photovoltaic thermal hybrid==
{{Main|Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector}}
Some systems combine photovoltaic with thermal solar, with the advantage that the thermal solar part carries heat away and cools the photovoltaic cells. Keeping temperature down lowers the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and improves the cell efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=S.A. Kalogirou |author2=Y. Tripanagnostopoulos |year=2006|title=Hybrid PV/T solar systems for domestic hot water and electricity production|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2006.01.012|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=47|issue= 18-19|page= 3368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penta-based photovoltaics==
Pentacene-based photovoltaics are claimed to improve the energy-efficiency ratio to up to 95%, effectively doubling the efficience of today's most efficient techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessinsider.com/new-method-for-hybrid-solar-cells-2014-10|title=A New Generation Of Solar Cells Could Smash Current Efficiency Limits|publisher=Business Insideraccessdate=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermediate band==
{{Main|Intermediate band photovoltaics}}
Intermediate band photovoltaics in solar cell research provides methods for exceeding the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]] on the efficiency of a cell. It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency. &lt;ref&gt;Luque, Antonio, and Antonio Martí. "Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels." Physical Review Letters 78.26 (1997): 5014-017. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Luque López|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]]. They assumed no carriers were collected at the IB and that the device was under full concentration. They found the maximum efficiency to be 63.2%, for a bandgap of 1.95eV with the IB 0.71eV from either the valence or conduction band.
Under one sun illumination the limiting efficiency is 47%. &lt;ref&gt;Okada, Yoshitaka, Tomah Sogabe, and Yasushi Shoji.

'''Sulfur trioxide''' (alternative spelling '''sulphur trioxide''') is the chemical compound with the formula SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with a relatively narrow liquid range. In the gaseous form, this species is a significant pollutant, being the primary agent in [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is prepared on an industrial scale as a precursor to [[sulfuric acid]].

In perfectly dry apparatus, sulfur trioxide vapor is invisible, and the liquid is transparent. However, it fumes profusely even in a relatively dry atmosphere (it has been used as a smoke agent) due to formation of a sulfuric acid mist. This vapor has no odor but is extremely corrosive.&lt;ref name="Lerner"&gt;{{

==Molecular structure and bonding==
Gaseous SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[trigonal planar]] molecule of D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, as predicted by [[VSEPR theory]]. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; belongs to the D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; [[molecular symmetry|point group]].

In terms of electron-counting formalism, the sulfur atom has an [[oxidation state]] of +6 and a [[formal charge]] of +2. The [[Lewis structure]] consists of an S=O [[double bond]] and two S–O [[dative bond]]s without utilizing d-orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The electrical [[dipole#molecular dipoles|dipole moment]] of gaseous sulfur trioxide is zero. This is a consequence of the 120° angle between the S-O bonds.

==Structure of solid SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;==

The nature of solid SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is complex because structural changes are caused by traces of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon condensation of the gas, absolutely pure SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; condenses into a trimer, which is often called ''γ''-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This molecular form is a colorless solid with a melting point of 16.8&amp;nbsp;°C. It adopts a cyclic structure described as [S(=O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''μ''-O)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is condensed above 27&amp;nbsp;°C, then ''α''-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forms, which has a melting point of 62.3&amp;nbsp;°C. ''α''-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is fibrous in appearance. Structurally, it is the [[polymer]] [S(=O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''μ''-O)]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each end of the polymer is terminated with OH groups. ''β''-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, like the alpha form, is fibrous but of different molecular weight, consisting of an hydroxyl-capped polymer, but melts at 32.5&amp;nbsp;°C. Both the gamma and the beta forms are metastable, eventually converting to the stable alpha form if left standing for sufficient time. This conversion is caused by traces of water.&lt;ref name="Merck"&gt;''Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs'', 9th ed. monograph 8775&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative vapor pressures of solid SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are alpha &amp;lt; beta &amp;lt; gamma at identical temperatures, indicative of their relative [[molecular weight]]s. Liquid sulfur trioxide has a vapor pressure consistent with the gamma form. Thus heating a crystal of  ''α''-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to its melting point results in a sudden increase in vapor pressure, which can be forceful enough to shatter a glass vessel in which it is heated. This effect is known as the "alpha explosion".&lt;ref name="Merck"/&gt;

SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is aggressively [[hygroscopic]]. The heat of hydration is sufficient that mixtures of SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and wood or cotton can ignite. In such cases, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrates these [[carbohydrate]]s.&lt;ref name="Merck"/&gt;

==Chemical reactions==

SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Inorganic anhydride|anhydride]] of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the following reaction occurs:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (g)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt; (l)&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔH&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = −200 [[kilojoule|kJ]] [[mole (unit)|mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Manufacture of Sulfuric Acid and Superphosphate |publisher=Chemical Processes in New Zealand |url=http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/production/1B.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction occurs both rapidly and exothermically, too violently to be used in large-scale manufacturing. At or above 340&amp;nbsp;°C, sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, and water coexist in significant equilibrium concentrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Sulfur trioxide also reacts with [[sulfur dichloride]] to yield the useful [[reagent]], [[thionyl chloride]].

:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a strong [[Lewis acid]] readily forming crystalline complexes with [[sulfur trioxide pyridine complex|pyridine]], [[dioxane]], and [[trimethylamine]]. These adducts can be used as sulfonating agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cotton&amp;Wilkinson6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Sulfur trioxide can be prepared in the laboratory by the two-stage [[pyrolysis]] of [[sodium bisulfate]]. [[Sodium pyrosulfate]] is an intermediate product:&lt;ref name="vries"&gt;{{cite journal |author=K.J. de Vries |author2=P.J. Gellings |title=The thermal decomposition of potassium and sodium-pyrosulfate |journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry |volume=31 |issue=5 |date=May 1969 |pages=1307–1313 |url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/the-thermal-decomposition-of-potassium-and-sodium-pyrosulfate |doi=10.1016/0022-1902(69)80241-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Dehydration at 315&amp;nbsp;°C:
#: 2 NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
#Cracking at 460&amp;nbsp;°C:
#: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In contrast, KHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; does not undergo the same reaction.&lt;ref name="vries"/&gt;

Industrially SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is made by the [[contact process]]. [[Sulfur dioxide]], which in turn is produced by the burning of [[sulfur]] or [[iron pyrite]] (a sulfide ore of iron). After being purified by electrostatic precipitation, the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then oxidised by atmospheric [[oxygen]] at between 400 and 600&amp;nbsp;°C over a catalyst. A typical catalyst consists of [[Vanadium(V) oxide|vanadium pentoxide]] (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) activated with [[potassium oxide]] K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on [[Diatomaceous earth|kieselguhr]] or [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] support. [[Platinum]] also works very well but is too expensive and is poisoned (rendered ineffective) much more easily by impurities.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Müller "Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. 2000 {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of sulfur trioxide made in this way is converted into [[sulfuric acid]] not by the direct addition of water, with which it forms a fine mist, but by absorption in concentrated sulfuric acid and dilution with water of the produced [[oleum]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

{{main|calcium sulfate#other uses}}
It was once produced industrially by heating [[calcium sulfate]] with [[silica]].

==Applications==
Sulfur trioxide is an essential reagent in [[sulfonation]] reactions. These processes afford detergents, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. Sulfur trioxide is generated in situ from sulfuric acid or is used as a solution in the acid.

==Safety==
Along with being a strong oxidizing agent, sulfur trioxide will cause serious burns on both inhalation and ingestion because it is highly corrosive and hygroscopic in nature. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; should be handled with extreme care as it reacts violently with water and produces highly corrosive sulfuric acid. It should also be kept away from organic material due to the strong dehydrating nature of sulfur trioxide and its ability to react violently with such materials.

[[File:Tantalum capacitors.jpg|thumb|right|10&amp;nbsp;µF 30&amp;nbsp;VDC-rated tantalum capacitors, solid electrolyte epoxy-dipped style.]]

A '''tantalum electrolytic capacitor'''  is an [[electrolytic capacitor]], a passive component of [[electronic circuit]]s. It consists of a pellet of [[tantalum]] metal as an [[anode]], covered by an insulating oxide layer that forms the dielectric, surrounded by liquid or solid electrolyte as a [[cathode]]. Because of its very thin and relatively high [[permittivity]] dielectric layer, the tantalum capacitor distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high [[capacitance]] per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.

Tantalum is a [[conflict mineral]]. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are considerably more expensive than comparable [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s.

Tantalum capacitors are inherently polarized components. Reverse voltage can destroy the capacitor. Non-polar or bipolar tantalum capacitors are made by effectively connecting two polarized capacitors in series, with the anodes oriented in opposite directions.

==Basic information==

===Basic principle===
[[File:Anodic oxidation.jpg|thumb|right|Basic principle of the anodic oxidation, in which, by applying a voltage with a current source, an oxide layer is formed on a metallic anode]]
Electrolytic capacitors use a chemical feature of some special metals, historically called ''valve metals'', which can form an insulating oxide layer. Applying a positive voltage to the tantalum anode material in an electrolytic bath forms an oxide barrier layer with a thickness proportional to the applied voltage. This oxide layer serves as the dielectric in an electrolytic capacitor. The properties of this oxide layer compared with tantalum oxide layer are given in the following table:
&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

After forming a dielectric oxide on the rough anode structures, a cathode is needed. An electrolyte acts as the cathode of electrolytic capacitors. There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally, the electrolytes will be distinguished into two species, ''non-solid'' and ''solid'' electrolytes. Non-solid electrolytes are a liquid medium whose [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] is [[ion]]ic. Solid electrolytes have electron conductivity and thus solid electrolytic capacitors are more sensitive against voltages spikes or current surges{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}.
The oxide layer may be destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage is reversed.

[[File:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|left|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area ''A'' and with a separation of ''d''.]]

Every electrolytic capacitor in principle forms a ''plate capacitor'' whose capacitance is greater the larger the electrode area, A, and the [[permittivity]], ε, are and the thinner the thickness, d, of the dielectric is.

:&lt;math&gt;C = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric thickness of electrolytic capacitors is very thin, in the range of [[meter|nanometers]] per volt. Despite this, the dielectric strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. Thus, tantalum capacitors can achieve a high volumetric capacitance compared to other capacitor types.

All etched or sintered anodes have a much larger total surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same overall dimensions. This surface area increase boosts the capacitance value by a factor of up to 200 (depending on the rated voltage) for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.&lt;ref name=Horacek &gt;I. Horacek, T. Zednicek, S. Zednicek, T. Karnik, J. Petrzilek, P. Jacisko, P. Gregorova, AVX, "High CV Tantalum Capacitors: Challenges and Limitations" [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/Tantalum-NiobiumCapacitors/highcvtant.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume of an electrolytic capacitor is defined by the product of capacitance and voltage, the so-called ''CV-volume''. However, in comparing the permittivities of different oxide materials, it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has an approximately 3 times higher permittivity than aluminum oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value can therefore be smaller than aluminum electrolytic capacitors.

===Basic construction of solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow="3" caption=" Construction of a solid tantalum chip capacitor with manganese dioxide electrolyte" class="centered" mode=packed heights=150px&gt;
File:Tantalum sintered pellet.jpg| The capacitor cell of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor consists of sintered tantalum powder
File:Tantalum-Sintered-MnO2-slug.jpg| Schematic representation of the structure of a sintered tantalum electrolytic capacitor with solid electrolyte and the cathode contacting layers 
File:Tantalum-SMD-Chip-Molded.jpg| Construction of a typical SMD tantalum electrolytic chip capacitor with solid electrolyte
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

A typical tantalum capacitor is a chip capacitor and consists of tantalum powder pressed and [[sintering|sintered]] into a pellet as the [[anode]] of the capacitor, with the oxide layer of [[tantalum pentoxide]] as a [[dielectric]], and a solid manganese dioxide electrolyte as the [[cathode]].

==Materials, production and styles==

===Anode===
[[File:Tantalum Powder CV.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A picture of three tantalum powder sizes.|Figure 1: Tantalum powder ''CV''/g.]]

Tantalum capacitors are manufactured from a powder of relatively pure elemental [[tantalum]] metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcstarck.com/tantalum_capacitor_powder H.C. Starck GmbH, Product Information Tantalum capacitor powder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Haas, H. C. Starck GmbH, Magnesium Vapour Reduced Tantalum Powders with Very High Capacitances [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSEUROPE04/CARTSE0411_ij2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic&gt;J. Gill, AVX,  BASIC TANTALUM CAPACITOR TECHNOLOGY, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/Tantalum-NiobiumCapacitors/bsctant.pdf PDF] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20151224110619/http://old.passivecomponentmagazine.com/files/archives/2003/PCI_03_03May-June.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; A common [[figure of merit]] for comparing [[volumetric efficiency]] of powders is expressed in capacitance (C, usually in μF) times volts (V) per gram (g). Since the mid-1980s, manufactured tantalum powders have exhibited around a ten-fold improvement in CV/g values (from approximately 20k to 200k).&lt;ref name=Horacek /&gt; The typical particle size is between 2 and 10 μm. Figure 1 shows powders of successively finer grain, resulting in greater surface area per unit volume. Note the very great difference in particle size between the powders.

[[File:Tantalum Sintered Anode.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A picture of tantalum powder sintered together.|Figure 2: Sintered anode.]]
The powder is compressed around a tantalum wire (known as the riser wire) to form a "pellet".&lt;ref name=VIS-DC /&gt; The riser wire ultimately becomes the anode connection to the capacitor. This pellet/wire combination is subsequently vacuum [[sintering|sintered]] at high temperature (typically 1200 to 1800&amp;nbsp;°C) which produces a mechanically strong pellet and drives off many impurities within the powder. During sintering, the powder takes on a sponge-like structure, with all the particles interconnected into a monolithic spatial lattice. This structure is of predictable mechanical strength and density, but is also highly porous, producing a large internal surface area (see Figure 2).

Larger surface areas produce higher capacitance; thus high ''CV''/g powders, which have lower average particle sizes, are used for low voltage, high capacitance parts. By choosing the correct powder type and sintering temperature, a specific capacitance or voltage rating can be achieved. For example, a 220&amp;nbsp;μF 6&amp;nbsp;V capacitor will have a surface area close to 346&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 80% of the size of a sheet of paper (US Letter, 8.5×11&amp;nbsp;inch paper has area ~413&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), although the total volume of the pellet is only about 0.0016&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Dielectric===
[[File:Tantalum Dielectric Layer.JPG|thumb|alt=Picture of sintered tantalum with dielectric layer.|Figure 3: Dielectric layer.]]
The [[dielectric]] is then formed over all the tantalum particle surfaces by the electrochemical process of [[anodizing|anodization]]. To achieve this, the “pellet” is submerged into a very weak solution of acid and DC voltage is applied. The total dielectric thickness is determined by the final voltage applied during the forming process. Initially the power supply is kept in a constant current mode until the correct voltage (i.e. dielectric thickness) has been reached; it then holds this voltage and the current decays to close to zero to provide a uniform thickness throughout the device and production lot.
The chemical equations describing the dielectric formation process at the [[anode]] are as follows:&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic/&gt;
:2 Ta → 2 Ta&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; + 10 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:2 Ta&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; + 10 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The oxide forms on the surface of the tantalum, but it also grows into the material. For each unit thickness of oxide growth, one third grows out and two thirds grows in. Due to the limits of oxide growth, there is a limit on the maximum voltage rating of tantalum oxide for each of the presently available tantalum powders (see Figure 3).

The dielectric layer thickness generated by the forming voltage is directly proportional to the voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors.&lt;ref name="Thiesbürger"&gt;K. H. Thiesbürger: Der Elektrolyt-Kondensator. 4. Auflage. Roederstein, Landshut 1991, OCLC 313492506&lt;/ref&gt; Electrolytic capacitors are manufactured with a safety margin in oxide layer thickness, which is the ratio between voltage used for electrolytical creation of dielectric and rated voltage of the capacitor, to ensure reliable functionality.

The safety margin for solid tantalum capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte is typically between 2 and 4. That means that for a 25&amp;nbsp;V tantalum capacitor with a safety margin of 4 the dielectric voltage proof can withstand 100&amp;nbsp;V to provide a more robust dielectric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/199/2014%20EDFA%20Tantalum%20Cap%20Failure%20Analysis%20Review%20by%20Javaid%20Qazi.pdf J. Qazi, Kemet, An Overview of Failure Analysis of Tantalum Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt; This very high safety factor is substantiated by the failure mechanism of solid tantalum capacitors, “field crystallization”.&lt;ref name=Goudswaard&gt;B. Goudswaard, F. J. J. Driesens, Failure Mechanism of Solid Tantalum Capacitors, Philips, Electrocomponent Science and Technology, 1976, Vol. 3. pp 171-179 [http://www.jourlib.org/paper/2327093]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;H.

For tantalum capacitors with solid polymer electrolyte the safety margin is much lower, typically around 2.&lt;ref name=Vasina/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Faltus, AVX Corp.EET Asia, Choosing the right capacitors to ensure long-term control-circuit stability [http://www.eetasia.com/STATIC/PDF/201209/EEOL_2012SEP19_POW_TA_01.pdf?SOURCES=DOWNLOAD]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathode===
[[File:Tantalum Manganese Layer.JPG|thumb|alt=Picture of tantalum with manganese dioxide layer.|Figure 4: Manganese dioxide layer]]

The next stage for solid tantalum capacitors is the application of the cathode plate (wet tantalum capacitors use a liquid electrolyte as a cathode in conjunction with their casing). This is achieved by pyrolysis of [[manganese nitrate]] into [[manganese dioxide]]. The “pellet” is dipped into an aqueous solution of nitrate and then baked in an oven at approximately 250&amp;nbsp;°C to produce the dioxide coat. The chemical equation is:&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic/&gt;

:Mn(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This process is repeated several times through varying specific gravities of nitrate solution, to build up a thick coat over all internal and external surfaces of the “pellet”, as shown in Figure 4.

In traditional construction, the “pellet” is successively dipped into [[graphite]] and then [[silver]] to provide a good connection from the manganese dioxide cathode plate to the external cathode termination(see Figure 5).

===Styles of tantalum capacitors===

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are made in three different styles:&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic /&gt;

* Tantalum chip capacitors:  SMD style for surface mounting, 80% of all tantalum capacitors are SMDs 
* Tantalum "pearls", resin-dipped, single-ended style for PCB mounting
* Axial-leaded tantalum capacitors, with solid and non-solid electrolyte, mostly used for military, medical and space applications.&lt;ref&gt;Vishay, Tantalum Capacitors, Review of Select Products – 2009 [http://www.vishay.com/docs/49903/49903.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chip capacitors (case size)===
More than 90% of all tantalum electrolytic capacitors are manufactured in [[Surface Mounted Device|SMD]] style as tantalum chip capacitors. It has contact surfaces on the end faces of the case and is manufactured in different sizes, typically following the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]-535-BAAC standard. The different sizes can also be identified by case code letters. For some case sizes (A to E), which have been manufactured for many decades, the dimensions and case coding over all manufactures are still largely the same. However, new developments in tantalum electrolytic capacitors such as the multi-anode technique to reduce the [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]] or the "face down" technique to reduce the inductance have led to a much wider range of chip sizes and their case codes. These departures from EIA standards mean devices from different manufacturers are no longer always uniform.

An overview of the dimensions of conventional tantalum rectangular chip capacitors and their coding is shown in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer’s Cross Reference and Tantalum Chip Capacitor Part Numbering Systems; F3075D; Kemet; November 2004&gt;[http://www.chip-flip.com/fileadmin/redaktion/TANTALUM_CHIPS_CROSS_REFERENCES.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wet tantalum capacitors===
[[File:Wet-Ta-e-cap-construction.jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of a non-solid all tantalum electrolytic capacitor, hermetic sealed]]

The main feature of modern non-solid (wet) tantalum electrolytic capacitors are their energy density compared with that of solid tantalum and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors within the same temperature range. Due to their self-healing properties (the non-solid electrolyte can deliver oxygen to form new oxide layer in weak areas of the dielectric), the dielectric thickness can be formed with much lower safety margins and consequently with much thinner dielectric than for solid types, resulting in a higher CV value per volume unit. Additionally, wet tantalum capacitors are able to operate at voltages in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;V up to 630&amp;nbsp;V, have a relatively low ESR, and have the lowest leakage current of all electrolytic capacitors.

The original wet tantalum capacitors developed in the 1930s were axial capacitors, having a wound cell consisting of a tantalum anode and foil cathode separated by a paper stripe soaked with an electrolyte, mounted in a silver case and non-hermetic elastomer sealed.&lt;ref name=Tailor&gt;D. F. Tailor, Tantalum and Tantalum Compounds, Fansteel Inc., Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 19, 2nd ed. 1969 John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the inertness and stability of the tantalum dielectric oxide layer against strong acids, the wet tantalum capacitors could use sulfuric acid as an electrolyte, thus providing them with a relatively low ESR.

Because in the past, silver casings had problems with silver migration and whiskers which led to increasing leakage currents and short circuits, new styles of wet tantalum capacitors use a sintered tantalum pellet cell and a gelled sulfuric acid electrolyte mounted in a pure tantalum case.

Due to their relatively high price, wet tantalum electrolytic capacitors have few consumer applications. They are used in ruggedized industrial applications, such as in probes for oil exploration. Types with military approvals can provide the extended capacitance and voltage ratings, along with the high quality levels required for avionics, military, and space applications.

==History==
{{main article|Electrolytic_capacitor#History}}
The group of "valve metals" capable of forming an insulating oxide film was discovered in 1875. In 1896 [[Karol Pollak]] patented a capacitor using aluminum electrodes and a liquid electrolyte. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors were commercially manufactured in the 1930s.

The first tantalum electrolytic capacitors with wound tantalum foils and non-solid electrolyte were developed in 1930 by Tansitor Electronic Inc. (US), and were used for military purposes.&lt;ref name=Tailor/&gt;

Solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors were invented by [[Bell Laboratories]] in the early 1950s as a miniaturized and more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented [[transistor]]. The solution R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring from the Bell labs found for the new miniaturized capacitor found in early 1950 was based on experience with ceramics. They ground metallic tantalum to a powder, pressed this powder into a cylindrical form and then sintered the powder particles at high temperature between {{convert|1500|and|2000|°C}} under vacuum conditions,  into a pellet (“slug”).&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring, “A metal semi-conductor capacitor,” J. Electrochem. Soc., vol. 103, p. 611, November, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Reed, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Characterization of Tantalum Polymer Capacitors, NEPP Task 1.21.5, Phase 1, FY05]   [http://nepp.nasa.gov/docuploads/0EA22600-8AEC-4F47-9FE49BAABEAB569C/Tantalum%20Polymer%20Capacitors%20FY05%20Final%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

These first sintered tantalum capacitors used a liquid electrolyte. In 1952 Bell Labs researchers discovered the use manganese dioxide as a solid electrolyte for a sintered tantalum capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. McLean, F. S. Power, Proc. Inst. Radio Engrs. 44 (1956) 872&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fundamental inventions came from the Bell Labs, the innovations for manufacturing commercially viable tantalum electrolytic capacitors were done by the researchers of the [[Sprague Electric Company]]. [[Preston Robinson]], Sprague's Director of Research, is considered to be the actual inventor of tantalum capacitors in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Preston Robinson, Sprague, US Patent 3066247, 25 Aug. 1954 – 27 Nov. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, Dr. Preston Robinson Granted 103rd Patent Since Joining Company In 1929 [http://www.mcla.edu/mcla_data/Library/Archive/Sprague/Vol25_No06.pdf]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; His invention was supported by R. J. Millard, who introduced the “reform” step in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;A. Fraioli, Recent Advances in the Solid-State Electrolytic Capacitor, IRE Transactions on Component Parts, June 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Millard, Sprague, US Patent 2936514,  October 24, 1955 – May 17, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; a significant improvement in which the dielectric of the capacitor was repaired after each dip-and-convert cycle of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; deposition. This dramatically reduced the leakage current of the finished capacitors.

This first solid electrolyte manganese dioxide had 10 times better conductivity than all other types of non-solid electrolyte capacitors. In the style of tantalum pearls, they soon found wide use in radio and new television devices.

[[File:Elektrolyte-Leitfähigkeitswerte.jpg|thumb|left|Conductivity of non-solid and solid used electrolytes]]

In 1971, Intel launched its first microcomputer (the MCS 4) and 1972 Hewlett Packard launched one of the first pocket calculators (the [[HP 35]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Computerposter.ch Computerposter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

The [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) for bypass and decoupling capacitors of standard electrolytic capacitors needed to be decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Larry E. Mosley, Intel Corporation, Capacitor Impedance Needs For Future Microprocessors, CARTS USA 2006, [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTS06/3_1cvm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although solid tantalum capacitors offered lower ESR and leakage current values than the aluminum electrolytics, in 1980 a price shock for tantalum in the industry dramatically reduced the usability of tantalum capacitors, especially in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;W.

In 1993 NEC introduced their SMD polymer tantalum electrolytic capacitors, called "NeoCap". In 1997 Sanyo followed with their "POSCAP" polymer tantalum chips.

A new conductive polymer for tantalum polymer capacitors was presented by Kemet at the "1999 Carts" conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/kemet/Replacing-MnO2-with-Conductive-Polymer-in-Tantalum-Capacitors.pdf John Prymak, Kemet, Replacing MnO2 with Polymers, 1999 CARTS]&lt;/ref&gt; This capacitor used the newly developed organic conductive polymer PEDT Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), also known as PEDOT (trade name Baytron).&lt;ref&gt;F. Jonas, H.C.Starck, Baytron, Basic chemical and physical properties, Präsentation 2003, [www.hcstarck.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

This development to low ESR capacitors with high CV-volumes in chip style for the rapid growing SMD technology in the 1990s increased the demand on tantalum chips dramatically. However, another price explosion for tantalum in 2000/2001 forced the development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Ch.

The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Pozdeev-Freeman, P.

==Electrical characteristics==

=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Electrolytic capacitor model.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of a tantalum capacitor]]

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors as discrete components are not ideal capacitors, as they have losses and parasitic inductive parts. All properties can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics are defined by:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR"
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL".

Using a series equivalent circuit rather than a parallel equivalent circuit is specified by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/EN 60384-1.

===Capacitance standard values and tolerances===

The electrical characteristics of tantalum electrolytic capacitors depend on the structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of tantalum capacitors, which depend on operating frequency and temperature. The basic unit of electrolytic capacitors capacitance is [[Farad|microfarad]] (μF).

The capacitance value specified in the data sheets of the manufacturers is called rated capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or nominal capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100 to 120&amp;nbsp;Hz. Electrolytic capacitors differ from other capacitor types, whose capacitances are typically measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or higher. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of ≤2.5&amp;nbsp;V or 2.1 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of &gt;2.5&amp;nbsp;V may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.

The percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series classifications, whose values are specified in the [[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]] specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E3 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M“
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E6 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M“
* rated capacitance, [[E12 series]], tolerance ±10%, letter code "K“

The required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]] capacitors don’t have the need for narrow tolerances because they are mostly not used for accurate frequency applications like [[oscillator]]s.

===Rated and category voltage===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category voltage and rated and category temperature]]

Referring to IEC/EN 60384-1 standard the allowed operating voltage for tantalum capacitors is called "rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; " or "nominal voltage U&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;". The rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; (IEC/EN 60384-1).

The voltage rating of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specify a "temperature derated voltage" for a higher temperature, the "category voltage U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture right.

Lower voltage applied may have positive influences for tantalum electrolytic capacitors. Lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.&lt;ref name="AVX-Reliability"&gt;Ch. Reynolds, AVX, Technical Information, Reliability Management of Tantalum Capacitors, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/Tantalum-NiobiumCapacitors/voltaged.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying a higher voltage than specified may destroy tantalum electrolytic capacitors.

===Surge voltage===

The surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for a limited number of cycles. The surge voltage is standardized in IEC/EN 60384-1. For tantalum electrolytic capacitors the surge voltage shall be 1.3 times of the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt.
The surge voltage applied to tantalum capacitors may influence the capacitors failure rate.&lt;ref name=AVXsurge&gt;J. Gill, AVX, Surge in Solid Tantalum Capacitors,[http://www.kyocera.co.jp/prdct/electro/pdf/technical/surgtant.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="code 562"&gt;A. Teverovsky, NASA, Effect of Surge Current Testing on Reliability of Solid Tantalum Capacitors [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA08/4_2a%20Teverovsky.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transient voltage===

Transient voltage or a current spike applied to tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte can cause some tantalum capacitors to fail and may directly lead to a short.&lt;ref name="AVXsurge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Teverovsky, Perot Systems Code 562, NASA GSFCE, Effect of Surge Current Testing on Reliability of Solid Tantalum Capacitors [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA08/4_2a%20Teverovsky.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse voltage===

Tantalum electrolytic are polarized and generally require anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.

With a reverse voltage applied, a reverse leakage current flows in very small areas of microcracks or other defects across the dielectric layer to the anode of the electrolytic capacitor. Although the current may only be a few microamps, it represents a very high localized current density which can cause a tiny hot-spot. This can cause some conversion of amorphous tantalum pentoxide to the more conductive crystalline form. When a high current is available, this effect can avalanche and the capacitor may become a total short.

Nevertheless, tantalum electrolytic capacitors can withstand for short instants a reverse voltage for a limited number of cycles. The most common guidelines for tantalum reverse voltage are:
* 10% of rated voltage to a maximum of 1&amp;nbsp;V at 25&amp;nbsp;°C,
* 3% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.5&amp;nbsp;V at 85&amp;nbsp;°C,
* 1% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.1&amp;nbsp;V at 125&amp;nbsp;°C.

These guidelines apply for short excursion and should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bishop, J.

===Impedance===

[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|140px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances X&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and resistance ESR and for illustration the impedance Z and dissipation factor tan δ]]

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, as well as other conventional capacitors, have two electrical functions. For [[timer]]s or similar applications, capacitors are seen as a storage component to store electrical energy. But for smoothing, bypassing, or [[decoupling capacitor|decoupling]] applications like in [[power supply|power supplies]], the capacitors work additionally as [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]s to filter undesired AC components from voltage rails. For this (biased) AC function the frequency dependent AC resistance ([[Electrical impedance|impedance]] ''"Z"'') is as important as the capacitance value.

[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverläufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values over frequency. As higher the capacitance as lower the resonance frequency.]]

The impedance is the [[Complex number|complex]] ratio of the voltage to the current with both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency in an AC circuit. In this sense impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to attenuate alternating currents and can be used like Ohms law
: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\hat u}{\hat \imath} = \frac{U_\mathrm{eff}}{I_\mathrm{eff}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The impedance is a frequency dependent AC resistance and possesses both magnitude and phase at a particular frequency. In data sheets of electrolytic capacitors, only the impedance magnitude ''|Z|'' is specified, and simply written as ''"Z"''. Regarding to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of tantalum electrolytic capacitors are measured and specified at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 100&amp;nbsp;kHz depending on the capacitance and voltage of the capacitor.

Besides measuring, the impedance can also be calculated using the idealized components out of a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, including an ideal capacitor ''C'', a resistor ''ESR'', and an inductance ''ESL''. In this case the impedance at the angular frequency ''ω'' therefore is given by the geometric (complex) addition of ''ESR'', by a capacitive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''

: &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

and by an inductive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' ([[Inductance]])

&lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then ''Z'' is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' have the same value (''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''), then the impedance will only be determined by ''ESR''. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ''ESL'' of the capacitor. At this point, the capacitor begins to behave primarily as an inductance.

===ESR and dissipation factor tan δ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[equivalent series resistance]] (''ESR'') summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the [[dielectric losses]] in the dielectric oxide layer.&lt;ref&gt;A. Berduque, Kemet, Low ESR Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitors for Medium to High Voltage Applications, [http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/DECEF7F25203B33E852578A400584ECC/$file/2011–03%20CARTS%20-%20Low%20ESR%20Aluminum%20Electrolytic%20Capacitors%20for%20Mid-to-High%20Voltage%20Applications.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

ESR influences the remaining superimposed AC [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] behind smoothing and may influence the circuit functionality. Related to the capacitor ESR is accountable for internal heat generation if a [[#ripple current]] flows over the capacitor. This internal heat may influence the reliability of tantalum electrolytic capacitors.

Generally, the ESR decreases with increasing frequency and temperature.&lt;ref name=DFR&gt;[http://www.dfrsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Uprating-of-Electrolytic-Capacitors.pdf Joelle Arnold, Uprating of Electrolytic Capacitors, DfR Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of electrolytic capacitors historically sometimes refer to the [[dissipation factor]], ''tan δ'', in the relevant data sheets instead of ''ESR''. The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the subtraction of capacitive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' from inductive reactance ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the ''ESR''. If the capacitor's inductance ''ESL'' is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = \mbox{ESR} \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

The dissipation factor ''tan δ'' is used for capacitors with very low losses in frequency determining circuits or [[resonant circuit]]s where the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor is called the [[Q factor|quality factor]] (''Q'') which represents a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].

===Ripple current===
[[File:rippelstrom mit Schaltplan.png|thumb|250px|The superimposed (DC biased) AC ripple current flow across the smoothing capacitor C1 of a power supply causes internal heat generation corresponding to the capacitors ''ESR'']]

A "ripple current" is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency upon a DC current. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.

Ripple currents generate heat inside the capacitor body. This dissipation power loss ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is caused by ''ESR'' and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) ripple current ''I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L} = I_R^2 \cdot ESR&lt;/math&gt;

This internal generated heat, in addition to the ambient temperature and possibly other external heat sources, leads to a capacitor body temperature having a temperature difference of ''Δ T'' against the ambient. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' over the capacitors surface ''A'' and the thermal resistance ''β'' to the ambient.

: &lt;math&gt; P_{th} = \Delta T \cdot A \cdot \beta&lt;/math&gt;

The internal generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient by [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and [[thermal conduction]]. The temperature of the capacitor, which is established on the balance between heat produced and distributed, should not exceed the capacitors maximum specified temperature.

The ripple current is specified as an effective (RMS) value at 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz or at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz at upper category temperature. Non-sinusoidal ripple currents have to be analyzed and separated into their component sinusoidal frequencies by means of [[Fourier analysis]] and the equivalent ripple current calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual currents.&lt;ref name=VishayIAC /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_R=\sqrt{{i_1}^2 + {i_2}^2  +  {i_3}^2 + {i_n}^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

In solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors the heat generated by the ripple current influences the reliability of the capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;I. Salisbury, AVX, Thermal Management of Surface Mounted Tantalum Capacitors [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/Tantalum-NiobiumCapacitors/thrmtant.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.W.

===Current surge, peak or pulse current===

Solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors can be damaged by surge, peak or pulse currents.&lt;ref name="AVXsurge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="code 562"/&gt; Tantalum capacitors, which are exposed to surge, peak or pulse currents should be used with a voltage derating up to 70% in highly inductive circuits. If possible, the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current seen by the capacitor.

===Leakage current===
[[File:Leakage current curves.svg|thumb|right|general leakage behavior of electrolytic capacitors: leakage current &lt;math&gt;I_{leak}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; depending of the kind of electrolyte

]]

The [[Leakage (electronics)|DC leakage current]] is a special characteristic for electrolytic capacitors other conventional capacitors don’t have. This current is represented by the resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;'' in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors. The main causes of leakage current for solid tantalum capacitors are electrical breakdown of the dielectric, conductive paths due to impurities or due to poor anodization, bypassing of dielectric due to excess manganese dioxide, due to moisture paths or due to cathode conductors (carbon, silver).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interstatemarketing.com/Papers/TechArticles/Tant-Niobium/leakage.pdf R.W. Franklin, AVX, AN EXPLORATION OF LEAKAGE CURRENT]&lt;/ref&gt; This leakage current in solid electrolyte capacitors cannot be reduced by "healing" in the sense of generating new oxide because under normal conditions solid electrolytes are unable to deliver oxygen for forming processes. This statement should not be confused with the self-healing process during field crystallization, as described in [[#Reliability (failure rate)|Reliability (failure rate)]].

The specification of the leakage current in datasheets often will be given by multiplication of the rated capacitance value ''C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''  with the value of the rated voltage ''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' together with an addendum figure, measured after a measuring time of 2 or 5 minutes, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Leak} = 0{.}01\,\mathrm{{A}\over{ V \cdot F}} \cdot U_\mathrm R \cdot C_\mathrm R + 3\,\mathrm{\mu A}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the leakage current depends on the voltage applied, on temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, and on influence of moisture caused by case sealing conditions. They normally have a very low leakage current, most much lower than the specified worst-case.

===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===
{{main article|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time retains some charge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage" or "battery action".

==Reliability and life time==

===Reliability (failure rate)===
[[File:Elko-Badewannenkurve-english.png|thumb|right|300px| [[Bathtub curve]] with times of “early failures”, “random failures”, and wear-out failures”. The time of random failures is the time of constant failure rate]]

The [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a component is a property that indicates how well a component performs its function in a time interval. It is subject to a [[stochastic process]] and can be described qualitatively and quantitatively; it is not directly measurable. The reliability of electrolytic capacitors are empirically determined by identifying the [[failure rate]] in production-accompanying [[endurance test]]s,  see [[Reliability engineering#Reliability testing]].

The reliability normally is shown in a [[bathtub curve]] and is divided into three areas: Early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failure types included in the total failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters).

The [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] prediction is generally expressed in a [[Failure rate]] λ, abbreviation '''FIT''' ('''F'''ailures '''I'''n '''T'''ime]. This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) component-hours of operation (e.g. 1000 components for 1&amp;nbsp;million hours, or 1&amp;nbsp; million components for 1000 hours which is 1&amp;nbsp;ppm/1000 hours) at fixed working conditions during the period of constant random failures. These failure rate model implicitly assume the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate. The standard operation conditions for the failure rate FIT are 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.

The reciprocal value of FIT is [[Mean Time Between Failures|MTBF]] ('''M'''ean '''T'''ime '''B'''etween '''F'''ailures).

For tantalum capacitors, often the failure rate is specified at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; as reference conditions and expressed as per cent failed components per thousand hours (n&amp;nbsp;%/1000&amp;nbsp;h). That is “n” number of failed components per 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; hours or in FIT the ten-thousand-fold value per 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours.

For conditions other than the standard operation conditions 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, for other temperature and voltage applied, for current load, capacitance value, circuit resistance, mechanical influences and humidity, the FIT figure can recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial&lt;ref&gt;IEC/EN 61709, Electric components. Reliability. Reference conditions for failure rates and stress models for conversion&lt;/ref&gt; or military&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-HDBK/MIL-HDBK-0200-0299/MIL-HDBK-217F_NOTICE-2_14590/ MIL-HDBK-217F Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt; contexts. For example, higher temperature and applied voltage cause the failure rate to increase.

The most often cited source for recalculation the failure rate is the MIL-HDBK-217F, the “bible” of failure rate calculations for electronic components.  SQC Online, the online statistical calculators for acceptance sampling and quality control gives an online tool for short examination to calculate given failure rate values to application conditions.&lt;ref&gt;SQC online table calculator, Capacitor Failure Rate Model, MIL-HDBK-217, Rev.

Tantalum capacitors are reliable components. Continuous improvement in tantalum powder and capacitor technologies have resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of impurities present, which formerly have caused most of the field crystallization failures. Commercially available tantalum capacitors now have reached as standard products the high MIL standard “C” level which is 0.01%/1000h at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or 1 failure per 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; hours at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=FC-Study&gt;T.Zednicek, AVX, A Study of Field Crystallization in Tantalum Capacitors and its effect on DCL and Reliability, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/FieldCrystallization.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Recalculated in FIT with the acceleration factors coming from MIL HDKB 217F at 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is this failure rate for a 100&amp;nbsp;µF/25&amp;nbsp;V tantalum chip capacitor used with a series resistance of 0.1&amp;nbsp;Ω  the failure rate is 0.02 FIT.

===Life time===
The [[Service life|life time]], [[service life]], load life or useful life of tantalum electrolytic capacitors depends entirely on the electrolyte used:

* Those using liquid electrolytes '''do not''' have a life time specification. (When hermetically sealed)
* Those using manganese dioxide electrolytes '''do not''' have a life time specification.
* Those using polymer electrolytes '''do''' have a life time specification.

The polymer electrolyte have a small deterioration of conductivity by a thermal degradation mechanism of the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreased, as a function of time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains.&lt;ref&gt;E.

===Failure modes and self-healing mechanism===
Tantalum capacitors show different electrical long-term behaviors depending on the electrolyte used. Application rules for types with an inherent failure mode are specified to ensure high reliability and long life.

Tantalum capacitors are reliable on the same very high level as other electronic components with very low failure rates. However, they have a single unique failure mode called “field crystallization".&lt;ref name=Goudswaard /&gt; Field crystallization is the major reason for degradation and catastrophic failures of solid tantalum capacitors.&lt;ref name="How Far"/&gt; More than 90% of the today's rare failures in tantalum solid-state electrolytic capacitors are caused by shorts or increased leakage current due to this failure mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elna-america.com/tech_tan_failurerates.php Elna, Failure Rates of Tantalum Chip Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The extremely thin oxide film of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor, the dielectric layer, must be formed in an amorphous structure. Changing the amorphous structure into a crystallized structure is reported to increase the conductivity by 1000 times, combined with an enlargement of the oxide volume.&lt;ref name="FC-Study"/&gt; The field crystallization followed by a [[dielectric breakdown]] is characterized by a sudden rise in leakage current within a few milliseconds, from nanoamp magnitude to amp magnitude in low-impedance circuits. Increasing current flow can accelerate in an "avalanche effect" and rapidly spread through the metal/oxide. This can result in various degrees of destruction from rather small, burned areas on the oxide to zigzag burned streaks covering large areas of the pellet or complete oxidation of the metal.&lt;ref name=VIS-DC /&gt; If the current source is unlimited a field crystallization may cause a capacitor [[short circuit]].  In this circumstance, the failure can be catastrophic if there is nothing to limit the available current, as the series resistance of the capacitor can become very low.
[[File:Self-Healing Effects-Ta-E-Caps2.jpg|thumb|right|250px| |If the current is limited in tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte, a self-healing process can take place, reducing MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into insulating Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Impurities, tiny mechanical damages, or imperfections in the dielectric can affect the structure, changing it from amorphous to crystalline structure and thus lowering the dielectric strength. The purity of the tantalum powder is one of the most important parameters for defining its risk of crystallization. Since the mid-1980s, manufactured tantalum powders have exhibited an increase in purity.

Surge currents after soldering-induced stresses may start crystallization, leading to insulation breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;A. Teverovsky, DERATING OF SURGE CURRENTS FOR TANTALUM CAPACITORS, Dell Services Federal Government, Inc. NASA/GSFC Greenbelt, MD20771, USA [https://nepp.nasa.gov/files/24745/2013_n240_Teverovsky_ESTEC_Derating_paper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to avoid catastrophic failures is to limit the current which can flow from the source in order to reduce the breakdown to a limited area. Current flowing through the crystallized area causes heating in the manganese dioxide cathode near the fault. At increased temperatures a chemical reaction then reduces the surrounding conductive manganese dioxide to the insulating [[manganese(III) oxide]] (Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and insulates the crystallized oxide in the tantalum oxide layer, stopping local current flow.&lt;ref name=VIS-DC /&gt;&lt;ref name=self-healing /&gt;

====Failure avoidance====

Solid tantalum capacitors with crystallization are most likely to fail at power-on.&lt;ref&gt;D.  Liu, MEI Technologies, Inc. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Failure Modes in Capacitors When Tested Under a Time-Varying Stress
[https://nepp.nasa.gov/files/21705/11_005_gsfc_Liu_Failure_Modes_in_Capacitors.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the voltage across the dielectric layer is the trigger mechanism for the breakdown and that the switch-on current pushes the collapse to a catastrophic failure. To prevent such sudden failures, manufacturers recommend:&lt;ref name=FC-Study /&gt;&lt;ref name=self-healing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/tales-from-the-cube/4363362/What-a-cap-astrophe- Jim Keith, What a cap-astrophe!,EDN, May 27, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 50% application voltage derating against rated voltage
* using a series resistance of 3&amp;nbsp;Ω/V or 
* using of circuits with slow power-up modes (soft-start circuits).

===Parallel connection===
Small or low voltage electrolytic capacitors may be safely connected in parallel. Large sizes capacitors, especially large sizes and high voltage types should be individually protected against sudden discharge of the whole bank due to a failed capacitor.

===Series connection===
Some applications like [[AC/AC converter]]s with DC-link for frequency controls in [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase grids]] need higher voltages than aluminum electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across each of the capacitors connected in series is proportional to the inverse of the individual capacitor’s leakage current. Since every capacitor differs a little bit in individual leakage current the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series connected capacitors is not symmetrically. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.&lt;ref name=VishayIAC&gt;Vishay BCcomponents, Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126094004/http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EpcosGTI&gt;Epcos, Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, General technical informations [http://www.epcos.de/blob/185386/download/4/pdf-generaltechnicalinformation.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polarity marking===
[[File:Polarity-rectangular-chips.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Polarity marking of tantalum electrolytic capacitors]]

All tantalum capacitors are polarized components, with distinctly marked positive or negative terminals. When subjected to reversed polarity (even briefly), the capacitor depolarizes and the dielectric oxide layer breaks down, which can cause it to fail even when later operated with correct polarity. If the failure is a short circuit (the most common occurrence), and current is not limited to a safe value, catastrophic thermal runaway may occur. This failure can even result in the capacitor forcefully ejecting its burning core. 

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte are marked at their positive terminal with a bar or a "+". Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte (axial leaded style) are marked on the negative terminal with a bar or a “-“ (minus). The polarity better can be identified on the shaped side of the case, which has the positive terminal. The different marking styles can cause dangerous confusion.

A particular cause of confusion is that on surface mount tantalum capacitors the positive terminal is marked with a bar. Whereas on aluminium surface mount capacitors it is the ''negative'' terminal that is so marked.

===Imprinted markings===

Tantalum capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. But most tantalum capacitors are chip types so the reduced space limits the imprinted signs to capacitance, tolerance, voltage and polarity.

Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M “V”, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10&lt;sup&gt;Z&lt;/sup&gt; pF), the letters K or M indicate the tolerance (±10% and ±20% respectively) and “V” represents the working voltage.

Examples:

* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 1 µF (K = ±10%) with a working voltage of 330 V.
* 476M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 47 µF (M = ±20%) with a working voltage of 100 V.

Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): µ47 = 0,47 µF, 4µ7 = 4,7 µF, 47µ = 47 µF

The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.

* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, "1208" is "2012, week number 8".
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: "R" = 2003, "S"= 2004, "T" = 2005, "U" = 2006, "V" = 2007, "W" = 2008, "X" = 2009, "A" = 2010, "B" = 2011, "C" = 2012, "D" = 2013, “E” = 2014 etc. Month codes are: "1" to "9" = Jan. to Sept., "O" = October, "N" = November, "D" = December. "X5" is then "2009, May"

For very small capacitors no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.

===Standardization===
The standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the '''Generic specification''':

* IEC/EN 60384-1: Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment

The tests and requirements to be met by aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following '''sectional specifications''':

* IEC/EN 60384-3—''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-15—''fixed tantalum capacitors with non-solid and solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-24—''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''

===Tantalum ore===
Tantalum capacitors are the main use of the element tantalum. Tantalum ore is one of the [[conflict minerals]]. Some [[non-governmental organization]]s are working together to raise awareness of the relationship between consumer electronic devices and conflict minerals.

===Market===
The market of tantalum electrolytic capacitors in 2008 was approximately US$2.2 billion, which was roughly 12% of the total capacitor market.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Capacitors, SIC 3675, NAICS 334414: Electronic Capacitor Manufacturing, Industry report: [http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/equipment/electronic-capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===
The low leakage and high capacity of tantalum capacitors favor their use in [[sample and hold]] circuits to achieve long hold duration, and some long duration timing circuits where precise timing is not critical. They are also often used for power supply rail decoupling in parallel with film or [[ceramic capacitor]]s which provide low [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]] and low [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] at high frequency. Tantalum capacitors can replace aluminum electrolytic capacitors in situations where the external environment or dense component packing results in a sustained hot internal environment and where high reliability is important. Equipment such as medical electronics and space equipment that require high quality and reliability makes use of tantalum capacitors.

An especially common application for low-voltage tantalum capacitors is power supply [[Filter capacitor|filtering]] on computer motherboards and in peripherals, due to their small size and long-term reliability.&lt;ref name="Prymak1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prymak, J.D. |title=New tantalum capacitors in power supply applications |journal=Industry Applications Conference, 1998 |volume=2 |pages=1129–1137 |year=1998 |doi=10.1109/IAS.1998.730289 |url= |isbn=0-7803-4943-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitz2007"&gt;Tamara Schmitz and Mike Wong [http://www.planetanalog.com/document.asp?doc_id=527521&amp;site=planetanalog Choosing and Using Bypass Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation''' ('''UNSCEAR''') was set up by resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1955. 21 states are designated to provide scientists to serve as members of the committee which holds formal meetings (sessions) annually and submits a report to the General Assembly. The organisation has no power to set radiation standards nor to make recommendations in regard to nuclear testing. It was established solely to "define precisely the present exposure of the population of the world to ionizing radiation." A small secretariat, located in Vienna and functionally linked to the [[UN Environment Program]], organizes the annual sessions and manages the preparation of documents for the Committee's scrutiny.

==Function==
[[File:International policy system radiological protection.png|thumb|400px|International policy relationships in radiological protection]]

UNSCEAR issues major public reports on ''Sources and Effects of [[Ionizing Radiation]]'' from time to time. As of 2017, there have been 28 major publications from 1958 to 2017.  The reports are all available from the UNSCEAR website. These works are very highly regarded as sources of authoritative information and are used throughout the world as a scientific basis for evaluation of radiation risk. The publications review studies undertaken separately from a range of sources. Reports from UN member states and other international organisations on data from survivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the [[Chernobyl disaster]], accidental, occupational, and medical exposure to [[ionizing radiation]].

==Administration==
Originally, in 1955, India and the Soviet Union wanted to add several neutralist and communist states, such as mainland China. Eventually a compromise with the US was made and Argentina, Belgium, Egypt and Mexico were permitted to join. The organisation was charged with collecting all available data on the effects of "ionising radiation upon man and his environment." (James J. Wadsworth - American representative to the General Assembly).

The Committee was originally based in the Secretariat Building in New York City, but moved to Vienna in 1974. 

The Secretaries of the Committee have been:

* Dr. Ray K. Appleyard (UK) (1956–1961)
* Dr. Francesco Sella (Italy) (1961–1974)
* Dr. [[Dan Jacobo Beninson]] (Argentina) (1974–1979)
* Dr. Giovanni Silini (Italy) (1980–1988)
* Dr. Burton Bennett (1988 acting; 1991–2000)
* Dr. Norman Gentner (2001–2004; 2005 acting)
* Dr. Malcolm Crick (2005–present)

'''Wood warping''' is a deviation from [[Flatness (manufacturing)|flatness]] in [[timber]] as a result of [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] and uneven shrinkage. Warping can also occur in wood considered "dry" (wood can take up and release [[moisture]] indefinitely), when it takes up moisture unevenly, or – especially – is allowed to return to its "dry" equilibrium state unevenly, too slowly, or too quickly. Many factors can contribute to wood warp; wood species, [[wood grain|grain]] orientation, air flow, sunlight, uneven [[wood finishing|finishing]], temperature – even cutting season and the moon's gravitational pull are taken into account in some traditions (e.g., [[violin making]]).

The types of wood warping include:

* '''bow''': a warp along the length of the face of the wood
* '''crook''': (also called wain) a warp along the length of the edge of the wood
* '''kink''': a localized crook, often due to a [[Wood#Knots|knot]]
* '''cup''': a warp across the width of the face, in which the edges are higher or lower than the center of the wood
* '''twist''' or '''wind''': a distortion in which the two ends do not lie on the same plane. [[Winding stick]]s assist in viewing this defect.

Wood warping costs the [[wood industry]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] millions of dollars per year. Straight wood boards that leave a cutting facility sometimes arrive at the store yard warped. This little understood process is finally being looked at in a serious way. Although wood warping has been studied for years, the warping control model for manufacturing [[composite wood]] hasn't been updated for about 40 years.

A researcher at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], Zhiyong Cai, has researched wood warping, and was working on a computer software program in 2003 to help manufacturers make changes in the manufacturing process so that wood doesn't arrive at its destination warped after it leaves the mill or factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.agrilife.org/2003/04/14/warped-idea-ways-to-stop-swayed-wood-may-be-around-the-bend/|title=WARPED IDEA: WAYS TO STOP SWAYED WOOD MAY BE AROUND THE BEND|last=|first=|date=|website=today.agrilife.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Cai, Zhiyong, Dickens, James R| title=Wood composite warping: Modeling and simulation| journal=Wood and fiber science| year=2004| volume=36| number=2| pages=174–185| publisher=Soc Wood Sc Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
