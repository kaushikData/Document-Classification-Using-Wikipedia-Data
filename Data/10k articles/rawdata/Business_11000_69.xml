'''Alasdair Antony Kenneth White''' (born May 24, 1952) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] management theorist best known for his work on [[performance management]] from a behavioural perspective and in the field of deconcentrated and networked organizations.  Along with John Fairhurst, White developed the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis relating to the performance life-cycle. He is also the author of ''Continuous Quality Improvement'' and ''The Essential Guide to Developing Your Staff''.

==Research==
In 2006, he worked closely with John Fairhurst and, following various observational studies, they formulated the White-Fairhurst Performance Hypothesis which states that "all performance will initially trend towards a steady state, particularly after a period of performance uplift, and that steady state will then develop a downward curve leading to a significant performance decline".

[[File:White-Fairhurst TPR Model.jpg|thumb|250px|right|White-Fairhurst TPR Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pm-solutions.com/ComfortZone_Performance.html |title=From Comfort Zone to Performance Management |last=Alasdair |first=White |date=November 2009 |publisher=Performance Management Solutions |accessdate=29 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421085837/http://www.pm-solutions.com/ComfortZone_Performance.html |archivedate=21 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In a paper entitled ''From Comfort Zone to Performance Management'', White examines the hypothesis from a theoretical perspective starting with the [[Comfort Zone Theory]] and the work of [[Robert Yerkes]] and John Dodson, David McClelland et al., the [[Tuckman Model]] and Colin Carnall. This theoretical examination leads White to conclude that the White-Fairhurst Hypothesis broadly holds true and the performance curve is as demonstrated in the White-Fairhurst TPR Life-cycle Model (TPR stands for Transforming, Performing, Reforming). There has been some criticism of White’s approach, suggesting that more recent sources and work would have been more appropriate, but none have been able to offer a counter-argument or to adequately refute or dispute the hypothesis. The fact remains that most of the fundamentals of performance behaviour were established in the last century and that the more recent work is itself based on this earlier work.

White argues that what is important now is to determine trend-change points on the performance curve so that the most appropriate performance management actions can be applied. He conducted research within a university environment in this relation to this and the result is recorded in his 2008 essay ''Managing Academic Performance'' the underlying theory of which underpins the approach being adopted by a number of academic institutions.

==Writing==
In addition to writing on management issues, White is also active in writing and editing fiction for White &amp; MacLean Publishing. Among those writings include the a political and action novel ''Shadows'', written under the pen-name of Alex Hunter.

'''Andrew Josef Feinstein''' (born 16 March 1964) is a former [[South African]] politician who currently resides in the [[United Kingdom]], but remains a South African citizen.

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Cape Town]] to Ralph Josef Feinstein and Erika Hemmer. He graduated from [[Wynberg Boys' High School]] in 1981, and received further education at [[King's College, Cambridge]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and the [[University of Cape Town]]. He married Simone Sultana on 18 December 1993, and has a son and a daughter. His interests include reading, classical &amp; jazz music, cinema, theatre, watching rugby, cricket &amp; soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/andrew-feinstein-3673|title=Andrew Feinstein {{!}} Who's Who SA|website=www.whoswhosa.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
A member of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), his political life began when he served as an advisor to [[Gauteng]]'s then-MEC of Finance, [[Jabu Moleketi]], from 1994 to 1996. He also worked as an economic advisor to then-premier [[Tokyo Sexwale]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Parliament of South Africa|South African Parliament]]'s [[National Assembly of South Africa|lower house]] in 1997. 

During his time in office, he served as chair of its study group on public accounts and ANC's official spokesman on the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]]'s public accounts committee. Feinstein was at the time referred to as "one of its most vocal and talented MPs", who argued that a thorough investigation into the [[South African Arms Deal]] had to be done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/2001/news0130.txt ''ANC seeks to play down Feinstein demotion'', SAPA, 29 February 2001.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resigned in 2001 when the ANC refused to launch an investigation into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/2001/pr0830c.html ''Statement by Andrew Feinstein MP'' - 30 August 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323082152/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/2001/pr0830c.html |date=23 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Geoff Doidge]] in both positions.

==Immigration to the UK==
He now resides in [[London]], where he chairs the Aids charity Friends of the [[Treatment Action Campaign]], and lectures and writes on South Africa. He also works as a Securities Coordinator for [[Investec Bank]] UK Ltd.

He is now considered an ANC dissident and critic, with his memoirs, ''After the Party'', being severely critical of the political culture of the ANC.

In an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', he noted the ways in which the global arms trade was linked to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/12/26/as_us_faces_gun_epidemic_post |title=As U.S. Faces Gun Epidemic Post-Newtown, Obama Urged to Break With NRA &amp; Back Global U.N. Arms Treaty |date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Feinstein published ''The Shadow World'', an investigation into the global [[arms industry]].  He reported "that the [[Arms industry|trade in weapons]] accounts for around 40 percent of all corruption in all world trade The .. trade in weapons is extremely closely tied into the mechanics of government. The defence manufacturers, those who make the weapons, are closely tied in to governments, to militaries, to intelligence agencies and crucially to political parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Is society inherently corrupt?

==Career==
In 1878, Drexel began working for his father's firm, [[Drexel &amp; Company|Drexel &amp; Co.]] in Philadelphia, and was made a partner on January 1, 1890.&lt;ref name="Rottenberg2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rottenberg|first1=Dan|title=The Man who Made Wall Street: Anthony J.

At the time, a close friend of his exclaimed to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "He does not care to assume the cares and responsibilities which are attached to the business. He is a young man who is very fond of life in the society. His pleasures would have to be curtailed immeasurably were he to continue closely identified with the business his father established, and he does not care for the confinement and close application to which he would be subjected. He prefers to be free footed, and will withdraw. That is all there is to his action. It is said it has no significant whatsoever."&lt;ref name="1893Resignation"/&gt;

The act of application retirement usually involves [[data migration|migrating data]] from the legacy application [[database]] to another [[Software repository|data repository]] or [[archive]] store that can be accessed independently using [[Standardization|industry standard]] reporting or [[business intelligence]] tools.

The '''Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry''' (ABPI) is the [[trade association]] for over 120 companies in the UK producing prescription medicines for humans, founded in 1891. It is the British equivalent of America's [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America|PhRMA]], however the member companies research, develop, manufacture and supply 80% of the medicines [[Prescription Only Medicines|prescribed]] through the [[National Health Service]].

==History==
The organisation was founded in London in 1891 and originally known as the "Drug Club". A rival institution to represent wholesalers, the "Northern Wholesale Druggists' Association", was formed in 1902 and lasted until 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Management and offices==
A board of management of members oversee the ABPI. The Board is made up of individuals who are elected by members to represent the industry and up to five people who are co-opted by the Board. Elections commence every January for elected seats to ensure that the Board is fully representative and has access to the broadest range of skills and expertise possible.

{{As of|2014}}, the Association's research director was Bina Rawal.&lt;ref name=piesing2014&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/23/tech-end-animals-drugs-testing | title=How tech could spell the end of animals in drugs testing | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=August 23, 2014 | author=Piesing, Mark | location=London | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABPI's head office is in London with three regional offices in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh.

==Membership==
ABPI membership is not open to individuals, only companies. Members fall into three categories:

* Full members who hold [[marketing authorization]] for, manufacture or supply [[prescription medicine]] for human use and undertake business in the UK
* Research affiliate members who carry out business in the UK and are involved in research and/or development of medicines for human use, but do not have a UK sales operation, for example [[Contract Research Organisation]]s (CROs) or [[Contract manufacturing organization]]s
* General affiliate members, who operate in the UK, have a business interest in the industry and will typically provide products or services to the industry, although not producing prescription medicines, for example law firms

==Functions==
The ABPI represents the views of the pharmaceutical industry to government and decision makers in the UK, i.e. is a [[lobbying organization]].

The organisation has six departments:
* Commercial
* Communications
* Legal
* Membership services
* [[NHS]] partnerships
* Research, medical and innovation

The medical and innovation department oversees complimentary resources for schools in UK to promote links between school science subjects and their applications in industrial research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpischools.org.uk/ ABPI resources for schools] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The department also runs a careers website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpicareers.org.uk ABPI Careers in the Pharmaceutical Industry] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The association sponsors booklets on a range of conditions, aimed at patients, carers and healthcare professionals.

The association has lobbied{{when|date=July 2017}} for the UK government to adopt the [[Directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions|European Union directive on biotechnology research]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Code of Practice==
The Code of Practice of the ABPI covers the promotion of medicines for prescribing to health professionals and administrative staff as well as the provision of information to the public about prescription only medicines in the UK. All ABPI member companies are obliged to comply with both the spirit and letter of the Code. The Code was first published in 1958 and undergoes revisions at least every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/thecode/InteractiveCode2016/Pages/default.aspx The Code of Practice of the ABPI] 2016 ABPI&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by the  Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority(PMCPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Criticism==
[[Ben Goldacre]] criticised the pharmaceutical industry in his 2012 book ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' as testing itself what it manufactures in "poorly designed trials, on hoplessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques that are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments".&lt;ref name=statesman&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/sci-tech/2012/10/ben-goldacre-v-association-british-pharmaceutical-industry "Dr Ben Goldacre vs the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry"], The ABPI responds to Ben Goldacre's book Bad Pharma.''New Statesman'', 19 October 2012. accessed 4 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  
The ABPI responded that medicines were "tested against the most effective comparator where possible unless there is no current standard of care." 
Regarding "results that companies don’t like, [which] they are perfectly entitled to hide [..] from doctors and patients . . . academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure." the ABPI responded that it  did "... not seek to “hide” trial data" and was recognising there was "still work to be done in ensuring the publication of negative trial data within journals, and in ensuring greater transparency all round within the industry".&lt;ref name=statesman/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">'''Available-to-promise''' ('''ATP''') is a business function that provides a response to customer order enquiries, based on resource availability.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, M.O. et al. (2004), "Available to Promise" in ''Handbook of Quantitative Supply Chain Analysis - Modeling in the E-Business Era'', Kluwer&lt;/ref&gt; It generates available quantities of the requested product, and delivery due dates. Therefore, ATP supports order promising and fulfillment, aiming to manage demand and match it to production plans.

Available-to-promise functions are IT-enabled and usually integrated in enterprise management [[software]] packages. However, ATP execution may need to be adjusted for the way a certain company operates.

== Classification ==
A fundamental distinction between ATP functions is based on the [[push-pull strategy]]. Push-based ATP is based on forecasts regarding future demand - based on anticipation of demand, ATP quantities and availability dates are computed. A prominent example is the traditional determination of ATP based on the [[Master Production Schedule]]. The push-based approach is fundamentally limited by dependence on [[forecasts]], which may prove inaccurate. Gross ATP represents the total available supply, and net ATP represents the supply remaining to support new demands, after existing commitments to customers have been accounted for.

Pull-based models, on the other hand, dynamically allocate resources in response to actual customer orders. This means that pull-based ATP is able to balance forecast-driven resource replenishment with order-triggered resource utilization,&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Z. (2005), "Optimization-based Available-to-promise with Multi Stage Resource Availability", Annals of Operations Research 135, 65-85&lt;/ref&gt; but because resources are allocated with each coming order, the process will yield myopic results.

== ATP Execution ==
ATP functions can be executed in real time, driven by each individual order, or in batch mode – meaning that at a certain time interval, the system checks availability for orders piled up in that period of time. The process is triggered by the need to check resource availability before making a commitment to deliver an order. For example, ATP calculation using SAP [[software]] depends on the level of "stock, planned receipts (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders and so on), and planned requirements (sales orders, deliveries, reservations, etc.)"

'''''Biotech Sweden''''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazine about and for the Scandinavian life science and biotech industry.

==History and profile==
''Biotech Sweden'' was first published on 9 April 2002 by IDG Sweden, a subsidiary of [[International Data Group|IDG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jan Sandred|title=Biotech Sweden – A Business Model Case Study in Innovation Journalism|url=http://innovationjournalism.org/archive/INJO-1-3_split/INJO-1-3_sandred.pdf|work=Innovation Journalism|accessdate=6 May 2015|format=Conference Paper|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sister publication of ''Bio-IT World''.&lt;ref name=ada/&gt; At its initial phase ''Biotech Sweden'' was published seven times a year.&lt;ref name=ada&gt;{{cite news|title=IDG to publish 'Biotech' magazine in Sweden|url=http://adage.com/article/btob/idg-publish-biotech-magazine-sweden/253684/|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=Ad Age|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it began to be published 11 times per year. The readers were mainly people working in the [[biotechnology]] [[Medical technology|medtech]] and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharma]] industry of the [[Nordic countries]]. It also carried the largest life science web news service of the Nordic countries, www.lifesciencesweden.se, with four newsletter distributed three times a week, subscription free-of-charge. On the website the magazine provided daily news in Swedish and a weekly news-letter covering life science news of the Nordic countries, plus also access to The Scandinavian Life Science Industry Guide, a database of all life science, medtech and labtech companies of Scandinavia. ''Life Science Sweden'' is also official media partner of Sweden Bio.

The [[editor-in-chief]]s included Ingrid Heath, Jörgen Lindqvist, Ingrid Helander and Loth Hammar.

In 2012, the magazine changed its name to ''Life Science Sweden'' and in 2013 it was sold to Mentor Communications AB.

In 1982, Christopher and his brother, [[Richard Chandler (businessman)|Richard]], took over the business and expanded it to ten stores, adding fashion design, manufacturing and real estate, before starting to look for international investment opportunities.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/christopher-chandler/ |title=Christopher Chandler |publisher=Forbes |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;

==Sovereign Capital==
In 1986, the brothers formed investment firm Sovereign Global in Monaco to focus on transitioning industries in Russia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile"/&gt; The business operated by investing in assets which it felt were mispriced in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout"/&gt;

One of the company's first major investments was in Hong Kong real estate, a market which investors had fled after the signing of the [[Sino-British_Joint_Declaration|Sino-British Accord]].&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout"/&gt; The company also invested in the Brazilian telecommunications industry, just after the country came out of hyperinflation, and in Russia, just after the fall of communism.

During the [[1997_Asian_financial_crisis|Asian banking crisis]], the brothers made significant investments in both Japan, including taking stakes in UHJ Holdings, Mizuho Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IISecrets" /&gt; The brothers of took a stake in South Korean refiner SK Corp., where they unsuccessfully tried to "oust" its CEO and Chairman.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IISecrets" /&gt;

In 2002, the brothers were the fourth largest investor in [[Gazprom]], the Russian state-controlled gas company.&lt;ref name="TimesLegatum"&gt;{{cite news |last=Leroux |first=Marcus |date=14 October 2017 |title=Christopher Chandler: billionaire behind Legatum think tank has unrivalled access to Brexit MPs |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/unrivalled-access-of-secretive-billionaire-christopher-chandler-funds-legatum-institute-885pb9vjc |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog of their representative on the Board, [[Boris Fyodorov]], was poisoned by cyanide, which allegedly may have been the result of their campaign to clean up the company's governance.&lt;ref name="TimesLegatum" /&gt;

==Legatum==
In 2006, Christopher founded Dubai-based [[Legatum|Legatum Capital]] after splitting off from his brother.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt; The company was co-founded with Mark Stoleson, Philip Vassiliou and Alan McCormick.&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout" /&gt;

Legatum is a private, multibillion-dollar investment firm that puts money into companies in developing countries as well as the world's capital markets.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt; In April 2012, Legatum acquired its own building in the [[Dubai_International_Financial_Centre|Dubai International Finance Centre]].&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Chandler is publicity shy and there exist few photographs of him nor much information about his personal life.&lt;ref name="GuardianSchool" /&gt; He enjoys windsurfing, water-skiing and riding motorcycles.&lt;ref name="IISecrets" /&gt;

The Chandler brothers bought [[La Fleur du Cap]] in [[Cap Ferrat]] for their parents.&lt;ref name="TimesLegatum" /&gt; It was previously owned by [[David Niven]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].

Chandler became a citizen of [[Malta]], a member-state of the [[European Union]], in 2016.&lt;ref name="ftmaltagrants"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Murchu|first1=Cynthia|title=Malta grants EU citizenship to Legatum backer|url=https://www.ft.com/content/110f57ee-02a3-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5?desktop=true|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=Financial Times|date=January 29, 2017|quote=The New Zealand-born billionaire behind Legatum, the London based think-tank that emerged as one of the most vocal advocates for Britain’s departure from the single market and the customs union, has obtained EU citizenship via Malta.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberta Metsola]], a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) representing [[Malta]], said in January 2018, when the news of his Maltese citizenship became public, that it was "surreal" that a [[Brexit]] backer had applied for an EU passport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180129/local/major-brexit-supporter-obtains-maltese-passport-ft.669224 Major Brexit supporter obtains Maltese passport - FT], ''[[Times of Malta]]'', January 29, 2018, accessed March 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently became clear that Chandler was not a Brexiter, and his application for Maltese citizenship was made before the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK referendum]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/apology-christopher-chandler], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 28, 2018, accessed October 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Downtown Club''', formerly known as the '''Downtown Athletic Club''', was a [[gentlemen's club|private social]] and athletic club in a 45-story building located at 20 [[West Side Highway|West Street]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[United States]]. It is currently in use as a residential building with [[condominium|condominiums]].

==History==
The Club was founded in 1926.  By 1927, it had purchased this site next to the [[Hudson River]] to construct its own building.  It was completed in 1930.

The high cost of land necessitated a tall building, and the relatively small lot size dictated that the different functions and facilities of the club, including [[swimming pool]], [[gym]]nasium, [[miniature golf]] course, [[Squash (sport)#The playing area (Court)|squash]], and [[tennis court]]s, as well as dining rooms and living quarters, be accommodated on separate floors.
The Club flirted with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. Discussions were held with local real estate developers to sell off the top hotel floors and for the Club to retain ownership of the lower floors; however, this never came to pass.

===Architecture===
The building was designed in a classic [[Art Deco]] decor.  Its [[architects]], [[Starrett &amp; van Vleck]] are also noted for designing several [[New York City]] department stores including [[Lord and Taylor]], [[Bloomingdales]] and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] shortly before the design of this Club. It has been designated as a landmark in New York, ensuring the building's unique architectural legacy.

===September 11 and subsequent bankruptcy===
The club was less than half a mile south of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and closed after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  The club never reopened, and declared bankruptcy in 2002.  The 45-story building is now a residential tower named "The Downtown Club" which opened in 2005.

The clubhouse within the building was not physically damaged in the attack on September 11, 2001, but it was located within the "frozen zone" from which the public was excluded for an extended period during the clean-up after the attack. The club's finances could not withstand the financial impact of such a long closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/sports/college-football-home-of-the-heisman-may-have-to-shut-doors.html|title=Home of the Heisman May Have to Shut Doors |date=2 November 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members, as well as the managers and employees, some who had been with the club for over 20 years, were devastated at the loss of the club and the employees' livelihood.

===Present day===
The Downtown Club building is registered as a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] landmark site.&lt;ref name=nyc1&gt;''[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/dac.pdf Downtown Athletic Club Designation Report]'', New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently home to condos and a preschool academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manhattan.tlechildcare.com |title=The Learning Experience |publisher=Children's Academy |date=|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtownclubny.com |title=Residences |publisher=The Downtown Club |date=|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heisman Trophy==
It was most famous for its annual awarding of the [[Heisman Trophy]] in its building, given every year to the most outstanding [[college football]] player, and named after [[John Heisman]], the club's first athletic director. The Heisman Trophy was relocated temporarily uptown to the [[Yale Club of New York City]].  The ceremony moved to the [[Hilton New York]] for 2004 and has been presented annually at the [[PlayStation Theater]] since 2005.

'''Enterprise control''' is the ability to combine control, intelligence and [[process management]] to enable business optimization that is inclusive of business and production operations. It combines the strength of both business processes and production operations processes.  It is the deliberate act of synchronizing [[business strategy]] with operational execution in real-time to enable closed loop [[business control]] across an enterprise.

==Key elements of enterprise control==

* [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP)
* [[Supply chain]]
* Environment and [[safety system]]s
* Assets
* People

Interoperating enterprise and industrial [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA) provide industrial companies with the potential for problem solutions that cover entire plants and entire industrial enterprises.  This enterprise-wide system can be developed using systems and technologies previously installed. The resulting system, consisting of multiple vendor products acquired over many years working as a single system, is what is referred to as an enterprise control system.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;''Automation Made Easy: Everything You Wanted to Know about Automation-and Need to Ask'' Peter G. Martin, Gregory Hale. {{ISBN|978-1936007066}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''enterprise control strategy''' is built around the premise that manufacturing needs an '''enterprise control system''' to integrate business systems and manufacturing in real-time. The concept of the enterprise control system encompasses everything from sensors and people in manufacturing to the ERP system.

{{quote|This logic does make sense since ERP systems have been refined over a number of years and they create tremendous efficiencies in business operations.   Certainly I and others see the need for this integrated systems approach in manufacturing. This seems to be an elusive concept except at manufacturing companies that have brilliant and industrious staff who assemble custom systems.|&lt;ref name=lydon&gt;Bill Lydon, Automation.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An enterprise control system is the [[open architecture]] framework to integrate control systems with the enterprise while adding functions to improve business performance including MES, optimization, workflow, quality management, and asset management.&lt;ref name=lydon/&gt;

==History==
A [[distributed control system]] gave way to process automation systems which lead the way for the concept of collaborative automation process systems developed by ARC Advisory Group&lt;ref&gt;ARC Advisory Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, enterprise control systems became key terminology in the marketplace.

{{quote|...[I]ndustrial automation interoperates with other functions within the enterprise. Trying to keep up with changing technologies, ... is never easy and the industrial automation environment is no exception. Whether you are a student just starting out or are a top-level executive or manager well-versed in one domain, but have limited knowledge of the industrial automation industry, it’s easy to find yourself adrift in this evolving industry.|&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;}}

ANSI/ISA-95, or [[ISA-95]] as it is more commonly referred, is an international standard for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. This standard has been developed for global manufacturers. It was developed to be applied in all industries, and in all sorts of processes, like batch processes, continuous and repetitive processes.

{{Admiralty law}}
The '''Hague Rules''' of 1924 (formally the "International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading, and Protocol of Signature")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/haguerules1924.html ''Admiralty Law Guide'']&lt;/ref&gt; is an international convention to impose minimum standards upon commercial carriers of goods by sea. Previously, only the common law&lt;ref&gt;''Liver Alkali v Johnson'' (1874) LR 9 Exch 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawandsea.net/COG/COG_Seaworthiness_3_absolute.html ''Law and Sea'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/G/Glynn_v_Margetson_1893_AC_351.html ''Glynn v Margetson'' (1893); AC 351 (1907) 1 KB 660;]&lt;/ref&gt; provided protection to cargo-owners; but the Hague Rules should not be seen as a "consumers' charter" for shippers because the 1924 Convention actually favoured carriers and reduced their obligations to shippers.

The Hague Rules represented the first attempt by the international community to find a workable and uniform way to address the problem of shipowners regularly excluding themselves from all liability for loss or damage to cargo. The objective of the Hague Rules was to establish a minimum mandatory liability of carriers.

Under the Hague Rules the shipper bears the cost of lost/damaged goods if they cannot prove that the vessel was unseaworthy, improperly manned or unable to safely transport and preserve the cargo, i.e. the carrier can avoid liability for risks resulting from human errors provided they exercise due diligence and their vessel is properly manned and seaworthy. These provisions have frequently been the subject of discussion between shipowners and cargo interests on whether they provide an appropriate balance in liability.

The Hague Rules form the basis of national legislation in almost all of the world's major trading nations, and cover nearly all the present international shipping. The Hague Rules have been updated by two protocols, but neither addressed the basic liability provisions, which remain unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bws.dk/conditions/sea-transport/hague-rules.aspx ''Sea Transport Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Rules were slightly amended (beginning in 1931, and further in 1977 and 1982) to become the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]. In addition, the [[United Nations|U.N.]] established a fairer and  more modern set of rules, the [[Hamburg Rules]] (effective 1992). Also a more radical and extensive set of rules is the [[Rotterdam Rules]], but as of November 2015, only 3 states have ratified these rules, so they are not yet in force.&lt;ref&gt;The Jackson Parton Miscellany, 2nd ed., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

 [http://www.herenvanholland.nl/eigenaar.cfm?eigenaarnummer=1810 Jacob Bicker in Heren van Holland]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in Amsterdam, he was a son of [[Gerrit Bicker]] and his wife [[Boelens Loen|Aleyd Andriesdr Boelens]]. He married Christina de Graeff (1609–1679), daughter of [[Jacob Dircksz de Graeff]] and of Aaltje Boelens Loen.

He was a leading member of the [[:Category:Bicker family|Bicker family]], a major trading family involved in the pelt trade with [[Muscovy]] and supplying ships and silver to Spain. Jacob also belonged to the ''Bickerse ligue'', which opposed stadhouder [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]]. Among his other posts, he held that of [[schepen]] of Amsterdam. In 1643 he inherited the castle and estate at Engelenburg near [[Herwijnen]] from his cousin [[Pieter Dircksz Graeff]] the castle and lordship of Engelenburg near [[Herwijnen]]. In 1647 he died in Amsterdam, shortly before the death of his brother [[Andries Bicker]].

Besides lands in [['s-Graveland (Noord-Holland)|'s-Graveland]] and [[Gooilust]], he also owned country houses in [[Baarn]], [[Soest (Nederland)|Soest]], [[Bilthoven]] and [[Hollandsche Rading]] buitenhuizen: '[[Laagte van Pijnenburg|De Eult]]', '[[Pijnenburg (landgoed)|Pijnenburg]]' and [[Kasteel de Hooge Vuursche]] .

'''Johann Culemeyer''' (16 October 1883 - 20 January 1951) was a German [[engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Lexicon der Eisenbahn |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culemeyer was born in Hanover in 1883 and, in 1936, he became a director of the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] and in that capacity was responsible for the construction, procurement and running of road vehicles, railway wagons and heavy transporters.

As early as 1931, he had designed a transportation system which was subsequently named after him, the "Culemeyer heavy [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berth.eu/waggon_de.html as at 31 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This heavy road trailer enabled the transportation of [[goods wagons]] on the road. These trailers initially had four axles with 16 solid rubber wheels. From 1935, a six-axle, 24-wheel version was also produced.

Under the [[slogan]] ''Die Eisenbahn ins Haus'' ('The Railway to Your Door')  goods wagons were brought to factories and other places that did not have their own railway links from the nearest loading station. It was patented on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1931 under the name ''Fahrbares Anschlussgleis'' ('Rail Link on Wheels') and demonstrated to the public for the first time on 24&amp;nbsp;April 1931 at the [[Anhalter Bahnhof]] in [[Berlin]].

In the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] the trailers were hauled by ''Kaelble'' tractors; the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR)]] in [[East Germany]] used ''[[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]'' tractors.

Whilst ''Culemeyer'' heavy trailers have been largely superseded on the roads by lorries, in some factories and firms they are still used occasionally.

On 4&amp;nbsp;November 1976 a private road belonging to the management of the former Reichsbahn authority (''[[VdeR]]'') in [[Berlin-Marienfelde]] ([[Tempelhof]]) was named after Johann Culemeyer. The road is open to public traffic and is a cul-de-sac with several industrial sites along it, including the ''Berliner Werk der Converteam Deutschland'' that in 1984 moved there as the [[AEG|AEG-Stromrichterfabrik]]. In the vicinity, there is also the ''Schwechtenstrasse'', named after the architect of the Anhalter Bahnhof.

Culemeyer died in 1951 in [[Nordholz]], [[Cuxhaven]], in north Germany.

'''John Cockburn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|ər|n}} {{respell|KOH|bərn}}) of [[Ormiston]], [[East Lothian]], (died 12 November 1758) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] landowner and politician who sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] from 1702 to 1707 and in the [[British House of Commons]] for 34 years from 1707 to 1741.

[[File:Ormiston Hall.jpg|thumb|Ormiston Hall, prior to the WWII fire which left it in ruins]]
He was the son of [[Adam Cockburn of Ormiston]], [[Lord Justice Clerk]], who he succeeded in 1735. He is known as the father of Scottish [[husbandry]].

Cockburn became a member of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] and took an active interest in accomplishing the union. He was the first representative of [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] in the parliament of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom of Great Britain]], and continued to hold that seat in all successive parliaments until 1741. He was one of the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]]. &lt;ref name = HOP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/cockburn-john-1679-1758| title= COCKBURN, John (c.1679-1758), of Ormiston, Haddington.| publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate =15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He built [[Ormiston Hall]] on his estate at [[Ormiston]]. This last Cockburn of Ormiston was an enthusiastic entrepreneur and eventually ruined himself as a result of which his estates were sold to the Earl of Hopetoun.

John Cockburn of Ormiston died in his son's house in the [[Navy Board|Navy Office]], London, England. He had firstly married Beatrix, daughter of [[John Carmichael, 1st Earl of Hyndford]], by whom he had no issue and secondly married Arabella, the daughter and coheiress of Anthony Rowe of Muswell Hall, Middlesex, with whom he had a son. His natural son, [[George Cockburne]] (d.1770), was a [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] in the [[Royal Navy]], and married Caroline, daughter of George Forrester, 5th Lord Forrester, with female issue.

'''John Thomas Madden''' A.M., C.P.A., Ph.D. (1882-1949) was an educator and business leader who served as the dean of NYU School of Business, introduced much of the modern procurement process, and served as president of [[Theta Nu Epsilon]] from 1926-1932 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041848/http://www.theamericanminerva.com/thetanuepsilon/11HisOff/Officers.html] and [[Beta Alpha Psi]], the finance, accounting and information systems fraternity from 1930-1932.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927035716/http://www.bap.org/annrep99/fmembers.htm]

Dean Madden was born to a New York City family, and was raised in the Protestant church. He was educated at [[Yale]] and [[New York University]] and worked both as an instructor and administrator at the latter while he was engaged in business as an accountant; he was also a member of [[Alpha Kappa Psi]] professional business fraternity.

From 1927-1940, Madden was dean of New York University's business school, serving as a professor through the thirties until 1947, while rendering procurement training to the military in World War II.  Dean Madden started an early form of inmate education using his faculty at Sing Sing. Dean Madden is quoted as saying "This idea is a mighty fine one, especially at this time. There are many men here who would not have been here five years ago. They committed no strange offenses. They merely carried on the business practices they had been used to. But these practices, with the advent of Depression, became criminal."[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746994,00.html]

In 1929, Dean Madden became the third President of [[Alexander Hamilton Institute]], a highly successful distance education business course started by his fellow [[New York University]] (NYU) instructor and predecessor as dean.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738018,00.html]

Dean Madden was also the major figure in developing the modern, professional procurement process.  He stated in his text, "Budgetary Control" (1930) that it has "became apparent that, due to the amount of dollars at stake, purchases are more effectively handled by an individual who could concentrate on the business of procurement. In transforming requests into materials for their organizations, procurement professionals also have to perform market analysis and do [[product forecasting]] as well as understand the law of contracts."

Dean Madden authored numerous texts of accounting, currency, mortgage banking and other business practices [http://www.antronics.com/cgi-bin/books/amazon.cgi?mode=books&amp;page_num=7&amp;search_type=AuthorSearch&amp;input_string=John+Madden&amp;templates=1&amp;locale=us] ; accounting historian Julia Grant names him as one of the "fathers of modern accounting". [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0815322380]

The educator and business leader was president of [[Theta Nu Epsilon]] from 1926-1932, and again (of the splintered TNE) from 1935 to 1946 and was active in [[the Andiron Club]]. The previous presidents of Theta Nu Epsilon were Joseph James Hartigan and Clarence J. Hand, students of Mr. Madden's at [[New York University]] (NYU).[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728104158/http://thetanuepsilon.org/11HisOff/Officers.html]

The John T. Madden Memorial Award at NYU's [[Stern School of Business]] are named in his honor and in recognition of his achievements.

On 2 November 2009 Cochrane became Group Chief Executive of [[Weir Group]] plc, having joined Weir as Group Finance Director in July 2006. He resigned as a director of Weir Group on 30 September 2016.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/krm0AUimqKgzdp2qRmHczhQBKFw/appointments |title=Keith Robertson Cochrane|publisher=[[Companies House]]|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane said that he was "looking for the next opportunity" and that the Weir Group had become "a bit samey".&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Keith Cochrane handed £770,000 to walk from Weir|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/company_news/15153650.Keith_Cochrane_handed___770_000_to_walk_from_Weir/|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cochrane was appointed as the lead "non-executive director” for the Scotland Office and Office of the Advocate General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15886349.Revealed__Carillion_boss_helps_Mundell_run_the_Scotland_Office/|title=David Mundell urged to drop Carillion interim chief executive as Scotland Office adviser|publisher=The Herald|date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochrane was appointed to the board of [[Carillion]] plc on 2 July 2015 and on 10 July 2017 he became its Interim Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/07/10/carillions-new-boss-promises-aggressive-plan-get-back-track/|title=Carillion's new boss promises 'aggressive' plan to get back on track|publisher=The Telegraph|date=10 July 2017|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in this position until the company went into [[Liquidation|voluntary liquidation]] on 15 January 2018.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Carillion to go into liquidation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42687032#|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, published on 16 May 2018, the Carillion board was described as "either negligently ignorant of the rotten culture at Carillion or complicit in it."&lt;ref name="Carillion report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|page=88|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report continued:
:"Keith Cochrane was an inside appointment as interim Chief Executive, having served as a non-executive on the board that exhibited little challenge or insight. He was unable to convince investors of his ability to lead and rebuild the company. ... Non-executives are there to scrutinise executive management. They have a particularly vital role in challenging risk management and strategy and should act as a bulwark against reckless executives. Carillion’s NEDs were, however, unable to provide any remotely convincing evidence of their effective impact."&lt;ref name="Carillion report"/&gt;

The report also recommended that the [[Insolvency Service]] should consider whether the former Carillion directors, including Cochrane, could be disqualified from acting as a director.&lt;ref name="Carillion report recommendation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|page=93|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Paid maternity leave is important for women to take time away from work to bond with a child without financial pressures. Of the 193 [[United Nations]] countries, only a handful do not have a paid-parental-leave policy: [[New Guinea]], [[Suriname]], the [[United States]] and a few South [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[Island country|island nation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/495839588/countries-around-the-world-beat-the-u-s-on-paid-parental-leave|title=Countries Around The World Beat The U.S. On Paid Parental Leave|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international history dates back to the 1970s, with countries such as Iraq granting full pay for women. By the 1980s, [[Great Britain]] was at the point of giving women benefits but did not specify a pay rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-timeline-maternity-leave-2113236.html|title=The Timeline: Maternity leave|date=2010-10-22|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of pay rates is limited and not well-recorded, except by the OECD.

== {{anchor|Different Kinds of Leave}}Types of leave ==
Maternity leave varies by country, with most developed countries having at least one set type of maternity leave. Most maternity leaves include a length of time to take off, with some form of pay. The following countries grouped by pay rate.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]] maternity-leave pay is known as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), which can cover up to 39 weeks of maternity leave. A woman can expect to earn 90 percent of her weekly earnings for the first six weeks of maternity leave; after that, the rate decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay|title=Maternity pay and leave - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia, Canada, and New Zealand ===
In Australia, women can receive up to 18 weeks minimum-wage from the government; if an employer offers paid leave, a mother can receive that as well. In Canada, a woman can receive 17 weeks of maternity leave: two weeks before giving birth and 15 weeks afterwards. The two weeks before birth are unpaid.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/family/PF2_5_Trends_in_leave_entitlements_around_childbirth_Annex.pdf|title=Annex: Detail of Change in Parental by Country|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, primary leave is 18 weeks of paid leave; special leave covers 10 days (spread out) for appointments or unpaid illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/types-of-parental-leave/|title=Types of parental leave » Employment|website=www.employment.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark, Greece, and Switzerland ===
In Denmark, a woman can receive 35 or 46 weeks of paid leave; the 35-week pay leave may be spread over 46 weeks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women in Greece must be insured to receive maternity benefits, which include 56 days before giving birth and 63 days afterwards. To receive the benefits a woman must stop working for 56 days. If she does not take 56 days off, the woman must add the days after giving birth to be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/greece/healthcare/pregnancy-birth/benefits|title=Maternity and Birth Benefits - Greece - Angloinfo|newspaper=Angloinfo|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, a woman is guaranteed up to 14 weeks (a minimum of 8 weeks) of paid leave after giving birth. She is paid 80 percent of her previous wage, with a daily maximum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Iceland, Japan, Turkey, and Slovak Republic}}Iceland, Japan, Turkey and Slovakia ===
Icelandic women receive 13 weeks of paid maternity leave (with an additional shared 13 weeks), with a ceiling of [[Icelandic króna|ISK]]370,000 per month. Japan allows 14 weeks if the woman is enrolled in the Employees' Health Insurance system. The leave can be taken by both parents in one absence period. There is a minimum payment of [[Japanese yen|¥]]46,230 per month and a maximum monthly payment of ¥285,420. Sixteen weeks of maternity leave  are on the condition that the employee was employed for 236 weeks by the 15th week before the first week of leave. There is no ceiling on payments for the first six weeks. [[Slovakia]] grants leave until the child's third birthday as a family entitlement, with a monthly benefit of €203.2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, and Sweden ===
Women in [[Cyprus]], including women who are adopting, receive 16 weeks of maternity leave. Nine weeks are mandatory, with the first two beginning two weeks before the expected due date. During this time, women receive a grant which serves as maternity pay. After maternity leave, women can apply to leave work an hour each day with pay for six months to help care for their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsi.gov.cy/mlsi/dl/dl.nsf/dmlposting_en/dmlposting_en?OpenDocument|title=Department of Labour - Employment Policy|website=www.mlsi.gov.cy|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Czech Republic]], women receive 28 weeks of paid maternity leave; the minimum leave is 14 weeks. Families can receive financial support for child care. Women in [[Hungary]] have the options of up to 24 weeks of maternity leave at 70-percent pay or financial support and job insurance to raise the child, with part-time work promoted. In [[Korea]], a woman receives 44 days of maternity leave before the birth and 90 days afterwards. During the first 60 days of the 90-day period, they receive full salary; during the last 30 days, they can receive up to [[South Korean won|₩]]1,350,000. [[Sweden|Swedish]] parents receive 480 days of maternity leave, with 90 days reserved for the father. The first 300 days are at 80-percent of pay, and the remainder is paid at a flat rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Italy, Latvia, Malta, and Romania ===
In [[Italy]], women receive 80 percent of their normal earnings for six months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Latvia]]n women are granted 114 days of paid leave, which may be extended based on health complications, the birth of more than one child or if there is more than one child under age two. When they return to work, mothers are allowed time to check on their child (or children).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/ifpdial/information-resources/national-labour-law-profiles/WCMS_158912/lang--en/index.htm|title=National Labour Law Profile: Latvia|date=2015-09-01|language=en|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malta|Maltese]] women receive 18 weeks of uninterrupted maternity leave. The first 14 weeks are full salary and benefits, and the last four weeks can be covered by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dier.gov.mt/en/Employment-Conditions/Leave/Pages/Maternity-Leave.aspx|title=Maternity Leave|website=dier.gov.mt|language=en|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Romania]], women have two options: a one-year leave at 75-percent salary, with a bonus when they return to work, or two years at 75 percent without the return bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lpg-roumanie.ro/en/publications/social/maternity-paternity-leave-in-romania|title=Maternity/Paternity leave in Romania|date=2014-12-19|newspaper=LPG Romania|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria, France, and Norway ===
In [[Bulgaria]] women receive 410 days of maternity leave at 90-percent salary, with 45 days granted before giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/bulgaria/healthcare/pregnancy-birth/maternity-leave|title=Maternity Leave, Allowance and Benefits - Bulgaria - Angloinfo|newspaper=Angloinfo|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France|French]] women are given 16 weeks of paid maternity leave for their first child, and time off increases with subsequent children. The amount paid is based on household income and how many children are already in the family. In [[Norway]], women can choose 49 weeks at 100 percent of salary or 59 weeks at 80 percent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to OECD research, 60 percent of countries offering maternity leave do not provide full pay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The table lists countries offering less than full salary, from lowest to highest.

These pay rates are the average of the paid leave for an individual earning 100 percent of the 2014 national average. In most countries, leave payments are calculated on gross earnings; however, in some—e.g., [[Austria]], [[Chile]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]—payments are based on net earnings (after income-tax and social-security payments). Pay rates in these countries reflect the proportion of net earnings replaced by the relevant payments, and should not be compared directly with pay rates based on gross earnings. Many countries have a variable rate; for example, [[Belgium]] gives women 82% of their salary for the first month. For the remaining three or four months (depending on the number of births) they receive 75 percent, with a cap of €133 per day.

Most OECD countries provide payments replacing over 50 percent of previous earnings, with twelve countries offering average-wage mothers full compensation for the leave. Pay rates are lowest in [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where only about one-third of gross average earnings are replaced by maternity benefits. Despite lengthy paid-leave entitlements, full-rate maternity leave in these countries is only nine weeks in Ireland and twelve in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf|title=Key Characteristic of Parental Leave Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Cecilia von Krusenstjerna]], his oldest daughter who grew up as the "Princess of Göteborg", has written a novel about the childhood of an upper class girl, the daughter of a business man in Göteborg, marked by [[eating disorder]] and self-disgust.  The novel is strongly critical towards Cecilia's upper-class background and, she admits, contains critic of both her parents but also purely fictional elements.  In the novel, the father is described as constantly unfaithful and the mother as failing to love her daughter.  Cecilia refuses to give any detail of what is purely fiction in the novel, but claims both her parents have read it and supports her.  Cecilia gave up a career as a journalist and has chosen not to make a career because of those of her parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Privatier''' ([{{IPA|pʀiˈvaˈtjeː}}], also spelled '''Privatus''', with the feminine forms '''Privata''' or '''Privatière''', meaning "private person") is a French word that was used from the 19th century in [[Germany]] and some other countries as a title by members of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] families of substantial financial means in lieu of another professional title. Much like [[wikt:rentier|rentier]], it denoted someone who did not have to work to make a living, and who lived off their assets of some size, e.g. [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from [[investor|investments]], [[real estate]] and [[current asset]]s. Sometimes, the title was used by affluent businessmen after they had wholly or largely retired from their former activity. For example, in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', the character Alois Permaneder, a former merchant, uses this title after his marriage to Tony Buddenbrook, after receiving a substantial [[dowry]] from her wealthy family, at which point he retires from business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mann]]: ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', part 6, chapter 8, Frankfurt 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''process model''' is used in various contexts. For example, in [[business process modeling]] the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''.

[[Image:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction level for processes&lt;ref name="Rolland1993"&gt;
[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). ''Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process. 3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Overview ==
Process models are [[wiktionary:Process|process]]es of the same nature that are classified together into a model. Thus, a process model is a description of a process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it. The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations. One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref name="Rolland1998"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] and Pernici, C. Thanos (1998). ''A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering. Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98''. B. [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] 1413. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of a process model are to be:
*Descriptive
**Track what actually happens during a process
**Take the point of view of an external observer who looks at the way a process has been performed and determines the improvements that must be made to make it perform more effectively or efficiently.
*Prescriptive
**Define the desired processes and how they should/could/might be performed.
**Establish rules, guidelines, and behavior patterns which, if followed, would lead to the desired process performance. They can range from strict enforcement to flexible guidance.
*Explanatory
**Provide explanations about the rationale of processes.
**Explore and evaluate the several possible courses of action based on rational [[argument]]s.
**Establish an explicit link between processes and the requirements that the model needs to fulfill.
**Pre-defines points at which data can be extracted for reporting purposes.

== Purpose ==
From a theoretical point of view, the [[meta-process modeling]] explains the key concepts needed to describe what happens in the development process, on what, when it happens, and why. From an operational point of view, the meta-process modeling is aimed at providing guidance for method engineers and application developers.&lt;ref name=Rolland1993/&gt;

The activity of [[business model|modeling a business]] process usually predicates a need to change processes or identify issues to be corrected. This transformation may or may not require IT involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process. [[Change management]] programmes are desired to put the processes into practice. With advances in technology from larger platform vendors, the vision of business process models (BPM) becoming fully executable (and capable of round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day. Supporting technologies include [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[model-driven architecture]], and [[service-oriented architecture]].

Process modeling addresses the process aspects of an enterprise [[business architecture]], leading to an all encompassing [[enterprise architecture]].  The relationships of a business processes in the context of the rest of the enterprise systems, data, organizational structure, strategies, etc. create greater capabilities in analyzing and planning a change. One real-world example is in corporate [[mergers and acquisitions]]; understanding the processes in both companies in detail, allowing management to identify redundancies resulting in a smoother merger.

Process modeling has always been a key aspect of [[business process reengineering]], and continuous improvement approaches seen in [[Six Sigma]].

== Classification of process models ==

=== By coverage ===
There are five types of coverage where the term process model has been defined differently:&lt;ref name="Dowson1988"&gt;M. Dowson (1998). ''Iteration in the Software Process, Proc 9th Int. Conf. on Software Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Activity-oriented: related set of activities conducted for the specific purpose of product definition; a set of partially ordered steps intended to reach a goal.&lt;ref name="Feiler1993"&gt;P.H. Feiler and [[W.S. Humphrey]]. (1993). ''Software Process Development and Enactment: Concepts and Definitions, Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. on "Software Process"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product-oriented: series of activities that cause sensitive product transformations to reach the desired product.&lt;ref name=Sianipar2014&gt;

* Decision-oriented: set of related decisions conducted for the specific purpose of product definition.
* Context-oriented: sequence of contexts causing successive product transformations under the influence of a decision taken in a context.
*Strategy-oriented: allow building models representing multi-approach processes and plan different possible ways to elaborate the product based on the notion of intention and strategy.&lt;ref name="Rolland1999"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1994). ''A Multi-Model View of Process Modelling. Requirements Engineering''. Vol 4, Nr 4. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By alignment ===
Processes can be of different kinds.&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt; These definitions "correspond to the various ways in which a process can be modelled".

* Strategic processes
** investigate alternative ways of doing a thing and eventually produce a plan for doing it
** are often creative and require human co-operation; thus, alternative generation and selection from an alternative are very critical activities
* Tactical processes
** help in the achievement of a plan
** are more concerned with the tactics to be adopted for actual plan achievement than with the development of a plan of achievement
* Implementation processes
** are the lowest level processes
** are directly concerned with the details of the ''what'' and ''how'' of plan implementation

=== By granularity ===
[[Granularity]] refers to the level of detail of a process model and affects the kind of guidance, explanation and trace that can be provided. Coarse granularity restricts these to a rather limited level of detail whereas fine granularity provides more detailed capability. The nature of granularity needed is dependent on the situation at hand.&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt;

Project manager, customer representatives, the general, top-level, or middle management require rather coarse-grained process description as they want to gain an overview of time, budget, and resource planning for their decisions. In contrast, software engineers, users, testers, analysts, or software system architects will prefer a fine-grained process model where the details of the model can provide them with instructions and important execution dependencies such as the dependencies between people.

While notations for fine-grained models exist, most traditional process models are coarse-grained descriptions. Process models should, ideally, provide a wide range of granularity (e.g. Process Weaver).&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernström1991"&gt;C. Fernström and L. Ohlsson (1991). ''Integration Needs in Process Enacted Environments, Proc. 1st Int. Conf. on the Software Process''. IEEE computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By flexibility ===
[[Image:flexibility.png|thumb|right|300px|Flexibility of Method construction approaches &lt;ref name="HBO"&gt;
A.F. Harmsen, [[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] and J.L.H. Oei  (1994). ''Situational Method Engineering for information Systems Project Approaches''. North Holland&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was found that while process models were prescriptive, in actual practice departures from the prescription can occur.&lt;ref name=Rolland1999/&gt; Thus, frameworks for adopting methods evolved so that systems development methods match specific organizational situations and thereby improve their usefulness. The development of such frameworks is also called situational [[method engineering]].

Method construction approaches can be organized in a flexibility spectrum ranging from 'low' to 'high'.&lt;ref name=HBO/&gt;

Lying at the 'low' end of this spectrum are rigid methods, whereas at the 'high' end there are modular method construction. Rigid methods are completely pre-defined and leave little scope for adapting them to the situation at hand. On the other hand, modular methods can be modified and augmented to fit a given situation. Selecting a rigid methods allows each project to choose its method from a panel of rigid, pre-defined methods, whereas selecting a path within a method consists of choosing the appropriate path for the situation at hand. Finally, selecting and tuning a method allows each project to select methods from different approaches and tune them to the project's needs." &lt;ref name="Rolland1997"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1997). 'A Primer for Method Engineering. Proceedings of the INFORSID Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of methods ==

As the quality of process models is being discussed in this paper, there is a need to elaborate quality of modeling techniques as an important essence in quality of process models.  In most existing frameworks created for understanding the quality, the line between quality of modeling techniques and the quality of models as a result of the application of those techniques are not clearly drawn.  This report will concentrate both on quality of process modeling techniques and quality of process models to clearly differentiate the two.
Various frameworks were developed to help in understanding quality of process modeling techniques, one example is Quality based modeling evaluation framework or known as Q-Me framework which argued to provide set of well defined quality properties and procedures to make an objective assessment of this properties possible.&lt;ref name=hommes/&gt;
This framework also has advantages of providing uniform and formal description of the model element within one or different model types using one modeling techniques&lt;ref name=hommes&gt;BJ Hommes, V Van Reijswoud, Assessing the Quality of Business Process Modeling Techniques -Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences – 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
In short this can make assessment of both the product quality and the process quality of modeling techniques with regard to a set of properties that have been defined before.

Quality properties that relate to [[business process modeling]] techniques discussed in &lt;ref name=hommes/&gt; are:

* Expressiveness: the degree to which a given modeling technique is able to denote the models of any number and kinds of application domains.
* Arbitrariness: the degree of freedom one has when modeling one and the same domain
* Suitability: the degree to which a given modeling technique is specifically tailored for a specific kind of application domain.
* Comprehensibility: the ease with which the way of working and way of modeling are understood by participants.
* Coherence: the degree to which the individual sub models of a way of modeling constitute a whole.
* Completeness; the degree to which all necessary concepts of the application domain are represented in the way of modeling.
* Efficiency: the degree to which the modeling process uses resources such as time and people.
* Effectiveness: the degree to which the modeling process achieves its goal.

To assess the quality of Q-ME framework; it is used to illustrate the quality of the dynamic essentials modeling of the organisation (DEMO) business modeling techniques.

It is stated that the evaluation of the Q-ME framework to the DEMO modeling techniques has revealed the shortcomings of Q-ME. One particular is that it does not include quantifiable metric to express the quality of business modeling technique which makes it hard to compare quality of different techniques in an overall rating.

There is also a systematic approach for quality measurement of modeling techniques known as complexity metrics suggested by Rossi et al. (1996). Techniques of Meta model is used as a basis for computation of these complexity metrics. In comparison to quality framework proposed by [[John Krogstie|Krogstie]], quality measurement focus more on technical level instead of individual model level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bart-Jan Hommes, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220260389_Business_Process_Change_A_Study_of_Methodologies_Techniques_and_Tools/file/72e7e52a1d6f118dba.pdf The evaluation of business process modeling techniques],'' phd thesis TU Delft 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used complexity metrics to measure the simplicity and understandability of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling ''et al.'' who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn can lead to a lower understandability, higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.&lt;ref name="MendlingMoserBPM"&gt;J. Mendling, M. Moser, G. Neumann, H. Verbeek, B. Dongen, W. van der Aalst, A Quantitative Analysis of Faulty EPCs in the SAP Reference Model, BPM Center Report BPM-06-08, BPMCenter.org, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of modeling technique is important in creating models that are of quality and contribute to the correctness and usefulness of models.

== Quality of models ==
Earliest process models reflected the dynamics of the process with a practical process obtained by instantiation in terms of relevant concepts, available technologies, specific implementation environments, process constraints and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Enormous number of research has been done on quality of models but less focus has been shifted towards the quality of process models. Quality issues of process models cannot be evaluated exhaustively however there are four main guidelines and frameworks in practice for such. These are: top-down quality frameworks, bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects, empirical surveys related to modeling techniques, and pragmatic guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Mendling |first2=H. A. |last2=Reijers |first3=W. M. P. |last3=van der Aalst |title=Seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG) |journal=Information and Software Technology |volume=52 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=127–136 |doi=10.1016/j.infsof.2009.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hommes quoted Wang ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt; that all the main characteristic of quality of models can all be grouped under 2 groups namely correctness and usefulness of a model, correctness ranges from the model correspondence to the phenomenon that is modeled to its correspondence to syntactical rules of the modeling and also it is independent of the purpose to which the model is used.

Whereas the usefulness can be seen as the model being helpful for the specific purpose at hand for which the model is constructed at first place. Hommes also  makes a further distinction between internal correctness (empirical, syntactical and semantic quality) and external correctness (validity).

A common starting point for defining the quality of conceptual model is to look at the linguistic properties of the modeling language of which syntax and semantics are most often applied.

Also the broader approach is to be based on semiotics rather than linguistic as was done by Krogstie using the top-down quality framework known as SEQUAL.&lt;ref name=krogstie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Lindland |first2=G. |last2=Sindre |first3=A. |last3=Sølvberg |title=Understanding quality in conceptual modeling |journal=IEEE Software |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=1994 |pages=42–49 |doi=10.1109/52.268955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, knowledge Externalisation, domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.

The framework does not however provide ways to determine various degrees of quality but has been used extensively for business process modeling in empirical tests carried out &lt;ref&gt;D. Moody, G. Sindre, T. Brasethvik and A. Sølvberg, Evaluating the quality of process models: empirical testing of a quality framework. In: S. Spaccapietra, S.T. March and Y. Kambayashi, Editors, Conceptual Modeling – ER 2002, 21st International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Tampere, Finland, October 7–11, 2002, Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 2503, Springer (2002), pp. 380–396.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to previous research done by Moody ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Moody, G. Sindre, T. Brasethvik, A. Sølvberg. Evaluating the Quality of Process Models: Empirical Testing of a Quality Framework&lt;/ref&gt; with use of conceptual model quality framework proposed by Lindland ''et al.'' (1994) to evaluate quality of process model, three levels of quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=C. W. |year=1970 |title=Foundations of the Theory of Signs |location=Chicago |publisher=Chicago University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; were identified:

* Syntactic quality: Assesses extent to which the model conforms to the grammar rules of modeling language being used.
* Semantic quality: whether the model accurately represents user requirements
* Pragmatic quality: whether the model can be understood sufficiently by all relevant stakeholders in the modeling process. That is the model should enable its interpreters to make use of it for fulfilling their need.

From the research it was noticed that the quality framework was found to be both easy to use and useful in evaluating the quality of process models however it had limitations in regards to reliability and difficult to identify defects. These limitations led to refinement of the framework through subsequent research done by [[John Krogstie|Krogstie]]. This framework is called SEQUEL framework by Krogstie ''et al.'' 1995 (Refined further by Krogstie &amp; Jørgensen, 2002) which included three more quality aspects.

* Physical quality: whether the externalized model is persistent and available for the audience to make sense of it.
* Empirical quality: whether the model is modeled according to the established regulations regarding a given language.
* Social quality: This regards the agreement between the stakeholders in the modeling domain.

Dimensions of Conceptual Quality framework&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie|J. Krogstie]], O. Lindland, G. Sindre, Defining quality aspects for conceptual models, in: Proc. IFIP8.1 Working Conference on Information Systems Concepts: Towards a Consolidation of Views, Marburg, Germany, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modeling Domain is the set of all statements that are relevant and correct for describing a problem domain, Language Extension is the set of all statements that are possible given the grammar and vocabulary of the modeling languages used. Model Externalization is the conceptual representation of the problem domain.

It is defined as the set of statements about the problem domain that are actually made. Social Actor Interpretation and Technical Actor Interpretation are the sets of statements that actors both human model users and the tools that interact with the model, respectively 'think' the conceptual representation of the problem domain contains.

Finally, Participant Knowledge is the set of statements that human actors, who are involved in the modeling process, believe should be made to represent the problem domain. These quality dimensions were later divided into two groups that deal with physical and social aspects of the model.

In later work, Krogstie et al.&lt;ref name=krogstie/&gt; stated that while the extension of the SEQUAL framework  has fixed some of the limitation of the initial framework, however other limitation remain .
In particular, the framework is too static in its view upon semantic quality, mainly considering models, not modeling activities, and comparing these models to a static domain rather than seeing the model as a facilitator for changing the domain.

Also, the framework's definition of pragmatic quality is quite narrow, focusing on understanding, in line with the semiotics of Morris, while newer research in linguistics and semiotics has focused beyond mere understanding, on how the model is used and affects its interpreters.

The need for a more dynamic view in the semiotic quality framework is particularly evident when considering process models, which themselves often prescribe or even enact actions in the problem domain, hence a change to the model may also change the problem domain directly. This paper discusses the quality framework in relation to active process models and suggests a revised framework based on this.

Further work by Krogstie ''et al.'' (2006) to revise SEQUAL framework to be more appropriate for active process models  by redefining physical quality with a more narrow interpretation than previous research.&lt;ref name =krogstie&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Krogstie |first2=G. |last2=Sindre |first3=H. |last3=Jorgensen |title=Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework |journal=European Journal of Information Systems |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=91–102 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other framework in use is Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) &lt;ref&gt;J. Becker, M. Rosemann and C. Uthmann, Guidelines of business process modeling. In: W. van der Aalst, J. Desel and A. Oberweis, Editors, Business Process Management. Models, Techniques, and Empirical Studies, Springer, Berlin (2000), pp. 30–49&lt;/ref&gt; based on general accounting principles include the six principles: Correctness, Clarity deals with the comprehensibility and explicitness (System description) of model systems.
Comprehensibility relates to graphical arrangement of the information objects and, therefore, supports the understand ability of a model.
Relevance relates to the model and the situation being presented. Comparability involves the ability to compare models that is semantic comparison between two models, Economic efficiency; the produced cost of the design process need at least to be covered by the proposed use of cost cuttings and revenue increases.

Since the purpose of organizations in most cases is the maximization of profit, the principle defines the borderline for the modeling process. The last principle is Systematic design defines that there should be an accepted differentiation between diverse views within modeling.
Correctness, relevance and economic efficiency are prerequisites in the quality of models and must be fulfilled while the remaining guidelines are optional but necessary.

The two frameworks SEQUAL and GOM have a limitation of use in that they cannot be used by people who are not competent with modeling. They provide major quality metrics but are not easily applicable by non-experts.

The use of bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects of process models is trying to bridge the gap of use of the other two frameworks by non-experts in modeling but it is mostly theoretical and no empirical tests have been carried out to support their use.

Most experiments carried out relate to the relationship between metrics and quality aspects and these works have been done individually by different authors: Canfora et al. study the connection mainly between count metrics (for example, the number of tasks or splits -and maintainability of software process models);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Canfora |first2=F. |last2=Garcia |first3=M. |last3=Piattini |first4=F. |last4=Ruiz |first5=C. |last5=Visaggio |title=A family of experiments to validate metrics for software process models |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |volume=77 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=113–129 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2004.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso validates the correlation between control flow complexity and perceived complexity; and Mendling et al. use metrics to predict control flow errors such as deadlocks in process models.&lt;ref name=MendlingMoserBPM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling, Detection and prediction of errors in epc business process models, Ph.D. thesis, Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, http://wi.wu-wien.ac.at/home/mendling/publications/Mendling%20Doctoral%20thesis.pdf, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results reveal that an increase in size of a model appears to reduce its quality and comprehensibility.
Further work by Mendling et al. investigates the connection between metrics and understanding &lt;ref name=mendling14/&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling and M. Strembeck, Influence factors of understanding business process models. In: W. Abramowicz and D. Fensel, Editors, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Business Information Systems (BIS 2008), Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing vol. 7, Springer-Verlag (2008), p. 142153.&lt;/ref&gt; While some metrics are confirmed regarding their effect, also personal factors of the modeler – like competence – are revealed as important for understanding about the models.

Several empirical surveys carried out still do not give clear guidelines or ways of evaluating the quality of process models but it is necessary to have clear set of guidelines to guide modelers in this task. Pragmatic guidelines have been proposed by different practitioners even though it is difficult to provide an exhaustive account of such guidelines from practice.
In,&lt;ref&gt;B.Silver, Ten Tips for Effective Process Modeling,BPMInstitute.org, &lt;http://www.bpminstitute.org/articles/article/article/bpms-watch-ten-tips-for-effective-process-modeling.html&gt;, Wednesday January 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 10 tips for process modeling are summarized, many technical definitions and rules are provided, but it does not teach how to create process models that are effective in their primary mission - maximizing shared understanding of the as-is or to-be process.
Most of the guidelines are not easily put to practice but "label activities verb–noun" rule has been suggested by other practitioners before and analyzed empirically.
From the research.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling, H.A. Reijers, J. Recker, Activity Labeling in Process Modeling: Empirical Insights and Recommendations, Information Systems. URL: &lt;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/19625/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; value of process models is not only dependent on the choice of graphical constructs but also on their annotation with textual labels which need to be analyzed. It was found that it results in better models in terms of understanding than alternative labelling styles.

From the earlier research and ways to evaluate process model quality it has been seen that the process model's size, structure, expertise of the modeler and modularity affect its overall comprehensibility.&lt;ref name=mendling14&gt;J. Mendling, H.A. Reijers and J. Cardoso, What makes process models understandable? In: G. Alonso, P. Dadam and M. Rosemann, Editors, Business Process Management, 5th International Conference, BPM 2007, Brisbane, Australia, September 24–28, 2007, Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 4714, Springer, Brisbane, Australia (2007), pp. 48–63.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Reijers, J. Mendling, Modularity in process models: Review and effects in: M. Dumas, M. Reichert, M.-C. Shan (Eds.), Business Process Management BPM 2008, Vol. 5240 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Milan, Italy, 2008, pp. 20-35&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these a set of guidelines was presented&lt;ref name=mendling19&gt;J. Mendling, H. A. Reijers, W. M. P. van der Aalst, Seven process modeling guidelines (7pmg), QUT ePrints Report 12340, Queensland University of Technology (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 7 Process Modeling Guidelines (7PMG). This guideline uses the verb-object style, as well as guidelines on the number of elements in a model, the application of structured modeling, and the decomposition of a process model. The guidelines are as follows:

* G1 Minimize the number of elements in a model
* G2 Minimize the routing paths per element
* G3 Use one start and one end event
* G4 Model as structured as possible
* G5 Avoid OR routing elements
* G6 Use verb-object activity labels
* G7 Decompose a model with more than 50 elements

7PMG still though has limitations with its use: Validity problem 7PMG does not relate to the content of a process model, but only to the way this content is organized and represented.
It does suggest ways of organizing different structures of the process model while the content is kept intact but the pragmatic issue of what must be included in the model is still left out.
The second limitation relates to the prioritizing guideline the derived ranking has a small empirical basis as it relies on the involvement of 21 process modelers only.

This could be seen on the one hand as a need for a wider involvement of process modelers' experience, but it also rises the question what alternative approaches may be available to arrive at a prioritizing guideline.&lt;ref name=mendling19/&gt;

'''Raymond Rubicam''' (June 16, 1892 – May 8, 1978) was an American advertising pioneer who co-established the [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] (Y&amp;R) [[advertising agency]] with [[John Orr Young]]. He retired from Y&amp;R in 1944 at age 52.

Raymond Rubicam's innovative leadership and creativity led many to recognize him as "advertising's statesman." Because his creative concepts and innovations have continued to play an important role in advertising as we know it today many people consider him the "father of modern advertising".

==Biography==
As a young copywriter for N.W. Ayer and Son, Rubicam was responsible for some of advertising's most memorable pieces. Steinway's "The Instrument of the Immortals," Squibb's "The Priceless Ingredient," and Rolls-Royce's "No Rolls-Royce has ever worn out," were highly successful slogans which made him one of the industry's leading copywriters. While he enjoyed considerable success at N.W. Ayer, he felt that the agency failed to emphasize the importance of the creative artist in advertising. Rubicam, seeking to create an agency that valued artistic and creative talent over business, joined with James Orr Young to found Young &amp; Rubicam in 1923.

Rubicam's skills and his recruitment of the industry's most talented specialists propelled Young &amp; Rubicam into the forefront of advertising. David Ogilvy credited Rubicam with assembling "the best team of copywriters and art directors in the history of advertising," whose advertisements "were read by more people than any other agency's." The agency represented many of America's leading companies, such as Gulf Oil, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Fortune, Life and others.

While Raymond Rubicam's emphasis on creativity was innovative in itself, his philosophy and copywriting approach revolutionized the industry. He believed that an advertisement should "mirror the reader." Knowledge and understanding of the customer was a critical component of effective advertising. With the help of Dr. George Gallup, Rubicam pioneered new methods of consumer and media research. Young &amp; Rubicam was the first agency to use scientific telephone sampling and to test audiences to measure the success of commercials and advertisements. The agency was also one of the first to produce their own programs, often integrating commercials into radio shows. The development of the "sequence-picture copy" was another Rubicam innovation. His was the first agency to use comic strips as a medium for advertising, creating "Mr. Coffee Nerves" for Postum and "Little Alby" for Grape-Nuts.

Under his direction, Young &amp; Rubicam made significant contributions to the war effort during World War II. The agency donated its time and resources to the War Advertising Council, the Treasury Department on War Loan Drives and to the Department of Agriculture for farm labor recruitment campaigns. Independently, Rubicam served as a special assistant to the War Manpower Commission, director of United China Relief, and later as a member of the Committee for Economic Development. The CED worked to support the United States during the war and significantly influenced policy following its conclusion.

Rubicam also occupied several positions in the business world and contributed to the development of his community. He served as the director of the New York Life Insurance Company, Bates Manufacturing and Valley National Bank.

==Biography==
He was born in New York on February 25, 1911. He attended [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. He attended [[Columbia University]] and graduated in 1934. He then attended [[New York University School of Law]]. He served as a lieutenant in the [[United States Navy]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre during World War II]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert F.

During her early childhood, Schlossberg attended [[Brearley School]] on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Heymann359AL07"&gt;Heymann, 2007, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[first grade]], she went on a school [[field trip]] to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] accompanied by her grandmother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. "She was the only grandparent in the group," said a father whose daughter was in the same class as Schlossberg.&lt;ref name="Heymann359AL07"/&gt;

In 1999, Schlossberg's uncle [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]], with whom she was close, died in a [[John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash|plane crash]].

== Education and career ==

In [[law]], '''set-off''' or '''netting''' are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities, replacing gross positions with net positions.&lt;ref&gt;David Southern ''Set off revisited'' (1994) NJL 1412, 1412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd v Westminster Bank Ltd'' [1970] 3 All ER 473 at 488, per Buckley LJ&lt;/ref&gt; It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a [[plaintiff]] and a [[respondent]]. The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single, net claim.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, ''Financial Law'' (2007, Oxford University Press), p264&lt;/ref&gt; The net claim is known as a '''[[Financial law|net position]]'''. In other words, a set-off is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor.  In bookkeeping terms, set-offs are also known as reconciliations.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  To determine a set-off, simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger. 

Any balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed, but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off. The power of net positions is to reduce [[credit risk|credit exposure]], also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages, which contributes to [[market stability]]. In regard to the financial market, net positions are vital.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, ''Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between Set off and Netting==
Whilst '''netting''' and '''set off''' are often used interchangeably, the legal distinction is made between ''netting'', which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a ''set off''. By contrast ''set off'' describes the legal bases for producing net positions. ''Netting'' describes the form such as '''novation netting''', or '''close-out netting''', whilst ''set off'' describes judicially recognised grounds such as '''independent set off''' or '''insolvency set off'''. Therefore, a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter-party to address counter-party credit risk. This is to be differentiated from [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk.

===Mutuality===
The law does not permit counter-parties to use third party debt to set off against an un-related liability.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood ''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim. This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out, primarily by ensuring that a non-owner cannot benefit from insolvency.

==Market Effect==
The primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties. This prevents credit risk exposure, and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry-picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Milman ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (2016, Cambridge University Press, Third edition)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Netting==
At least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.worldbank.org/finance/assets/images/Woltjer_paper.pdf |title=Risk Management in Netting schemes for settlement of securities transactions |publisher=World Bank |date=March 2002 |author=Jan Woltjer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market, specifically credit, [[financial risk|risk]]
{{Quote|Since claims are a major form of property nowadays and since creditors are often also debtors to the same counterparty, the law of set off is of paramount importance in international affairs|author=P.Wood|title=''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 72}} 

===Novation Netting===
Also called '''rolling netting''', netting by [[novation]] involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties. This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims.
{{Quote|Suppose that on Monday, 'A' and 'B' enter into transaction-1, whereby A agrees to pay B £1,000,000 on Thursday. On Tuesday A and B enter into transaction-2, whereby B agrees to pay A £400,000 on Thursday. Novation netting takes effect on Tuesday to extinguish the obligations of the parties under both transaction 1 and 2, and to create in their place a new obligation on A to pay to B £600,000 on Thursday.|author=Benjamin,Joanna|title=''Financial law'' (2007, Oxford University Press), 267}}
This differs from '''settlement netting''' (outlined below) because the fusion of both claims into one, producing a single balance, occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract. This method of netting is crucial in financial settings, particularly derivatives transactions, as it avoids cherry-picking in insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;''Commissioner for HMRC v Entin'' [2006] BCC 955 per Lightman J [21]&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of pre-insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in ''[[British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France]]''[1975] 1 WLR 758. Similar to '''settlement netting''', novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date. This means that if, in the above example, transaction-2 was to be paid on Friday, the two transactions would not offset. Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations. This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due.

===Close out netting===
An effective close-out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market.&lt;ref&gt;EFMLG ''The regulation of close out netting in the new member states of the European Union'' 2005, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]]. These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency. In the event of [[counterparty]] [[bankruptcy]] or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at [[market value]] or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially "cherry pick").&lt;ref&gt;ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, Section 2(1)(a)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt; There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
The key elements of close out netting are:
*default
*the accretion of the time for performance of obligations to the time of default
*conversion of non-cash obligations into debts; meaning obligations to deliver non-cash assets are converted to market price equivalents; and
*set off&lt;ref&gt;See the Financial Collateral Directive (Directive 2002/47/EC, Art 2(1)(n)&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such as''repos'', forwards or options.&lt;ref&gt;ISDA master agreement&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations, as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Insolvency Rules 1986 Rule 4.90&lt;/ref&gt; The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively. Other systemic challenges to netting, such as regulatory capital recognition under [[Basel II]] and other Insolvency-related matters seen in the ''Lamfalussy Report''&lt;ref&gt;European Commission,''Report from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament, Evaluation Report on the Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive'' (2002/47/EC), 2006, COM (2006) 833 final, 10&lt;/ref&gt; has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, 269&lt;/ref&gt; In England &amp; Wales, the effect of ''[[British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France]]'' has largely been negated by ''Part VII'' of the [[Companies Act|Company Act 1989]] which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts. In regard to the [[Basel_Accords|BASEL Accords]], the first set of guidelines, [[Basel_I|BASEL I]], was missing guidelines on ''netting''. [[Basel_II|BASEL II]] introduced ''netting'' guidelines.

===Settlement netting===
For [[cash]] settled trades, this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions.
Obligations are not modified under settlement netting, which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood, ''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995),153-5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike '''close-out netting''', settlement netting is only possible in relation to like-obligations having the same settlement date. These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency, but can be agreed in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274&lt;/ref&gt; Claims exist but are extinguished when paid. To achieve simultaneously payment, only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides. This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting, the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur, the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned ''British Eagle''. These are routinely included within [[derivative]] transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre-settlement exposure amount. 

::*''Bilateral Net Settlement System'': A settlement system in which every individual bilateral combination of participants settles its net settlement position on a bilateral basis. 

::*''Multilateral Net Settlement System'': A settlement system in which each settling participant settles its own multilateral net settlement position (typically by means of a single payment or receipt). 

==Set off==
Set off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted. Of these legal bases, a common form is the legal defense of set-off, which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ("Party A") who owed money to another ("Party B") could be sent to debtors' prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. This operated as an equitable shield, but not a sword. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing (e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A). Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.

In certain jurisdictions (including the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Insolvency Act 1986]], section 323; [[Insolvency Rules 1986]], rule 4.90.&lt;/ref&gt;), certain types of set-off takes place automatically upon the [[insolvency]] of a company. This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most. The primary argument This has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;Mokal ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as an undeclared [[security interest]] that violates the principle of [[pari passu]]. The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on' insolvencies, and thus a systemic market risk.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed) 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Goode, ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency'' (Fourth Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013), 278&lt;/ref&gt; Seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set-off. First, the law should uphold pre-insolvency autonomy and set-offs as parties invariably rely on the pre-insolvency commitments. This is a core policy point. Second, as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs.&lt;ref&gt;Stein v Blake [1993]; Halesowen Presswork&lt;/ref&gt; Third, managing risk, particularly systemic risk is crucially. Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out. Effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts. Can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation. 

The right to set off is particularly important when a bank's exposures are reported to regulatory authorities, as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements. If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default, thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors, is thus replaced. The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent, less the value of the security taken.

===Set-off by Country===
Two primary examples of set-off rules are outlined below. These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives. 

====English law set-off====
Under English law, there are broadly five types of set-off which have been recognised:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-107-7242 |title=Practical Law: set-off |publisher=Thompson Reuters |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Goode, ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency'' (Fourth Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013), 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Legal set-off.''' or '''Independent set-off'''&lt;ref&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; What is known as statutory set-off, this arises where a claim and a counterclaim in a court action are both liquidated sums or ascertained with certainty. This is wider than insolvent set-off, but the claim and cross claim must be mutual ''and'' liquidated. In such cases the court will simply set-off the amounts and award a net sum.  The two claims do not need to be intrinsically connected.
# '''Equitable set-off.''' or '''Transaction set-off''' Outside of litigation, where two mutual claims arise out of the same matter or a sufficiently closely related matter ''and'' an injustice would be done if not enforced, the claims will set off in equity.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; Both sums must be due and payable, but may be for liquidated or unliquidated sums. Unlike ''Independent set-off'', this is not self-executing
# '''Contractual Set-off''' made by express agreement. Often netting will arise through express agreement to the parties, the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] master agreement is an example of this type, which is ineffective against an insolvent party but is often used to address pre-insolveny credit risk and reduce the need for collateral.
# '''[[Banker's right to combine accounts|Banker’s set-off]].''' or '''Current Account Set-off''' Sometimes referred to as a banker's right to combine accounts, this is a special form of set-off which is implied into contractual agreements with bankers and allows banks to offset sums in one account against another account which is overdrawn from the same client.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the right cannot be exercised if one of the accounts is a loan account, or if the bank has agreed not to exercise the right, or if the bank has notice that the sums in the account are for a specific purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii |litigants=[[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd]] |year=1968 |court=UKHL |div= |num=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on trust for another party. It is said to derive from a bankers' lien, however this is misleading as it is only available where both accounts are maintained in the same capacity. Difference in currency will not prevent this right, however.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Miliangos v George Frank Ltd]]'' [1976] AC 443&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Insolvency set-off.''' It is perhaps the most expensive form of set off. Under section 323 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]&lt;ref&gt;Rule 4.90 of the [[Insolvency Rules 1986]] for companies.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person goes into [[bankruptcy]] or a company goes into [[liquidation (law)|liquidation]] mutual debts are automatically set-off. This is a mandatory operation in bilateral situations. Whether the debt is liquidated or unliquidated does not matter, and the set-off will apply to future or contingent claims if the debts are provable. Insolvency set-off operates on liquidation and administration, where the administrator gives notice of his intention to make a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Rules 14.25 and 14.25 of the Insolvency Rules 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
The five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk. Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term. It is an essential aspect for cross-claims, especially when there exits overlapping obligations. Common features of set-off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality.

====US law set-off====
{{jargon|date=October 2017}}
See De Magno v. United States, 636 F.2d 714, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VA’s “affirmative 
action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its '''common-law right of set-off'''”) (discussing similar language of predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. § 211)

See, e.g., United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1601, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947) ("government has the same right 'which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him' " (quoting Gratiot v. United States, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 336, 370, 10 L.Ed. 759 (1841))); see also Tatelbaum v. United States, 10 Cl.Ct. 207, 210 (1986) (set-off right is inherent in the United States government and grounded on common law right of every creditor to set off debts).

In {{NZ election link year|1890}}, Earnshaw contested the {{NZ electorate link|Peninsula}} electorate against the incumbent, [[William Larnach]].

This put him off-side with Premier [[Richard Seddon]].

Earnshaw came seventh in the three-member Dunedin electorate in the {{NZ election link|1896}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Otago |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18961223.2.28.16 |accessdate=6 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Auckland Star]] |date=23 December 1896 |volume=XXVII |issue=305 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came eighth in the three-member {{NZ electorate link|Wellington}} electorate in the {{NZ election link|1899}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AJHR1900-I.2.3.2.54 |title=The General Election, 1899 |date=19 June 1900 |publisher= Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives |page=2 |accessdate=12 February 2014 |location=Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnshaw was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] in 1913 and served until his death in 1931.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=152}}

==Life outside parliament==
After his 1899 defeat, Earnshaw moved to [[Gillespies Beach]] near [[Fox Glacier]], where he was involved in dredging. He later took employment with the [[Wellington Harbour Board]] prior to his appointment to the Legislative Council.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=225}}

He died on 29 December 1931 at [[Wellington Hospital, New Zealand|Wellington Hospital]] after a short illness. He was survived by his wife and two sons.&lt;ref name="EP obit" /&gt; His wife died in 1947, and both are buried at [[Karori Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Details |url= http://wellington.govt.nz/services/community-and-culture/cemeteries/cemeteries-search/details?id=17616&amp;serviceType=Burial |publisher=[[Wellington City Council]] |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
