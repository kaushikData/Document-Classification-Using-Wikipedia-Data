'''Adam Ferguson''', [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Adhamh MacFhearghais''), also known as '''Ferguson of Raith''' (1 July [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]/20 June O.S. 1723 – 22 February 1816), was a Scottish philosopher and historian of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

Ferguson was sympathetic to traditional societies, such as the Highlands, for producing courage and loyalty. He criticized commercial society as making men weak, dishonourable and unconcerned for their community. Ferguson has been called "the father of modern sociology" for his contributions to the early development of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Harry E.|title=Sociology Before Comte: A Summary of Doctrines and an Introduction to the Literature|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=September 1917|volume=23|issue=2|pages=234|jstor=2763534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = William Bradford | last = Willcox |author2=Arnstein, Walter L. | edition=Sixth Edition, 1992 | title = The Age of Aristocracy, 1688 to 1830 | others=Volume III of A History of England, edited by Lacey Baldwin Smith | page = 133 | location=[[Lexington, MA]] | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-669-24459-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His most well known work is his ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society|Essay on the History of Civil Society]]''.

==Life==
Born at [[Logierait]] in [[Atholl]], [[Perthshire]], Scotland, the son of Rev Adam Ferguson, he received his education  at Logierait Parish School, [[Perth Grammar School]], and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[University of St Andrews]] (MA 1742).&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1745, owing to his knowledge of [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], he gained appointment as deputy [[chaplain]] of the 43rd (afterwards the 42nd) regiment (the [[Black Watch]]), the licence to preach being granted him by special dispensation, although he had not completed the required six years of [[theology|theological]] study.

It remains a matter of debate as to whether, at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745), Ferguson fought in the ranks throughout the day, and refused to leave the field, though ordered to do so by his colonel. Nevertheless, he certainly did well, becoming principal chaplain in 1746. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, when, disappointed at not obtaining a living, he left the clergy and resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits.

After residing in [[Leipzig]] for a time, he returned to [[Edinburgh]] where in January 1757 he succeeded [[David Hume]] as librarian to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (see [[Advocates' Library]]), but soon relinquished this office on becoming tutor in the family of the [[Earl of Bute]].&lt;ref name="Essay95"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Ferguson|editor=Fania Oz-Saltberger|title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-44736-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvi}} In 1759 Ferguson became professor of [[natural philosophy]] in the [[University of Edinburgh]], and in 1764 transferred to the chair of "pneumatics" ([[mental philosophy]]) "and [[moral philosophy]]".

In 1767, he published his ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'', which was well received and translated into several [[European languages]]. In the mid-1770s he travelled again to the [[European mainland|Continent]] and met [[Voltaire]]. His membership of [[The Poker Club]] is recorded in its minute book of 1776.

In 1776 appeared his anonymous pamphlet on the [[American Revolution]] in opposition to Dr [[Richard Price]]'s ''[[Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty]]'', in which he sympathised with the views of the [[British legislature]]. In 1778 Ferguson was appointed secretary to the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] which endeavoured, but without success, to negotiate an arrangement with the revolted colonies.

In 1780 he wrote the article "History" for the second edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204623/Adam-Ferguson&lt;/ref&gt; The article is 40 pages long and replaced the article in the first edition, which was only one paragraph.

In 1783 appeared his ''[[History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic]]''; it became very popular and went through several editions. Ferguson believed that the [[history of the Roman Republic]] during the period of their greatness formed a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which he studied especially. The history reads well and impartially, and displays conscientious use of sources. The influence of the author's military experience shows itself in certain portions of the narrative. Tired of teaching, he resigned his professorship in 1785, and devoted himself to the revision of his lectures, which he published (1792) under the title of ''[[Principles of Moral and Political Science]]''.

In his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of the history, visited [[Italy]] and some of the principal cities of Europe, where he was received with honour by [[learned societies]]. From 1795 he resided successively at [[Neidpath Castle]] near [[Peebles]], at Hallyards on [[Manor Water]], and at [[St Andrews]], where he died on 22 February 1816.  He is buried in the churchyard of [[St Andrews Cathedral]], against the east wall. His large mural monument includes a carved profile portrait in marble.

==Ethics==
In his [[ethical system]] Ferguson treats man as a social being, illustrating his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the [[human race]], he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. [[Victor Cousin]] criticised Ferguson's speculations (see his ''Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale an dix-huitième siècle'', pt. II., 1839–1840):

&lt;blockquote&gt;We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above all his predecessors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this principle Ferguson attempted to reconcile all moral systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} With [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] he admits the power of self-interest or utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation. [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]'s theory of universal benevolence and [[Adam Smith]]'s idea of mutual sympathy (now [[empathy]]) he combines under the law of society. But, as these laws appear as the means rather than the end of human destiny, they remain subordinate to a supreme end, and the supreme end of perfection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In the political part of his system Ferguson follows [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and pleads the cause of well-regulated [[liberty]] and free [[government]]. His contemporaries, with the exception of Hume, regarded his writings as of great importance (see [[Sir Leslie Stephen]], ''English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;214).

==Social thought==
Ferguson's ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' (1767) drew on classical authors and contemporary travel literature, to analyze modern commercial society with a critique of its abandonment of civic and communal virtues. Central themes in Ferguson's theory of citizenship are conflict, play, political participation and military valor. He emphasized the ability to put oneself in another's shoes, saying "fellow-feeling" was so much an "appurtenance of human nature" as to be a "characteristic of the species."  Like his friends [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] as well as other Scottish intellectuals, he stressed the importance of the spontaneous order; that is, that coherent and even effective outcomes might result from the uncoordinated actions of many individuals.

Ferguson saw history as a two-tiered synthesis of natural history and social history, to which all humans belong. Natural history is created by [[God]]; so are humans, who are progressive. Social history is, in accordance with this natural progress, made by humans, and because of that factor it experiences occasional setbacks. But in general, humans are empowered by God to pursue progress in social history. Humans live not for themselves but for God's providential plan. He emphasized aspects of medieval [[chivalry]] as ideal [[masculine]] characteristics. British gentleman and young men were advised to dispense with aspects of politeness considered too [[feminine]], such as the constant desire to please, and to adopt less superficial qualities that suggested inner [[virtue]] and [[courtesy]] toward the 'fairer sex.'&lt;ref name="Kettler, 1965"&gt;Kettler, ''The Social and Political Thought of Adam Ferguson'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Herman, A., The Scottish Enlightenment, Harper Perennial&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson was a leading advocate of the [[Idea of Progress]]. He believed that the growth of a commercial society through the pursuit of individual self-interest could promote a self-sustaining progress. Yet paradoxically Ferguson also believed that such commercial growth could foster a decline in virtue and thus ultimately lead to a collapse similar to Rome's. Ferguson, a devout [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]], resolved the apparent paradox by placing both developments in the context of a divinely ordained plan that mandated both progress and human free will. For Ferguson, the knowledge that humanity gains through its actions, even those actions resulting in temporary retrogression, form an intrinsic part of its progressive, asymptotic movement toward an ultimately unobtainable perfectibility.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson was influenced by  classical humanism and such writers as [[Tacitus]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The fellow members of Edinburgh's Select Society, which included [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], were also major influences. Ferguson believed that civilization is largely about laws that restrict our independence as individuals but provide liberty in the sense of security and justice. He warned that social chaos usually leads to despotism. The members of civil society give up their liberty-as-autonomy, which savages possess, in exchange for liberty-as-security, or civil liberty. [[Montesquieu]] used a similar argument.&lt;ref name="Kettler, 1965"/&gt;

Smith emphasized capital accumulation as the driver of growth, but Ferguson suggested innovation and technical advance were more important, and he is therefore in some ways more in line with modern thinking. According to Smith, commerce tends to make men 'dastardly'. This foreshadows a theme Ferguson, borrowing freely from Smith, took up to criticize capitalism.  Ferguson's critique of commercial society went far beyond that of Smith, and influenced [[Hegel]] and Marx.&lt;ref name="Kettler, 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The ''Essay'' has been seen as an innovative attempt to reclaim the tradition of [[Civic republicanism|civic republican]] citizenship in modern Britain, and an influence on the ideas of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] held by the [[American Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref name="Kettler, 1965"/&gt;

==Family==
He married Katharine Burnett in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of The Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Pruss graduated from the [[University of Western Ontario]] in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Physics. After earning a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1996 and publishing several papers in ''Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society'' and other mathematical journals,&lt;ref name=wc /&gt; he began graduate work in philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He completed his dissertation, ''Possible Worlds: What They Are and What They Are Good For'', under [[Nicholas Rescher]] in 2001.

Pruss began teaching philosophy at [[Georgetown University]] in 2001, earning tenure in 2006. In 2007, he moved to [[Waco, Texas]] to teach philosophy at [[Baylor University]]. He is now the Director of Graduate Studies for the Baylor Philosophy Department. He  has taught various courses, including graduate seminars on the [[philosophy of time]], [[metaphysics]], the [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]] and [[ontological argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], [[Modal logic|modality]], [[free will]], and [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pruss, ''Curriculum Vitae''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Pruss's philosophical thought reflects Christian [[orthodoxy]]. He is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and a member of the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]].

Pruss defends the [[principle of sufficient reason]] (PSR), claiming that it is self-evident, and arguing that the rejection of PSR creates problems in epistemology, modality, ethics, and even evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Pruss, "Leibnizian Cosmological Arguments"&lt;/ref&gt;

Pruss is a critic of [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis's]] "extreme modal realism," and instead gives "a combined account" of Leibnizian and Aristotelian modality, which integrates the "this-worldly capacities" of the Aristotelian view and Leibniz's account of [[possible world]]s as thoughts in the mind of God.&lt;ref&gt;Pruss, "The Actual and the Possible"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Augusta Cooper Bristol''' (April 17, 1835 – May 9, 1910) was an American poet and lecturer. She began teaching at the age of fifteen. In 1869, she published a volume of poems, and, the same year, gave her first public lecture. Beginning in 1872, she was frequently called before the public as a speaker.

==Early years and education==
Augusta Cooper was born in [[Croydon, New Hampshire]], April 17, 1835. She was the youngest of a family of ten children of Col. Otis and Hannah (Powers) Cooper.{{sfn|Metcalf|1895|p=67}} Her first verses were written at the age of eight, and she had poems published when only fifteen. She excelled in mathematics and showed in her early life an aptitude for logical and philosophical reasoning. The greater part of her education was acquired in a public school, but she was also a student in Canaan Union Academy and [[Kimball Union Academy]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=123}}{{sfn|Metcalf|1895|p=67}} 

==Career==
Bristol began teaching at fifteen during summer and winter for seven years. At the age of twenty-two, she married G. H. Kimball, from whom she was divorced five years later. In 1866, she married Louis Bristol, a lawyer of [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and they removed to [[southern Illinois]]. In 1869, she published a volume of poems, of which, a review by ''The Congregationalist and Boston Recorder'' noted: "In ''Poems'' by Augusta Cooper Bristol, we fail to discern any remarkable poetic power. They seem to be characterized bya considerable command of language, and something of the poetic temper, with a good deal of the now fashionable cant of 'insight' and 'nature' and non-capital punishment, and things of that kind."&lt;ref name="Congregationalist1869"&gt;{{cite web|title=Literary Review|url=http://find.galegroup.com.ezproxy.neu.edu/ncnp/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=NCNP&amp;userGroupName=mlin_b_northest&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=GT3004382090&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|website=19th Century U.S. Newspapers|publisher=Congregationalist and Boston Recorder|accessdate=2 December 2017|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=110|date=8 April 1869|url-access=subscription|edition=Public domain}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she gave her first public lecture, which changed the course of her intellectual career.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=123}}{{sfn|Metcalf|1895|p=67}}

In 1872, she moved to [[Vineland, New Jersey]], from which date she developed herself as a platform speaker before the public. For four years, she was president of the Ladies' [[Social Science]] Class in Vineland, giving lessons from [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Henry Charles Carey]] every month. In the winter of 1880, she gave a course of lectures before the New York [[Positivism|Positivist]] Society on "The Involution of Character," followed by another course under the auspices of the Woman's Social Science Club of that city. In the following June, she was sent by friends in [[New York City]] to study the equitable association of labor and capital at the [[Familistère]], in [[Guise]], France, founded by [[Jean-Baptiste André Godin]]. She was also commissioned to represent the New York Positivist Society in an international convention of liberal thinkers in [[Brussels]] in September. Remaining in the Familistere for three months and giving a lecture on the "Scientific Basis of Morality" before the Brussels convention, she returned home and published the "Rules and Statutes" of the association in Guise. In 1881, she was chosen State lecturer of the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Patrons of Husbandry]] in [[New Jersey]]. In the autumn of the following year, was employed on a national lecture bureau of that order.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=123}}{{sfn|Metcalf|1895|p=67}}
[[File:AugustaCooperBristol.png|thumb|Augusta Cooper Bristol (1894)]]
After her husband's death in 1882, she seldom appeared upon the platform, but was one of the speakers in the [[World's Congress of Representative Women]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] (1893).{{sfn|Metcalf|1895|p=67}} She was occupied with the care of an estate and in directing the educational interests of her youngest daughter. Some of her philosophic and scientific lectures were translated and published in foreign countries.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=124}} She died May 9, 1910 in Vineland.{{sfn|Publishers' Weekly|1911|p=397}}

[[Image:1826 EleanorDavis byThomasEdwards BostonMonthlyMagazine.png|thumb|right|''Boston Monthly Magazine,'' May 1826; with detail of "Memoir of Mrs. Eleanor Davis"]]

The '''''Boston Monthly Magazine''''' (1825–1826) of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], was edited by [[Samuel Lorenzo Knapp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n85-363427|title=Knapp, Samuel L. (Samuel Lorenzo) 1783-1838  [WorldCat.org]|website=www.worldcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124095381|title=Boston monthly magazine.|first=Samuel L|last=Knapp|date=19 July 2018|publisher=|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "devoted to literature, philosophy, and miscellaneous matters, worthy of being recorded, ... [and] chiefly directed to the diffusion of the productions of our own minds."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Boston Monthly Magazine, no.1, June 1825&lt;/ref&gt; It focused on American culture, as distinct from that of Europe. Contributors included [[Thomas Edwards (artist)|Thomas Edwards]], [[David Claypoole Johnston]], [[Pendleton's Lithography]], [[John Ritto Penniman]], and [[William Hoogland]].

[[Image:1825 BostonMonthlyMagazine v1 engraved byWilliamHoogland.png|thumb|left|''Boston Monthly Magazine,'' frontispiece for v.1, 1825]]

In the first issue of June 1825, Knapp addressed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We shall endeavor to blend amusement with instruction, and philosophy and taste with morals — to persuade without dictating, and to reason without any claims to infallibility. ... We shall not confine ourselves to any particular field of literature or philosophy; but shall thrust in our sickles wherever we have a right to reap, and glean after others wherever the harvest is gathered, if what is left is worth picking up. We shall give to our labors as much variety as possible, and often attempt to relieve the solemn legend and serious tale, by something of the playful and the gay. The wits shall be taxed to swell our stores, but nothing shall appear in our columns to confuse innocence or alarm modesty. We shall often leave the groves of fancy and the paths of general literature and history, for deep shades and solitudes, where repose the ashes of youth and loveliness, to drop a tear and strew a flower on the graves of those untimely called away; ... to read the rude memorials of our forefathers, in order to bring their merits into light, and make them better known to their descendants. ... Among the fair we expect readers and hope for patrons, for we have at all times advocated their claims to an equal share with men, in the advancement of knowledge and happiness in society, and shall still continue to support the same doctrine. The time has gone when females were pleased with drivelling flattery, and smiled in approbation at mawkish sonnets to their beauty and charms. ... The simplicity of Sparta and the polish of Athens, is sweetly blended in the highest state of female education. ... In the course of our labors, we shall not be unmindful of the numerous institutions and societies now flourishing in our country; — their origin, growth, and value, shall be fairly discussed. A monthly summary of passing events at home, and a succinct view of things abroad, shall be added. If we glance at politics, it shall be with national feelings; if we touch upon religion, it shall be in the spirit of toleration."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Busshō (Shōbōgenzō)''}}
'''''Busshō''''' ({{CJKV|j=佛性}}), or '''''Buddha Nature''''', is the third book of the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'' by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It was written in the fall of 1241 at Dōgen's monastery [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in [[Kyoto]]. As the title implies, the work is a discussion of the concept of [[buddha nature]], laying out [[Dōgen]]'s unique viewpoint on what the term means. While more typical interpretations see Buddha-nature as the inherent prospect of becoming a buddha, or alternatively a sort of life force within us, in ''Busshō'' Dōgen interprets Buddha-nature simply as concrete reality itself. He presents this thesis in his characteristically difficult style using frequent [[allusions]] to and comments on classical Zen literature, as well as complex word play hinging on creative interpretations of [[Classical Chinese]] sentence structure.&lt;ref name=bielefeldt&gt;{{citation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|title=Shōbōgenzō busshō|year=2010|publisher=Sotoshu Shumucho|url=http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/bussho/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of buddha nature==
The literature of [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]] includes many discussions and comments on the notion of [[buddha nature]], and its exact meaning has been interpreted in numerous ways over many centuries. At is most basic, it can simply be synonymous with "[[buddha]]" or the qualities that make one a Buddha. More commonly, it is used to mean the potential to become a buddha, with common analogies likening buddha nature to a seed and a fully-fledged buddha to the mature plant. Finally, it may mean the absolute, fundamental nature of all things.&lt;ref name=bielefeldt/&gt;

[[Dōgen]] begins his work by quoting the putative words of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] as recorded in the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]] stating that all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|living beings]] have buddha nature. He then equates this statement to a dialogue Dōgen often cites between [[Nanyue Huairang]] and his teacher [[Dajian Huineng]] in which they discuss the undefiled nature of "practice and verification" ({{CJKV|j=修證; shushō}}), setting up his argument that buddha nature is just reality itself.&lt;ref name=bielefeldt/&gt;

'''Christine Marion Korsgaard''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|z|g|ɑː|r|d}}; born April 9, 1952) is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] and Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy at [[Harvard University]] whose main scholarly interests are in [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] and its history; the relation of issues in moral philosophy to issues in [[metaphysics]], the [[philosophy of mind]], and the theory of [[personal identity]]; the theory of [[personal relationship]]s; and in [[Norm (sociology)|normativity]] in general. She has been described as "one of today's leading moral philosophers"&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24047-the-constitution-of-agency-essays-on-practical-reason-and-moral-psychology/&lt;/ref&gt; because of her work in defense of [[Kantian ethics|Kantian views in moral theory]], and "the greatest contemporary proponent" of "a distinguished philosophical tradition that conceives of humanity as a task."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa McBay Merritt, "Motherhood in Ferrante's ''The Lost Daughter'': A Case Study of Irony as Extraordinary Reflection," ''Philosophy and Literature'', vol. 41, no. 1 (April 2017), 184, 186. (The expression alluding to Kantianism&amp;mdash;"a distinguished philosophical tradition that conceives of humanity as a task"&amp;mdash;is, originally, from [[Jonathan Lear]], ''A Case for Irony'' [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2011], p. 3, and in Merritt's article Korsgaard is enrolled in this tradition.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Korsgaard first attended Eastern Illinois University for two years and transferred to receive a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] from Harvard, where she was a student of [[John Rawls]]. She received an LHD [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] from the [[University of Illinois]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://commencement.illinois.edu/ceremonies/honors_awards.html&lt;/ref&gt; She is a 1970 alumna of [[Homewood-Flossmoor High School]] in Flossmoor, Ill.

She has taught at [[Yale University|Yale]], the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]], and the [[University of Chicago]]; since 1991 she has been a professor at Harvard University, where she is now Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy.

In 1996 Korsgaard published a book entitled ''The Sources of Normativity'', which was the revised version of her [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values]], and also a collection of her past papers on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s moral philosophy and Kantian approaches to contemporary moral philosophy: ''Creating the Kingdom of Ends''. In 2002, she was the first woman to give the [[John Locke Lectures]] at the [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures/past_lectures |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171436/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures/past_lectures |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which turned into her most recent book, ''Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity''.

She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/05.24/07-academy.html&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy|Corresponding Fellow]] of the [[British Academy]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/index.cfm?year=2015 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721205532/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/index.cfm?year=2015 |archivedate=2015-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as President of the Eastern Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]] in 2008-2009, and held a Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award from 2006-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/|title=Index|website=www.people.fas.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contentment''' is a mental or [[emotional state]] of satisfaction maybe drawn from being at [[inner peace|ease]] in one's situation, body and mind. Colloquially speaking, contentment could be a state of having accepted one's situation and is a milder and more tentative form of [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenblatt|first1=S|title=The Straight Road to Happiness: A Personal Guide to Enable Us to Overcome Tendencies which Block Our Natural Flow of Happiness and to Explore New Horizons of Inner Joy|date=2002|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contentment and the pursuit of contentment are possibly a central thread through many philosophical or religious schools across diverse cultures, times and geographies. [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]] might have said "Health is the most precious gain and contentment the greatest wealth". [[John Stuart Mill]], centuries later, would write "I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires, rather than in attempting to satisfy them." [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote "Live with the gods. And he who does so constantly shows them that his soul is satisfied with what is assigned to them." Hebrews 13:5 reads "Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/HEB.13.5.niv|title=Hebrews 13:5; Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,&amp;#8220;Never will I leave you;never will I forsake you.&amp;#8221;#:5 Deut. 31:6|work=www.bible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou]] once wrote in the 3rd century BCE (hypothetically) "A gentleman who profoundly penetrates all things and is in harmony with their transformations will be contented with whatever time may bring. He follows the course of nature in whatever situation he may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=A0qs9W6Km6UC&amp;pg=PA331 | title=A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2008 | page=331 | isbn=978-1-4008-2003-0 | translator=Wing-Tsit Chan | chapter=Neo-Taoism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature seems to generally agree that contentment is maybe a state ideally reached through being happy with what a person has, as opposed to achieving one's larger ambitions, as [[Socrates]] described by probably saying "He who is not contented with what he has, would not be contented with what he would like to have." That said, there may be a number of elements of achievement that may make finding a state of personal contentment easier: a strong family unit, a strong local community, and satisfaction of life's basic needs as perhaps expressed in [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]. In general, the more needs in Maslow's hierarchy are achieved, the more easily one might achieve contentment.

==General==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Contentment is the capital which will never diminish.|salign=right |source=— [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Short Sayings from Ahlulbayt(as) |url=https://www.duas.org/sayings.htm |website=Duas.org |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Many [[religion]]s have some form of eternal bliss or [[heaven]] as their apparent goal, often contrasted with [[Eternity|eternal]] torment or dissatisfaction. The source of all dissatisfaction appears to stem from the ability to compare experiences and then infer that one's state is not ideal.

In the [[Bible]], there is an intriguing [[allegorical]] account that man's fall from his paradisal state was caused by man eating the [[forbidden fruit]] from the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. Man's eyes were "opened" to know the distinction between good and evil ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3&amp;version=KJV Genesis 3]). In other words, when man becomes intellectually developed to distinguish between good and bad, he realizes that is a gap between what he considers good or ideal and what he is experiencing. The perception of this disparity is what creates psychological and physiological tension.

In the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Ir56ChS1TjkC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=When+the+Tao+is+lost,+there+is+goodness.+When+goodness+is+lost,+there+is+morality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuLqUhu1LT&amp;sig=3CMldTc_Lcf9QB1tvufHPMk8aBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiuzIK3qcPHAhWPxI4KHThbB5I#v=onepage&amp;q=When%20the%20Tao%20is%20lost%2C%20there%20is%20goodness.%20When%20goodness%20is%20lost%2C%20there%20is%20morality&amp;f=false|title=Tao Te Ching|author=Tzu, Lao}}&lt;/ref&gt; this development of man from his primal state of consciousness called Tao is similarly expounded in this manner: "When the Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is morality&amp;nbsp;...".  [[Morality]] as we know is the intellectual discernment between good and evil. There is therefore a belief that one can achieve contentment by living "in the moment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200810/the-art-now-six-steps-living-in-the-moment|title=The Art of Now: Six Steps to Living in the Moment|work=Psychology Today|date=November 1, 2008|author=Jay Dixit}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents a way to stop the judgmental process of discriminating between good and bad. However, attempting to live in the moment is difficult because a person's attention is not only distracted by sensory stimuli but also psychological processes that conspire to make them think subconsciously or consciously. This thinking process is always involved with memories; hence, the attempt to stay in the present is a ponderous one given that there is always this subconscious struggle to break away from memories, especially unhappy ones. For this reason, specializations in this pursuit to live in the moment are found in various religious and mystical schools, manifested in forms of [[meditation]] and [[prayer]].

A more practical way for most people would be to simply practice contentment as an attitude. Practicing gratitude is perhaps a way to understand what contentment as an attitude is about. Seen in this light, contentment is not an achievement but an attitude that one can adopt at any time.

The American philosopher [[Robert Bruce Raup]] wrote a book ''Complacency: The Foundation of Human Behavior'' (1925) in which he claimed that the human need for complacency (''i.e. inner tranquility'') was the hidden spring of human behavior. Raup made this the basis of his [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] theory, which he later used in his severe criticisms of the American education system of the 1930s. However, in the context of present-day society, perhaps the multidimensional leisure culture evinces in a very significant way the desire of man to return to his core state of contentment by letting go of his hectic outer activities.

===Contentment and positive psychology===

In many ways, contentment can be closely associated with the concept of happiness and satisfaction. In [[positive psychology]], [[social scientist]]s study what might contribute to living a good life, or what would lead to people having increased positive mood and overall satisfaction with their life.&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seligman|first=Martin|author2=Michal Csikszentmilhalyi|title=Positive Psychology|journal=American Psychologist|date=January 2000|volume=55|issue=1|pages=5–10|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.5|pmid=11392865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Happiness, in positive psychology, is defined in a twofold manner, which in totality is referred to as [[subjective well-being]]. How much positive emotion ([[positive affect]]) as opposed to negative emotion ([[negative affect]]) does a person have, and how ones view one's life overall (global satisfaction) are the questions asked in positive psychology to determine happiness. Contentment may be more associated or closely related to a person's level of satisfaction with his/her life (global satisfaction), but the idea of contentment is certainly intertwined in the concept of what makes people happy.

In the 2014 book ''[[Lucky Go Happy : Make Happiness Happen!]]'', Paul van der Merwe uses a [[chart]] to illustrate how being content for long periods of time, can yield more [[happiness]] than being [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] during a short period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckygohappybook.com/the-book|title=About the Book|quote=contentment can yield the same amount of happiness as ecstasy|last=Van der Merwe|first=Paul|website=luckygohappybook.com|access-date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive psychology finds it very important to study what contributes to people being happy and to people flourishing, and finds it just as important to focus on the constructive ways in which people function and adapt, as opposed to the general field of psychology which focuses more on what goes wrong or is pathological with human beings.&lt;ref name=PP/&gt;

====Variables that contribute to happiness in research====

====Satisficer vs. maximizer====

These are two concepts that define the ways in which people make choices. A [[Satisficing|satisficer]] is a person who will make a decision once his/her criteria is met, and a maximizer, on the other hand, won't make a decision until every possible option is explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, Barry|author2=Ward, Andrew; Lyubomirsky, Sonja;Monterosso, John; White, Katherine | title = Maximizing Versus Satisficing:Happiness Is a Matter of Choice |date = November 2002 |volume=83|issue=5|pages=1178–1197 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.5.1178 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genes====

There is evidence suggesting that there is a relationship between contentment and [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lykken|first=David|date=3 May 1996|title=Happiness Is A Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=3|pages=186–189|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x|author2=Tellegen, Auke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality====

Through [[factor analysis]], personality can be narrowed down according to the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor model]], which holds that there are five aspects of heritable personality traits: [[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]]. Research has shown that personality is 50% heritable, but not always.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Heritability of Personality is not Always 50%: Gene-Environment Interactions and Correlations between Personality and Parenting|journal=J. Pers.|year=2008|volume=76|issue=6|pages=1485–1521|pmid=19012656|pmc=2593100|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2008.00529.x|authors=Krueger R. F., South S., Johnson W., Iacono W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two aspects of personality which are related to happiness. There is a strong relationship between extraversion and happiness, in that the more extraverted a person is (or behaves) the more happy he/she will be.  The other aspect of personality which has a strong relationship to happiness is the genetic predisposition to neuroticism. The more neurotic (emotionally unstable) a person is, the more likely he/she is to be unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Alexander|author2=Bates, Timothy |author3=Luciano, Michelle |title=Happiness Is A Personal(ity) Thing:The Genetics of Personality and Well-Being in a Representative Sample|journal=Psychological Science|date=March 2008|volume=19|issue=3|pages=205–210|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x|pmid=18315789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Goal pursuits====

Reaching [[goal]]s that are important to oneself and that are in alignment with one's personality can contribute to feelings of [[confidence]] and mastery. It is important to establish goals that are neither too easy or too hard, but that are optimally challenging. It is also important to note that investing energy in avoiding goals will contribute to diminishing happiness as well as deter one from reaching one's goals, which can be quite intuitive to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=K.M.|author2=Elliot, A.J|title=Goal Striving, Need Satisfaction, and Longitudinal Well-Being:The Self-Concordance Model|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1999|volume=76|pages=482–497|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Money====

Many people strongly associate money with happiness, and they believe that being rich will contribute greatly to making them happier, and the American society reflects this growing [[materialism]]. Although wealth is associated with some positive outcomes, i.e. lighter prison sentences for the same crime, better health, and lower [[infant mortality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|title=Unhealthy Societies:The Afflictions of Inequality|year=1996|isbn=978-0-415-09235-7|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can act as a buffer in certain instances, as mentioned previously, the overall relationship between money and happiness is marginal.

However, beyond a low threshold where the basic needs are met, money has a very small impact on happiness.  There is also the concept of the diminishing marginal utility of income (DMUI), which is that money has no effect on happiness once a certain income level has been reached, and which represents wealth and happiness as having a curvilinear relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veenhoven|first=Ruut|title=Is Happiness Relative?|journal=Social Indicators Research|year=1991|volume=24|pages=1–34|doi=10.1007/bf00292648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, when one has met his basic needs and have more to spare, it is time to spend or give some to experience happiness.  This is because happiness is really a state of in-and-out flow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/science-of-happiness/getting-in-the-flow/|title=Flow and Happiness|work=Pursuit of Happiness|accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's energy. Using or giving money is an expression of out-flowing of one's life-state. Attempt to just hoard more and more in the belief that it brings more happiness can lead to the opposite result if only because the means – that is the pursuit of money for happiness – has unwittingly become the ends.

====Leisure (also [[Leisure satisfaction]])====

The concept of [[work-life balance]] is now well-accepted.  At the same time, it must be noted that the 'life' aspect of this 'work-life' concept includes activities devoted to one's personal life which sometimes calls for the kind of commitment and effort no less than that demanded from one's work-life.

In some societies, this 'life' aspect might include looking after the elderly and infirm, sending children to and from schools, preparing the meals, cleaning the house and doing the laundry. They are as much work as the work life, and in the midst of all these, the need for [[Leisure|leisure activities]] is simply an alien concept.

Leisure as a culture is not a universal societal value although the younger generation in developed or near-developed societies seems more inclined toward it.  Overseas trips, lounging in a cafe with friends, attending concerts, relaxing in a spa, karaoke-ing and similar activities after office hours are now prevalent among that generation.  In fact, over the last 15 years, the market has seen a tremendous surge in demand for such leisure services.  In his book "In the Era of Human Capital",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=Richard|title=In the Era of Human Capital: The Emergence of Talent, Intelligence and Knowledge as the Economic Force and What it Means|date=1991|publisher=HarperBusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crawford charted the exponential growth of the Business &amp; Leisure sector in the [[post-industrial society]].
This trend might look like an offshoot of a more affluent society; however, the need for leisure is intrinsic in humans and only through the demands of modern economic life – run as it were by the clock, timetables, deadlines and schedules – did this need fade into the background.

Humans' need for leisure is intrinsic because that is the state they were born with, or rather, that is the state of life in the natural world.  Leisure implies that one is not pressured by others or oneself to deliver a certain result but that life is lived to enjoy the simple pleasures of exploring the world that one is born into.

This happy state of life is that generally experienced by the pre-school child and is gradually lost when duties and responsibilities of school life and subsequently the adult work-life enter into the picture.

Not all societies have embraced the leisure culture whether through certain public policies like having a universal welfare system, and psychological and financial preparedness on the part of individuals for retirement wherein leisure is the salient feature.  This even applies to developed nations.  For example, the US has a "retirement crisis" in which a large percentage of Americans do not have sufficient savings for retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2015/01/26/105394/the-reality-of-the-retirement-crisis/ |title=The Reality of the Retirement Crisis |date=January 26, 2015 |authors=Keith Miller, David Madland, Christian E. Weller |publisher=Center for American Progress |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815213243/https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2015/01/26/105394/the-reality-of-the-retirement-crisis/ |archivedate=August 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic productivity being often if not always equated with work, the culture of leisure is seldom recognized as a major contributor to a growing business sector.   For this reason, many societies do not have in place an infrastructure that strongly supports the leisure culture – such as represented by a universal [[social welfare system]], a wealth of products, services and amenities for retirees.  Such societies even if they were to become more affluent may continue to find happiness elusive even for retirees.

Leisure is intrinsically sought after by all as a way to release the tensions and stresses of work-life.  It is often used to indulge in play – as is witnessed by how constantly obsessed nowadays people are with surfing the Internet, movies and games through their smartphones.   There is no doubt that these are enjoyable activities.

But leisure also allows people – without the need of any modern gadgets – to re-connect with family and friends and experience the happiness arising from that interaction such as chatting over a drink or meal.

====Health====

Historically, major Eastern mystical teachings on human development, like those from India and China, do not make a separation between the spiritual and physical. Happiness or contentment was never viewed as an isolated state from physical health.  Physical health-enhancing practices such as [[Hatha yoga]] and [[qigong]] – and their respective herbalism known as Ayurveda and TCM ([[traditional Chinese medicine]]) – were consonant with and fully integrated into those mystical teachings in the implicit belief that the attainment of the ideal state of consciousness requires a healthy body as a launchpad or basis even.

Personal development and health in these systems are understood more as a holistic development of the various aspects of the multidimensional human being.

The concept of body and mind interplay (including [[relationship factor]]) now known as [[psychosomatic medicine]] has always been present in these "mystical teachings", particularly in TCM.  An unhappy, angry patient may be told by a TCM physician that there is a lot of trapped heat in their internal organs and then treated accordingly with herbs or acupuncture. At times, if the TCM physician is a qigong practitioner, they may even recommend some qigong exercises for the patient to practise.

However given that adepts in such complex holistic analysis and treatment are hard to come by, Eastern health maintenance practices may not necessarily be always adequate, reliable or even safe.  Mainstream Western medicine and a good personal knowledge into the common health issues and how to treat them safely at home should also be included in the total package to ensure good health so that the human body can be fit vehicle for optimal and positive performance – the foundation of happiness.

Outer success and material possession are secondary when health is compromised. One cannot be happy or contented when the body is broken, although there are rare, exceptional individuals who are able to rise above their physical predicament.  However, for the vast majority having a good knowledge and an effective protocol for personal health is critical to happiness not just to oneself but also to one's family and friends.

====Laughter====

[[Laughter]] is synonymous with happiness.  A proposal is made here that when a line of thought (e.g. joke) or sensation (e.g. tickling) is not expected by one's psychological or physiological order respectively, it triggers a certain chaos and temporary breakdown of that order.  The innate Contentment intrinsic to the person then breaks through this temporal breach to express itself in happy laughter.

Laughter has been used as a health therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laughter therapy|work=Cancer Treatment Centers of America|url=http://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy/|accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for many years such as in some hospitals through the showing of TV comedies for patients.  Laughter clubs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/07/09/laughing-yoga-cultivates-merry-mindfulness/|title=Laughing yoga cultivates merry mindfulness|date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Reuters|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been formed in India and some Asian countries to promote laughter as a form of health-enhancement through regular meet-ups.

====Universal social welfare====
Contentment has also been studied as a cultural or political phenomenon.  The Nordic nations, which have repeatedly appeared near the top in Happiness Index surveys like [[World Happiness Report]] – and most likely correlated economic performance as well – contend that higher rates of happiness are rooted in their [[welfare|welfare system]], the "[[Nordic model]]", which not only fulfills the healthcare, social and other essential needs of their people but also is proposed to provide a high sense of security.

Other research indicates a substantial portion of Scandinavians exaggerate their sense of happiness or contentment when asked informally or in surveys, due to social prohibitions against expressing negativity or unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Booth. The Almost Nearly Perfect People: Behind the Myth of Scandinavian Utopia. Picador, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
The region's rates of alcohol abuse, among the highest in Europe, have also been cited as an indication that the positive social effects attributed to the Nordic model are exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
Some of the earliest{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} references to the state of contentment are found in the reference to the [[midah]] (personal attribute) of ''Samayach B'Chelko''. The expression comes from the word ''samayach'' (root Sin-Mem-Chet) meaning "happiness, joy or contentment", and ''chelko'' (root Chet-Lamed-Kuf) meaning "portion, lot, or piece", and combined mean contentment with one's lot in life. The attribute is referred to in the [[Mishnah]]ic source which says, "Ben Zoma said: Who is rich? Those who are happy with their portion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2032/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm|title=Ethics of the Fathers: Chapter Four - Texts &amp; Writings|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of contentment in Jewish culture reflect an even older thinking reflected in the [[Book of Proverbs]] which says: "A joyful heart makes a cheerful face; A sad heart makes a despondent mood. All the days of a poor person are wretched, but contentment is a feast without end."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 15:13 and 15, Rabbi Meir Leibush (Malbim)&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of contentment remained in Jewish thinking during the [[Middle Ages]] as evident for example in the writings of [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol]], an eleventh-century Spanish poet-philosopher who taught:

Who seeks more than he needs, hinders himself from enjoying what he has. Seek what you need and give up what you need not. For in giving up what you don't need, you'll learn what you really do need.&lt;ref&gt;''Mivhar Hapeninim'' 155,161 as found in The Jewish Moral Virtues, Borowitz and Schwartz, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
In [[Islam]], true contentment is achieved through establishing a relationship with Allah, always keeping Him in mind.  The [[Quran]] states:
{{Cquote|4=Quran - 13:29|''Truly, it is in the remembrance of [[Allah]](God) that hearts can find contentment''}}

This verse reveals that the more the people gain the trivial goods of this life, the greater becomes the hunger and the consequent burning of their hearts. Moreover, there is no end for worldly desires and greed. But as for those who seek God, the more they turn to Him, the greater is their peace of mind.  This means that a search for the [[divine]] or a supreme [[Deity]] is inherent within human nature and the innermost yearning of a human being.  The real and ultimate goal of a person's life.

In a well known [[Hadith]] (saying of the prophet [[Muhammad]]) the prophet said:
{{Cquote|4=Saheeh Bukhari-Vol 8:book76|''If the son of Adam (the human being) were given a valley full of riches, he would love to have a second one; and if he were given the second one, he would love to have a third, for nothing satisfies the belly of Adam's son except dust (of the grave). And Allah forgives he who repents (turns) to Him.''}}

==Eastern religions==
In [[Yoga]] ([[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]), movement or positions, breathing practices, and concentration, as well as the yamas and niyamas, can contribute to a physical state of contentment ([[santosha]]).

In a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sense, it is the freedom from anxiety, want, or need. Contentment is the goal behind all goals because once achieved there is nothing to seek until it is lost. A living system cannot maintain contentment for very long as complete balance and harmony of forces means death. Living systems are a complex dance of forces which find a stability far from balance. Any attainment of balance is quickly met by rising pain which ends the momentary experience of satisfaction or contentment achieved. [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s task was to find the solution to this never-ending descent into dissatisfaction or [[Dukkha]]. The Buddhist faith is based on the belief that he succeeded.

===Sikhism===
Contentment (or Sabar or Santokh) is important an aspect in [[Sikh]] life and is known as attainment of First Treasure. Sikhism categorizes Contentment into two forms: Contentment (Santokh) and True Contentment (Satt Santokh/Sabar). Contentment can be broken, turning souls greedy for the temporal world, but True Contentment is never broken and such a soul is eligible for the Supreme State.&lt;ref&gt;ਸਤ ਸੰਤੋਖਿ ਸਬਦਿ ਅਤਿ ਸੀਤਲੁ ਸਹਜ ਭਾਇ ਲਿਵ ਲਾਇਆ ॥੩॥ You are true and content; the Word of Your Shabad is cool and soothing. Through it, we are lovingly, intuitively attuned to You. ||3||, Page 1038, Adi Granth&lt;/ref&gt; The soul having contentment is called Saabari&lt;ref&gt;Page 1384, Adi Granth; ਸਬਰ ਅੰਦਰਿ ਸਾਬਰੀ ਤਨੁ ਏਵੈ ਜਾਲੇਨ੍ਹ੍ਹਿ ॥ Sabar anḏar sābrī ṯan evai jāleniĥ. Those who are patient abide in patience; in this way, they burn their bodies.&lt;/ref&gt; or Santokhi.

'''Domingo Báñez'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally and more properly Váñez and sometimes, but erroneously, Ibáñez.&lt;/ref&gt; (29 February 1528 in [[Valladolid]] – 22 October 1604 in [[Medina del Campo]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologian. The qualifying ''Mondragonensis'' sometimes attached to his name seems to refer to the birthplace of his father, Juan Báñez, at [[Mondragón]] in [[Guipúzcoa]].

==Life==

===Education and teaching===
Báñez was born at [[Medina del Campo]], in the province of [[Valladolid]].

At fifteen he began to study philosophy at the [[University of Salamanca]]. Three years later he took the Dominican habit at the [[Convento de San Esteban, Salamanca|Convent of St. Stephen, Salamanca]], and made his profession 3 May 1547. During a year's review of the liberal arts and later, he had the afterwards distinguished [[Bartolomé Medina]] as a fellow student. Under such professors as [[Melchior Cano]] (1548–51), [[Diego de Chaves]] (1551), and [[Pedro Sotomayor]] (1550–51) he studied theology, laying the foundations of the erudition and acquiring the acumen which later made him eminent as a theologian and an exponent and defender of [[Thomistic]] doctrine. Báñez next began teaching, and under [[Domingo Soto]], as prior and regent, he held various professorships for ten years. He was made master of students, explaining the ''Summa'' to the younger brethren for five years, and incidentally taking the place, with marked success, of professors who were sick, or who for other reasons were absent from their chairs at the university. In the customary, sometimes competitive, examinations before advancement he is said easily to have carried off all honours. Báñez taught at the Dominican [[University of Avila]] from 1561 to 1566. About 1567 he was assigned to a chair of theology at [[Complutense University of Madrid|Alcalá]], the ancient Complutum. It appears that he was at Salamanca again in 1572 and 1573, but during the four scholastic years 1573-77 he was regent of St. Gregory's Dominican College al [[Valladolid]], a house of higher studies where the best students of the Castilian province were prepared for a scholastic career. Elected Prior of [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]], he went instead to Salamanca to compete for the chair of [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]], left vacant by Medina's promotion to the chief professorship. He occupied this position from 1577 to 1580. After Medina's death (30 December 1580) he appeared again as competitor for the first chair of the university. The outcome was an academic triumph for Báñez and he was duly installed in his new position amid the acclamations of professors and students. There he laboured for nearly twenty years. His name acquired extraordinary authority, and the leading schools of orthodox Spain referred to him as the ''proeclarissimum jubar''-- "the brightest light"—of their country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over free will===
Báñez in his prime was director and confessor of [[Saint Teresa of Ávila|St. Teresa]].

The great controversy, with whose beginnings his name is prominently associated, goes back to a public disputation held early in 1582. [[Francisco Zumel]], of the [[Order of Mercy]], was moderator. [[Prudentius Montemayor]], a [[Jesuit]], argued that Christ did not die freely, and consequently suffered death without merit, if the Father had given him a command to die. Báñez asked what the consequences would have been if the Father had given command not only as to the substance of the act of death, but also as to its circumstances. Prudentius responded that in that case there remained neither liberty nor merit. [[Luis de León]], an [[Augustinian]], sided with Prudentius and presently the discussion was taken up by the masters in attendance and carried to the kindred subjects of predestination and justification. Other formal disputations ensued, and strong feeling was manifested. [[Juan de Santa e Cruz]], a [[Hieronymite]], felt constrained to refer the matter to the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (5 February), and to his deposition he appended sixteen propositions covering the doctrines in controversy. Leon declared that he had only defended the theses for the sake of argument. His chief thought was to prevent them from being qualified as heretical. Notwithstanding these and further admissions, he was forbidden to teach, publicly or privately, the sixteen propositions as reviewed and proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1588, [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]], a Jesuit brought out, at [[Lisbon]], his  ''Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiæ donis'', bearing the censura, or sanction, of a Dominican, [[Bartolomeu Ferreiro]], and dedicated to the Inquisitor General of Portugal, [[Cardinal Albert of Austria]]; but a sentiment against its appearance in Spain was aroused on the ground of its favouring some of the interdicted propositions. The cardinal, advised of this, stopped its sale, and requested Báñez and probably some others to examine it. Three months later, Báñez gave his opinion that six of the 11 forbidden propositions appeared in the ''Concordia''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Molina was asked to defend himself, and his answers to the objections and to some other observations were added as an appendix, with which, sanctioned anew (25 and 30 August 1589), the work was permitted to circulate. It was regarded as an epoch-making study, and many Fathers of the Society of Jesus rallied to its defense. From Valladolid where the Jesuit and Dominican schools in 1594 held alternate public disputations for and against its teaching on grace, the contention spread over all Spain. The intervention of the Inquisition was again sought, and by the authority of this high tribunal the litigants were required to present their respective positions and claims, and a number of universities, prelates, and theologians were consulted as to the merits of the strife. The matter was referred however, by the papal nuncio to Rome, 15 August 1594, and all dispute was to cease until a decision was rendered. In the meantime, to offset his Dominican and other critics, Molina brought counter accusations against Báñez and Zumel. The latter submitted his defense in three parts, all fully endorsed by Báñez, 7 July 1595. The Dominican position was set forth about the same time by Báñez and seven of his brethren, each of whom presented a separate answer to the charges. But the presiding officer of the Inquisition desired these eight books to be reduced to one, and Báñez, together with [[Pedro Herrera (theologian)|Pedro Herrera]] and [[Didacus Alvarez]] was instructed to do the work. About four months later Alvarez presented their joint product under the title "Apologetica fratrum prædicatorum in provinciâ Hispaniæ sacræ theologiæ professorum, adversus novas quasdam assertiones cujusdam doctoris Ludovici Molinæ nuncupati", published at Madrid, 20 November 1595. [...] Nearly two years later, 28 October 1597, Báñez resumed the case in a new summary and petitioned the pope to permit the Dominican schools to take up their teaching again on the disputed questions. This was the ''Libellus supplex Clementi VIII oblatus pro impetrandâ immunitate a lege silentii utrique litigantium parti impositâ'', published at Salamanca. An answer to the "Libellus" was conveyed in a letter of [[Cardinal Madruzzi]], 25 February 1598, written in the name of the pope, to the nuncio in Spain:

:Inform the Fathers of the Order of Preachers that His Holiness, moderating the prohibition that was made, grants them the faculty freely to teach and discuss, as they did in the past, the subject-matter de auxiliis divinae gratia, et eorum efficaciâ, conformably to the doctrine of St. Thomas; and likewise the Fathers of the Society, that they also may teach and discuss the same subject-matter, always holding, however, to sound Catholic doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Serry, Hist. Cong. de Aux., I, XXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

This pronouncement practically ended whatever personal participation Báñez had in the famous controversy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
It has been contended that Báñez was at least virtually the founder of present-day Thomism, especially in so far as it includes the theories of [[physical promotion]], the intrinsic [[efficacy of grace]], and [[predestination]] irrespective of foreseen merit. To any reader of Bañez It is evident that he would have met such a declaration with a strenuous denial. Fidelity to [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas]] was his strongest characteristic. [...] He singles out for special animadversion the views in which his professors and associates dissent even lightly from the opinions of the Angelic Doctor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Báñez's zeal for the integrity of Thomistic teaching could brook no doctrinal novelty, particularly if it claimed the sanction of St. Thomas's name. In the voluminous literature of the ''De Auxiliis'' and related controversies, the cardinal tenets of Thomism are ascribed by its opponents to a varied origin: [[Gerhard Schneeman]],&lt;ref&gt;''Controversiarum de divinæ gratiæ liberique arbitrii Concordiâ initiae progressus'', Freiburg im Br., 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; the Rev. [[Father De Regnon]], S. J.&lt;ref&gt;''Bañez et Molina'', Paris, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rev. Father Gaudier, S. J.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Revue des Sciences Ecclésiastiques'', Amiens, 1887, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; are probably the foremost modern writers who designate the Thomists as Bannesians. But against them appears a formidable list of Jesuits of repute who were either Thomists themselves or authorities for other opinions. [[Francisco Suárez|Suárez]], for instance,&lt;ref&gt;Op. omn., XI, ed Vives, Paris, 1886, Opusc., I, Lib. III, De Auxiliis vii.&lt;/ref&gt; credits Medina with the first intimations of physical premotion and elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Op. omn., XI, 50; Opusc. I, Lib. I, De Conc.-Dei, xi, n 6.&lt;/ref&gt; admits that St. Thomas himself once taught it. [[Toletus]]&lt;ref&gt;Comment. in 8 Lib. Aristotelis, Venice, 1573, Lib. II, c. iii, q.8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benedict Pereira|Pererius]]&lt;ref&gt;Pref. to Disquisit. Magicarum Lib. VI, I Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; considered as Thomistic the Catechism of the [[Council of Trent]], which was the work (1566) of three Dominican theologians.&lt;ref&gt;For Delrio see Goudin, Philosophia (Civita Vecchia, 1860), IV pt. IV, 392, Disp. 2, q. 3, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rev. [[Victor Frins]] S. J., gives it as his opinion&lt;ref&gt;S. Thomæ Aq. O.P. doctrina de Cooperatione Dei cum omni naturâ creatâ præsertim liberâ, Responsio ad R.P. Dummermuth O.P., Paris, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; that whilst Medina and [[Pedro Soto]] (1551) taught physical predetermination, the originator of the theory was [[Francis Victoria]], O.P. (d. 1546). The Dominicans [[Ferrariensis]] (1576), [[Saint Cajetan|Cajetan]] (1507), and [[Giovanni Capreolus]] (d. 1436) are also accredited Thomists in the estimation of such authorities as the Jesuits [[Martin Becanus]]&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theol. Schol. (Mainz, 1612), De Deo, xviii, no 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Azorius]],&lt;ref&gt;Institut. Moral. (Rome, 160-11), Lib. I, xxi, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theologians of [[Coimbra]].&lt;ref&gt;Comment. in 8 libros Phys., Lib. II, q. 13, a. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Molina, strangely enough, cites the doctrine of a "certain disciple of St. Thomas"—supposedly Báñez—as differing only in words from the teaching of [[Duns Scotus]], instead of agreeing with that of Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Concordia (Paris 1876), q. 14, a. 13, Disp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; These striking divergences of opinion of which only a few have been cited would seem to indicate that the attempt to father the Thomistic system on Báñez has failed.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Defensio Doctrinæ S. Thomæ, A.M. Dummermuth O.P., Louvain and Paris, 1895, also Card. Zigliara, Summa Phil. (Paris, 1898), II, 525.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Thomistic terminology in the Dominican school was mainly due to the exigencies not only of the stand taken against Molina and the forbidden propositions already mentioned, but of the more important defense against the attacks and aberrations of the Reformers. The "predetermination" and "predefinition" of Báñez and his contemporaries, who included others besides Dominicans, emphasized, on the part of God's knowledge and providence, a priority to, and independence of future free acts, which, in the Catharino-Molinistic theories, seemed to them less clearly to fall under God's causal action. These terms, however, are used by St. Thomas himself.&lt;ref&gt;Comment. de divinis nominibus, Lect. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; The words "physical premotion" were meant to exclude, first a merely moral impulse and, secondly, a concurrence of the Divine causality and free will, without the latter's subordination to the First Cause. That such terms, far from doing violence to the teachings of their great leader, are their true expression, has, of course, been an unvaried tenet of the Thomistic school. One of the presiding officers of the [[Congregatio de Auxiliis]], Cardinal Madruzzi, speaking of Báñez in this connection, said: 'His teaching seems to be deduced from the principles of St. Thomas and to flow wholly from St. Thomas's doctrine, although he differs somewhat in his mode of speaking.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Serry]], Hist. Cong. de Aux. appendix, col. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02247a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Ernst Mally''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|i}}; {{IPA-de|ˈmali|lang}}; 11 October 1879 – 8 March 1944) was an Austrian philosopher affiliated with the so-called [[Graz School]] of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] psychology. A pupil of [[Alexius Meinong]], he was one of the founders of [[deontic logic]] and is mainly known for his contributions in that field of research.

== Life ==
Mally was born in the town of [[Kranj]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Krainburg}}) in the [[Duchy of Carniola]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now in [[Slovenia]]). His father was of [[Slovenes|Slovene]] origin, but identified himself with [[Austrian German]] culture (he also [[Germanize]]d the orthography of his surname, originally spelled Mali, a common Slovene surname of [[Upper Carniola]]). After his death, the family moved to the [[Carniola]]n capital of [[Ljubljana]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Laibach}}). There, Ernst attended the prestigious [[Poljane Grammar School|Ljubljana German language Gymnasium]]. Already at a young age, Mally became a fervent supporter of the [[Pan-German]] nationalist movement of [[Georg von Schönerer]]. In the same time, he developed an interest in philosophy.

In 1898, he enrolled in the [[University of Graz]], where he studied philosophy under the supervision of [[Alexius Meinong]], as well as [[physics]] and mathematics, specializing in [[formal logic]]. He graduated in 1903 with a thesis entitled ''Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie des Messens'' (Investigations in the Object Theory of Measurement). In 1906 he started teaching at a high school in [[Graz]], at the same time collaborating with Adalbert Meingast and working as Meinong's assistant at the university. He also maintained close contacts with the Laboratory for Experimental Psychology, founded by Meinong. In 1912, he wrote his ''[[Habilitation]]'' thesis entitled ''Gegenstandstheoretische Grundlagen der Logik und Logistik'' (''Object-theoretic Foundations for Logics and Logistics'') with Meinong as supervisor.

From 1915 to 1918 he served as an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. After the end of [[World War I]], Mally joined the [[Greater German People's Party]], which called the unification of [[German Austria]] with Germany. In the same period, he started teaching at the university and in 1925 he took over Meinong's chair. In 1938, he became a member of the National Socialist Teachers' Association and two months after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' he joined the [[NSDAP]]. He continued teaching during the [[Austria in the time of National Socialism|Nazi administration of Austria]] until 1942 when he retired. He died in 1944 in [[Schwanberg, Styria|Schwanberg]].

==Philosophical work==

===Mally's deontic logic===
Mally was the first logician ever to attempt an axiomatization of ethics (Mally 1926). He used five axioms, which are given below. They form a [[first-order theory]] that quantifies over [[proposition]]s, and there are several predicates to understand first. !x means that x ought to be the case. Ux means that x is unconditionally obligatory, i.e. that !x is [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. ∩x means that x is unconditionally forbidden, i.e. U(¬x). A f B is the [[binary relation]] A requires B, i.e. A materially implies !B. (All [[Logical consequence|entailment]] in the axioms is [[material conditional]].) It is defined by axiom III, whereas all other terms are defined as a preliminary.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rl}
\mbox{I.} &amp; ((A\; \operatorname{f}\; B) \And (B \to C)) \to (A\; \operatorname{f}\; C) \\
\mbox{II.} &amp; ((A\; \operatorname{f}\; B) \And (A\;\operatorname{f}\;C)) \to (A\; \operatorname{f}\; (B \And C)) \\
\mbox{III.} &amp; (A\; \operatorname{f}\; B) \leftrightarrow\; !(A \to B) \\
\mbox{IV.} &amp; \exists U\; !U \\
\mbox{V.} &amp; \neg (U\; \operatorname{f}\; \cap)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- How could we write an upside-down U instead of \cap? --&gt;

Note the implied [[universal quantifier]]s in the above axioms.

The fourth axiom has confused some logicians because its formulation is not as they would have expected, since Mally gave each axiom a description in words also, and he said that axiom IV meant "the unconditionally obligatory is obligatory", i.e. (as many logicians have insisted) UA → !A. Meanwhile, axiom 5 lacks an object to which the predicates apply, a [[typo]]. However, it turns out these are the least of Mally's worries (see below).

===Failure of Mally's deontic logic===

Theorem: This axiomatization of [[deontic logic]] implies that !x [[if and only if]] x is true, OR !x is unsatisfiable. (This makes it useless to deontic logicians.)
Proof: Using axiom III, axiom I may be rewritten as (!(A → B) &amp; (B → C)) → !(A → C). Since B → C holds whenever C holds, one immediate consequence is that (!(A → B) → (C → !(A → C))). In other words, if A requires B, it requires any true statement. In the special case where A is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], the theorem has consequence (!B → (C → !C)). Thus, if at least one statement ought be true, every statement must [[Material conditional|materially entail]] it ought be true, and so every true statement ought be true. As for the converse (i.e. if some statement ought be true then all statements that ought be true are true), consider the following logic: ((U → !A) &amp; (A → ∩)) → (U → !∩) is a special case of axiom I, but its [[consequent]] contradicts axiom V, and so ¬((U → !A) &amp; (A → ∩)). The result !A → A can be shown to follow from this, since !A implies that U → !A and ¬A implies that A → ∩; and, since these are not both true, we know that !A → A.

Mally thought that axiom I was self-evident, but he likely confused it with an alternative in which the implication B → C is ''logical'', which would indeed make the axiom self-evident. The theorem above, however, would then not be demonstrable. The theorem was proven by [[Karl Menger]], the next deontic logician. Neither Mally's original axioms nor a modification that avoids this result remains popular today. Menger did not suggest his own axioms. (See also deontic logic for more on the subsequent development of this subject.)

===Ontology===
Mally developed a [[Philosophical realism|realistic]] approach to ontology (Mally 1935) and saw himself in opposition to the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[logical positivists]].

'''Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Learning''' is an Orthodox Jewish organization designed to reach out to [[secular Judaism|secular]] and non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]s in the hopes of bringing them into the [[Baal teshuva movement]].

==History==
Officially incorporated on November 30, 1983,&lt;ref name=corp/&gt; Etz Chaim is a multi-faceted outreach center dedicated to reaching Jews of all backgrounds to experience [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schifrin, Daniel. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222799315/ For Baltimore, A New Expo-sure: At the Jewish Food &amp; Life Expo, everything from matzoh balls to marriage]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. November 8, 1991. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its programs, Etz Chaim helps people find study partners for the process of [[Jewish conversion|conversion]] to Orthodox Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Schifrin, Daniel. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222861829/ Judaism Begins At Home: For Doris Feinstein Pollock, conversion instructor, the home is where Jews by choice should discover Judaism.]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 26, 1993. p. 38. &lt;/ref&gt; Etz Chaim says that success is when a person considers their [[Jewish identity]] more valuable, when a person chooses not to [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarry]], or when a person does one [[mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Richard.  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222836269 Getting The Word Out: Jewish outreach workers recommit themselves to strengthening religious observance]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. May 23, 1997. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992, a [[Lubavitch]] family advertised and held Jewish services, ceremonies, and celebrations in their house in Baltimore County.&lt;ref name=homeashul&gt;Lechtman, Jay. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222829213/ When Is A Home A Shul?] ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. February 14, 1992. p. 26. &lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors complained to the local zoning commission, stating that the family were using their home as a synagogue, in direct violation of local zoning laws, parking laws, and noise restrictions.&lt;ref name=homeashul/&gt; Etz Chaim supported the family, stating that enforcing such laws on a place of worship was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=homeashul/&gt;

In 1992, Etz Chaim supported detailed recommendations regarding Jewish celebrations that restricted [[kiddush]] to only one hot dish, cake, and drinks, while a [[b'nai mitzvah]] or wedding celebration may have up to two hot dishes.&lt;ref name= spending&gt;Eisenstadt, Merrie M. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222826957/ Scaling Down Spending Is An Uphill Battle]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. March 27, 1992. p. 23.  &lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations stated that all religious celebrations be held only at a synagogue itself or a synagogue's facilities.&lt;ref name=spending/&gt;

In 1993, Etz Chaim honored Marc Hurwitz for his working helping college students discover or maintain their Jewish identities and fighting [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, Alan H.

''Baltimore Jewish Times''. July 6, 2001. p. 12. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a choir of 61 mixed-gender students in third through fifth grades prepared to sing at a Jewish food and life expo. When Etz Chaim was asked whether it was religiously appropriate for female and male children to sing together, Etz Chaim determined the performance should not go forward.&lt;ref&gt;Harac, Lani.

'''''Faith, Science, and Understanding''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] which explores aspects of the integration between science and theology.  It is based on lectures he gave at the [[University of Nottingham]] and [[Yale]] and on some other papers.

==Publication information==
It was published in 2000 by [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-08372-6}} and issued in paperback in 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-300-09128-1}}. There are 17 citations in Google Scholar [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;cites=10720196843939906329]

==Synopsis==

In '''1. Theology in the University''' Polkinghorne suggests that "the essential purpose of a University is the discovery and propagation of knowledge"(p4) and that universities are institutionalised expressions of the beliefs in the value of knowledge for knowledge's sake and the essential unity of all knowledge. He says that quantum theory illustrates the principle "Do not make common sense the measure of everything but be prepared to recognise aspects of reality in those modes that are intrinsic to their natures, however strange these modes may at first sight be."(p7). He argues that personal experience is a fundamental aspect of reality and that the human intuition of an infinite Reality is another fact about humanity and that one of the roles of theology is the intellectual study of the religious dimension of personal experience (p19), whilst theological metaphysics can offer a more profound understanding of reality (p22)

In '''2. Motivations for Belief''' he rejects simplistic accounts of science, commending instead the approach of [[Michael Polanyi]]. He points out that the laws of nature operate all the time, but that understanding is only possible if we have access to regimes that are particularly transparent to our enquiry (p36) and suggests that God is always there, but there have been particular moments in history that have been unusually open to the divine presence, and that Scripture is ''evidence'', the record of foundational spiritual experience (p37).  He expounds the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and commends [[John Zizioulas]]'s ''Being as Communion''.

In '''3. The Role of Revelation''' he suggests that "revelation bears an analogy with the role played by observations and experiment in science"&lt;ref&gt;Citing for further explanation of this view his books ''Reason and Reality'' Ch 4 &amp; 5, and ''Science and Christian Belief/The Faith of a Physicist'' Ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; and that the pursuit of simplicity through studying extreme conditions (such as [[Deep inelastic scattering]]) is an important part of science.  He also suggests that the fact that the Bible is still read with attention and spiritual profit by so many people so long after it was written is a fact that should be taken into account. (p56)

In '''4. Design in Biology?''' he discusses the [[Anthropic Principle]] and in addition to the well-explored physicist perspective he commends the explorations of [[Michael Denton]] of properties of the physical world that seem to be tuned to life's necessities&lt;ref&gt;citing [[Michael Denton]] ''Nature's Destiny'' Free Press 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the Nobel-prizewinner [[Christian de Duve]]'s assertion "to [[Jacques Monod|Monod]]'s famous sentence 'The universe was not pregnant with life, nor the biosphere with man,' I reply: 'You are wrong. they were.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian de Duve]], ''Vital Dust'' Basic Books 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and also discusses with caution [[Michael Behe]]'s claims about [[irreducible complexity]].

In '''5. Second Thoughts''' he modifies some of his earlier positions somewhat, especially in relation to [[multiverse]] theory.

In '''6. Kenotic Creation and Divine Action''' he discusses [[Arthur Peacocke]] and the nature of causality

In '''7. Natural Science Temporality and Divine Action''' he identifies "four different metascientific accounts of the nature of time, each claiming to derive from contemporary physics"&lt;ref&gt;''Op. cit.'' p131&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''8. Contemporaries''' he discusses the ideas of [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], [[Thomas F. Torrance]] and [[Paul Davies]]

In '''9. Science and Theology in England''' he sketches "the long English history of interaction between theology and science" from [[Robert Grosseteste]] via [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Browne]] and [[Robert Boyle]], citing [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Aubrey Moore]] and [[Frederick Temple]] who "all played an important part in welcoming the insights of [[Charles Darwin]]"&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' pp196-197&lt;/ref&gt; and noting that the great British physicists of the 19th Century "[[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Kelvin]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] were all men of deep religious faith" (p198).  He "feels that every German theologian writes with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] looking over one shoulder and [[Hegel]] looking over another" whereas the English "tend to enjoy a more relaxed relationship with philosophy"(p202)

==Reviews and comment==
* Review by Prof Tom McLiesh for the [[Institute of Physics]] [http://physicsweb.org/articles/review/14/4/4 IoP Physics Web]
* “Polkinghorne is eminently qualified to write on theology and science...[he] strongly argues theology's place in the postmodern university, drawing attention to its methodological affinity with the natural sciences. In both, he insists on a "bottom up" approach—that is, more pragmatic than systematic—in which biblical material and creation are read as evidence, not simply as revelation. Later, he locates himself in a group of scientist-theologians that includes [[Ian Barbour]] and [[Arthur Peacocke]]...[and] critically reviews [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]] and [[Thomas F. Torrance]]...The concluding chapter is a concise history of science and theology in England that corrects popular distortions connected with the reception and continuing influence of Darwin...an engaging discussion of an important, little understood disciplinary intersection as well as a congenial point of entry into Polkinghorne's influential work.” Steven Schroeder— [[Booklist]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0300091281/ cited in Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* “I can’t imagine anyone more qualified to write about science and theology than John Polkinghorne. This is a lively account of his intellectual and theological journey.”— [[Thomas Appelquist]], Yale University&lt;ref&gt;Reviews otherwise un-refed are quoted by [[Yale University Press]] [http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=0300091281 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
* “Irrespective one’s religious belief or non-belief, this book provides intellectual stimulation of a high order.”—Henry H. Bauer, ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]''
* “A gentle discourse, very thoughtful and very English, on the relationship between physics and theology. . . . Worthwhile and intelligent: Polkinghorne has the courage and the ambition to stroll onto a field where most would fear to tread.”— ''Kirkus Reviews''
* “A welcome addition to university or seminary libraries.”— ''[[Library Journal]]''
* “Polkinghorne is respected in the field of theology and science not only because of his credentials as a physicist and priest, but also because he is lucid writer who never uses interdisciplinary concepts as a smokescreen for sloppy thinking...Polkinghorne impresses with a rare combination of theological sensitivity and technical grasp of the scientific and metascientific issues involved.”— ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''
* “An engaging examination of the science—and—religion dialogue written by a seminal figure in the field, John Polkinghorne gives his thoughts on reconciling the processes of the universe with the ideas behind theology. Polkinghorne writes with a gentle sensibility that allows even casual readers to appreciate the depth of his knowledge about the subject.”— ''Research News and Opportunities in Science and Theology''
* “For those seeking a very accessible discussion of current issues in theology and science, albeit primarily physics, I highly recommend this book as well as Polkinghorne’s other books. He is the C. S. Lewis of our time in the science-theology dialogue.”—Eugene E. Selk, [[Theological Studies (journal)|''Theological Studies'']]
* “Fascinating and engaging treatment in the interplay between physics and theology.”—Steven Norman, ''University Press Books for Public and Secondary School Libraries''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1286">A '''falsism''' is a claim that is clearly and [[self-evidence|self-evidently]] wrong. A falsism is usually used merely as a reminder or as a [[rhetorical device|rhetoric]]al or literary device. An example is "pigs can fly". It is the opposite of a [[truism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Family honor''' (or '''honour''') is an abstract concept involving the perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects the social standing and the self-evaluation of a group of related people, both corporately and individually.&lt;ref name="Malina2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce J. Malina|title=The New Testament world: insights from cultural anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek3fSY7jRDcC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=7 November 2011|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22295-6|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; The [[family]] is viewed as the main source of [[honor]] and the community highly values the relationship between honor and the family.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt; The conduct of family members reflects upon family honor and the way the family perceives itself, and is perceived by others.&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; Family honor can be dependent upon many factors and areas that are affected by family honor include multiple aspects of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] such as [[social status]], [[religion]], [[clothing]], [[eating]], [[education]], [[job]] or [[career]], [[ownership]] such as [[real estate]], and [[marriage]].&lt;ref name="Derné1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Derné|title=Culture in action: family life, emotion, and male dominance in Banaras, India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-meiAuhm1K8C&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2425-4|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who live in [[Honor culture#Cultures of honour and cultures of law|cultures of honor]], perceive family as the central [[institution]] in their society and a person's social identity depends largely on their family.&lt;ref name="Malina"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce J. Malina|title=The New Testament world: insights from cultural anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek3fSY7jRDcC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22295-6|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important for these individuals to fulfill expectations of family and society in order to be accepted by their family and experience feelings of belonging to this central institution that they are tied to through birth or marriage.&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt; In some cultures, maintaining family honor is perceived as more important than either [[individual freedom]], or individual achievement.&lt;ref name="McGoldrickGiordano2005"/&gt;

The ideology and practice of family honor varies from country to country. Individuals of certain cultures are often unaware or discerning in their understanding of differing cultural [[traditions]]. Many fail to grasp the concept of honor as the basis for traditions such as defending one's honor or their family's. Some cultures value family honor more than others.&lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt; Many times a family's honor may overpower the actions or beliefs of the individual. However, a theme that is common within many traditions is the respecting of elders.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt; Children of the family are to respect their elders who have earned what some call a "badge of 'honor'" representative of their age. Once an individual has lived throughout life for several years, they have earned this badge of honor and should be shown respect teaching their young the cultural traditions that have deemed them honorable.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt;
 
==History==
An individual is considered as honorable based on his/her behaviors and characteristics he or she displays that the society deems to be worthy of honor. In addition, honor also entails the aspect of how high of a position an individual holds in relation to the group and how much he or she is respected by others.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: unlocking New Testament Culture"/&gt;

One of the ideals of family honor is [[social class]]. Social class can be defined as a group of people categorized into a hierarchy based on the amount of money they have accumulated, how much education they have received, and the amount of power they hold within society, amongst other variables. People who play similar roles within society tend to have similar outlooks. Social standing affects the way in which families form. It determines how and who a person mates with, how they raise their children, and how people relate to one another.&lt;ref name="Social"/&gt;

Historically, honor is a quality ascribed to an individual in two ways: either by obtaining it through his or her birth into an honorable family or being assigned as honorable by powerful people who hold higher status in the society.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malina2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce J. Malina|title=The New Testament world: insights from cultural anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek3fSY7jRDcC|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22295-6|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's parental [[Kinship|lineage]], is the traditional source for his or her honor.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: unlocking New Testament Culture1"/&gt; Because honor is passed through paternal lineage in most [[patrilineality|patrilineal cultures]], these societies historically considered having sons as a source of pride and honor. For example, in the Moroccan culture, it is still a preference among women to have sons instead of daughters. [[Morocco]] is a typical patrilineal society in which the son has a more important function for the family such as the son supports his parents once they have aged compared to the daughter who will marry into a different group becoming a loss to the family. In such societies men also hold more sexual rights compared to women besides the supportive role men obtain from caring for their aging parents. Females in these societies are perceived as threats to family honor.&lt;ref name="Muslim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everyday Life in the Muslim Middle East"/&gt;

Within cultures, honor is an important and highly esteemed theme. It can be maintained through living up to one's word and promises, providing for the family, and keeping a certain social status. Honor can be affected by both men and women through ways in which a man heightens his family's honorable status, and a woman can shame her family through disapproved actions. Ensuing constant pressure to uphold her family's honor, a woman can suffer psychological and social damage.&lt;ref name="Muslim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everyday Life in the Muslim Middle East2"/&gt;

===Gender roles===
The different effects honor instills upon men and women can be seen in the ancient world, where women and men played contrasting roles in society. Men displayed their honorable roles in public while women were restricted to the limitations of their households. While in public, women were required to avoid conversations with estranged men while only visiting places frequented by women.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: unlocking New Testament Culture3"/&gt; In the present Islamic culture, men hold a higher social status, but they also carry more responsibility in caring and providing for their family. If a man is single or childless his place in society does not waver or become lower. A woman should have a family whom she stays faithful to and respectful towards at all times.&lt;ref name="Muslim"/&gt; A man's actions will not greatly affect or hurt his family's standing like a woman's actions would. Women are perceived as vulnerable individuals who must be kept safe at all times. This aspect of a woman's characterization comes from her fertility and role within her family.&lt;ref name="Muslim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everyday Life in the Muslim Middle East2"/&gt;

Societies in which "family honor" is considered highly important generally place a correspondingly high degree of restriction of the freedom of women.&lt;ref name="Derné1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginat19972"/&gt; In these cultures, a family may defend its honor, or may seek reparation or revenge if the family honor is perceived to have been abused or treated with disrespect.&lt;ref name="JosephNajmabadi"/&gt; In [[Ancient Rome]], sexual activity of married women outside of their marriage was seen as dishonor to the family and it was legal for men to kill their wives or married daughters that shamed the family through adultery.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt; Reasoning for the designation of women to private and/or nonmale areas comes from the ancient tradition of a woman's place in the world. Women are not seen as independent individuals, but rather extensions of their male counterparts' identity and honor.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: unlocking New Testament Culture3"/&gt;

===Family honor within society===
Because the approval of honor is dependent upon the recognition of others, during ancient times individuals worked hard for the approval of their peers within their societal cultures. This meant that individuals were more likely to behave like their honorable counterparts.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: unlocking New Testament Culture6"/&gt; Groups reinforced what it meant to be honorable through various expected behaviors and goals placed amongst individual members. This discouraged members from any negative activity that may have adversely affected a group or family's honor. In the event that the leader of the group promoted actions that did not appear to be honorable on a larger societal scale, the leader then offered some explanation defending their actions which lead to the preservation of what they defined as honor and their traditions forever.&lt;ref name="Kinship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: unlocking New Testament Culture6"/&gt;

In [[Ancient Rome]], chastity and loyalty of members of a family was an important factor contributing to family honor in addition to social standing and accomplishments of that family.&lt;ref name="KertzerSaller1993"/&gt; For example, if a married woman committed [[adultery]], her father had the legal right to kill her whereas her husband was required to divorce her.&lt;ref name="KertzerSaller1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="julian laws"/&gt; If the husband chose not to divorce his wife, he would jeopardize his honor and be labeled as a pimp.&lt;ref name="julian laws"/&gt;

===In opposition to freedom===

In some cultures with strong principles of family honor, offspring are not free to choose a partner for themselves but may instead be expected to enter into an [[arranged marriage]] or if the offspring resists, into a [[forced marriage]] or [[child marriage]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hedersfortryck.se/hedersfortryck/vad-ar-hedersrelaterat-vald-och-fortryck/utsatta-och-forovare/|title=Utsatta och förövare {{!}} Hedersförtryck.se|work=Länsstyrelsen Östergötland|access-date=17 November 2017|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hedersfortryck.se/hedersfortryck/aktenskapstvang-och-barnaktenskap/|title=Barn- och tvångsäktenskap {{!}} Hedersförtryck.se {{!}} Barn- och tvångsäktenskap|last=|first=|date=|work=Länsstyrelsen Östergötland|access-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hedersfortryck.se/hedersfortryck/vad-ar-hedersrelaterat-vald-och-fortryck/kollektivistiska-strukturer/|title=Kollektivistiska strukturer {{!}} Hedersförtryck.se|last=|first=|date=|work=County administrative board of Ostrogothia ([[Länsstyrelsen]] [[Östergötland]])|access-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males and females in this type of honor culture may act as either persecutors and the oppressed,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; for instance a son in a family may be forced to enter into an arranged marriage by his older relatives while controlling his sisters.

==Family honor within different cultures==

===Middle East and Africa===
The aspects of family honor mentioned above differ throughout varying cultures and countries. Family honor in the [[Bedouin]] and other Middle Eastern cultures consists of interdependent forms of ird and sharaf. Ird is the honor of a woman she is born with which involves her chastity and continence whereas sharaf is the honor code for men which depends on ird of women in the family. Due to its connection to ird, sharaf includes protecting ird of the family members. The adherence to these gender-specific honor codes  is important to keep the respectability and sexual honors of the family, particularly men, known as [[namus]].&lt;ref name="Ginat1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmoni"/&gt; For example, the sexual relationships of a girl are seen in these societies to make her impure and of lesser value, which affects her eligibility for marriage. Public knowledge and gossip about sexual impurity or adultery are proposed to be the main reasons that loss of family honor can bring shame to the family.&lt;ref name="Ginat19971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="antoun"/&gt; Preservation of family honor is not only important for respectability of family members in society but also affects the fate of all family members. To protect family honor and dignity, families may resort in killing the woman who is involved in the dishonorable act.&lt;ref name="Ginat19971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ginat2"/&gt; In an associated context, to protect the purity and chastity of young girls, families may decide to practice [[female genital mutilation]], a practice that removes or damages female genital organs to assure that sex will not be pleasurable. A mutilated woman is changed so that she has no desire to engage in sexual activity that may undermine the family's honor.&lt;ref name="benok"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FerraroAndreatta2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary P. Ferraro|author2=Susan Andreatta|title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6XO9Sgt9y8C&amp;pg=PA277|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=24 February 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60192-0|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this can be seen in [[Sierra Leone]], Africa where young girls are mutilated every year. The number of girls mutilated in Africa per year has risen to 3 million.&lt;ref name="Mutilation"/&gt; Rugiatu Turay, founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement, protects young girls from being circumcised by other women in secret societies like [[Sande society|Sande]] and other female practitioners who still engage in the ceremonial tradition today. Girls as young as the age of five assist in the mutilation of other young girls in the country.&lt;ref name="Mutilation"/&gt; At the age of 12, Turay was snatched by female family members, held down and had her clitoris cut off with a knife. She was beaten, forced to walk, and had hot pepper water poured in her eyes. As she was mutilated, the women sang, danced, and clap ceremoniously.&lt;ref name="Mutilation"/&gt; According to these women, Turay had become a woman. However, females are generally mutilated under the age of 15. Girls who are trained to assist in this ceremony are trained as young as five years old. Turay has convinced 400 practitioners to stop the practice of female mutilation, but 97 million females have been mutilated within the country and the numbers remain constant, even increasing.&lt;ref name="Mutilation"/&gt; The practice has been enforced by politicians within the country and locals refer to the practice as a ceremony that initiates womanhood, prepares females for marriage, and restricts their sexual conduct.&lt;ref name="Mutilation"/&gt;

====Turkey====

Family honor is a highly valued concept known as [[namus]] in [[Turkey]] and it is linked to female modesty, chastity, and family reputation among other families,&lt;ref name="Lee1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary R. Lee|title=Family structure and interaction: a comparative analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frfH-mHHXcoC&amp;pg=PA177|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=November 1982|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-1091-4|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as loyalty.&lt;ref name="Sheehan2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Sheehan|title=Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qBqjNxsZVnwC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=April 2004|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-1705-7|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ideology of preserving family honor is deeply rooted is society and is not affected by high levels of education. Many women in Turkey are well educated&lt;ref name="DiPiazzaSchultz2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francesca DiPiazza|author2=Sam Schultz|title=Turkey in Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWdCQJmziBgC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-1169-4|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still are expected to be modest and sexually pure in order to preserve the honor of their families. If a family's honor is breached, it brings shame to the entire family. In such cases, traditionally the family would decide the fate of the female that brought shame. This might involve forcing the young woman into a [[shotgun wedding]], while in extreme cases a young male in the family was given the duty to cleanse the family name through an [[honor killing]].&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Zeiss Stange|author2=Carol K. Oyster|author3=Jane E. Sloan|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA723|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=23 February 2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5|page=723}}&lt;/ref&gt; With recent changes to criminal law that removed reduced sentences for honor killings, females that brought shame to the family are sometimes forced to commit honor suicides by their families, especially in the predominantly Kurdish South-East regions, a region that greatly values traditions.&lt;ref name="StangeOyster2011" /&gt; Families who do not want their sons to face possible incrimination have encouraged their daughters to commit suicide. The number of female suicides over the years has increased greatly. Stories have surfaced revealing girls who are given tools with which to kill themselves such as rope to hang themselves, poisons to drink, or a gun to shoot themselves. Some murders have also been disguised as suicides in order to protect family members.&lt;ref name="Turkey"/&gt; Female family members are not the only ones that may be punished to preserve family honor. It is proposed that the death of a male homosexual physics student, Ahmet Yildiz, was an honor killing.&lt;ref name="gay killing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Birch|first=Nicholas|title=Was Ahmet Yildiz the victim of Turkey's first gay honour killing?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/was-ahmet-yildiz-the-victim-of-turkeys-first-gay-honour-killing-871822.html|work=The Independent|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=14 November 2011|location=London|date=19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Republican People Party have stated that in the six months preceding Hatice Firat's death a woman had been killed every day because of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Firat"/&gt;

===South Asia===
Similar to the South African and Turkish culture, family is a central value for Asian societies.&lt;ref name="JosephNajmabadi2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suad Joseph|author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi|title=Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures: Family, law, and politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Uyypm6T7ZsC&amp;pg=PA510|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12818-7|pages=510–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian families are usually multi-generational, patriarchal and self-sufficient structures strongly bound to traditions.&lt;ref name="JosephNajmabadi2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giacomelli2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gianni Giacomelli|title=The Face of Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8TcSX5Y7Q4C&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=November 2007|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-84753-856-7|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[India]] touching feet of relatives and elderly is a ritual to express respect and submission.&lt;ref name="DeMello2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and footwear: a cultural encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, family honor entails different components depending on the continental region. For example, family honor is strongly linked to female chastity in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[India]] in a similar fashion to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean societies.&lt;ref name="Derné1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JosephNajmabadi"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suad Joseph|author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi|title=Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures: Family, body, sexuality and health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzXzWgVajnQC&amp;pg=PA464|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12819-4|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JosephNajmabadi2003"/&gt; Whereas men threaten family honor by extreme actions such as murder and addiction, females may dishonor family by leaving the house too often or having unnecessary conversations with men.&lt;ref name="Derné1995"/&gt; [[Sikh]] women need to be modest and reserved to be considered honorable; even rape is seen as a major insult to family honor.&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sushil Mittal|author2=Gene R. Thursby|title=Religions of South Asia: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44lBT7_0lDwC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=9 November 2011|date=4 April 2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-22390-4|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures near the Middle East also consider involuntary sexual assaults dishonorable and shameful.

====Far East Asia====
Contrastingly in other Asian cultures, especially for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other factors such as education.&lt;ref name="Edmundson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea Edmundson|title=Globalized e-learning cultural challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QXK6R503xoC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=9 November 2011|year=2007|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=978-1-59904-301-2|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic success of a student is seen as a source of pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid academic failure which brings shame to the family.&lt;ref name="Edmundson2007"/&gt; In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In [[Japan]], for example, ritualized suicide practices such as [[harakiri]] were committed by Japanese [[samurai]] for centuries in the event of a defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the shame of defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.&lt;ref name="Current opinion"/&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, similar to traditional practices in South Africa, honor relates to different concepts depending on the geographic area; whereas honor is  strongly linked to family reputation in the [[Mediterranean]] countries, in [[Northern Europe]] it has a more individualized meaning that is focused on personal accomplishments and qualities.&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; Similar to gender-specific family honor codes in the Middle East, Mediterranean nations also traditionally exhibit such codes; women are seen as honorable by their chastity whereas men are seen as honorable by their productivity, toughness, and by protecting the honor of the women.&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaGumina2000"/&gt; In Italy, infidelity of women was seen dishonorable, thus crimes of passion were classified as second-degree murders until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="LaGumina2000"/&gt; Although Western and Northern European nations traditionally have a more individualistic approach to honor, there have been an increase in [[honor killings]] or [[crimes of passion]] within their borders by immigrant populations residing in these countries.&lt;ref name="BBChonorkill"/&gt; The European culture also served as a basis for American traditions of honor as well.&lt;ref name="Steward2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dick Steward|title=Duels and the roots of violence in Missouri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEDZplQZGCMC&amp;pg=GBS.PA6http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Febooks%2Freader%3Fid%3Dub2gfqnxkwAC|accessdate=13 November 2011|date=June 2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1284-9|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mainly Muslim [[Kosovo]], the impact on family honor of admitting one has been raped, has discouraged some women from applying for compensation as victims of atrocities committed during the 1998-99 [[Kosovo War|war with Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597222010/not-all-kosovar-women-raped-during-war-with-serbia-apply-for-compensation Not All Kosovar Women Raped During War With Serbia Apply For Compensation]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====

In Denmark, the migration authority published that 24% of immigrants of non-Western heritage and their offspring of ages 18-29 were limited in [[Endogamy|their choice of partner by their relatives]]. The report showed a higher incidence for women than men and in areas with high concentrations of migrants, 59% were limited in choice of partner. Of migrant women who lived in high-concentration areas, fewer of those in education or employment were limited.  Of migrant women who live in areas with a low share of migrants, 22% were limited in partner choice. It was also shown that migrant youth are more limited if their social circles only comprises other migrants when it came to choosing a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uim.dk/nyheder/integration-i-tal/integration-i-tal-nr-4-4-januar-2017/ikke-vestlige-unge-i-ghettoer-foler-sig-mest-begraenset-i-valg-af-kaereste-eller-aegtefaelle|title=Ikke-vestlige kvinder i ghettoer føler sig mest begrænset i valg af kæreste eller ægtefælle — Udlændinge- og Integrationsministeriet|website=uim.dk|language=da|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uim.dk/nyheder/nyhedsbrev-aeresrelateret-viden/aeresrelateret-viden-nr-1-27-marts-2017|title=Æresrelateret viden, nr. 1, 27. marts 2017 — Udlændinge- og Integrationsministeriet|website=uim.dk|language=da|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
In 2018, an investigation into court cases involving domestic violence against children showed that 47% of the cases involved parents who were both born abroad. According to a researcher at [[Norwegian Police University College]] the over-representation was due to cultural (honor culture) and legal differences in Norway and foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrk.no/mr/nrk-undersoking_-47-prosent-av-alle-born-i-familievaldsaker-er-innvandrarar-1.14204426|title=NRK-undersøking: 47 prosent av alle born i familievaldsaker er innvandrarar|last=Trovåg|first=Einar Orten|work=NRK|access-date=2018-09-22|language=nn-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sweden ====
The [[Swedish National Police Board]] and the [[Swedish Prosecution Authority]] define honor related crime as crimes against a relative who, according to the perpetrator and his family's point of view has disohonoured the family honor. These crimes are intended to prevent the family honor being damaged or to restore damaged or lost family honor.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/941451364|title=Våld i nära relationer - en folkhälsofråga : förslag för ett effektivare arbete : betänkande|last=relationer.|first=Sverige.

The most serious honor related crime is often organised and deliberate. Incidents include torture, forced suicides, forced marriages, rapes, kidnapping, assault, mortal threats, extortion and protecting a criminal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In a 2009 study by the [[Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society]] (MUCF), about 70 000 individuals of ages 16-25 stated they could not freely choose whom to marry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mucf.se/att-bli-gift-mot-sin-vilja|title=Att bli gift mot sin vilja {{!}} MUCF|website=www.mucf.se|language=sv|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MUCF report is limited to people aged 16-25 and for instance excludes adult women who wish to divorce but are threatened with violence due to family honor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women in such situations face a greater threat as they are persecuted by both their own extended family and that of the husband.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some [[Women's shelter|women's shelters]] report that nearly all women who seek refuge with them are fleeing honor based violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2012, the county administrative board of Östergötland got a mandate to coordinate efforts against honor culture-based violence and persecution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to an investigation of 3000 cases by newspaper [[Göteborgsposten]], the most common scenario are girls being supervised and banned from being outside the home after school hours, who are forced [[Islamic veil|to wear an Islamic veil]] and girls risking a forced marriage. About 80% of the [[Corporal punishment in the home|child victims have been physically abused]], most frequently with bare hands but also being beaten with belts or cables. In several cases the children have been burned with kitchen utensils or metal objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/hedersflickorna/gp-avsl%C3%B6jar-527-unga-offer-f%C3%B6r-hedern-1.4310835#/|title=GP AVSLÖJAR: 527 unga offer för hedern|work=Göteborgs-Posten|access-date=25 December 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 interview, researcher Astrid Schlytter stated that polls had shown that a third of all girls with two foreign-born parents faced restrictions in school, are forbidden to have a boyfriend and must be a virgin when they marry and they are not allowed to choose whom they marry. Using patterns of behaviour observed in Denmark, Norway and the UK Schlytter estimated that there were 240 000youth suffer under an honour culture (Swedish: ''hedersförtryck'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/knnm9/forskare-240-000-unga-i-sverige-kan-vara-drabbade|title=Forskare: ”240 000 unga i Sverige kan vara drabbade av hedersförtryck”|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=2018-09-22|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
In the UK, honor crimes include forced marriage and female genital mutilation and honour based crimes disproportionally affect women from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/07/only-5-of-honour-crimes-reported-to-police-are-referred-to-cps|title=Only 5% of 'honour' crimes reported to police are referred to CPS|last=Summers|first=Hannah|date=7 November 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|language=en|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of honor crimes reported to police increased from 3335 in 2014 to 5595 in 2015, an increase of 68%, before a slight drop to 5105 in 2016. Figures published by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] showed that 256 crimes were referred to the CPS by police in 2016-17, about 5% of the cases reported. Of the 256 referrals, 215 lead to prosecutions which resulted in 122 convictions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===North America===

====The Old South====
{{further|Culture of honor (Southern United States)}}
The [[Old South]] took honor particularly seriously. Southerners in the Old South held themselves to their own sets of social codes.&lt;ref name="Wyatt-Brown1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertram Wyatt-Brown|title=Honor and violence in the Old South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSU1xWLfk7wC&amp;pg=GBS.PA3http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Febooks%2Freader%3Fid%3Dub2gfqnxkwAC|accessdate=13 November 2011|date=11 December 1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504242-9|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An affront to a Southerner's honor, if serious enough, was resolved by a duel. [[Dueling]] was originally a European custom, later adopted by the United States.&lt;ref name="Steward2000"/&gt; Dueling was not technically legal in the United States, but it was difficult to enforce the laws written against it, especially in the Old South.&lt;ref name="Williams2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack K. Williams|title=Dueling in the Old South: Vignettes of Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub2gfqnxkwAC&amp;pg=GBS.PA5.w.1.1.0http%3A%2F%2Fbookshttp%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Febooks%2Freader%3Fid%3Dub2gfqnxkwAC|accessdate=13 November 2011|date=1 June 2000|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-0-89096-193-3|pages=3–5|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually only men engaged in duels; their opponents were men they perceived to be equals.&lt;ref name="Wyatt-Brown1986"/&gt; Public opinion for dueling varied: some thought it was a barbaric and backwards custom, while others believed it was a perfectly legitimate way of dealing with affronts to honor.&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt;

===Hispanic countries and culture===
Looking at the [[Hispanic]] community, similar to many of the countries mentioned above, elders are seen as wise and are to be shown respect from other family members. Family members turn to elders for help regularly, and when a family member falls ill wisdom on what should be done to care for the ill family member is searched for within the elders of the family.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt;

Men are the dominant figures within their households and embody a decisive, authoritative role. Contrary to popular belief, women hold as much weight within their homes as their husbands. They are the matriarchs of the family, and the family's health and stability relies on the mother. Although they need to be protected, women are cherished within their families as important figures.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt; 
   
Hispanic families strongly display their emotions towards one another. Family members show that they care and love one another through taking care of each other. They search for reinforcement and support within their own homes more often than they would in today's society.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt;  The Hispanic culture has what is called [[Curandero|Curanderismo]].  This is a system in which families consult the help of a religious figure called a curandero who gives medical, psychological, and social advice. Families make offerings unto the curandero such as money, candle lighting, creating metal or wooden offerings (shaped in the form of the body part in need of healing), etc.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt; 
    
Many families believe that all personal or familial issues should be kept within the home. The Hispanic culture values modesty for all individuals including males and children in addition to females who historically, are expected to behave in a modest fashion.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt; Family members that suffer from mental illnesses are reluctant to inform their family members of this information in fear that their family members will criticize them.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt;

In the aspect of childbirth, men are required to wait until after the mother has had birth and dressed in a decent manner to visit his wife and newborn child.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt; Mothers typically accompany the new mother during birth. Much like the American culture, Hispanic women take time to rest after childbirth, but traditionally they returned to heavier labor jobs as opposed to jobs normally held by women within society.&lt;ref name="Hispanic"/&gt;

====Brazil====
In one country in particular [[Brazil]], the community attempts to divide the upper-class families who are considered honorable from the lower-class families who are seen as a threat to society in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="Brazil1"/&gt; The country defends family honor through the creation of different policies and laws, but this has caused great opposition. Politics has played a major in role in determining the status and meaning of what is considered to be honorable within Brazils’ society.&lt;ref name="Brazil1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caulfield"/&gt;

=====Honor of women in Brazil=====
In the late 1800s Viveiros de Castro noted an increase in violations of female honor within Brazil at the turn of the century. Women were expanding their roles throughout society which many believed opened doors for women to be taken advantage of and seduced. Viveiros de Castro believed that women's working in factories was a threat to society and morality.&lt;ref name="Brazil2"/&gt; Men believed that the new change in opinion amongst women contributed to this new susceptibility. Many men believed that women believed they were freer than they actually were, and because of this the actions of women led them to lose honor because of their lack of dependency on the male gender. The new century had changed the image of how women were historically perceived and portrayed. Certain individuals, a judge by the name of Nelson Hungria (quoted in Sueann Caulfield's book) specifically, labeled a woman's reserved role as the source of her honor which was lost once she branched out into society losing this reserved quality attributed to women.&lt;ref name="Brazil2"/&gt; Because women chose to leave the traditional role of being the homemaker they lost the characterization of being innocent and some assumed they were engaging sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Caulfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil2"/&gt;

Michael Herzfeld, an [[anthropologist]], argued that the idea of women losing their [[chastity]] derived from those who wished to explain a woman's new role within society.&lt;ref name="Brazil3"/&gt; The idea of women expanding their roles outside of the home in society went against the ideas and morals that were upheld centuries before. In order to defend this morality, many highlighted the customs of the past as something that should have been continuously practiced and enforced even in a new modern era.&lt;ref name="Brazil3"/&gt;

Many women were subjected to sexual trials in which they were criticized for being dishonorable. Women during this time were similar to their ancestors. They engaged in practices such as sex before marriage, consenting to unions, and taking on the head role within their homes.&lt;ref name="Brazil3"/&gt; However, these acts were perceived in an extremely contrasting manner during this period (after [[World War I]]). Because of this, many were uncertain of how they should approach the act of preserving sexual honor.&lt;ref name="Caulfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil3"/&gt;

=====Politics and honor within Brazil=====
Turning to a different aspect of society that intertwined itself with idea of honor, politics played a major role in defining honor within Brazil. The country attempted to define honor while displaying this view of honor along with the country's traditions to others around the world. In September 1920, [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Queen Elisabeth]] made a trip to [[Brazil]]. This trip sparked major controversy from different parties in the country. Many believed the trip was an attempt to "Europeanize" the country. Some viewed the trip as a positive way to show off Brazil the country and its civilization.&lt;ref name="Brazil1"/&gt; Others viewed the trip as a negative opportunity in which the culture would attempt to conform to European standards. In doing so, attempts by the upper class would be made to hide Brazil's struggle of poverty which was a main part of its society and culture at the time. With this trip the importance of honor intensified.&lt;ref name="Brazil1"/&gt; Before the King and Queen arrived, preparing for the couple included exposing and exercising honor in a manner many believed would promote the division of social classes and international affairs. Those who were responsible for posing as advocates for their country concealed their social class under what was perceived as honorable and behaved as though they themselves were a part of an "honorable" class.&lt;ref name="Brazil1"/&gt; One of the aspects they displayed were gender ideologies that played a crucial role in differentiating social classes from one another. Natives desired to portray the country the best way possible. In doing so, they defended their families’ traditions and morals and sexual honor.&lt;ref name="Brazil1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caulfield"/&gt;

Towards the end of the 1930s, the definition of honor within Brazilian society has transformed completely. In result, in 1940, a penal code derived definitions of the term honor. Sexual crimes became a breaking of not family honor but "social customs".&lt;ref name="Brazil4"/&gt; With the Vargas regime (Dictator Getúlio Vargas who ruled from 1937–1945), came a new form or definition of honor. Many attribute the change in the meaning of honor and a devaluing of its meaning to Vargas’ rule. Vargas attributed the aspect of authority to the meaning of honor. Vargas closely tied traditional Brazilian family honor with the aspect of the nation's honor.&lt;ref name="Brazil4"/&gt; Through his regime, Vargas intended to create a hierarchy of social, authoritative classes. However, debates over class, and gender in relation to honor and the nation of Brazil continued to take place. Women continued to transform their traditional roles and these changes could not be neglected.&lt;ref name="Caulfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil4"/&gt;

Its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following freedom rights: users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it. GNU software guarantees these freedom-rights legally (via its license), and is therefore [[free software]]; the use of the word "free" always being taken to refer to freedom.

In order to ensure that the ''entire'' software of a computer grants its users all freedom rights (use, share, study, modify), even the most fundamental and important part, the [[operating system]] (including all its numerous utility programs), needed to be free software. According to its manifesto, the founding goal of the project was to build a free operating system and, if possible, "everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free." Stallman decided to call this operating system ''[[GNU]]'' (a [[recursive acronym]] meaning "''GNU's not Unix''"), basing its design on that of [[Unix]], a [[Proprietary software for linux|proprietary operating system]].&lt;ref name="manifesto"&gt;{{cite web

The project's current work includes software development, awareness building, political campaigning and sharing of the new material.

== Origins ==

Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a [[Usenet]] message in September 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/net.unix-wizards/8twfRPM79u0/1xlglzrWrU0J
 | title = new Unix implementation | author = Richard Stallman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the GNU project first started they had an [[Emacs]] text editor with [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] for writing editor commands, a source level [[debugger]], a [[yacc]]-compatible [[parsing|parser]] generator, and a [[Linker (computing)|linker]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah; and Nick Montfort. "The GNU Manifesto." ''The NewMediaReader''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 2003. pp.545-550.&lt;/ref&gt; The GNU system required its own C compiler and tools to be free software, so these also had to be developed. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler ([[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]), an editor ([[Emacs|GNU Emacs]]), and various Unix utilities (such as &lt;code&gt;[[ls]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[grep]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[awk]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[make (software) | make]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[GNU linker | ld]]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull3.html#SEC11
 | title = GNU's Bulletin, vol. 1 no. 3
 | date = June 1987
 | work = gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had an initial kernel that needed more updates.

Once the kernel and the compiler were finished, GNU was able to be used for program development. The main goal was to create many other applications to be like the Unix system. GNU was able to run Unix programs but was not identical to it. GNU incorporated longer file names, file version numbers, and a crashproof file system. The GNU Manifesto was written to gain support and participation from others for the project. Programmers were encouraged to take part in any aspect of the project that interested them. People could donate funds, computer parts, or even their own time to write code and programs for the project.&lt;ref name="manifesto"/&gt;

The origins and development of most aspects of the GNU Project (and free software in general) are shared in a detailed narrative in the Emacs help system. (C-h g runs the Emacs editor command &lt;kbd&gt;describe-gnu-project&lt;/kbd&gt;.) It is the same detailed history as at their web site.

== GNU Manifesto ==
 
{{Main article | GNU Manifesto}}

The GNU Manifesto was written by Richard Stallman to gain support and participation in the GNU Project. In the GNU Manifesto, Stallman listed four freedoms essential to software users: freedom to run a program for any purpose, freedom to study the mechanics of the program and modify it, freedom to redistribute copies, and freedom to improve and change modified versions for public use.&lt;ref name="GNU Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html

 | accessdate = 2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;Weber, S. (2004). ''The Success of Open Source''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To implement these freedoms, users needed full access to code. To ensure code remained free and provide it to the public, Stallman created the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), which allowed software and the future generations of code derived from it to remain free for public use.

== Philosophy and activism ==

{{Main article | Free software movement}}

Although most of the GNU Project's output is technical in nature, it was launched as a social, ethical, and political initiative. As well as producing software and licenses, the GNU Project has published a number of writings, the majority of which were authored by Richard Stallman.

== Free software ==

The GNU project uses software that is free for users to copy, edit, and distribute. It is free in the sense that users can change the software to fit individual needs. The way programmers obtain the free software depends on where they get it. The software could be provided to the programmer from friends or over the Internet, or the company a programmer works for may purchase the software.

== Funding ==

Proceeds from associate members, purchases, and donations support the GNU project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/help/help.html#funds Helping the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation]. gnu.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyleft ==

{{main article | Copyleft}}

[[Copyleft]] is what helps maintain free use of this software among other programmers. Copyleft gives the legal right to everyone to use, edit, and redistribute programs or programs' code as long as the distribution terms do not change. As a result, any user who obtains the software legally has the same freedoms as the rest of its users do.

The GNU Project and the FSF sometimes differentiate between "strong" and "weak" copyleft. "Weak" copyleft programs typically allow distributors to link them together with non-free programs, while "strong" copyleft strictly forbids this practice. Most of the GNU Project's output is released under a strong copyleft, although some is released under a weak copyleft or a lax, push-over free software license.{{Citation needed | date=January 2016}}

== Operating system development ==

[[File:HURD Live CD.png | thumb|GNU Hurd live CD]]
{{main article|GNU}}

The first goal of the GNU project was to create a whole free-software operating system. By 1992, the GNU project had completed all of the major operating system utilities, but had not completed their proposed [[Kernel (operating system)|operating system kernel]], [[GNU Hurd]]. With the release of the [[Linux kernel]], started independently by [[Linus Torvalds]] in 1991, and released under the GPL with version 0.12 in 1992, for the first time it was possible to run an operating system composed completely of free software. Though the Linux kernel is not part of the GNU project, it was developed using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and other GNU programming tools and was released as free software under the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | author = Linus Benedict Torvalds
 | publisher = comp.os.minix
 | date = August 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of present, the GNU project has not released a version of [[GNU/Hurd]] that is suitable for production environments since the commencement of the GNU/Hurd project over {{Time ago|Dec 31, 1990}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/status.html|title=GNU Hurd/ hurd/ status|website=GNU Operating System|publisher=Free Software Foundation|access-date=2018-04-15|quote="It may not be ready for production use, as there are still some bugs and missing features."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux ==

Today a stable version (or variant) of GNU can be run by combining the GNU packages with the [[Linux kernel]], making a functional [[Unix-like]] system. The GNU project calls this GNU/Linux, and the defining features are the combination of:

* GNU packages&lt;ref name=gnu_packages&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html#allgnupkgs
 | title = All GNU packages
 | work = gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gnu_packages_fsf&gt;[http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GNU GNU @ Free Software Directory] (fsf.org)&lt;/ref&gt; (except for GNU Hurd) &lt;br /&gt;The GNU packages consist of numerous operating system tools and utilities ([[Bash (Unix shell)|shell]], [[GNU Core Utilities|coreutils]], compilers, libraries, etc.)&lt;ref name=gnu_packages /&gt;&lt;ref name=gnu_packages_fsf /&gt; including a library implementation of all of the functions specified in [[POSIX]] System Application Program Interface (POSIX.1).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/POSIX.html POSIX - The GNU C Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[GNU C Library#A temporary fork]]&lt;/ref&gt; The GCC compiler can generate machine-code for a large variety of computer-architectures.&lt;ref&gt;[[GNU Compiler Collection#Architectures|GCC Architectures]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linux kernel]] – this implements program scheduling, multitasking, device drivers, memory management, etc. and allows the system to run on a large [[List of Linux-supported computer architectures|variety of computer-architectures]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kernel.org/#whatislinux The Linux Kernel Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linus Torvalds]] released the [[Linux kernel|Linux]] kernel under the [[GNU General Public License]] in 1992;&lt;ref name=linux_free&gt;[http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/linux/historical/kernel/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 Release Notes for Linux v0.12]&lt;/ref&gt; it is however not part of the GNU project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#allgpled Should the GNU/name convention be applied to all programs that are GPL'ed?] GNU/Linux FAQ by Richard Stallman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#whyslash Why do you write “GNU/Linux” instead of “GNU Linux”?] GNU/Linux FAQ by Richard Stallman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#claimlinux Isn't it wrong for us to label Linus Torvalds' work as GNU?] GNU/Linux FAQ by Richard Stallman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#linusagreed Does Linus Torvalds agree that Linux is just the kernel?] GNU/Linux FAQ by Richard Stallman&lt;/ref&gt;
* non-GNU programs - various free software packages which are not a part of the GNU Project but are released under the [[GNU General Public License]] or another [[Free software license#FSF-approved .22free software.22 licenses|FSF-approved Free Software License]].

Within the GNU website, a list of projects is laid out and each project has specifics for what type of developer is able to perform the task needed for a certain piece of the GNU project. The skill level ranges from project to project but anyone with background knowledge in programming is encouraged to support the project.

The packaging of GNU tools, together with the Linux kernel and other programs, is usually called a [[Linux distribution]] (distro). The GNU Project calls the combination of GNU and the Linux kernel "GNU/Linux", and asks others to do the same,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#why Why do you call it GNU/Linux and not Linux?]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]].

Today most Linux distros combine GNU packages with a Linux kernel which contains proprietary [[binary blobs]] and a number of proprietary programs.

=== GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines ===

The GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG) is a system distribution commitment used to explain what it means for an installable system distribution (such as a Linux distribution) to qualify as free (libre), and help distribution developers make their distributions qualify.

Mostly this includes distributions that are a combination of GNU packages with a [[Linux-libre]] kernel (a modified Linux kernel, that removes binary blobs, obfuscated code and portions of code under proprietary licenses) and consist only of free software (eschewing proprietary software entirely).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Strategic projects ==

{{see also | Free Software Foundation#High priority projects}}

From the mid-1990s onward, with many companies investing in free software development, the [[Free Software Foundation]] redirected its funds toward the legal and political support of free software development. Software development from that point on focused on maintaining existing projects, and starting new projects only when there was an acute threat to the [[free software community]]. One of the most notable projects of the GNU Project is the [[GNU Compiler Collection]], whose components have been adopted as the standard compiler system on many [[Unix-like]] systems.

=== GNOME ===
The [[GNOME]] desktop effort was launched by the GNU Project because another desktop system, [[KDE]], was becoming popular but required users to install [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]], which was then [[proprietary software]]. To prevent people from being tempted to install KDE and Qt, the GNU Project simultaneously launched two projects. One was the [[Harmony toolkit]]. This was an attempt to make a free software replacement for Qt. Had this project been successful, the perceived problem with the KDE would have been solved. The second project was GNOME, which tackled the same issue from a different angle. It aimed to make a replacement for KDE that had no dependencies on proprietary software. The Harmony project didn't make much progress, but GNOME developed very well. Eventually, the proprietary component that KDE depended on ([[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]) was released as free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== {{anchor | GNU Enterprise}}GNU Enterprise ===

'''GNU Enterprise''' ('''GNUe''') is a meta-project started in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/history.php Community History]&lt;/ref&gt; and can be regarded as a sub-project of the GNU Project. GNUe's goal is to create [[free software|free]] "enterprise-class data-aware applications" ([[enterprise resource planner]]s etc.). GNUe is designed to collect Enterprise software for the GNU system in a single location (much like the GNOME project collects Desktop software).

== Recognition ==
In 2001, the GNU Project received the [[USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award]] for "the ubiquity, breadth, and quality of its freely available redistributable and modifiable software, which has enabled a generation of research and commercial development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Gnostic saints''' are a series of historical figures revered in [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] as celebrated in several Gnostic Christian churches. One such list of saints appears in the Collect of the Day of All Gnostic Saints of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], which reads as follows:

"Praise be to Thee, O Father of all Fatherhood, Thou, the unknown God, who was before the fall of the sparks into the darkness of this aeon, for the glorious messengers of the light of Thy everlasting and redeeming Gnosis. Especially do we praise and thank Thee today for the following holy and enlightened teachers and knowers of truth: Valentinus of Rome; Basilides of Antioch; Carpocrates of Alexandria; Bardesanes of Syria; Mani of Babylonia, Martyr; Priscillian of Avila, Bishop and Martyr; Paul of Samosata, Bishop; Peter of Bruys, Martyr; Amalric of Bena; David of Dinan and William of Paris; Bogomil of Dragowitza, Bishop; Peter Waldo of Lyons; Joachim of Flora; Esclaremonde de Foix and the Cathar martyrs; and all the holy souls and wise sages who have in any way or form, under whatsoever guise and appearance attained to and taught the true and ancient Gnosis of God. Grant, O Boundless One, that inspired by and following their most noble example we also may see the light of Thy Gnosis and assist in liberating Thy sparks of light from the chains of darkness, ignorance and malice which afflict them in this aeon. 
Amen."&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesia Gnostica. [http://www.gnosis.org/ecclesia/lect162.htm Meditations: Day of All Gnostic Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is best known for his work ''The Wholeness of Nature'', considered a relevant and original recent interpretation of [[Goethean science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.ksu.edu/seamon/Bortoft_review.htm Book review on ''Wholeness of Nature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415015804/http://www.arch.ksu.edu/seamon/Bortoft_review.htm |date=2012-04-15 }} by David Seamon, originally appeared in Parabola, 22, 3 (Fall 1997): 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waldorflibrary.org/images/stories/journal_articles/RB2104.pdf Book review on ''The Wholeness of Nature''] by John Barnes&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Taking Appearance Seriously: The Dynamic Way of Seeing in Goethe and European Thought'' was published in 2012.

Bortoft completed his studies at the [[University of Hull]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.siriusonline.de/verlag/autoren.nsf/Autoren/9A1B65B9412C0A16C1256E4E005F4186?OpenDocument Henri Bortoft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425143345/http://www2.siriusonline.de/verlag/autoren.nsf/Autoren/9A1B65B9412C0A16C1256E4E005F4186?OpenDocument |date=2012-04-25 }} {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then performed postgraduate research on the foundations of [[quantum physics]] at [[Birkbeck College]], where theoretical physicist [[David Bohm]] introduced him to the problem of [[Holism in science|wholeness]] in quantum theory. Subsequently, Bortoft worked with [[John G. Bennett]] on Bennett's [[Systematics – study of multi-term systems|''Systematics'']] (also known as Multi-Term Systems), which was Bennett's methodology for assisting the systematic and progressive understanding of systems, complexity, and wholeness, and on efforts with Bennett and with [[Kenneth W. Pledge]] to develop a formal language that was rigorouly descriptive of scientific activity. Those efforts were published in ''Systematics: The Journal of the Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences'', listed below.

Bortoft taught physics and philosophy of science at [[Schumacher College]] in the framework of the program in ''Holistic Science''. He held numerous lectures and seminars in Great Britain and the United States on the scientific work of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and on the [[Modern science|development of modern science]].

Bortoft died on 29 December 2012 at his home in [[Matlaske]], [[Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Add to Timeline |url=http://www.familynotices24.co.uk/22870059?s_source=arnf_edp |title=PETER HENRI BORTOFT : Death - FamilyNotices24 - Eastern Daily Press |publisher=FamilyNotices24 |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ishida Baigan''' (October 12, 1685 - October 29, 1744) was a [[Japan]]ese lecturer and [[philosopher]] who founded the [[Shingaku|Shingaku movement (heart learning)]] which advocated all education include teachings in [[ethics]] and [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ishida Baigan|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295302/Ishida-Baigan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His life work in today's perspective has been summarized with the [[Confucian]] idea that a man that cannot control his home cannot control his nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This idea helped motivate many Japanese reformists fighting for Japanese [[Feminism|feminists]], human, and people's rights.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''Jāliyat al-Kadr''' ({{lang-ar|'''جالية الكدر'''}}, {{lang-en|'''Removal of Distress'''}}) is a supplicatory poem where [[Allah|God]] is implored through the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and his [[Sahabah|companions]] who fought alongside him in the Battles of [[Battle of Badr|Badr]] and [[Battle of Uhud|Uhud]]. It was written by Ja’far b. Ḥasan b. ‘Abd al-Karīm b. al-Sayyid Muḥammad b. ‘Abd al-Rasūl [[al-Barzanjī]], the Shafite Mufti of [[Medina]] and author of the [[Mawlid al-Barzanjī]].&lt;ref name=jkTranslation&gt;Ahmed, A. (2015). ''Removal of Distress''. Birmingham: Manaqib Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jāliyat al-Kadr was written in the 18th century when the Ottoman empire was in decline and the Muslim world was in a state of political and intellectual upheaval. It is an example of a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] devotional work on [[intercession]].&lt;ref name="jkTranslation" /&gt;

==Structure==
The Jāliyat al-Kadr has four sections:
#''Muqaddimah'' (Opening)
#''Asmā’ Ahl al-Badr'' (Names of the People of Badr)
#''Asmaā’ Shuhadā’ Uhud'' (Names of the Martyrs of Uhud)
#''Khatimah'' (Closing)

==Commentary==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3790">'''[[Immanuel Kant]]'s antinomies''', from the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', are contradictions which he believed follow necessarily from our attempts to conceive the nature of transcendent reality.

Kant thought that certain of his antinomies (God and Freedom) could be resolved as "Postulates of Practical Reason". He used them to describe the equally rational-but-contradictory results of applying the universe of pure thought to the categories or criteria, i.e. applying reason proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena). [[Empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

==Overview==
Kant's antinomies are four: two "mathematical" and two "dynamical". They are connected with (1) the limitation of the universe in respect of space and time, (2) the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms (whereas, in fact, none such exist), (3) the problem of free will in relation to universal causality, and (4) the existence of a necessary being.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (1911), Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two antinomies are dubbed "mathematical" antinomies, presumably because in each case we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to be sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and space and time. The second two are dubbed "dynamical" antinomies, presumably because the proponents of the thesis are not committing themselves solely to claims about spatio-temporal objects.&lt;ref&gt;S. Al-Azm, ''The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies'', Oxford University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, ''Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion'', Cambridge University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, "The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies," in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

NOTE:  Kant himself did not use the plural term, "antinomies," but only the singular term, "Antinomy," as the logical status of a species of metaphysical argument.   There is Antinomy, and Kant argued in detail regarding four cases of Antinomy in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]] (1780).

==The mathematical antinomies==
===The first antinomy (of space and time)===
*Thesis:
**The world has a beginning in time, and is also limited as regards space.
*Anti-thesis:
**The world has no beginning, and no limits in space; it is infinite as regards both time and space.

===The second antinomy (of atomism)===
*Thesis:
**Every composite substance in the world is made up of simple parts, and nothing anywhere exists save the simple or what is composed of the simple.
*Anti-thesis:
**No composite thing in the world is made up of simple parts, and there nowhere exists in the world anything simple.

==The dynamical antinomies==
===The third antinomy (of spontaneity and causal determinism)===
*Thesis:
**Causality in accordance with laws of nature is not the only causality from which the appearances of the world can one and all be derived. To explain these appearances it is necessary to assume that there is also another causality, that of Spontaneity.
*Anti-thesis:
**There is no Spontaneity; everything in the world takes place solely in accordance with laws of nature.

===The fourth antinomy (of necessary being or not)===
*Thesis:
**There belongs to the world, either as its part or as its cause, a being that is absolutely necessary.
*Anti-thesis:
**An absolutely necessary being nowhere exists in the world, nor does it exist outside the world as its cause.

'''Advaita Vedanta''' is in Guru-Shishya parampara.

Seeds of Advaitic thoughts are seen in the Rgveda. However, the credit for making it a systematic, logical philosophical system goes to Sankara Bhagavatpada. Names of the Acaryas who have contributed significantly to Advaita Vedanta has to be recorded for posterity. This article strives to document as many of them as possible, with list of their work.

==Prasthanatrayi in Advaita Vedanta==

The canonical texts taught and studied in Advaita Vedanta are the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad-Gita]], and the [[Brahma Sutras|Brahmasutra]]. Brahmasutra is authored by [[Badarayana]] (around 400 BC). The concept of Advaita was available even before Badarayana's period. He has referred to the earlier Advaita Acaryas in his Brahmasutra..

[[Adi Shankara]]charya was the most prominent in the tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]] to formulate its [[siddhanta|doctrine]] in his many [[Works of Adi Shankara|works]].

==Ancient Acharyas==

Lyricism is when art is expressed in a beautiful or imaginative way, or when it has an expressive quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lyricism|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lyricism|website=Oxford US English Language Dictionary|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term lyricism is often used in conjunction with art composed of sound alone, it can also apply to all forms of art including performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeFrantz|first1=Thomas F.|title=Dancing Revelations: Alvin Ailey's Embodiment of African American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=130|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Jean-Louis|title=Le Corbusier, 1887-1965: The Lyricism of Architecture in the Machine Age|date=2004|publisher=Taschen|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Steven|title=Derek Jarman and Lyric Film: The Mirror and the Sea|date=2004|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=12|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of lyricism ==
[[File:VanGogh-starry night edit.jpg|left|thumb|The Starry Night]]Although it is impossible to define beauty, emotion, or imagination in a definitive manner, it is possible to draw upon examples of works that may share those characteristics in both subtle and dramatic ways.  The following are some classic examples of lyricism:
*'''Poetry.''' Maya Angelou's poetry has intrinsic lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Maya Angelou's I Know why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook|last = Braxton|first = Joanne M.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Music.''' In Jazz, [[Charlie Parker]] is renowned for his lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Charlie Parker Companion: Six Decades of Commentary|last = Woideck|first = Carl|publisher = Schirmer Books|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Classical music, nearly all of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's]] work has been revered at one time or another for its lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on Mozart Performance|last = Todd|first = R. Larry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Jane Austen and Mozart: Classical Equilibrium in Fiction and Music|last = Wallace|first = Robert K.|publisher = University of Georgia Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wolfgang Amadé Mozart|last = Georg Knepler,|first = J. Bradford Robinson|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Dance.''' [[Swan Lake|Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake]], or [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]] exhibit classic lyricism. 
*[[File:Colors Streaming, Winter Prayer Hall, Nasir-Ol-Molk Mosque, Shiraz (14288444120).jpg|thumb|Nasir ol Molk Mosque]]'''Film.''' ''Lost, Lost, Lost'' (1976) has been described as an example of the mid-20th century lyricism movement in film, as well as ''[[Dog Star Man|The Art of Vision]]'' (1965) and ''[[Fireworks (1947 film)|Fireworks]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Film Experience: An Introduction|last = Timothy Corrigan|first = Patricia White|publisher = Macmillan|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Architecture'''. The [[Nasir ol Molk Mosque|Nasir ol-Molk Mosque]] may be seen as an example, as well as the [[Taj Mahal]], or the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Modern examples would be some of the later works of [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Painting.''' [[The Starry Night]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]] can be considered the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of lyricism in the world of art.

'''Mario Vella''' (Born 1953) is a major Maltese philosopher, economist and political theorist. His area of specialisation in philosophy is chiefly [[critical analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, vol. II, pp. 246-247.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Beginnings===
Vella was born to a Maltese family at [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]], and lived his boyhood within an Italian community there. He started his education at a [[Catholic]] school in [[Tripoli]], then returned to [[Malta]] with his family and attended [[De La Salle College (Malta)|De La Salle College]] at [[Cottonera]].

===Higher studies===
Vella studied philosophy at the [[University of Malta]], [[social economy]] with a major in [[sociology]] at the [[University of London]], and international economic politics at [[Berlin]]’s [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Humboldt]], in former [[East Germany]].

===Career===
In [[Malta]], after teaching [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[sociology]] in public elementary schools, Vella taught [[political economy]] and [[social development]] at the [[University of Malta]].

Vella is also a living lecturer in [[foreign direct investment]] and development at the [[University of Urbino]], [[Italy]]. He was Chief Executive Officer of the Malta Development Corporation, and is Director of the foreign direct investment consulting services at [[Grant Thornton International|Grant Thornton]] in [[Malta]]. Vella is further a member of the international faculty of the Postgraduate School of Economics and International Relations. He is politically active, serving, for some time, as President of the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] in [[Malta]].

In 2013, Vella was appointed Chairman of [[Malta Enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130522/local/mario-vella-made-malta-enterprise-chairman.470824&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 it was announced that Vella would be taking up the role of Governor of the [[Central Bank of Malta]].&lt;ref name="Central Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mario Vella to be appointed Central Bank governor|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160628/local/mario-vella-to-be-made-central-bank-governor.617067|website=Times of Malta|accessdate=29 June 2016|date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Vella’s philosophical publications are few but significant. The following might be considered his most representative

===Magnum opus===
The following is Vella's major philosophical book to date. When published, the book was quite exceptional for it uncharacteristically dealt with the analysis and criticism of another [[Maltese people|Maltese]] philosopher, and a living one at that. Apart from [[Angelo Pirotta]]'s investigation into the philosophy of [[Anastasio Cuschieri]] in the early 20th century, it seems that [[Maltese people|Maltese]] philosophers are reluctant to so take on, at least so directly, other living philosophers (or even dead ones, for that matter). Vella had certainly created an encouraging precedent.

* '''''Reflections in a Canvas Bag''''' (1989)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt; – First and foremost, this book is a critique of the philosophy of [[Peter Serracino Inglott]] in general, and of his book ''Beginning Philosophy'' (1987) in particular. However, it is also a sort of invitation (or instigation) to do philosophy by starting from history (as Vella does) rather than from theory (as Serracino Inglott does). History here is understood in the sense of [[Marx]]’s [[historical materialism]].

===Articles===
Of course, the following are not the only articles published by Vella. Nevertheless, these might be the most philosophically engaging. On must bear in mind that Vella is a regular contributor to ''The Times of Malta''&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.timesofmalta.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and also has his own blog.&lt;ref&gt;http://watersbroken.wordpress.com/about-this-blog&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Wara r-Repubblika'' (Subsequent to the Republic; together with Lillian Sciberras; 1979)
* ''That Favourite Dream of the Colonies'' (1994)
* ''Minflok Dahla'' (Instead of an Introduction; 1995)

===Poetry and short stories===
Sometimes Vella ventures to publish some of his poetry or short stories in [[Maltese language|Maltese]] or in [[English language|English]]. One example would be those in ''Wara r-Repubblika'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Particularly pp. 69-138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not seem to be very common. Here is one of his poems:&lt;ref&gt;''Wara r-Repubblika'', ''op. cit.'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

::The Time has come
::for the fire eater
::to empty himself
::on the crowd.

::The time has come
::for the high wire artist
::and the flying acrobat
::to fall and fertilize the ground,
::the burnt ground, with their blood.

::The time has come
::to burn the circus top
::and crucify the clown
::and to release Barabbas,
::the lion, from his cage.

===Editorial work===
Though Vella sometimes contributes something of his thought to the following editorial works, of course his personality is seen more in the style and content chosen of these publications.

* ''Pitazzi Homor'' (Red Copybooks; 1989–90)
* ''Fl-Antiporta tal-Millennju'' (On the Threshold of the Millennium; 1995)

==Appreciation==
In part, Vella’s philosophy is [[deconstructivist]], tenaciously exposing the internal conflicts that tend to undercut the asserted meaning of any text. But this is not all. It is also [[Contextualism|contextualist]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

To Vella’s mind, in order to be acceptable, philosophy must begin from, and build on, the socio-political and historical context. Neither philosophy nor the history of philosophy can rise above power and history. Doing philosophy means taking political positions for or against historically concrete structures of power, and the forces struggling for power within society.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Michel Onfray''' ({{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ɔ̃fʁɛ|lang}}; born 1 January 1959) is a contemporary French writer and [[philosopher]] who defends a hedonistic, epicurean and atheist world view. He is a highly prolific author on philosophy, having written more than 100 books.&lt;ref name='Irelandquote'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Introductory Note to Onfray | journal = [[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]] | date = Winter 2006 | first = Doug | last = Ireland | authorlink=Doug Ireland| volume = X | issue = 4| id = | url = http://newpol.org/content/introductory-note-onfray | quote = a gifted and prolific author who, at the age of only 46, has already written 30 books | accessdate = 2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Michel Onfray#Œuvres|Complete list of works on the French Wikipedia page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has gained notoriety for writing such works as ''Traité d'athéologie: Physique de la métaphysique'' (translated into English as ''[[Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam]]''), ''Politique du rebelle: traité de résistance et d'insoumission'', ''Physiologie de [[Georges Palante]], portrait d'un nietzchéen de gauche'', ''La puissance d'exister'' and ''La sculpture de soi'' for which he won the annual [[Prix Médicis]] in 1993.

His philosophy is mainly influenced by such thinkers as [[Nietzsche]], [[Epicurus]], the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] and [[cyrenaic]] schools, and [[French materialism]].

== Life ==
[[File:Michel Onfray 2009 2.jpg|thumb|Onfray in Spain in 2009]]
Born to a family of [[Normans|Norman]] [[farmer]]s, Onfray was sent to a weekly Catholic boarding school from ages 10 to 14. This was a solution many parents in France adopted at the time when they lived far from the village school or had working hours that made it too hard or too expensive to transport their children to and from school daily.  The young Onfray, however, did not appreciate his new environment, which he describes as a place of suffering. Onfray went on to graduate with a teaching degree in philosophy. He taught this subject to senior students at a high school that concentrates on technical degrees in [[Caen]] between 1983 and 2002. At that time, he and his supporters established the ''[[Université populaire de Caen]]'', proclaiming its foundation on a free-of-charge basis and on the manifesto written by Onfray in 2004 (''La communauté philosophique'').

Onfray is an atheist&lt;ref name="Ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ireland|first=Doug|authorlink=Doug Ireland|date=Winter 2006|title=Introductory Note to Onfray|url=http://newpol.org/content/introductory-note-onfray|journal=[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]|volume=X|issue=4|id=|accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of ''Traité d'Athéologie'' (''[[Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam|Atheist Manifesto]]''), which "became the number one best-selling nonfiction book in France for months when it was published in the Spring of 2005 (the word 'atheologie' Onfray borrowed from [[Georges Bataille]]). This book repeated its popular French success in Italy, where it was published in September 2005 and quickly soared to number one on Italy's bestseller lists."&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;

In the 2002 election, Onfray endorsed the French [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]] and its candidate for the [[President of the French Republic|French presidency]], [[Olivier Besancenot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Michel Onfray vote pour Olivier Besancenot |work=L'Obs |date=2007-04-04 |url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/elections-2007/20070404.OBS0537/michel-onfray-vote-pour-olivier-besancenot.html |accessdate=2017-06-15 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he endorsed [[José Bové]], but eventually voted for Olivier Besancenot, and conducted an interview with the future French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], whom he declared was an "ideological enemy" for ''Philosophie Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy et Michel Onfray - CONFIDENCES ENTRE ENNEMIS http://www.philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray-confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Le crépuscule d'une idole : L'affabulation freudienne'' (''The Twilight of an Idol: The Freudian Confabulation''), published in 2010, has been the subject of considerable controversy in France because of its criticism of Freud. He recognizes Freud as a philosopher, but he brings attention to the considerable cost of Freud's treatments and casts doubts on the effectiveness of his methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/un-psychanalyste-reagit-au-crepuscule-d-une-idole-de-michel-onfray_886463.html|title=Un psychanalyste réagit au "Crépuscule d'une idole" de Michel Onfray|date=26 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he published ''Cosmos'', the first book of a trilogy. Onfray considers ironically that it constitutes his "very first book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philomag.com/les-livres/lessai-du-mois/cosmos-une-ontologie-materialiste-11291|title=Cosmos. Une ontologie matérialiste (pour tout le monde) • FLAMMARION • L'essai du mois, Michel Onfray, Cosmos, Nature, Catherine Portevin, Deuil, Pensée magique • Philosophie magazine|website=www.philomag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Onfray writes that there is no philosophy without self-[[psychoanalysis]].  He describes himself as an [[atheist]]&lt;ref name="HAA"&gt;"He is a self-described hedonist, atheist, libertarian, and left-wing anarchist".[http://www.ainfos.ca/06/dec/ainfos00234.html (en) France, Media, Michel Onfray, A self labeled Anarchist Philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt; and considers [[Theism|theist]] [[religion]] to be indefensible. 
=== View on the history of Western philosophy and philosophical project ===
Onfray has published 9 books under a project of [[history of philosophy]] called ''Counter-history of Philosophy''. In each of these books Onfray deals with a particular historical period in western philosophy. The series of books are composed by the titles I. ''Les Sagesses Antiques'' (2006) (on western antiquity), II. ''Le Christianisme hédoniste'' (2006) (on [[Christian hedonism]] from the Renaissance period), III. ''Les libertins baroques'' (2007) (on [[libertine]] thought from the [[Baroque era]]), IV. ''Les Ultras des Lumières'' (2007) (on radical enlightenment thought), V. ''L'Eudémonisme social'' (2008) (on radical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[Eudomonia|eudomonistic]] thought), VI. ''Les Radicalités existentielles'' (2009) (on 19th and 20th century radical [[existentialist]] thinkers) and VII.''La construction du surhomme: [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'' (on Guyau´s and Nietzsche´s philosophy in relation to the concept of the ''[[Übermensch]]''). VIII ''Les Freudiens hérétiques'' (2013). IX ''Les Consciences réfractaires'' (2013).

In an interview he establishes his view on the history of philosophy. For him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is in fact a multitude of ways to practice philosophy, but out of this multitude, the dominant historiography picks one tradition among others and makes it the truth of philosophy: that is to say the [[idealist]], spiritualist lineage compatible with the [[Judeo-Christian]] world view. From that point on, anything that crosses this partial – in both senses of the word – view of things finds itself dismissed. This applies to nearly all non-Western philosophies, Oriental wisdom in particular, but also sensualist, empirical, [[materialist]], [[nominalist]], [[hedonistic]] currents and everything that can be put under the heading of "anti-[[Plato]]nic philosophy". Philosophy that comes down from the heavens is the kind that – from Plato to [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinas]] by way of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Christianity]] – needs a world behind the scenes to understand, explain and justify this world. The other line of force rises from the earth because it is satisfied with the given world, which is already so much.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001921/192178e.pdf|title=Michel Onfray: A philosopher of the Enlightenment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"His mission is to rehabilitate materialist and sensualist thinking and use it to re-examine our relationship to the world. Approaching philosophy as a reflection of each individual's personal experience, Onfray inquires into the capabilities of the body and its senses and calls on us to celebrate them through music, painting, and [[fine cuisine]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_03/a_03_s/a_03_s_que/a_03_s_que.html|title=THE BRAIN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hedonism ===
{{Hedonism| Thinkers}} He defines hedonism "as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1421|title=Atheism à la mode - New Humanist|website=newhumanist.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous [[utilitarianism]], and a generalized [[aesthetic]] of sensual [[materialism]] that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent &amp;ndash; while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions."&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;

Onfray's works "have explored the philosophical resonances and components of (and challenges to) science, painting, gastronomy, sex and sensuality, bioethics, wine, and writing. His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume ''Counter-history of Philosophy''",&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt; of which three have been published.

For Onfray:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought, hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others; the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other. Obtaining this balance – my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others – presumes that we approach the subject from different angles – political, ethical, aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, pedagogical, historiographical....&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His philosophy aims for "micro-revolutions", or "revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainfos.ca/06/dec/ainfos00234.html|title=France, Media, Michel Onfray, A self labeled Anarchist Philosoph|website=www.ainfos.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relation to hedonism ====
In ''La puissance d'exister: Manifeste hédoniste'', Onfray claims that the political dimension of hedonism runs from [[Epicurus]] to [[John Stuart Mill]] through [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]]. What political hedonism aims for is to create ''the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers''.

=== Atheism ===
{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar| Critics}}

Blogger J. M. Cornwell praised Onfray's ''Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam'', claiming it "is a religious and historical time capsule" containing what he sees as "the true deceptions of theological philosophy".&lt;ref name='TheCelebrityCafe'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecelebritycafe.com/books/full_review/785.html | title = Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism and Islam | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | last = Cornwell | first = J.

Recently he has been involved in promoting the work of [[Jean Meslier]],&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentle Inclination"&gt;[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Onfray40.htm Michel Onfray, ''"Jean Meslier and 'The Gentle Inclination of Nature"'' (translated into English by Marvin Mandel), ''[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]'', Winter 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908093940/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Onfray40.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an 18th-century French Catholic priest who was discovered, upon his death, to have written a book-length philosophical essay promoting atheism.&lt;ref name="Gentle Inclination"/&gt;

In the atheist manifesto, Onfray has said that among the "incalculable number of contradictions and improbabilities in the body of the text of the synoptic Gospels"&lt;ref&gt;[Atheist Manifesto, 127]&lt;/ref&gt; two claims are made: crucifixion victims were not laid to rest in tombs, and in any case Jews were not crucified in this period.  Ancient Historian [[John Dickson (author)|John Dickson]], of Macquarie University, has said that [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]], writing about the time of Jesus, says that sometimes the Romans handed the bodies of crucifixion victims over to family members for proper burial. The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] even remarks: "the Jews are so careful about funeral rites that even malefactors who have been sentenced to crucifixion are taken down and buried before sunset".&lt;ref&gt;[Josephus, Jewish War 4.317]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the second claim, Dickson calls this a "clear historical blunder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anchist.mq.edu.au/doccentre/SSEC/newslettersforms/Newsletter61.pdf |title=Page not found - Macquarie University |website=www.anchist.mq.edu.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914113247/http://www.anchist.mq.edu.au/doccentre/SSEC/newslettersforms/Newsletter61.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his latest book, ''Décadence'' he argued for [[Christ myth theory]], which is a hypotheses that [[Jesus]] was not a historical person. Onfray based this on the fact that, other than in the New Testament, Jesus is barely mentioned in accounts of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metro.co.uk|first1=Rob Waugh for|title=‘Jesus never actually existed at all,’ controversial French author argues|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/12/jesus-never-actually-existed-at-all-controversial-french-author-argues-6571007/|website=Metro|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ''Université Populaire'' ==
Onfray was a high school philosophy teacher for two decades until he resigned in 2002 to establish a tuition-free [[Université populaire de Caen|Université Populaire (People's University) at Caen]], at which he and several colleagues teach philosophy and other subjects.&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Université Populaire, which is open to all who cannot access the state university system, and on principle does not accept any money from the State -- Onfray uses the profits from his books to help finance it -- has had enormous success. Based on Onfray's book ''La Communauté Philosophique: Manifeste pour l'Université Populaire'' (2004), the original UP now has imitators in [[Picardy]], [[Arras]], [[Lyon]], [[Narbonne]], and [[Le Mans]], with five more in preparation."&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  "The national public radio network France Culture annually broadcasts his course of lectures to the Université Populaire on philosophical themes."&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;

'''Miguel Ángel Virasoro''' (1900–1966) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

==Life and thought==
Born in [[Santa Fe, Argentina]], in 1900,  graduated in law at the [[University of La Plata]]. Like many men from his generation came to philosophy through the paths of the academy but for a personal tour of self, an impulse that internal vocation personally selected readings tone of the spiritual atmosphere of the time . He belonged to the generation of 1925, not only by chronology, but also by the philosophical orientation which shaped his thinking at a time with all the enthusiasm and fervor of his youth were part of this age group Astrada, Fatone, Vasallo, Lugones, Borges and others reacted against the positivist and pragmatic features that printed in politics and culture of Argentina. Virasoro himself defined his generation as one that "For the first time in our history is outlined with sufficient spiritual inner life as to feel determined to an ideal of disinterested culture ...".These first works that addressed the issue of culture is a valuable contribution to the study of our modern American consciousness "in the words of Guglielmini, editor of the Early and prologue of his first book A Theory of Self and Culture (1928) that worth the National Prize of Culture and opens the doors of a university professorship. Since then begins to serve as professor in the chair of modern and contemporary philosophy of the UBA. In 1947 he took over the direction of the magazine and is Logos | Report which resulted in the same year which still remains the best version of Being and Nothingness Sartre into Castilian. In 1949 part of the first National Congress of Philosophy held in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] with a presentation "dialectical existentialism" which is an excerpt from his original thought. In 1952 he was appointed vice dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and also takes over the leadership of the Department of Philosophy. In 1954 he took over the Argentine Institute of Thought.In 1955 he was expelled for political reasons since 1960 began teaching at several universities in the interior, especially the de Cuyo, in an intense and fruitful activity until his death in 1966. His work earned lofty concepts both at home and abroad, of [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Alejandro Korn]], among others.

The thought of Virasoro enrolled in the current existentialist revolves around the existential problem in a form of arming go through an intermittent dialogue with Hegel, Heidegger, Nietzsche and often with Eastern philosophy. An armed thinking in dialogue, which is a welcome and a synthesis-oriented reject Hegel, Heidegger notoriously Nietzschean inspiration, whose expression is what he calls "dialectical existentialism. (Existentialism dialectical, 1958) dialectical Existentialism is a correction of Hegel, the slogan deslogizar because the dialectic is based on the existence whose principle is freedom.In Hegel's Logic (1932), argues that the Hegelian dialectic prefix a field of possibilities that makes the spirit where mechanized activity becoming, rather than an open possibility, diluted as a closed circle of eternal return, and excludes any desire to affair and conquering one's virtue is philosophical. Against this stands the active nature of the spirit that is always right and will, vital impulse of life but does not deny the claims, but does not repress the instincts that leads to full empowerment. But unlike Nietzsche who agrees with this reassessment of the vital forces, proposed ranking them according to their greater or lesser contribution to the implementation of the spirit and therefore the reverse, "he says of what is happening in contemporary society. This understanding of the dialectical method allows you to recover the right of difference that can not be reduced to the formalism of the synthesis of opposites. While on the ground the outline of competitions, you can not capture the richness of difference.This requires that thought out of itself, requires the intuition that takes the concept of the static tautological. (The metaphysical intuition, 1965) From this perspective the dialectic of opposites becomes existential dialectic, then march toward the concrete, the existence, in which the overcoming of opposites is impossible. In this area, the contradictions are insoluble when overcome in Hegel appears as reconciliation of opposites guaranteed by the necessary evolution, is given here as hiatus, the qualitative leap forward is the land of paradox where opposites coexist, land and carved by Kierkegaard. (Freedom, existence and being, 1942) Thus anchor their thinking in Heidegger for whom consciousness is not something theoretical but emotional. "temple of spirit", "pre-understanding" original predisposition to anxiety, which is not form but content and not of conscience but of existence. But here again Virasoro corrected: the original is not anxiety born of the awareness of finitude, that which in Sartre and Kierkegaard is expressed as limited awareness of this in every election. Anxiety is just another aspect of the deeper phenomenon that contains: the thirst for being, "anxiety", force or impulse that is being itself as an abstract possibility. A conception of being as opposed substance as the impetus, a pure will to be where he does not play any type of need. Freedom, but freedom to be held in permanent tension and implies a sense of being as pure possibility that is actualized in the form of a quota want individual and limited, as the abstract universal being as impotent and needs the body to perform.

== Early life ==
He was born in Hong Kong, HKSAR China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skypost.hk/%25E6%25B8%25AF%25E8%2581%259E/%25E6%2596%25B0%25E8%2581%259E%25E9%25A0%25AD%25E6%25A2%259D/20130708/001/%25E6%259C%2583%25E8%2580%25833%25E5%2588%2586%2520%25E5%25B9%25B4%25E8%25B3%25BA%25E7%2599%25BE%25E8%2590%25AC/100981|website = www.skypost.hk|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an exchange student in Australia. A turning point came when his host asked, "I want to ask from your soul, what do you want？". He then discovered a talent in [[public speaking]]. After accumulating experience in teaching etiquette, he started the first etiquette school in Hong Kong, providing training for major corporations.

'''Oscar R. Gómez (Osy)''' (born March 9, 1956, in ''Puerto Belgrano'', province of ''Buenos Aires'') is an Argentine writer, psychoanalyst and academic researcher who became renown as an integrator of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism with Western formal sciences and who constituted the first religious organization in Argentina engaged in the Tantric Worship practice in children and adults.&lt;ref name="ORCID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4469-8298 |title= ORCID iDs|date=|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

At 12 he began to study and experiment in Eastern philosophies. He was first initiated in the [[Rosicrucian Order]], then walked through the traditional paths of [[bhakti yoga]] and [[Jnana yoga]], and in 1972, he received his initiation into the practice of tantra that lies within [[tantric buddhism]]&lt;ref name=CLA&gt;{{cite book|last=Cárdenas|first=Luis Alberto|title=Beliefs, healings and miracles in the globalized society|year=2012|publisher=''Arcana Ediciones''|isbn=978-987-22922-6-3|page=69,87|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his training in Eurasian philosophies and religions, he was being trained in Western biology, philosophy, psychology, psychoanalysis, sociology, and [[psychobiology]].&lt;ref name="Datahub"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://datahub.io/dataset/0000-0003-4469-8298 |title=DataHub ID|date=|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this double training, he developed a method of transmission of the Tantric philosophy that adapts to Western life, free from oriental cultural forms and the superstitions of the people who practiced tantra centuries ago and yet retains its tradition and paradigmatic essence.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Becerra, Gastón |title=Tantric buddhism in Buenos Aires: A case study of secular religiosity among young people.|journal=The International Journal of Religion and Spirituality in Society  |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=97–102| url=http://ijn.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.200/prod.25 |year= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This philosophy can be transferred faster because there are not many differences with the Western philosophy, which takes the vision of tantra based on the notion of subject developed by the 3rd Dalai Lama, [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]] and [[Akbar|Grand Kahn Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar]] and introduced in Europe by the Jesuit Antonio de Montserrat". Osy (February, 1995).&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt;

Out of this paradigmatic look and (Tantric) source, Osy developed a psychotherapeutic technique of self-knowledge and self-improvement that he called ''Tecnología del deseo''® —such as others that were developed within the Eranos Circle— and suits the modern life needs: it does not involve mysticism, magic or superstitions, it is based on western and formal knowledge, and it is approachable for all ages and genres, including children and the elder.&lt;ref name="LN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Himitian|first=Evangelina|title=Newspaper article|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/720409-a-los-padres-les-cuesta-hablar-de-sexo|accessdate=|newspaper=''La Nación''|date=July 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, after an interview with the fourteenth [[14th Dalai Lama]] in Buenos Aires and together with other students and a coordinator appointed by him, he opened at his home in ''Berazategui (Buenos Aires)'' a space called ''La Casa del Tantra''&lt;ref name="FNA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grupo DERF|first=|title=Journalistic research|url=http://www.derf.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_des=24160|accessdate= |newspaper=Federal News Agency|date=March 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to foster integration in the western academic arena what he considers to be the source of existential phenomenology.&lt;ref name=CLA /&gt;

In 1995, within the Argentine Association for Psychobiological Research, he created the Argentine School of Tantra (''Escuela Argentina de Tantra''), which is the first and only institution devoted to spread the Tantric philosophy in Argentina. In 2000, driven by a group of Spanish students, he created the School of Tantra in Spain (''Escuela de Tantra en España'').&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bassani|first=Lorena|title=Journalistic research|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2004/03/15/t-724506.htm|accessdate= |newspaper=''Clarín''|date=March 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong advocate of clarity in the transmission of ideas, in his classes, lectures and writings, he does not use terms in languages unknown to the receiver (Sanskrit and Tibetan, for example), which makes his message easily understood and concepts&lt;ref name="RJS"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarpa|first=Rodrigo|title=Research by Chilean psychologist and sexologist Rodrigo Jarpa Sacher|url=https://www.belelu.com/2010/11/el-sexo-tantrico-es-mucho-mas-que-los-masajes-y-no-eyacular|accessdate= |newspaper=Editorial Belelú|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are clearly explained. That is called Enlightenment. To see reality as it is and to call things by their name.

It is precisely because of this point that he is not willing to give up the name tantra as the source of his knowledge as others have done so and who first called it Age of Enlightenment, existentialism, Gestalt, psychodrama or emotional thought.

“To hold on to the origin of an idea and link it to the subsequent ideas generated out of it allows for an ongoing development of academic knowledge. There is no excuse to rename and self-assign foundational rights on an existing concept by giving it a new name only to collect royalties or to avoid being excluded from a peer group, as it happened to the first Jesuits initiated in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, who were forced to call themselves ''alumbrados'' or Illuminated of Spain rather than tantric”. Oscar R. Gómez (February, 1995).&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rodriguez Acosta, Francisco |title="The origins of Tantrism in Mexico around 1600" Article based on the essay by Don Julio Jimenez Rueda in Volume XVI, Number 1 of the Mexico General Archive Bulletin in 1945 and the book Tantrism proteic of Juan Miguel de la Mora |journal=Editorial Desarrollo Humano| url=http://desarrollohumano.co/2011/tantrismo-en-mexico-articulo |volume= |issue= |date=February 2, 2011|pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Oscar R. Gómez’s input, in July 2005, some initiated in tantric philosophy by him decided to gather to spread his thought and thus created a non-profit foundation called ''Fundación MenteClara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://datahub.io/dataset/06072005/resource/8ff6d3e7-5aff-4858-b1a0-4eb507c314c5 |title=Minutes of the organizational meeting of the Fundación MenteClara|date=June 6, 2005|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official presentation of the foundation took place at a dinner party where the Argentine School of Tantra was celebrating its 10th anniversary.

On December 18, 2006, members of ''Fundación MenteClara'' —based on Oscar R. Gómez teachings and character— met in a special session to constitute a religious organization called “Culto Tantra”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://datahub.io/dataset/18122006/resource/0f67d78a-4d4a-4077-88e3-4308cf13f32b |title=Official article of incorporation and by-laws of the Tantric Worship|date=December 18, 2006|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is officially registered in Argentina to be practiced publicly and to spread the tantric cult, which was banned in 1959 with the invasion of Tibet by China. As from that date, a large number of followers of different ages, including children and elders, have been initiated in this cult and still practicing.&lt;ref name=GB /&gt;

==Social work within the academic arena==

From 1982 to 2001, within the Argentine Association for Psychobiological Research (AAIP for its acronym in Spanish), he devoted to research, teaching and social assistance in the field of mental health. In 1995 he developed the first digital polygraph in Argentina to provide biofeedback therapy for patients with repetitive strain injury (RSI) and neuromuscular disorders.&lt;ref name="Datahub" /&gt;

He created both a school of Social Psychology —which had two sites: one in the Province of Buenos Aires and another in the city of Buenos Aires— and a school of Therapeutic Accompanying Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Journalistic research |url= http://fundacionmenteclara.org.ar/noticias/ambitofinanciero29-10-99.htm |accessdate=November 1, 2015|newspaper= Ámbito financiero |date= October 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training at both schools was free for students (travel and study material expenses were also aid-funded)&lt;ref name=des&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Newspaper article|url= http://fundacionmenteclara.org.ar/noticias/ElSol10-01-2000.jpg |accessdate=November 1, 2015|newspaper= El Sol |date=January 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange for community aid service in their respective places of residence.

As director of the AAIP’s research and assistance department, he created a daycare center for patients with mild psychotic disorder in Berazategui, province of Buenos Aires. Patients were treated by professionals from different disciplines who worked pro bono. Monies received from health insurance plans and NGO’s aid programs were allocated in full to cover building expenses, improvements in the quality of patients’ environment and non-medical staff.

At that time period, he fostered putting into practice HIV assistance and prevention programs in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Ministry of Education from the Republic of Paraguay and the Ministry of Health from the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Newspaper article |url= http://fundacionmenteclara.org.ar/noticias/Verdadeinvestigacion23-10-98.jpg |accessdate=November 1, 2015|newspaper= Verdad e Investigación |date= October 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these social interventions were carried out with the support of the Municipality of Berazategui and the Ministry of Health of the province of Buenos Aires, led by Dr. Juan José Mussi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Newspaper article |url=http://fundacionmenteclara.org.ar/noticias/ElSol2-11-98.jpg |accessdate=November 1, 2015|newspaper= Diario El Sol |date=November 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this track record a variety of mass media accounted for, in 1997 he was appointed by Argentine president, Dr. Carlos Saúl Menem, Director of the Federal Program for People at Social Risk from the Ministry of Social Development. At such capacity, he furthered the Residential Caregiver training program &lt;ref name=des /&gt;

In June 2000, all the before mentioned association's activities came to an end due to a financial crisis, the same economic reasons that would take [[René Favaloro]] to end his own life.

==Peace efforts==

'''September 20, 2007:''' He was invited to lecture at the 2nd Argentine Symposium against all forms of violence and discrimination carried out at the 
Universidad Tecnológica Argentina – UTN. Such event was:

- Declared of Educational Interest by the Argentine Ministry of Education, Science and Technology

- Declared of Interest by the School of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires

- Declared of Social Interest Declared by the Buenos Aires City Legislature

==Present time==

In March 2010, he created the School of [[Body Psychotherapy]] as a department within Fundación MenteClara.&lt;ref name=ORCID /&gt;

At present, he is a consultant for researchers in the field of theology, sociology, anthropology and philosophy looking to trace and link characters and events in Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=IMWbRRIAAAAJ&amp;hl |title= ''Google Académico''|date=|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Deutscher received her bachelor's from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1986 and went on to receive a [[Master of Advanced Studies|Diplôme des études approfondies]] at the [[University of Paris]] in 1991 and a doctorate in philosophy from the [[University of New South Wales]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Deutscher served as an associate lecturer in philosophy at the [[University of New South Wales]] in 1992 before becoming a lecturer and then senior lecturer in philosophy at the [[Australian National University]] from 1992 to 2001.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Deutscher moved to [[Northwestern University]] in 2002, accepting an appointment as the Lane Professor for the Humanities in 2002-3, and then serving as an associate professor from 2002 to 2008 before being promoted to full professor in 2008.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Besides for her permanent appointments, Deutscher also served as the Marie-Jahoda guest professor at [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas and publications==
Deutscher has authored five books, including ''Yielding Gender: Feminism, Deconstruction and the History of Philosophy'' (1997), ''A Politics of Impossible Difference: The Later Work of Luce Irigaray'' (2002), ''How to Read Derrida'' (2006), ''The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir: Ambiguity, Conversion, Resistance'' (2008), and ''Foucault's Futures: A Critique of Reproductive Reason'' (2017).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Deutscher has also edited or co-edited four books, ''Repenser le politique: l’apport du féminisme'' (2004), ''Enigmas: Essays on Sarah Kofman'' (1999), (with Olivia Custer and Samir Haddad) ''Foucault/Derrida Fifty Years Later'' (2016), and (with Cristina Lafont) ''Critical Theory in Critical Times'' (2017).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Deutscher has also written a large number of refereed articles, contributed more than 26 book chapters, several encyclopedia articles, and a number of book reviews.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Deutscher's first book, ''Yielding Gender: Feminism, Deconstruction and the History of Philosophy'', engaged the works of [[Judith Butler]] and [[Eve Sedgwick]] with that of [[Jacques Derrida]] to create a novel analysis of the instability of the meaning of ''woman'' throughout the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=yg1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schott|first=Robin May|title=Yielding Gender: Feminism, Deconstruction and the History of Philoso· phy.

'''Peter Vasilevich Verigin''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Васильевич Веригин}}) often known as Peter "the Lordly" Verigin ({{OldStyleDate|July 12|1859|June 29}} - October 29, 1924) was a [[Russians|Russian]] philosopher, activist and leader of the Community [[Doukhobors]] in Canada.

==Biography==

=== In Transcaucasia===
Peter Vasilevich Verigin was born on {{OldStyleDate|July 11|1859|June 29}}, in the village of [[Slavyanka, Azerbaijan|Slavyanka]] in [[Elisabethpol Governorate]]&lt;ref name=erta&gt;[http://www.erta-tcrg.org/groupes/doukhoborshisto.htm Brève histoire des Doukhobors au Canada] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Russian Empire]]. The village, located in the north-west of what is today the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]], was one of the settlements founded by the Doukhobors, a large sect of communally living peasants, exiled to the [[Transcaucasia]] from [[Ukraine]] and southern [[Russia]] in the 1840s.&lt;ref name=kalmakoff&gt;J. Kalmakoff, [http://www.doukhobor.org/Maps.htm Doukhobor Historical Maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204174503/http://www.doukhobor.org/Maps.htm |date=2012-02-04 }}, with maps of settlements [http://www.doukhobor.org/Azerbaijan.gif in Azerbaijan] and [http://www.doukhobor.org/Georgia.gif  Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Vasily Verigin, was an illiterate, but reportedly rich peasant, who, once elected a village headman, "showed himself a real despot".&lt;ref name=pozdnyakov1908&gt;[[Vasily Nikolaevich Pozdnyakov]],
[http://www.doukhobor.org/Pozdnyakov.htm "Story of a Spiritual Upheaval"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416165708/http://www.doukhobor.org/Pozdnyakov.htm |date=2008-04-16 }} Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 1908. (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

June 29 happens to be the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]. Although the Doukhobors don't venerate saints ''per se'', this day - often known as St. Peter's Day ({{lang-ru|Петров день}}) is still a traditional day of celebration, and thus it may have been the case that young Verigin was named after [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]].&lt;ref name=peace-day&gt;[[Koozma J. Tarasoff]], [http://www.doukhobor.org/Peace-Day.htm The Doukhobor Peace Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040516121338/http://www.doukhobor.org/Peace-Day.htm |date=2004-05-16 }} (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter was one of seven brothers. His four older brothers did not study anything at all, but Peter and two other brothers, Vasily and Grigory, were [[home-schooling|home-schooled]], at least to the extent of learning to read and write. There were no formal schools in Doukhobor villages at the time.&lt;ref name=pozdnyakov1908/&gt;

[[File:Sirotski dom.jpg|thumb|left|"The Orphanage"]]
At quite a young age, Peter Verigin married Evdokia Georgievna Kotelnikova. In 1882, soon after his marriage, while his wife was expecting their first child ([[Peter P. Verigin]]), he started working as a secretary and administrative assistant for the leader of the Transcaucasian Doukhobors, Lukerya Vasilyevna Gubanova (born 18??—died December 15, 1886; {{lang-ru|Лукерья Васильевна Губанова}}).
Lukerya Gubanova was the widow of the community's previous leader, Peter Kalmykov and was also known as Kalmykova, by her late husband's surname.&lt;ref name=shubin&gt;Daniel H. Shubin, "A History of Russian Christianity". Volume III, pgs. 141-8. Algora Publishing, 2006; {{ISBN|0-87586-425-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=W7h-RhKG2Q4C On Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalmykov dynasty resided in the village of Gorelovka, one of Doukhobor communities in Georgia (shown on one of J.J. Kalmakoff's maps.&lt;ref name=kalmakoff/&gt;), in the ''Sirotsky Dom'' ({{lang-ru|Сиротский дом}}), or "The Orphanage" - the facility serving as the Doukhobor headquarter, as well as, indeed, home for orphans and the aged.&lt;ref name=lohm&gt;Hedwig Lohm, "Dukhobors in Georgia: A Study of the Issue of Land Ownership and Inter-Ethnic Relations in Ninotsminda rayon (Samtskhe-Javakheti)". November 2006. Available in [http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_en.pdf English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602192825/http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_en.pdf |date=2010-06-02 }} and [http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_rus.pdf Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902195014/http://www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_35_rus.pdf |date=2010-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lukerya was respected by the provincial authorities, who had to cooperate with the Doukhobors on various matters. While working for her and living at her residence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doukhobor.org/Reibin.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809031319/http://www.doukhobor.org/Reibin.htm |archivedate=2007-08-09 |df= }} (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt; Verigin received an extensive religious education, and was prepared by childless Lukerya to become her successor as the leader of the Doukhobors. He became acquainted with the Doukhobor ideas of administration - rejecting [[secular]] government. The [[Doukhobors]] rejected the holiness of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Bible]], and were naturally [[pacifist]]s and [[conscientious objector]]s who refused to participate in wars and battles.

The death of "Queen Lukerya" in 1886 was followed by a leadership crisis. However, only part of the community ("the Large Party"; {{lang-ru|Большая сторона}}) accepted her designated successor, Peter Verigin, as the leader; others, known as "the Small Party" (Малая сторона), sided with Lukerya's brother, Michael Gubanov, and the village elder Aleksei Zubkov.&lt;ref name=shubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=lohm/&gt;

While the Large Party was a majority, the Small Party had the support of the older members of the community and the local authorities. So, on January 26, 1887, at the community service where the new leader was to be acclaimed, the police walked in and took Verigin away. He was to spend the next 16 years in government custody. Still, the Large Party Doukhobors maintained contact with him and continued to consider him their spiritual leader.&lt;ref name=shubin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/verigin_peter_1859-1924.html Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern exile===
While in exile, Verigin got quite a tour of Russian North. He was first sent to [[Shenkursk]], in [[Arkhangelsk Governorate]] (now [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]]), in the Russia's north, arriving there in October 1887. In the summer 1890, he was transferred to [[Kola (town)|Kola]], on the [[Barents Sea]]. It was then Russia's northernmost town, as [[Murmansk]] and [[Polyarny, Murmansk Oblast|Polyarny]] were to be built yet. In November 1894, he left Kola for Obdorsk (now [[Salekhard]]) in the north-western [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name=shubin/&gt;

In Shenkursk, Verigin, along with several exiled Doukhobor elders, shared two houses between them. When this small band of Doukhobor exiles was visited by Peter Verigin's brother, Grigory in September 1888, he was somewhat surprised and impressed by their complete [[vegetarianism]], as Grigory's family back in [[South Caucasus]] was still eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doukhobor.org/Grigory-Verigin.htm Grigory Verigin: My Trip to Shenkursk and My Communal Life There] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416165525/http://www.doukhobor.org/Grigory-Verigin.htm |date=2008-04-16 }}. A chapter from Grigory Vasilyevich Verigin, ''Ne v Sile Bog, a v Pravde'' ("The God is not in the Force, but in Truth"). Paris, Dreyfus &amp; Charpentier, 1935. (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PeterVeregin1903.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Veregin in 1903 with two of the Doukhobors]]
In November 1894, as he was being transferred from Kola to Obdorsk, Verigin wrote a message to the Doukhobors, asking them to obey God's commandment, "Thou shalt not kill", destroy their weapons, and refuse military service. His message was taken to the Caucasus by his brothers Grigory and Vasily, who spread it throughout the Doukhobor communities. Soon, the confrontation between pro-Verigin Pacifist Doukhobors ("the Large Party") and the government keen on drafting their youth came to head. On [[Easter]] Sunday 1895, eleven Doukhobor conscripts refused to do military training. As days went on, more  conscripts laid down their arms and refused further service. Reservists were returning their registration papers to the draft boards. Finally, in the night of June 28–29 (July 10–11 [[Gregorian Calendar|New Style]]), 1895, - the night before St. Peter's Day, and, incidentally, Verigin's birthday - the Large-Party Doukhobors of Transcaucasia assembled in three villages to burn the weapons they owned, in the event remembered ever since as "the Burning of the Arms".&lt;ref name=peace-day/&gt;

Arrests and beatings by government's [[Cossack]]s followed. Soon, Cossacks were billeted in many of the Doukhobors' houses, and their original inhabitants were dispersed through remote villages in the region.&lt;ref name=shubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=ashworth&gt;John Ashworth, [http://www.doukhobor.org/Spiritual-Origins.htm Doukhobortsy and Religious Persecution in Russia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020017/http://www.doukhobor.org/Spiritual-Origins.htm |date=2010-11-13 }}, 1900 (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The exodus===
Horrified at the plight of his followers, in August 1896 Verigin wrote to [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna]], the wife of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]], making a number of proposals to resolve the conflict, such as the resettlement of the Large-Party Doukhobors to some remote province of Russia (assuming that an exemption from military service could still be granted), or emigration to Britain or Canada.&lt;ref name=shubin/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] and his associates addressed Russian and international public with letters and articles about the persecution of the Doukhobors.

In 1898, an agreement was reached with the Czar's Minister of the Interior, [[Ivan Nikolayevich Durnovo]], to allow the Doukhobors leave for Canada. Between 1898 and 1899 around 7,500 Doukhobors from Transcaucasia did so. Of them, some 3,300 were the members of the Large Party; the rest belonged to the Small and the Middle Parties. Among them was Verigin's mother, Anastasia Verigina, around 80 years of age at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.sfu.ca/cgi-bin/edocs/Doukhobor-Collection?Display=148 Report of Royal Commission on matters relating to the sect of Doukhobors in the province of British Columbia, 1912]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller numbers of Doukhobors, directly from Transcaucasia or from various places of exile, continued moving to Canada in the years to follow.

In the fall of 1902, after 16 years in exile, Verigin was released from [[Salekhard|Obdorsk]]. He visited Leo Tolstoy in October,
&lt;ref&gt;Х. Н. АБРИКОСОВ. ДВЕНАДЦАТЬ ЛЕТ ОКОЛО ТОЛСТОГО. (Kh. N. Abrikosov, "Twelve Years near Tolstoy") {{Ru icon}}. Abrikosov mentions Verigin visiting Tolstoy on the way from Obdorsk to Canada in October 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and joined his people in [[Yorkton]] (present-day [[Saskatchewan]]) in December 1902.&lt;ref name=shubin/&gt;

Verigin was to visit Russia again, only once. He came in 1906, leading a delegation of 6 Doukhobors, to investigate a possibility of the return of the Doukhobors to Russia, now that, as a result of [[Russian Revolution (1905)]], religious tolerance has been legislated. Verigin's delegation met with [[Pyotr Stolypin|Stolypin]] and other ministers, who made an offer of land in the [[Altai Krai|Altai]] (south-western Siberia) and an exemption from the conscription. Although the offer was personally confirmed by Nicholas II, Verigin felt that, no matter what, the Doukhobors' situation in Russia would not be as secure as in Canada. In March 1907 his delegation went back to Canada.

===In Canada===
[[File:Verigin1907.jpg|thumb|right|340x|Verigin preaching amongst his followers in 1923 in British Columbia]]
{{Main|Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood}}
Verigin established his first Canadian residence at the Doukhobor village of Poterpevshie ({{lang-ru|Потерпевшие}}, 'The Victims', or perhaps 'The Survivors'), some 15&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Kamsack, Saskatchewan]]. On the joyful occasion of reuniting with their leader, the villagers renamed the place Otradnoye ({{lang-ru|Отрадное}}, 'the place of rejoicing'). Otradnoye continued to be Verigin's headquarters until 1904 or 1905 &lt;ref name=kalmakoff-otradnoye&gt;[http://www.doukhobor.org/pn-details.html?rec=141 Otradnoye] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915102147/http://www.doukhobor.org/pn-details.html?rec=141 |date=2005-09-15 }}(Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;
The nearby village of Nadezhda was the site of annual general meetings of the Doukhobor community chaired by him.

When the new [[Canadian Northern Railway]] line crossed the Doukhobor reserve in 1904 some 10&amp;nbsp;km south of Otradnoye, a small station named after the Doukhobor leader (initially, "Veregin Siding", and after 1908, Veregin Station)
was built there around 1904 to serve the needs of the Doukhobor community of the area.
A village, also named [[Veregin, Saskatchewan|Veregin]] (sometimes spelled ''Verigin'', at least on Verigin's own CCUB letterhead) was built next to the station, and Veregin's headquarters was shifted there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doukhobor.org/pn-details.html?rec=166 Village of Veregin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910212527/http://www.doukhobor.org/pn-details.html?rec=166 |date=2005-09-10 }} (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the exiled Doukhobors rejected the newly enforced requirements of [[Dominion Lands Act]] which attempted to register their communal lands under individual ownership and rebelled against the request. Following this in 1907 the communal land system was abolished and in 1908 Verigin led around 6,000 of his group ([[Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood]], CCUB) to [[British Columbia]]. CCUB still continued to own some properties and industrial facilities in Saskatchewan, and its headquarters remained in Veregin for some years to come. Verigin had another residence built for himself near [[Grand Forks, British Columbia]], spending the rest of his life sharing his time between the two provinces.

==Verigin's death==
Verigin was assassinated in a still-unsolved [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] train explosion on October 29, 1924 on the [[Kettle Valley Railway]] (now known locally as the [[Columbia and Western Railway]]) line near [[Farron, British Columbia|Farron]], between [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]] and [[Grand Forks, British Columbia|Grand Forks]], which also killed his 17-year-old secretary Marie Strelaeff, member of the provincial legislature John McKie, P.J Campbell, Hakim Singh, Harry J. Bishop, W. J. Armstrong, and Neil E. Armstrong. The government initially (during investigation) had stated the crime was perpetrated by people within the Doukhobor community, while the Doukhobors suspected [[Canadian government]] involvement. To date, it is still unknown who was responsible for the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/verigin/home/indexen.html ''"Explosion on the Kettle Valley Line: The Death of Peter Verigin"'', Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Verigin's grave is located near [[Brilliant, British Columbia|Brilliant]], a historically Doukhobor village outside [[Castlegar, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry Hannant, [{{cite web |url=http://www.doukhobor.org/Hannant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412092508/http://www.doukhobor.org/Hannant.htm |archivedate=2008-04-12 |df= }} "The Mysterious Death of Peter Verigin". [[The Beaver (magazine)|''The Beaver'']], November 2004, Vol. 84: 5 (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successors==
After Verigin's murder in 1924, the majority of the community Doukhobors proclaimed his son Peter P. Verigin, who was still in the USSR, as his successor. However, several hundred Doukhobors recognized P.V. Verigin's widow, Anastasia F. Golubova (1885–1965; also spelt Holuboff), who had been Verigin's  wife for some 20 years, as their leader.

In 1926 Anastasia's followers split from CCUB, forming a breakaway organization called "The Lordly Christian Community of Christian Brotherhood". They left British Columbia for [[Alberta]], where they set up their own village at [[Shouldice]], near [[Arrowwood, Alberta]], which existed until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doukhobor.org/Anastasia.htm "Pacifism and Anastasia's Doukhobor Village"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214064741/http://www.doukhobor.org/Anastasia.htm |date=2009-12-14 }} (Doukhobor Genealogy Website)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Peter P. Verigin arrived from the USSR and assumed the leadership of CCUB in 1928.
After the bankruptcy of CCUB, he organized USCC (Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ) in 1938.

When Peter P. Verigin died in 1939, the Community Doukhobors proclaimed his son (and P.V.Verigin's grandson) Peter P. Verigin II as their new spiritual leader. But as the latter was in Soviet prisons at the time, it was Peter P. Verigin's grandson (and Peter V. Verigin's great-grandson), the young [[John J. Verigin]] who became the de facto leader of USCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iskra.ca/canada.htm Iskra: Life in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}

The '''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras''' are a group of [[Mahayana sutras]] that present the concept of the "womb" or "embryo" (''garbha'') of the [[tathāgata]], the buddha. Every [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]] has the possibility to attain Buddhahood because of the ''tathāgatagarbha''.

This concept originated in India but was a major influence in the development of [[East Asian Buddhism]], where it was equated with the concept of ''Buddhadhātu'', "buddha-element" or "buddha-nature".

The Tathāgatagarbha sūtras include the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra]]'', ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]'', ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]''. Related ideas are in found in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' and ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]''. Another major text, the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]]'', was originally composed in China,{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=116}} while the ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' was considerably extended in China.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The Sanskrit term ''tathāgatagarbha'' ({{cjkv|t=如来藏|p=rúláizàng|j=にょらいぞう|k=여래장|v=như lai tạng}}) may be parsed into ''[[tathāgata]]'' "the one thus gone"{{sfn|Brandon|1972|p=240}} (referring to [[Buddhahood]]) and ''garbha'' "root, embryo, essence".{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=263}}

==Development of the concept==
{{main|Buddha-nature}}

===Luminous mind in the ''Nikāyas''===
In the ''Anguttara Nikāya'', the Buddha refers to a "[[luminous mind]]".{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=94}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The reference is at A I, 8-10.}}

The canon does not support the identification of the "luminous mind" with [[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]], though it plays a role in the realization of nirvana.{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=94, 97}}{{sfn|Thanissaro |p=}} Upon the destruction of the fetters, according to one scholar, "the shining nibbanic consciousness flashes out of the womb of arahantship, being without object or support, so transcending all limitations."{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=99}}

===Tathagatagarbha and Buddha-nature===
Though the tathagatagarbha and the Buddha-nature have not exactly the same meaning, in the Buddhist tradition they became equated. In the ''Angulimaliya Sūtra'' and in the ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' the terms "Buddha-nature" (''Buddha-dhātu'') and "''tathāgatagarbha''" are synonyms.

All are agreed that the ''tathāgatagarbha'' is an immortal, inherent transcendental essence or potency and that it resides in a concealed state (concealed by mental and behavioural negativities) in every single being, even the worst - the [[icchantika]].{{source?|date=July 2014}}

Although attempts are made in the Buddhist sutras to explain the ''tathāgatagarbha'', it remains ultimately mysterious and allegedly unfathomable to the ordinary, unawakened person, being only fully knowable by perfect Buddhas themselves.

The ''tathāgatagarbha'' itself needs no cultivation, only uncovering or discovery, as it is already present and perfect within each being:
{{quote|An unknown treasure exists under the home of a poor person that must be uncovered through removing obstructive dirt, yielding the treasure that always was there. Just as the treasure already exists and thus requires no further fashioning, so the matrix-of-one-gone-thus [i.e. the ''tathāgatagarbha''], endowed with ultimate buddha qualities, already dwells within each sentient being and needs only to be freed from defilements.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=9}} }}

Charles Muller comments that the tathagatagarbha is the mind's original pure nature and has neither a point of origination nor a point of cessation: '''tathagatagarbha'' expresses the already perfect aspect of the original nature of the mind that is clear and pure without arising or cessation.'{{sfn|Muller|1999|p=82}}  

The ''tathāgatagarbha'' is the ultimate, pure, ungraspable, inconceivable, irreducible, unassailable, boundless, true and deathless quintessence of the Buddha's emancipatory reality, the very core of his [[Dharmakaya|sublime nature]].

==Texts==

===Overview===
Key texts associated with this doctrine, written in India, are the{{sfn|Radich|2015|pp=261-273}}
* ''[[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra]]'' (200-250 CE)
* ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]'' (3rd century CE{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=2}})
* ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa|Anunatva Apurnatva Nirdeśa]]''
* ''Mahābherīhārakaparivarta''{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=492}}
* ''Mahamegha Sūtra''
* ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]''
* ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga]]'', a compendium of Tathāgatagarbha-thought
* ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' (c. 200 CE), very influential in Chinese Buddhism
* ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' (3rd century CE), integrating Tathāgatagarbha and [[Yogachara]]
* ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]'' (6th century CE), a [[shastra]] (commentary) written in China

Comparing the tradition of Tathāgatagarbha sūtras to the [[Yogachara]] and [[Madhyamaka]] schools, Paul Williams writes that this collection appears to have been less prominent in India, but became increasingly popular and significant in [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asian Buddhism]] and East Asian Buddhism.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}}

===''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'' (200-250 CE)===
The ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'' presents the ''tathāgatagarbha'' as a virtual Buddha-homunculus, a fully wisdom-endowed Buddha, "a most victorious body ... great and indestructible", inviolate, seated majestically in the lotus position within the body of each being, clearly visible only to a perfect Buddha with his supernatural vision.{{sfn|Lopez|1995|pp=100–101}}{{Request quotation|date=May 2016}} This is the most "personalist" depiction of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' encountered in any of the chief ''Tathāgatagarbha'' sutras and is imagistically reminiscent of Mahāyāna descriptions of the Buddha himself sitting in the lotus posture within his own mother's womb prior to birth: "luminous, glorious, gracious, beautiful to see, seated with his legs crossed" and shining "like pure gold ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Lalita Vistara Sutra'', "Voice of Buddha", Dharma Publishing, 1983, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' (2nd century CE)===
Some of the earliest and most important Tathāgatagarbha sūtras have been associated by scholars with certain [[early Buddhist schools]] in India.

Brian Edward Brown dates the composition of the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' to the Andhra Ikshvaku in the 3rd century CE, as a product of the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region.{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=3}}{{fv|date=May 2016}} Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the Mahāsāṃghikas and the ''Śrīmālā'', along with four major arguments for this association.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=153-154}}

Sree Padma and Anthony Barber also associate the earlier development of the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'' with the Mahāsāṃghikas, and conclude that the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region were responsible for the inception of the Tathāgatagarbha doctrine.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=155-156}} 
According to''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'', the tathāgatagarbha is "not born, does not die, does not transfer, does not arise. It is beyond the sphere of the characteristics of the compounded; it is permanent, stable and changeless."{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=40}}{{sfn|Paul|2004|p=40}}{{fv|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="The Shrimaladevi Sutra"&gt;The Shrimaladevi Sutra&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}}{{Full citation needed|date=May 2016}} Moreover, it has been described as "the sphere of experience of the Tathāgatas [Buddhas]."&lt;ref name="The Shrimaladevi Sutra" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}

===''Anunatva Apurnatva Nirdeśa''===
The development of the Buddha-nature doctrine is closely related to that of Buddha-matrix (Sanskrit: ''tathāgatagarbha''). In the ''Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdeśa'', the Buddha links the ''tathāgatagarbha'' to the ''[[Dharmadhatu|Dharmadhātu]]'' (ultimate, all-equal, uncreated essence of all phenomena) and to essential being, stating: "What I call "be-ing" (''sattva'') is just a different name for this permanent, stable, pure and unchanging refuge that is free from arising and cessation, the inconceivable pure Dharmadhatu."&lt;ref&gt;言眾生者即是不生不滅常恒清涼不變歸依。不可思議清淨法界等異名。T668.477c08&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Angulimaliya Sūtra''===
Every being has Buddha-nature (''Buddha-dhatu''). It is indicated in the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' that if the Buddhas themselves were to try to find any sentient being who lacked the Buddha-nature, they would fail. In fact, it is stated in this sutra that the Buddhas do discern the presence of the everlasting Buddha-nature in every being:
{{quote|Even though all Buddhas themselves were to search assiduously, they would not find a ''tathāgata-garbha'' ([[Buddha-nature]]) that is ''not'' eternal, for the eternal ''dhātu'', the ''buddha-dhātu'' (Buddha Principle, Buddha Nature), the ''dhātu'' adorned with infinite major and minor attributes, is present in all beings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131115045602/http://www.webspawner.com/users/bodhisattva/index.html "Tathagatagarbha Buddhism"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Belief and faith in the true reality of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' is presented by the relevant scriptures as a positive mental act and is strongly urged; indeed, rejection of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' is linked with highly adverse karmic consequences. In the ''Angulimaliya Sutra'' it is stated that teaching only non-self and dismissing the reality of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' karmically lead one into most unpleasant rebirths, whereas spreading the doctrine of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' will bring benefit both to oneself and to the world.{{sfn|Hodge|p=20}}

===''Ratnagotravibhāga''===
Of disputed authorship, the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] (otherwise known as the ''Uttaratantra''), is the only Indian attempt to create a coherent philosophical model based on the ideas found in the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}} The Ratnagotravibhāga especially draws on the ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=110}} Despite East Asian Buddhism's propensity for the concepts found in the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, the Ratnagotravibhāga has played a relatively small role in East Asian Buddhism.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=110}} This is due to the primacy of sutra study in East Asian Buddhism.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=110}}

The ''Ratnagotravibhāga'' sees the Buddha-nature (''tathāgatagarbha'') as "suchness" or "thusness" - the abiding reality of all things - in a state of tarnished concealment within the being. The idea is that the ultimate consciousness of each being is spotless and pure, but surrounded by negative tendencies which are impure. Paul Williams comments on how the impurity is actually not truly part of the Buddha-nature, but merely conceals the immanent true qualities of Buddha mind (i.e. the buddha-nature) from manifesting openly:
{{quote|The impurities that taint the mind and entail the state of unenlightenment (''samsara'') are completely adventitious ... On the other hand from the point of view of the mind's pure radiant intrinsic nature, because it ''is'' like this it is possessed of all the many qualities of a Buddha's mind. These do not need actually to be brought about but merely need to be allowed to shine forth. Because they are intrinsic to the very nature of consciousness itself they, and the very state of Buddhahood, will never cease.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=166}} }}

===''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' (c. 200 CE)===
[[File:Karla chaitya stupa.JPG|thumb|Cave complex associated with the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] sect. [[Karla Caves]], [[Maharashtra|Mahārāṣtra]], India]]
{{Main|Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra}}

The ''Nirvana Sutra'' is an eschatological text.{{sfn|Hodge|2006}} Its core was written in India in a time which was perceived as the age in which the Buddha-dharma would perish, and all the Mahayana sutras disappear. The sutra responds to this awaited end with the proclamation of the tathagatagarbha, the innate Buddhahood present in all man.{{sfn|Hodge|2006}}

According to Sallie B. King, the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' does not represent a major innovation, and is rather unsystematic,{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} which made it "a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text".{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} According to King, its most important innovation is the linking of the term ''buddhadhātu'' with ''tathāgatagarbha''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} 

''Buddhadhātu'', "Buddha-nature", "the nature of the Buddha", that what constitutes a Buddha, is a central topic of the ''Nirvana sutra''.{{sfn|Liu|1982|p=66-67}} According to Sally King, the sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} The "nature of the Buddha" is presented as a timeless, eternal "Self", which is akin to the ''tathāgatagarbha'', the innate possibility in every sentient being to attain Buddhahood and manifest this timeless Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Liu|1982|p=66-67}} This "hidden treasury" is present in all sentient beings:
{{quote|[the Buddha] expounds the doctrine that this quality [of the hidden interior, wondrous treasury] is not only common to buddhas but to all living beings as well.{{sfn|Blum|2013|p=xv-xx}}}}

This does not mean that sentient beings are at present endowed with the qualities of a Buddha, but that they will have those qualities in the future.{{sfn|Liu|1982|p=66-67}} It is obscured from worldly vision by the screening effect of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], tenacious negative mental afflictions. The most notable of which are greed, hatred, delusion, and pride. Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, the buddhadhātu is said to shine forth unimpededly and the buddhadhātu can then be consciously "entered into", and therewith deathless Nirvana attained:{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=94–96}}
{{quote|[T]he tathagatagarbha is none but Thusness or the Buddha Nature, and is the originally untainted pure mind which lies overspread by, and exists in, the mind of greed and anger of all beings. This bespeaks a Buddha Body that exists in a state of bondage.{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=87}}}}

===''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' (3rd century CE)===
The later ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' presents the ''tathāgatagarbha'' as being a teaching completely consistent with and identical to emptiness. It synthesizes ''tathāgatagarbha'' with the [[sunyata|emptiness]] (''śūnyatā'') of the ''[[prajnaparamita|prajñāpāramitā]]'' sutras. Emptiness is the thought-transcending realm of non-duality and unconditionedness: complete freedom from all constriction and limitation.

The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' describes the ''tathāgatagarbha'' as "by nature brightly shining and pure," and "originally pure," though "enveloped in the garments of the ''skandhas'', ''dhātus'' and ''ayatanas'' and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining." It is said to be "naturally pure," but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements.{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=996-97}} Thus the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' identifies the luminous mind of the canon with the ''tathāgatagarbha''.{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=97}}

It also equates the ''tathāgatagarbha'' (and ''[[alaya-vijnana|ālaya-vijñāna]]'') with nirvana, though this is concerned with the actual attainment of nirvana as opposed to nirvana as a timeless phenomenon.{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=97"}}{{sfn|Henshall|2007|p=36}} 

In the later{{sfn|Sutton|1991|p=14}} ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' it is said that the ''tathāgatagarbha'' might be mistaken for a self, which it is not.{{sfn|Harvey|1989|p=98}} In fact, the sutra states that it is identical to the teaching of no-self.{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=58}}

In Section XXVIII of the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', Mahāmati asks Buddha, "Is not this Tathagata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the ego-substance taught by the philosophers?" The Buddha's response:
{{quote|No, Mahamati, my Tathagata-garbha is not the same as the ego taught by the philosophers; for what the Tathagatas teach is the Tathagata-garbha in the sense, Mahamati, that it is emptiness, reality-limit, Nirvana, being unborn, unqualified, and devoid of will-effort; the reason why the Tathagatas who are Arhats and {{Sic|?|hide=y|Fully|-}}Enlightened Ones, teach the doctrine pointing to the Tathagata-garbha is to make the ignorant cast aside their fear when they listen to the teaching of egolessness and to have them realise the state of non-discrimination and imagelessness. I also wish, Mahamati, that the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas of the present and future would not attach themselves to the idea of an ego [imagining it to be a soul]. Mahamati, it is like a potter who manufactures various vessels out of a mass of clay of one sort by his own manual skill and labour combined with a rod, water, and thread, Mahamati, that the Tathagatas preach the egolessness of things which removes all the traces of discrimination by various skilful means issuing from their transcendental wisdom, that is, sometimes by the doctrine of the Tathagata-garbha, sometimes by that of egolessness, and, like a potter, by means of various terms, expressions, and synonyms. For this reason, Mahamati, the philosophers' doctrine of an ego-substance is not the same as the teaching of the Tathagata-garbha. Thus, Mahamati, the doctrine of the Tathagata-garbha is disclosed in order to awaken the philosophers from their clinging to the idea of the ego, so that those minds that have fallen into the views imagining the non-existent ego as real, and also into the notion that the triple emancipation is final, may rapidly be awakened to the state of supreme enlightenment. Accordingly, Mahamati, the Tathagatas who are Arhats and {{Sic|?|hide=y|Fully|-}}Enlightened Ones disclose the doctrine of the Tathagata-garbha which is thus not to be known as identical with the philosopher's notion of an ego-substance. Therefore. Mahamati, in order to abandon the misconception cherished by the philosophers, you must strive after the teaching of egolessness and the Tathagata-garbha.{{sfn|Suzuki|1932|pp=}}}}

Yet in the concluding ''Sagathakam'' portion of the text, coming after the above-quoted passage, the sutra does not deny the reality of the Self; in fact it castigates such denial of the 'pure Self'. According to Thomas Cleary, "The original scripture rigorously rejects nihilism and does not ultimately deny either self or world",{{sfn|Cleary|2012|pp=69-71}} and quotes the sutra: 
"Confused thinkers without guidance are in a cave of consciousness running hither and thither seeking to explain the self. The pure self has to be realized first hand; that is the matrix of realization [Tathagatagarbha], inaccessible to speculative thinkers."{{sfn|Cleary|2012|pp=69-71}} 

The ''tathāgatagarbha'' doctrine became linked (in syncretic form) with doctrines of [[Consciousness-only|Citta-mātra]] ("just-the-mind") or [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]]. Yogācārins aimed to account for the possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood by ignorant sentient beings: the ''tathāgatagarbha'' is the indwelling awakening of bodhi in the very heart of [[samsara]]. There is also a tendency in the ''tathāgatagarbha'' sutras to support vegetarianism, as all persons and creatures are compassionately viewed as possessing one and the same essential nature - the ''Buddha-dhatu'' or Buddha-nature.

[[File:Adyar_estuary.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A view of the gardens of the Adyar Theosophical society]]
The '''Theosophy Society – Adyar''' is the name of a section of the [[Theosophical Society]] founded by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] and others in 1882. Its headquarters moved with Blavatsky and president [[Henry Steel Olcott]] from New York to [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]], an area of [[Chennai]], in 1886. The designation 'Adyar' is added to make it clear that this is the Theosophical Society headquartered there, after the American section and some other lodges separated from it in 1895, under [[William Quan Judge]].&lt;ref&gt; Ryan, Charles J. (1975) "''H.P. Blavatsky and the Theosophical Movement''". San Diego (California), Point Loma Publications Inc. blz. 427 - {{ISBN|0-913004-25-1}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The US National Section of this organization is called the [[Theosophical Society in America]] located in [[Wheaton, Illinois]].

==The garden==
[[File:Adyar TG.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Theosophical Society, Adyar, India, in 1890]]
Known as the "Huddleston Gardens", the Theosophical Society garden lies on the south bank of the Adyar River and covers 260 acres. The garden has migratory birds, fruit bats, snakes, jackals, wild cats, mongooses, hares, and a variety of spiders. Trees include the rare [[mahogany]] and other trees from across the globe. The garden also has a 450-year-old [[banyan tree]], which is known locally as ''Adyar aala maram,'' whose aerial roots cover some 60,000 sq m. The main trunk fell under its own weight in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[H. P. Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]] and others founded the Theosophical Society on 17 November 1875 in [[New York City]]. The American section split off with William Quan Judge as its leader. Henry Steel Olcott remained president until his death in 1907.

== Aims and ideals ==
# To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.
# To encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy and Science.
# To investigate unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in man.

=== Monastic/Non-monastic ===

The Theosophical Society is open to anybody who supports its three objects, regardless of belief, social custom or marriage status. Celibacy is neither encouraged nor discouraged, each member being free to decide his/her own way of life.

[[File:Olcott in Adyar.jpg|thumb|Colonel Olcott in Adyar, 1903]]
=== General philosophical outlook ===
* [[Universal Brotherhood]]
* Belief in theory of [[Karma]]
* Belief in [[Reincarnation]]
* There exists a [[Consciousness]] ([[Logos]]), [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universal]] and  [[Individual]]
* [[Immortality]] of Man

=== Spiritual discipline ===

The practice of brotherhood regardless of race, creed, sex, color, or any other difference is recommended. Nothing is mandatory. Members are free to have any or no spiritual practice at all.

=== Administration ===

The organization has a highly autonomous setup in that lodges and sections are fully autonomous. The President gets involved in National Section matters only when there is some dispute between them. Otherwise the President does not interfere in the matters of the sections or lodges. The President is nominated by the members of the General Council and then elected by members all over the world. The President holds office for seven-year period. The Vice-President acts on behalf of the President as necessary and assists him or her in various ways. The Secretary handles worldwide correspondence, maintains records including statistics of the worldwide membership of the Society, its Lodges and Sections, and is responsible for producing an annual report. He/she is also the Secretary of the General Council and the Executive Committee of the Society. This Committee, which meets a number of times each year, implements the decisions of the General Council and makes financial and administrative decisions relating to the Society's Headquarters. The Treasurer is responsible for the finances of the Society and prepares an annual financial report.

Locally, members are organised in lodges. When a country has at least seven lodges, these can be gathered in a national section. Lodges and sections have a democratic organisation in which chairperson, secretary, treasurer and optional other officers are elected. Similarly, officers of the national sections are directly elected by the members of that section in a business meeting.

== Activities ==
[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|Emblem of Theosophical Society Adyar]]
=== Religion &amp; spirituality ===
The Theosophical Society is organised in lodges and national sections.  These organise meetings for religious study and lectures.  Members individually practice any kind of meditation or other spiritual practice they choose.

=== Social field ===
* The Olcott Education Society
* The Olcott Memorial School
* The Olcott Memorial High School
* The [[Theosophical Order of Service]]

[[Olcott Memorial High School]] provides free education, uniforms, books, and two daily meals to impoverished rural children in Chennai, [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashanet.org/projects/project-view.php?p=360&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural field ===
* Theosophical Publishing House

=== Relief activities ===
When a [[Tsunami]] hit [[South India]] on 26 December 2004, it affected many of the people living near the Adyar-compound. The Theosophical Society, through the Theosophical Order of Service, helped the people survive both in the immediate aftermath and later. Similar activities were undertaken after the [[Hurricane Katrina|hurricane]] that destroyed much of [[New Orleans]] in 2005.

=== Province of its influence ===
The influence of the Theosophical Society has been major, especially considering its small size. The [[new age]] movement reflected many of its main characteristics, especially [[holism]] and eclecticism. In [[Modern Art]], the artists Kandinsky and Mondriaan were both influenced by theosophy.

=== Theosophical Society and Jiddu Krishnamurti ===
The leadership of the Theosophical Society at Adyar was responsible for promoting young [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the new [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|"World Teacher"]] during the first few decades of the 20th century. [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], one of the Society's leaders at the time, had "discovered" fourteen-year-old Krishnamurti in 1909, and considered him the likely "vehicle" for the expected reappearance of the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]. However, as a young man in 1929, Krishnamurti disavowed his expected "mission" and disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its doctrines and practices. Over the next six decades he pursued an independent course, becoming widely known as an original, influential thinker and speaker on philosophical and religious subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lutyens|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Lutyens|title=J.

[[File:Portrait tattoo.jpg|thumb|Tattoos are common examples of tie signs that signify a relationship between the wearer and the subject of the tattoo.]]'''Tie signs''' are signs, signals, and symbols, that are revealed through people's actions as well as objects such as engagement rings, wedding bands, and photographs of a personal nature that suggest a relationship exists between two people.  For romantic couples, [[Public display of affection|public displays of affection (PDA)]] including things like holding hands, an arm around a partner’s shoulders or waist, extended periods of physical contact, greater-than-normal levels of physical proximity, grooming one’s partner, and “sweet talk” are all examples of common tie signs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behavior|last1=Morris|first1=Desmond|date=1977|publisher=H.N. Abrams|isbn=0810913100|location=New York, NY|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tie signs inform the participants, as well as outsiders, about the nature of a relationship, its condition, and even what stage a relationship is in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Young couple standing in a field, the man with right arm around the woman's shoulder LCCN2015650129.jpg|thumb|Holding someone close is an example of a tie sign, as are photographs of such actions]]

== Background ==
Origination of the term "tie sign" has been attributed to [[Desmond Morris]], an English zoologist and author, by at least one source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803104617120|title=Oxford Reference|website=oxfordreference.com|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Erving Goffman]] is also credited with employing the term in 1959, almost two decades earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Relationships|last=Duck|first=Steve|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4129-5876-9|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Usage ==
[[File:Holding hands (34305602934).jpg|thumb|Couples holding hands in public is a common tie sign]]
Nearly anything can be a tie sign, whether it is an action or an object, depending on the context in which it is observed. The majority of the time, the term tie sign is directed toward relational couples, but it can also apply to groups like families and friends. Additionally, "name-dropping" is an example a type of non-romantic tie sign&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; wherein someone attempts to communicate to others that a relationship exists between the speaker and the person he or she has named.

=== Dependence on context ===
Morris relates that one of the difficulties associated with understanding tie signs is that almost anything can qualify as one, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, even though holding hands is a common tie sign, there is an obvious difference between a man and a woman holding hands as they stand on the alter at a wedding when compared to a female physician holding a male patient's hand in a doctor's office. Goffman echoes this sentiment when he says, "a tie-sign is in fact dependent on the context for its meaning."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1433020|title=Relations in public; microstudies of the public order|last=Erving|first=Goffman|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1972|isbn=0060902760|location=New York,|oclc=1433020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Facebook Like React.png|thumb|"Liking" someone's Facebook page is an example of tie sign via social media]]

=== Use of tie signs in social media ===
The advent of social media has created a newer conduit for tie signs.  In addition to broadcasting images of a couple exhibiting traditional tie signs like kissing, holding hands, hugging, pictures of weddings, and engagement rings, etc., social media provides the opportunity for other signals such as "liking" someone's page or tagging another person in a picture. Additionally, although observers may not witness the act of "liking" as it occurs, evidence of such actions persist on the recipient's page for others to see over time.

There is some evidence that ceasing to use social media for relational maintenance purposes could contribute to "alienation and relational de-escalation", while it would not have been a problem in the past simply because the opportunity to communicate via social media was not an option.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosik|first=Victoria Schwanda|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalya N.|year=2014|title=Relational maintenance on social network sites: How Facebook communication predicts relational escalation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=35|pages=124–131|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044|issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Afifi and Johnson ===
Walid A. Afifi and Michelle L. Johnson researched cross-sex friendships (those between a man and a woman) and how the use of tie signs in less-than-romantic relationships differ from the same tie signs when they are used in romantic cross-sex relationships.  For example, hugging as a greeting is an accepted tie sign for both cross-sex friendship as well as cross-sex romantic relationships.  Afifi and Johnson note some differences between sexes in the meanings behind tie signs in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afifi|first=Walid A.|last2=Johnson|first2=Michelle L.|year=1999|title=The Use and Interpretation of Tie Signs in a Public Setting: Relationship and Sex Differences|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407599161002|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=16|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1177/0265407599161002|issn=0265-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, women, more often than men, stated their use of tie signs was intended to "express inclusion and intimacy."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Afifi and Johnson also suggest that less-than-overt tie signs are often ambiguous even with knowledge of the context and the present state of the relationship.  It is for this reason that [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] argues that a tie sign is informative in nature and not a type of communication or language that can stand on its own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Goffman===
Like Morris, Goffman's work on tie signs, copyrighted in 1971,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was more descriptive than it was research-based because he was defining a new concept.  In so doing, Goffman focuses on relationships between two people (dyadic), and refers to the participants as both "pegs" and "ends" that are joined in "anchored relations,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the way intentional and unintentional actions that are exhibited by the pair reflect the current state of their relationship.  Goffman argues that tie signs are "ritual idioms"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that contain information as opposed to a particular message, in large part because tie signs are often susceptible to incorrect interpretations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In turn, third party observers tend to look for additional tie signs in order to confirm or deny their suspicions regarding the subjects they are observing. Goffman breaks tie-signs into three distinct categories:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Rituals:  These are inward-facing tie signs between those in a relationship.  For example, in a new relationship, where the parties exhibit increased attentiveness toward one another by holding hands, maintaining prolonged eye contact, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Ritual ties signs can be subtle or overt, but, although they may be perceptible to outsiders, they are directed inward between the participants.
# Markers:  As the name suggests, these types of tie signs are more overt and intended by at least one of the participants in a relationship to be interpreted by others that a relationship of some kind does exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Change signals:  Things like weddings and births are examples of change signals. Change signals also generally involve a participant in the relationship taking a good bit for granted, or as Goffman puts it, "the taking of liberty."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For example, handing a partner one's coat or purse without asking, and not giving the action a second thought, is an example of one relational "peg"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; demonstrating that a relationship exists with another.

=== Guerrero and Anderson ===
Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen researched how touch avoidance informs on the various stages of romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|year=1991|title=The Waxing and Waning of Relational Intimacy: Touch as a Function of Relational Stage, Gender and Touch Avoidance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407591082001|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=8|issue=2|pages=147–165|doi=10.1177/0265407591082001|issn=0265-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guerrero and Anderson's results quite clearly suggest a marked decrease in touching between couples once their relationship reaches a "stable" stage.  The authors' research does not determine whether the decrease in touch after reaching a "stable" condition it is no longer needed as much as when the relationship is still forming, or if need, or desire, for public touching is replaced by an increase in physical contact while in private,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or by less overt communications and gestures such as knowing looks between pairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Guerrero and Anderson's work supports Morris' contention that tie-signs decrease in frequency and intimacy as relationships mature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] refers to this trend as “taking liberty.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Perhaps somewhat counter intuitively on its face, a lack of touching between an “anchored pair”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is also a tie sign that can signal a pair’s relationship is in a mature and stable stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  
[[File:Desmond Morris (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Desmond Morris]]]]

===Morris===
Like Goffman, [[Desmond Morris]]'s work with tie signs, was more descriptive in nature as he was describing a new concept, in contrast with others’research that followed. Morris defines a tie sign as "any action which indicates the existence of a personal relationship".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he broadens and clarifies his definition by including objects such as engagement rings, family pictures, and tattoos, as well as "indirect tie signs"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as a couple sharing a desert after dinner, and "direct ties signs"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as maintaining close proximity to one another, finishing each other’s sentences, and prolonged and frequent body contact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sosick and Bazarova ===
Victoria Schwanda Sosik and Natalya Bazarova researched relational maintenance through social networking including an increasing sense of “staying in touch” and frequency of contact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Even while noting a reduction in effort, or "relational maintenance cost"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; required to maintain a relationship via a social media conduit, the authors argue that activity on an acquaintance's social media page still serves to signal a shared relationship.  Sosik and Bazarova also argue there is a hierarchy of signals available including more personal, written comments posted either publicly or privately, “liking” something on the other person’s social media page, tagging the other person when active on other pages, etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Two differences between an in-person tie sign and a tie sign in a social media setting are first - the potentially greater size of the audience, and second - the lingering of tie signs that were generated in the past creating, in turn, a prolonged signal to any who see it that a relationship exists.

=== Tong and Walther===
In Wright and Webb's book ''Computer-Mediated Communication in Personal Relationships'',&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/667213140|title=Computer-mediated communication in personal relationships|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang|others=Wright, Kevin B., Webb, Lynne M.|isbn=9781433110818|location=New York|oclc=667213140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Tom Tong and [[Joseph Walther]] explore whether social media activity is additive to relational maintenance between people that are not dispersed geographically and otherwise have social contact with one another.  Even thought people may have a relationship outside of social media, they still often choose to demonstrate to others that a relationship exists with tie signs that are delivered via social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Critique ==
In "Relations in Public", Goffman concedes that his review of tie-signs is focused on Western society of the time.  And, specifically to "middle-class American[s]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There may be some benefit for future research on the effects of broadcasting tie signs through social media, and what impact they may have on relationships.  Such as, whether the larger number of witnesses and lingering representation of a tie sign that is preserved in social media might be perceived as magnifying the significance of what is otherwise a seemingly small gesture.

{{Nihongo|'''Tomonaga Sanjūrō'''|朝永 三十郎||1871–1951}} was a [[Japanese philosopher]] and a renowned professor emeritus of the Medieval, Renaissance, Early Modern, and Kantian philosophy at the [[University of Kyoto]] in early 20th century. He was one of the leading thinkers from the [[Kyoto School]]. His son, [[Shinichirō Tomonaga]], is also famous for receiving the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1965 for the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

==Life==
Tomonaga was born in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]] the second son of Tomonaga Jinjirō, a [[samurai]] of the [[Ōmura Domain]],in 1871. After graduating from Nagasaki Ōmura Junior High School (which is now known as [[Nagasaki Prefectural Omura High School]]) and then [[First Higher School]], he entered the [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. After finishing his degree from the same university, he became the assistant professor of philosophy at the [[Imperial University of Kyoto]] in 1907 and then full professor in 1913. He mainly lectured on [[Western Philosophy]] and the [[History of Philosophy]]; and, along with [[Nishida Kitarō]] and [[Tanabe Hajime]], constituted the important intellectual movement of modern Japan, i.e., the [[Kyoto School]]. Tomonaga was known for being an unprolific writer but left remarkable works (e.g., "The History of Self-consciousness in relation to the Self of Modernity," "Philosophy from Renaissance to Kant," "Kant's Theory of Peace," and others) and taught many students who later became renowned Japanese philosophers (e.g., [[Amano Teiyū]], [[Obara Kuniyoshi]], [[Yamauchi Tokuryū]], [[Kosaka Masaaki]]). He retired from [[Kyoto Imperial University]] in 1931 and then became full professor at [[Ōtani University]].

'''Tomáš Štítný ze Štítného''' (c. 1333 &amp;ndash; 1401/1409) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] nobleman, writer, theologian, translator, and Christian preacher. He was one of the leading figures of the early [[Czech Reformation]], writing and translating Christian tracts for the benefit of the nobility, to assist in wise governance. The [[Klementinum Codex]], a major work, is a collection of some of the essentials necessary for Christian practice and the needs of daily life. He also wrote parables for ordinary people and works purely for entertainment. There is a bronze bust of Tomas Stitny in the pantheon of the [[National Museum of Prague]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">'''Truthmaker theory''' is "the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth-ma/ Truthmaker Theory – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''truthmaker''' for a [[truthbearer]] is that entity in virtue of which the truthbearer is true. Philosophers have speculated on the question whether every truthbearer requires a truthmaker.  [[Parmenides]]' classic claim that what does not exist cannot be thought about has been read as a claim that every truthbearer must have a truthmaker, since otherwise the truthbearer is not ''about'' anything. A '''falsemaker''' for a [[proposition]] is that existent reality in virtue of which that proposition is false, assuming it is false.

==Overview==
In "Truth-Makers" (1984), Mulligan, Simons and Smith introduced the truth-maker idea as a contribution to the correspondence theory of truth. Logically atomic empirical sentences such as "John kissed Mary" have truthmakers, typically events or tropes corresponding to the main verbs of the sentences in question. Mulligan et al. explore extensions of this idea to sentences of other sorts, but they do not embrace any position of truthmaker maximalism, according to which every truthbearer has a truthmaker.

This maximalist position leads to philosophical difficulties, such as the question of what the truthmaker for an [[ethics|ethical]], [[modal logic|modal]] or [[mathematics|mathematical]] truthbearer could be. Of course someone who is deeply enough committed to truthmakers and who simultaneously doubts that a truthmaker could be found for a certain kind of truthbearer will simply deny that that truthbearer could be true. Those who find the Parmenidean insight sufficiently compelling often take it to be a particularly enlightening metaphysical pursuit to search for truthmakers of these kinds of propositions.

Another difficulty for the claim that every truthbearer has a truthmaker is with negations of [[existential proposition]]s (or, equivalently, [[universal proposition]]s). What ''entity'' makes it true that unicorns do not exist?  Proposals include the ''totality'' of all things, or some worldly state of affairs such as x1's not being a unicorn, x2's not being a unicorn, ..., and everything's being x1, or x2, or ... (the latter suggestion is due to Richard M. Gale).  

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] has proposed a more moderate version of the truthmaker theory on which truthmakers are only required for positive propositions (e.g., there must be a truthmaker for the proposition that there are horses, but not for the equally true proposition that there are no unicorns). What makes a negative proposition ''p'' true is the ''lack'' of a [[falsemaker]] for it, i.e., the lack of a truthmaker for the negation of ''p''. Thus what makes it true that there are no unicorns is the lack of a truthmaker for the proposition that there ''are'' unicorns, i.e., the lack of unicorns. This may be what Protagoras was getting at when he said that to speak truly is to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not.

Truthmaker theorists differ as to what entities are the truthmakers of various truthbearers. Some say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting (assuming he is!) is ''Socrates' being seated'' (whatever exactly that might turn out to be on the correct ontology) and in general the truthmaker of the truthbearer expressed by a sentence ''s'' can be denoted by the [[participial nominalization]] of ''s''. Others will say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting is just ''Socrates'' himself. In any case, the truthmaker is supposed to be something ''concrete'', and on the first view is that whose existence is reported by the truthbearer and on the second view is that which the truthbearer is ''about''.

While the existence of truthmakers may seem an abstruse question, concrete instances are at the heart of a number of philosophical issues. Thus, J. L. Mackie has argued that the truthmakers of moral claims would be "queer entities", too strange to exist, and hence all moral claims are false. Alternatively, a [[Divine command theory|divine command]] [[metaethics|metaethicist]] may insist that the only possible candidate for a truthmaker of a moral claim is a command from a perfect God, and hence if moral claims are true and a truthmaker theory holds, then God exists. Thus the disagreement between various [[metaethics|metaethical]] schools is in part a disagreement over what kinds of truthmakers moral claims would have if these claims were true and over whether such truthmakers exist.

'''Valéria Dienes''' (25 May 1879 – 8 June 1978) was a Hungarian philosopher, dancer, dance instructor, choreographer and one of first Hungarian woman to graduate from university. She is widely considered to be one of the most important Hungarian theorists on movement. She was the recipient of Hungary's highest literary award, the [[Baumgarten Prize]] in 1934.

==Early life==
Valéria Geiger was born on 25 May 1879 in [[Szekszárd]], in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to Erzsébet (née Berczelits) and Gyula Geiger. Her father was a journalist and the Geiger family lived two houses away from her childhood friend [[Mihály Babits]], who would later base some of the characters in his novel ''Halálfiai'' on the Geigers.{{sfn|Holy Elizabeth Catholic School|2013}} She began her education at the Mária Mayer-Arlow School in Szekszárd and after completing 5 courses, began study at the State Civilian Girls' School in 1891. Graduating in 1893, Geiger began studying at the State Normal School in [[Győr]], earning her teacher's degree in 1897. That same year, she moved to [[Budapest]] and enrolled in the three-year Civil-School Teacher Training Course held at #65 [[Andrássy út|Andrássy Avenue]], matriculating in 1901.{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2001}}

In 1901, Geiger entered [[Pázmány Péter Catholic University]] as a scholarship student of Wlassits College of the National Women's Training Institute{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2001}} and simultaneously began studying piano at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|Budapest Academy of Music]].{{sfn|Holy Elizabeth Catholic School|2013}} Studying [[aesthetics]], [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], Geiger graduated with a dual-doctorate from the Philosophy Department in aesthetics and mathematics in June 1905.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}}{{sfn|Pléh|2008|p=172}} She became the first woman to obtain a PhD from the Philosophy Department with a thesis entitled ''Valóság-Elméletek'' (Reality-Theories).{{sfn|Holy Elizabeth Catholic School|2013}}{{sfn|Pléh|2008|p=172}} A few months later, she married a fellow mathematics student, {{ill|Pál Dienes|hu|Dienes Pál}}{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2001}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} and the young couple spent the years 1906 and 1907 touring, traveling from [[Palermo]] to [[Tunis]].{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2001}} Between 1908 and 1912, the couple lived in Paris, where Dienes attended classes given by [[Henri Bergson]], attended performances by [[Isadora Duncan]] and courses on Greek classical [[eurythmy]] given by [[Raymond Duncan]].{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}}{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010|p=134}}

==Career==
Returning to Budapest in 1912, Dienes created and taught a course based on Duncan's Greek movement ideas.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} Simultaneously, she began work translating the works of Bergson, [[Alfred Binet]] and others. She published an original work in the ''Galilei Booklets'' synthesizing the ideas of [[Ivan Pavlov]] and the [[Würzburg School]] to present a reform on the way thought processes were viewed by psychologists.{{sfn|Pléh|2008|pp=172–173}} She was the first person in Hungary to put forth the idea of [[functional psychology]] and advocate it for childhood development as a means of reforming educational activities.{{sfn|Pléh|2008|pp=165, 172}}  In 1915 she founded a school, which she called "Orkesztika" or "Orchestrics", incorporating her own ideas of motion. Evaluating the interrelationships of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], [[Mimesis|mimetics]], and  [[rhythm]]ics, she created her own system to teach eurythmics and provide students with an understanding of the strength, space, expression and time needed to create dance.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}}{{sfn|Fuchs|2002|p=82}} Her two sons, {{ill|Gedeon Dienes|lt=Gedeon|hu|Dienes Gedeon}} and {{ill|Zoltán Dienes|lt=Zoltán|hu|Dienes Zoltán Pál}} were born in 1914 and 1916, respectively.{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2001}}

In 1919, Dienes designed a reform program for women's sports for the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], but the following year was exiled from the country{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} because of the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] violence.{{sfn|Németh|2014}} During the period, she gave performances in [[Belgrade]], [[Vienna]], [[Nice]], and Paris, and taught at a [[Montessori education|Montessori school]] in [[Grinzing]].{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2001}} Her husband fell in love with one of his students and moved to England, leaving Dienes the sole responsibility for their children. She went to France and joined the Duncan Art Colony in Paris, reuniting with the siblings Isadora and Raymond.{{sfn|Németh|2014}} Returning to Budapest in 1923, Dienes resumed teaching.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} She also returned to her [[Catholic Church in Hungary|Catholic]] roots. Her philosophical writings from this point, turned away from radical social philosophy and began to incorporate her Catholic beliefs into her works. Combining Bergson's theories that action, rather than passive thought, was fundamental to mental development, Dienes began to incorporate the ideas of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] and the influential priest [[Ottokár Prohászka]] into her philosophical writings.{{sfn|Németh|2014}}{{sfn|Pléh|2008|p=173}} Prohászka advocated a philosophy which was both nationalistic and [[Christian]], decidedly [[Antisemitism|anti-Semtic]] and his influence caused Dienes to evaluate the role of religion and [[mysticism]] on the development of Hungarian thought.{{sfn|Németh|2014}} Her philosophy was grounded by a belief that human expression, was constantly evolving and was motivated by four pilars: a need to preserve the past, the absence of identity, constant change and inevitability.{{sfn|Le Moal|1999|p=127}}

Dienes' choreographic works began by setting the verse of modern Hungarian poets, such as [[Endre Ady]] and Babits, to dance.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} By the 1920s, she had begun to publish her own works widely and perform large-scale movement dramas.{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010|p=134}} Her first performance of her own work was ''Hajnalvárás'' (Waiting for Dawn, 1925), followed by ''Nyolc boldogság'' (The Eight Beatitudes, 1926).{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2004}}{{sfn|Le Moal|1999|p=127}} These drama performances used her own lyrics and were often set to the music of [[Lajos Bárdos]] and performed in an outdoor arena like the [[City Park (Budapest)|Budapest City Park]]. The scope was often massive, as in her performance of ''A gyermek útja'' (The Child's Path, 1935), which used nearly 1,000 performers.{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2004}} Some of Dienes' most important religious works included ''Hajnalvárás'' (Waiting for Dawn, 1925), ''Magyar Végzet'' (Hungarian Doom), Szent Imre Misztérium, (Saint Emery’s Mystery, 1930–1931), ''"A rózsák szentje'' (The Saint of Roses, 1932), ''Magvető'' (Sower, 1933), ''Tíz szűz'' (Ten Virgins, 1934),{{sfn|Németh|2014}} and ''Az anya'' (The Mother, 1937).{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010|p=134}} In addition to religious works, Dienes created choreographies for [[fairy tales]] such as ''Fehér királylány'' (The White Princess, 1929), ''Csipkerózsa'' (''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', 1931), ''Hamupipőke'' (''[[Cinderella]]'', 1934),{{sfn|Le Moal|1999|p=127}}{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2004}} and ''Hófehérke'' (''[[Snow White]]'', 1940). ''Fehér királylány'' was made into a motion picture in 1930.{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2004}} ''Patrona Hungariae'' (Patron of Hungary, 1938) was a historic drama retelling the  Christianization of Hungary by [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] and in 1940, she choreographed ''Az élet kenyere'' (The Bread of Life) to music by Bárdos.{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2004}}

By 1928 Dienes had founded, serving as co-president, the Movement Culture Association and the following year began offering a four-year teacher's courses to train professionals in the study of motion. In 1934, she was awarded the [[Baumgarten Prize]], which at the time was the highest literary recognition in the country,{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} for her contributions to Hungarian philosophy.{{sfn|Töttős|1991}} She continued performing through the 1940s and her school remained open until 1944.{{sfn|Dienes|Fenyves|2004}} After the rise of communism, Dienes was forgotten for many years, though she continued to work and develop her philosophical ideas. She worked on translations of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and Teilhard de Chardin's ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' in the 1960s for the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1975, a television program by {{ill|Iván Vitányi|hu|Vitányi Iván}} highlighted her multi-faceted personality.{{sfn|Holy Elizabeth Catholic School|2013}}{{sfn|Töttős|1991}}

==Death and legacy==
Dienes died on 8 June 1978 in Budapest.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2015}} In 1991, a school in her hometown was renamed to bear her name.{{sfn|Töttős|1991}} That same year, the Orchestrics Foundation was created in Hungary to re-introduce the Duncan-Dienes method of eurythmics.{{sfn|Craine|Mackrell|2010|p=134}} In 1996, her collected works on her theories of movement, ''Orkesztika—Mozdulatrendszer'' (Orchestics—System of Movement) was first published. The book analyzes how movement is limited by both the anatomy and environment, which is further impacted by the amount of energy and time movement will take and the meaning one wants to convey.{{sfn|Weibel|2005|p=43}} The Hungarian Art of Movement Company has held honorary performances to recognize the pioneering work of Dienes on her 120th and 125th birthday.{{sfn|Hungarian Art of Movement Company|1999|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1838">'''William of Ware''' (called the ''Doctor Fundatus''; flourished 1290&amp;ndash;1305) was a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] and [[theologian]], born at [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. He almost certainly studied at [[Oxford University]] and lectured on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]] there, but he is not listed among the Oxford masters. There is some evidence, but no certainty, that he also taught at the [[University of Paris]], perhaps lecturing there too on the ''Sentences''. He was known as the ''Doctor Fundatus'' (established doctor) and less commonly the ''Doctor Praeclarus'' (very clear doctor).

Only one work can reliably be attributed to him, a commentary on the ''Sentences'' which survives in many manuscripts: only small parts have been edited, by the Franciscans of Quaracchi (1904), and by A. Daniels (1909, 1913), P. Muscat (1927), J.-M. Bissen (1927), and L. Hödl (1990). William does not try to discuss every distinction, but concentrates on the topics he finds most important, devoting over 100 questions to book 1 and just 129 to the remaining three books. Among the theologians whose views William discusses are [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Godfrey of Fontaines]], [[Giles of Rome]], and [[Richard of Middleton]].

Traditionally William has been assumed to be the master of [[Duns Scotus]]. In a work on the [[immaculate conception]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1373) [[Thomas Rossy]] refers to William as the ''Magister Scoti'', as does [[Bartholomew Rinonico|Bartolomeo da Pisa]] in his ''De conformitate vitae beati Francisci ad vitam domini Jesu'' of the late 1380s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6897">'''Yangism''' ({{zh|c=楊朱學派|p=Yángzhūxuépài}}) was a philosophical school founded by [[Yang Zhu]], existent during the [[Warring States period]] (475 BCE – 221 BCE), that believed that human actions are and should be based on [[rational self-interest|self-interest]]. The school has been described by [[sinology|sinologists]] as an early form of [[Psychological egoism|psychological]] and [[ethical egoism]].&lt;ref name="readings1"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Readings in classical Chinese philosophy | year = 2005 | last =Ivanhoe | first = P.J. | last2= Van Norden | first2= Bryan William |publisher = [[Hackett Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-87220-780-6|page=369|chapter=Yangism|quote="Yangzhu's own way has been described as psychological egoism (humans are in fact motivated only by self-interest), ethical egoism (humans should do only what is in their own self-interest), or primativism (humans should only do what is in the interest of themselves and their immediate family}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of ''xing'', or human nature,&lt;ref name="readings1"/&gt; a term later incorporated by [[Mencius]] into [[Confucianism]]. No documents directly authored by the Yangists have been discovered yet, and all that is known of the school comes from the comments of rival philosophers, specifically in the Chinese texts ''[[Huainanzi]]'', ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'', ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'', and possibly the ''[[Liezi]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''.&lt;ref name="mencius1"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Mencius and Early Chinese Thought | year = 2000 | last =Shun | first = Kwong-loi |publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-8047-4017-3|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Mencius]] claimed that Yangism once rivaled [[Confucianism]] and [[Mohism]], although the veracity of this claim remains controversial among sinologists.&lt;ref name="mencius2"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Mencius and Early Chinese Thought | year = 2000 | last =Shun | first = Kwong-loi |publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-8047-4017-3|page=36|quote="there is little evidence that Yangist teachings were influential during Mencius's time, and this has led some scholars to suggest that Mencius exaggerated the movement's influence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Yangism had largely faded into obscurity by the time that [[Sima Qian]] compiled his [[Shiji]], the school was not included as one of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]].

Yangism has been described as a form of psychological and [[ethical egoism]].&lt;ref name="readings1"/&gt; The Yangist philosophers believed in the importance of maintaining [[Ethical egoism|self-interest]] through "keeping one's nature intact, protecting one's uniqueness, and not letting the body be tied by other things."&lt;ref name="stal"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Overcoming our evil: human nature and spiritual exercises in Xunzi and Augustine | year = 2006 | last = Stalnaker | first = Aaron |publisher = [[Georgetown University Press]] | isbn = 978-1-58901-094-9|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreeing with the Confucian virtues of ''[[Li (Confucianism)|li]]'' (propriety), ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' (humaneness), and ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]]'' (righteousness) and the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] virtue of ''fa'' (law), the Yangists saw ''wei wo'', or "everything for myself," as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.&lt;ref name="senghaas"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual pleasure is considered desirable, like in [[hedonism]], but not at the expense of the health of individual.&lt;ref name="deutsch"/&gt; The Yangists saw individual well-being as the prime purpose of life, and considered anything that hindered that well-being immoral and unnecessary.&lt;ref name="deutsch"/&gt;

The main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of ''xing'', or human nature,&lt;ref name="readings1"/&gt; a term later incorporated by [[Mencius]] into [[Confucianism]]. The ''xing'', according to sinologist [[A. C. Graham]], is a person's "proper course of development" in life. Individuals can only rationally care for their own ''xing'', and should not naively have to support the ''xing'' of other people, even if it means opposing the emperor.&lt;ref name="stal"/&gt; In this sense, Yangism is a "direct attack" on Confucianism, by implying that the power of the emperor, defended in Confucianism, is baseless and destructive, and that [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]] is morally flawed.&lt;ref name="stal"/&gt;

The Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]] depicts Yangism as the direct opposite of Mohism, while Mohism promotes the idea of universal love and impartial caring, the Yangists acted only "for themselves," rejecting the [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]] of Mohism.&lt;ref name="readings2"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Readings in classical Chinese philosophy | year = 2005 | last =Ivanhoe | first = P.J. | last2= Van Norden | first2= Bryan William |publisher = [[Hackett Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-87220-780-6|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the Yangists as selfish, ignoring the duty of serving the public and caring only for personal concerns.&lt;ref name="deutsch"&gt;{{Cite book| title = A companion to world philosophies | year = 1999 | last =Bontekoe | first = Ronald | last2= Deutsch | first2= Eliot |publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | isbn = 978-0-631-21327-7|pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mencius saw Confucianism as the "[[Doctrine of the mean|Middle Way]]" between [[Mohism]] and Yangism.&lt;ref name="mencius2"/&gt;

==Influence on later beliefs==
{{Hedonism}}
Mencius incorporated the Yangist concept of ''xing'' into his own philosophy. Some sinologists have argued that Yangism influenced [[Taoism]], and can be seen as a "precursor" to later Taoist beliefs.&lt;ref name="deutsch"/&gt;
