'''''100,000,000 Guinea Pigs: Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics''''' is a book written by [[Arthur Kallet]] and [[F.J. Schlink]] first released in 1933 by the [[Vanguard Press]] and manufactured in the United States of America. Its central argument propounds that the American population is being used as [[guinea pigs]] in a giant experiment undertaken by the American producers of food stuffs and [[patent medicines]] and the like. Kallet and Schlink premise the book as being “written in the interest of the consumer, who does not yet realize that he is being used as a guinea pig…”

==Summary==
The book's key proposition is that a significant portion of the products sold to the [[general public|public]]—particularly [[pharmaceuticals]] and food products—are released with little regard for or knowledge of how these products adversely affect the consumer. [[Corporations]], often knowingly, release products which either do not do what they purport to do, or have dangerous side effects or defects. Furthermore, many officials and government departments, namely, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], have fallen victim to [[regulatory capture]].

The book goes on to state that the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906 is not effective in arresting these trends, and real reform or [[consumer protection]] is obstructed by the powerful connections that offending corporations have with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kallet, A &amp; Schlink, F: "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs", Ch 1. Vanguard Press, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the [[poison]] is such that it acts slowly and insidiously, perhaps over a long period of years (and several such will be considered in later chapters), then we poor consumers must be test animals all our lives; and when, in the end, the experiment kills us a year or ten years sooner than otherwise we would have died, no conclusions can be drawn and a hundred million others are available for further tests.&lt;ref&gt;Kallet, A &amp; Schlink, F: "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs", pp 13. Vanguard Press, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors develop ideas such as [[synergy]] effects, and the [[precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[substitution principle (sustainability)|substitution principle]]s. They claim that many toxic substances, even in low concentrations, can act together to cause much more harmful effects than each substance would individually. Prolonged exposure to low amounts of toxic substances, even at very mild concentrations, can potentially have serious negative health impacts that consumers are not made aware of. These impacts are felt by all consumers because harmful substances are being ingested by consumers because of the use of dangerous [[pesticides]], [[herbicides]] and other chemicals in [[food production]]. Preservatives are particularly criticized, and the increase in canned or packaged foods is cited as evidence of an increasing risk of such synergy effects because of the large amount of chemical [[byproducts]] these products include.

The book argues that many products would not be sold if properly labeled, and this failure to police product labeling has been a key failing of the Food and Drug Administration. Extensive [[reform]] and overhaul in government [[regulation]] and [[inspection]] of the food and drug industry is needed in order to adequately protect consumers from corporations and manufacturers who do not place the health of the [[consumer]] before [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Examples cited include [[beauty products]], which in the first quarter of the 20th century were found to contain [[arsenic]], [[lead]] and even [[radium]], the health effects of which were not understood or known to consumers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kallet, A &amp; Schlink, F: "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs", Ch 5. Vanguard Press, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The true label for a [[pineapple]] pie, they argue, would be closer to this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Corn starch]]-filled, [[glucose]]-sweetened pie with made with sub-standard canned [[pineapple]], [[artificial flavor|artificial]] ([[citric acid]]) lemon flavor and artificial [[food coloring|coal tar color]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kallet, A &amp; Schlink, F: "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs", Ch 2. Vanguard Press, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book takes particular aim at the [[pharmaceutical]] market in the United States during the period, citing extensive lists of drugs which are often the subject of very strong and widespread campaigns of media promotion as "wonder-drugs," yet which do not have any effect on the conditions they purport to cure, and often carry with them serious [[side effects]] that are not revealed to consumers. The authors claim that advertising for these drugs is deliberately misleading and uses a variety of dishonest techniques from false testimonials to fake experts. The authors also question the value of statements made by scientists who vouch for the safety of products, citing the example of a dean of the College of Pharmacy of Columbia University who had vouched for the safety of a drug that later proved fatal to many.&lt;ref&gt;Kallet, A &amp; Schlink, F: "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs", Ch 4-9. Vanguard Press, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final [[analysis]], the authors encourage consumers to be more active and questioning in their purchasing habits. Consumers should be vigilant in finding out more information about products and [[ingredients]], and [[boycotting]] producers and their products that contain dangerous ingredients. They also call for stronger laws, tougher [[sanctions (law)|penalties]] for offending companies, and a much more concerted effort from authorities to implement consumer protection laws. The book concludes with the statement that "Above all, let your voice be heard loudly and often, in protest against indifference, ignorance, and avarice responsible for the uncontrolled [[adulteration]] and misrepresentation of foods, drugs, and cosmetics."&lt;ref&gt;Kallet, A &amp; Schlink, F: "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs", Ch 13. Vanguard Press, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book proved to be extremely popular and a national [[bestseller]] in the years immediately following its release, and at least 13 printings of the book were published in the first six months of [[publication]]. Public reaction to the book was very strong. Many people were shocked at the extent of [[food contamination]] and drug [[side-effects]], and ''100,000,000 Guinea Pigs'', along with several other books of a similar nature, were published during a period when a new [[consumer activism|consumer movement]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. "The Ergot Controversy: Prologue to the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act" ''[[J Hist Med Allied Sci]]'' 1968; XXIII: 248-257&lt;/ref&gt; It is often cited, along with ''[[American Chamber of Horrors]]'' by [[Ruth De Forest Lamb]], as being one of the key catalysts for increased government regulation over food and drugs in the United States which led to the passage in 1938 of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/histor1a.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216135613/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/histor1a.html |archive-date=December 16, 2007 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df=mdy-all }}. Centre for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mannion, M. [http://www.mindshiftinstitute.org/articles/frankenstein.htm "Frankenstein Foods"] ''The Journal of the Mindshift Institute'', Vol.4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also the subject of strong opposition from several quarters—not just vested interests such as the drug companies, but also from the medical fraternity. The book was frequently criticized for being sensational propaganda, and many at the time questioned the credentials of the authors (both engineers) and the accuracy of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;Kyrk, H. ''The Journal of Business of the University of Chicago'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Oct., 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Several professionals in the medical industry also pointed to the unscientific and spurious conclusions reached, with one commenting on "data fantastically exploited and erroneously interpreted," "extreme and unrealistic conclusion[s]" and "authors with technical qualifications more pronounced in the art of sensationalism than [in] the sciences of biology, chemistry, or public health."&lt;ref&gt;Tobey, J. ''[[Am J Public Health]]''. 1933 May; 23(5): 530–531&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many of the authors' scientific conclusions are indeed thought to have been mistaken. For example, they claimed that [[bran]] ([[roughage]]) has many negative effects on the [[intestine]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; which contradicts today's view that bran in moderation is beneficial to the [[intestines]].

However, it still remains an influential book on the topic of [[consumer affairs]]. Nearly forty years later, in 1972, [[John G. Fuller]] published his expose of the food, drug and cosmetic industries, honoring Kallet and Schlink by entitling his book ''200,000,000 Guinea Pigs: New Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics''. In the Introduction, Fuller wrote, "Today, nearly forty years later, the situation is worse, not better. … Time bombs are ticking away in several dark corners. … It is 1933 all over again—multiplied by logarithms. The difference is only a matter of form."

'''Abortion in Sweden''' was first legislated by the Abortion Act of 1938.&lt;ref name="NB2009"&gt;''[http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/18031/2010-5-12.pdf Official Statistics of Sweden: Statistics – Health and Medical Care: Induced abortions 2009]'' (2010) [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]. {{ISBN|978-91-86585-24-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stated that an [[abortion]] could be legally performed in [[Sweden]] upon [[medicine|medical]], [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]], or [[eugenics|eugenical]] grounds. That is, if the [[pregnancy]] constituted a serious threat to the woman's life, if she had been impregnated by [[rape]], or if there was a considerable chance that any serious [[congenital disorder|condition]] might be inherited by her child, she could request an abortion. The law was later augmented in 1946 to include socio-medical grounds and again in 1963 to include the risk of serious fetal damage. A committee investigated whether these conditions were met in each individual case and, as a result of this prolonged process, abortion was often not granted until the middle of the second [[wiktionary:trimester|trimester]]. As such, a new law was created in 1974, stating that the choice of an abortion is entirely up to the woman until the end of the eighteenth week. &lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt;

==Legislation==
===Current===
The current legislation is the Abortion Act of 1974 ([[Swedish Code of Statutes|SFS]] 1974:595). This states that up until the end of the eighteenth week of the pregnancy, the choice of an abortion is entirely up to the woman, for any reason whatsoever. After the 18th, a woman needs a permission from the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] (''Socialstyrelsen'') to have an abortion. Permission for these late abortions is usually granted for cases in which the fetus or mother are unhealthy. Abortion is not allowed if the fetus is viable, which generally means that abortions after the [[Prenatal Development|22nd week]] are not allowed. However, abortions after the 22nd week may be allowed in the rare cases where the fetus can not survive outside the womb even if it is carried to term.&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/9357/2006-1-3_200613.pdf Socialstyrelsens meddelandeblad: ''Rättsliga rådets behandling av abortärenden m.m.'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is largely settled in Sweden, and the question of the legality of abortion is not a highly controversial political issue.&lt;ref name="Pew"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/Abortion-Laws-Around-the-World.aspx Pew Forum: Abortion Laws Around the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensus in Sweden is in favour of preventing unwanted pregnancies by the use of [[birth control]] and the primary goal is not to lower the amount of abortions, but rather the goal is that all children that are born should be wanted. The number of abortions statistically follows the number of pregnancies. In comparison with the other [[nordic countries]], Sweden ranks high in number of abortions, and low in number of [[Teenage pregnancy|young parents]], while the number of pregnancies in relation to total population is largely the same in all nordic countries.&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lindahl |first=Katarina |encyclopedia=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |title=Aborter i Sverige [Abortion in Sweden] |language=Swedish |publisher=Bra Böcker }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first law on legal abortions was passed in Sweden in 1938 when the law legalized abortion on a very limited scale, and only on serious medical consideration, after evaluation by the Royal Board of Health. From 1946 abortions could also be permitted on [[Social medicine|social medicinal]] grounds. During the 1960s, a successive change in Swedish society took place, and the general attitude towards [[human sexuality|sexuality]], as well as abortion, became more liberal. This, among other things, led to an increase in the number of permitted abortions.&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt; 

The current Abortion Act (SFS 1974:595 with later amendments in 1995 and 2007) entered into force on 1 January 1975. It permits abortion on the request of the pregnant woman until the 18th week, and thereafter only in cases of severe indications of medical risk. After the 18th week, abortions can only be performed after an evaluation by the National Board of Health and Welfare.&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt;

In 1989, the Board issued general advice on implementation of the law (SOSFS 1989:6). From 1 September 2004, these were superseded by new advice and policy (SOSFS 2004:4).&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt;

Since 1 January 2008, foreign women - including [[right of asylum|asylum]] applicants, non-permanent residents, and those not [[Population registration in Sweden|registered]] in Sweden - are allowed to get an abortion in the country. 132 such abortions were performed in Sweden during 2009. The National Board of Health and Welfare called this a comparably small figure, in relation to the total number of abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/pressrum/nyhetsarkiv/abortrapport |title=Rapport om utländska kvinnors aborter i Sverige 2009 |date=23 February 2010 |publisher=National Board of Health and Welfare |accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] is the central national authority for social services, public health, and the health services in Sweden. Among the board's responsibilities are evaluation and monitoring of abortions performed in Sweden, as well as establishing norms by issuing provisions and general advice. The board is also responsible for the collection and publishing of official national statistics on abortions. Until 1995 reports were instead published by [[Statistics Sweden]].&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt; 

Statistical reports are published yearly and are based on data from all clinics and hospitals where abortions are performed. Data is collected on the age of the women, earlier pregnancies and abortions, the length of the pregnancy at the time of abortion, method of abortion, and where the abortion was performed.

One of the National Health Board's main purposes with these reports is to measure changes and trends over time. The statistics on legal abortions stretches back to 1955 and, starting from 1975, data on frequencies for different age groups are available. From 1985 the women's home [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] was also recorded.

===Trends===
The number of induced abortions performed in Sweden rose markedly on a yearly basis from the early 1960s, but soon leveled off following the liberalization of the abortion law in 1975. It is not possible to tell whether the increase in the statistics after the Abortion Act of 1974 reflects actual circumstances, or just [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] resulting from an increased will to report abortions after legalization. Since 1975, the total yearly number of cases has averaged between 30,000 and 38,000 abortions.&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt; 
 
The number of abortions by age group were as follows: those performed on teenagers in 1975 were 30 in every 1,000, while those performed on women aged 20 to 24 years old was 27 in every 1,000. However, since 1977, the opposite has held true, with fewer abortions being performed on teenagers than women aged 20 to 24. The number of abortions among teenagers was around 12 per 1,000 women in 2017, a halving since 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most abortions in Sweden are performed on women aged 25–29 years old, followed in order by the age groups 20–24 years old, 30–34 years old, 35–39 years old,  15–19 years old (teenage abortions), and 40–44 years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before the age of thirty most women have not established a family life and abortion is more common amongst this age group, with [[multiple sex partners]] in the younger age groups parenthood is less desired and abortion more likely.&lt;ref name="NE" /&gt; The fact that most women in the younger age groups are still studying, combined with them being new on the labour market, influences the choice to perform abortion.&lt;ref name="NE" /&gt;

Although abortion rates vary widely in Sweden, according to geographical region, the highest rate of teenage abortions is registered in [[Gotland]] and in the metropolitan areas of [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The lowest incidences are in the [[Counties of Sweden|counties]] of [[Blekinge]], [[Kronoberg]], and [[Jönköping]].&lt;ref name="NB2009"/&gt;

In 2017, 84 percent of the induced abortions were performed before the end of the 9th week of pregnancy and 55 percent before the end of the 7th week, compared to 45 and 4 percent respectively in 1991. The proportion of medical abortions constituted 93 percent of all abortions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/20973/2018-5-17.pdf|title=Statistik om aborter 2017|last=|first=|date=2018-05-21|website=|publisher=[[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]|language=sv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Albanian Red Cross''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kryqi i Kuq Shqiptar, KKSH''), or '''ARC''', is the national society member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] for [[Albania]]. The oldest humanitarian organization in Albania, it was founded on October 4, 1921, and was officially recognized by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] in 1923.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kksh.org.al/historik-i-kksh-se/|title=Historik i KKSH-se|last=|first=|date=|website=Kryqit të Kuq Shqiptar|publisher=|language=Albanian|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[headquarters]] are located in the Albanian capital of [[Tirana]], and its 39 branches provide humanitarian assistance across the country in accordance with the [[Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Fundamental Principles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kksh.org.al/kontakte/|title=Kontakte|last=|first=|date=|website=Kryqit të Kuq Shqiptar|publisher=|language=Albanian|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The first activity of the Red Cross Movement in Albania was in 1920, when aid from the [[American Red Cross]] was distributed at the rear of the [[Albanian Armed Forces|Albanian Army]]. On October 4, 1921, the Albanian Red Cross Society was founded and the organization's first statutes were accepted in 1922. In its first year, it began publishing a magazine, took over the operations of an orphanage, and assisted refugees from the surrounding region. In 1923, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] officially recognized the Albanian Red Cross, making it the 38th national society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1920s - 1940s ===
Throughout the second half of the 1920s and the 1930s, the Albanian Red Cross expanded its coverage across Albania. It opened a nursing school, training nurses to serve the poorest and most vulnerable of the population. With the French Red Cross, it established counseling and milk distribution programs for undernourished children. During this period, the organization's activities were funded by charitable donations from the Albanian people, with significant support coming from the [[Albanian diaspora]], particularly from the United States.

During [[World War II]], the main activities of the Albanian Red Cross was at the [[Greco-Italian War]] front. It established and operated a field hospital at the front, and also opened an office to assist displaced populations in searching for missing family members. In the immediate post-war years, the Albanian Red Cross distributed food, clothing, and cash to those struggling to rebuild. Shelters were set up in major cities for the elderly.

As the new [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist government]] began its socialist reconstruction of the country, the activities of the Albanian Red Cross adapted to fit this new direction. The late 1940s were a period of rapid industrialization, and the Albanian Red Cross began teaching first aid courses at workplaces and construction sites, opening a hospital to treat workers building the Durrës-Elbasan railway. It also opened two nurseries to aid working women, five orphanages, and a nursing home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1950 - 1990 ===
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Albanian Red Cross slowly began to be influenced by other organizations of the same name in [[Eastern Europe]] that had become ''de facto'' agents of government propaganda for national health programs rather than independent humanitarian organizations as the statutes and principles of the Red Cross Movement intended. By 1969, the majority of the Albanian Red Cross activities were carried out by the state, which resulted in the halt of all practical programs.

From 1969-1990, the Albanian Red Cross did not operate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1991 - Present ===
In 1991, the Albanian Red Cross was reborn as a new organization and began again operating. The Albanian government ratified the [[Geneva Protocol]]s in 1993, and in 1994, the Albanian Red Cross was granted official status. It has since grown into the largest humanitarian organization in Albania and has developed its capacity in multiple areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Status ==
The Albanian Red Cross was recognized by the [[Parliament of Albania|Albanian Parliament]] as an independent volunteer humanitarian organization under Law No. 7864 on September 29, 1994. As a member of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]], it is guided by the [[Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Fundamental Principles]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It is the sole Red Cross society for [[Albania]]. The Albanian government may grant budgetary funds to the Albanian Red Cross to carry out specific humanitarian activities. It does not pay tax.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Albania.

The '''American Student Dental Association''' ('''ASDA''') is a national student-run organization that attempts to protect and advance the rights, interests, and welfare of students pursuing careers in [[dentistry]]. It introduces students to lifelong involvement in organized [[dentistry]] and provides services, information, education, recreation, representation and limited amounts of advocacy.

ASDA was established to connect, support and advance the needs of dental students. ASDA represents 90 percent of all students from 66 [[List of dental schools in the United States|U.S. dental schools]]. Since 2011, dental student membership has averaged more than 19,000. ASDA also welcomes hundreds of predental students each year.

==The early years==
In 1969, university students across the country staged demonstrations to protest the [[Vietnam War]], restrictive school policies, dress codes and more. Dental school admission criteria became more selective and the competition for acceptance into dental schools increased. The resulting student profile was a brighter, more socially aware individual with diverse interests and talents.

However, at this time dental school could be likened to boot camp. In fact, many instructors were indeed retired military officers. Students were told how long to wear their hair and sideburns. Some schools even had fingernail inspections. Only a handful of women and minority students could be found in dental school. To make matters worse, no system of due process existed, which meant students could be expelled with no available recourse for help. With a multitude of issues building, the solution presented itself-dental students needed to organize.

===The initial step===
That year the federal government offered the Student American Medical Association (SAMA) a $1 million grant to coordinate student involvement in the [[Appalachia Service Project|Appalachia Project]] and the American Indian Health Program. Dentistry was the only health care discipline without its own national student organization. In order to receive the grant for the project, SAMA needed dental students to organize.

The presidents of SAMA (now known as the [[American Medical Student Association]]) and the Student American Pharmacy Association both attended the [[University of California at San Francisco]]. They approached Dennis Spain, a third year student at the university's dental school, to start a national association for dental students.

In January 1970, at a SAMA conference that included professional students of all disciplines, Spain met David Evaskus, a fourth year dental student at the [[University of Illinois]]. Impressed with the scope and depth of the projects in which the other student organizations were involved, Spain and Evaskus returned to their schools and began contacting dental school deans and students across the country.

Students held a meeting in Chicago Feb. 14-15, 1970, just prior to the midwinter meeting of the Chicago Dental Society. Although records indicate that 45 students from 26 dental schools participated, more dental schools may have been unofficially represented because several students came to the meeting without the approval of their schools' administrations. This assembly represented a new generation of dental students.

This new brand of leaders formed the Student American Dental Association (SADA), a national organization that would recruit students to serve in federal health care projects, function as an information clearinghouse on local student issues, coordinate student lobbying efforts and establish and promote student positions on professional issues. Members elected Dennis Spain, the event organizer, as board president. The newly established SADA planned to hold its first national convention and House of Delegates meeting in New York in October 1970.

===ASDA is born===
SADA wanted to maintain its independence but was unable to secure funding to support its planned national convention. At the same time, the [[American Dental Association]] began developing its own plans for student affairs to channel student requests to the appropriate ADA departments. Approved at the 1970 ADA Annual Session, one of the first activities was to help organize a dental student convention, which was later held Feb. 8-9, 1971.

The culmination of the conference was the formation of the American Student Dental Association (ASDA), a new national student dental organization. Its first president and other key officers were former SADA leaders. While this new organization had the ADA's approval and support, ASDA's guiding principles and leaders descended directly from the original student organization, SADA.

In its first year, ASDA participated in minority student recruitment, migratory worker health programs in several states and [[Indian Health Service]] programs. In addition, the association published a monthly newsletter and held regional conferences on issues concerning public health.

One of ASDA's earliest activities was the development of an advocacy program to respond to students' requests for support and assistance. ASDA's advocacy program helped students by either directing them to local sources of assistance, forwarding cases to the ADA Commission on Dental Accreditation, or simply shedding light on injustices through ASDA's newsletter.

In 1986, ASDA established its Political Education Network, composed of students who coordinate legislative activities and lobbying efforts at their dental schools. PEN monitored state and national legislative activities and organized political action at the grassroots level, such as letter-writing campaigns and voter registration drives. ASDA initiated its political advocacy network of dental students nearly 10 years before the
ADA created its grassroots network for dentists. In the fall of 2000, ASDA changed PEN's name to the Legislative Grassroots Network (LGN) to better reflect its purpose and efforts.

==The issues==

===A channel for dental student concerns===
ASDA is the largest national organization solely dedicated to dental student concerns. Structured as a network of chapters based at each of the 60+ dental schools in the United States and Puerto Rico, ASDA is uniquely geared to respond to its members at the local, regional and national levels.

Two delegates at each dental school chapter serve as voting members of the ASDA House of Delegates. Their role is to voice the concerns of their constituents to the House of Delegates for action in the form of resolutions. As a result of passed resolutions, ASDA publishes policy statements on several issues, including [[dental education]], [[National Board Dental Examination|licensure]], the rise in tuition cost for dental students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdanet.org/debt.aspx |title=Student Debt |publisher=Asdanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; dental research, midlevel providers and education financing. ASDA notifies groups or individuals, such as dental school deans, dental associations, state boards of dentistry and lawmakers, of its position on particular issues.

===Capturing support of legislators===
In 1999, ASDA and the [[American Dental Education Association]] hosted the first [http://www.asdanet.org/lobbyday/ National Dental Student Lobby Day]. Each year since then, students have gathered in Washington, D.C. to actively lobby members of Congress. This unique experience provides ASDA members an opportunity to meet with their legislators and advocate for their profession.

Recent issues that ASDA has lobbied for:
* Funding for the [[National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research]] and the National Institutes of Health
* Dental Emergency Responder Act of 2011
* Student Loan Interest Deduction
* [[Meth Mouth]] Prevention and Community Recovery Act
* Dental Licensure Reform

===Dental licensure reform===
ASDA supports the universal acceptance of all regional and state clinical licensing examinations. ASDA is leading the charge for the elimination of live patient exams to protect the public and ethical integrity of the profession. Our efforts to reach out to
state dental associations to encourage them to adopt similar policies have been successful.

In 2010, bill AB 1524 was passed in California recognizing licensure by portfolio. This innovative approach to licensure opens up opportunities in other states. The ADA has created a workgroup to develop a portfolio-style examination for the purpose of initial dental licensure. An ASDA representative is a member of the task force assigned to this project.

===Barriers to care===
Oral health can only be of benefit to those who have the ability to access it. In America and beyond, barriers to care remain. Whether it's financial barriers, disabilities, geographical isolation or their dental health is relatively forgotten under a myriad of other health needs, patients are left with serious conditions that threaten their overall health and quality of life. These patients may need transportation, oral health education or financial incentives in order to access their dental needs. Often education, language, cultural or ethnic barriers only add to their unfortunate situation.

One potential solution is the expanded function of dental auxiliaries. ASDA endorses expanded functions for dental auxiliaries only when each has received the appropriate education and training to guarantee competence with proper supervision of a trained dentist, and when such functions fall within the laws established by their respective state of employment. Because of the comprehensive education and training requirements for dentists, ASDA believes that only dentists should perform irreversible procedures and prescribe medications.

==Legislation==

===Governance===
ASDA is governed by 130 delegates (two students from each of its 65 dental school chapters). Chapters are grouped into 11 districts, each guided by an elected trustee. Each year, the delegates elect a president, two vice presidents and a Speaker of the House of Delegates. ASDA also has councils that guide the organization's work in a number of key areas.

===Adopted resolutions===
A [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] is a formal request or action that is presented to the House of Delegates for consideration. Delegates present discussion for or against a specific resolution, then the house votes to determine the outcome.

==The future==
ASDA has grown into a strong, well-respected and influential organization. Today more than 88 percent of all dental students join the association, thanks in part to automatic enrollment at many schools. ASDA will continue attempting to provide its members the support and services they need to meet the future with confidence.

In anatomy the '''apical foramen''' is the opening at the apex of the [[Cementum|root]] of a [[tooth]], through which the [[nerve]] and [[blood vessels]] that supply the [[dental pulp]] pass. Thus it represents the junction of the pulp and the [[periodontal]] tissue.

The average size of the orifice is 0.3 to 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. There can be two or more foramina separated by a portion of dentin and [[cementum]] or by cementum only. If more than one foramen is present on each root, the largest one is designated as the apical foramen and the rest are considered accessory foramina.

It is a point of interest in [[endodontics]], as it is considered necessary to thoroughly chemomechanically [[debride]] the pulp space to remove all [[necrotic tissue]] and minimise [[bacterial load]] in the [[pulp space]]. Ideally this debridement would terminate exactly at the apical foramen. In reality determining the exact position of the apical foramen is problematic, requiring [[radiography]] and/or use of an [[electronic apex locator]] to produce a refined estimate. A tooth may have multiple small accessory canals in the root apex area forming an [[apical delta]] which can complicate the endodontic problem.

An [[Apical constriction (dentistry)|apical constriction]] is often present. In immature teeth the root is not fully formed leading to an [[open apex]]. This is also seen in some pathological teeth.

A '''root end surgery''', also known as '''apicoectomy''' (''[[wikt:apico-|apico-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ectomy|-ectomy]]''), '''root resection''', '''retrograde root canal treatment''' (''c.f.'' [[root canal therapy|orthograde root canal treatment]]) or '''root-end filling''', is an [[endodontic]] [[surgical procedure]] whereby a [[tooth]]'s root tip is removed and a root end cavity is prepared and filled with a [[biocompatible]] material.

[[Microsurgical endodontics]]—dental surgery using a microscope—may be performed.

This is usually necessitated when a conventional [[root canal]] therapy had failed and a re-treatment was already unsuccessful or is not advised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2007|title=Endodontic Microsurgery|journal=Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry|publisher=Aegis Communications|issn=1548-8578}}&lt;/ref&gt; State-of-the-art procedures make use of microsurgical techniques, such as a dental [[operating microscope]], micro instruments, ultrasonic preparation tips and calcium-silicate based filling materials.

Removal of the root tip is indicated to remove the entire [[apical delta]] ensuring no uncleaned missed anatomy.

Extraction may be the only alternative. Where necessary prosthetic replacement with a [[denture]], [[dental bridge]] or [[dental implant]] may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beautysetter.com/dental-implant-cost Dental Implant Cost Guide | What you absolutely must know]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials Used ==
The primary aim of any endodontic treatment is to disinfect the root canal system in order to reduce the bacterial load as much as possible, and to seal the system to prevent ingress or egress of bacteria or their byproducts. Failure is often due to leakage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Minju|last2=Kim|first2=Hyeon-Cheol|last3=Lee|first3=Woocheol|last4=Kim|first4=Euiseong|title=Analysis of the Cause of Failure in Nonsurgical Endodontic Treatment by Microscopic Inspection during Endodontic Microsurgery|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2011.06.032|journal=Journal of Endodontics|volume=37|issue=11|pages=1516–1519|doi=10.1016/j.joen.2011.06.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore any materials used to seal the end of the root must provide a good seal. It is also important that they are biocompatible; that is, that they are non-carcinogenic and non-toxic to the surrounding tissues or the body as a whole. They must also be stable in moisture and at body temperature. It is beneficial if they are easy to handle, as they are placed in small amounts under technically demanding conditions, and if they are easily identified on radiographs (i.e. radio-opaque).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Bradford R.|title=Considerations in the selection of a root-end filling material|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1079-2104(99)70237-4|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontology|volume=87|issue=4|pages=398–404|doi=10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70237-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a list of some of the commonly used root-end filling materials. This list is by no means exhaustive.

=== Amalgam ===
Amalgam is widely used as a root-end filling, and meets many of the desired criteria. It is easy to handle, easy to see on radiographs, not sensitive to moisture, and stable at body temperature. Amalgam provides a relatively good seal if placed correctly.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasudev SK et al.|year=2003|title=Root end filling materials - A review|url=http://medind.nic.in/eaa/t03/i2/eaat03i2p12.pdf|journal=Endodontology|volume=15|pages=12–18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some concerns about toxicity, as amalgam contains mercury as an ingredient, but there is very little evidence to support these.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Composite Resin ===
Composite resin is commonly used as a filling material due to its aesthetic qualities and ability to effectively bond to tooth structure, especially enamel. It is less commonly used as a root-end filling material, as its placement is technique sensitive, particularly to moisture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moisture contamination will result in a weakened bond that is very susceptible to leakage and subsequent failure. There is some evidence that, when placed correctly, composite resin can produce high success rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) ===
MTA is a cement containing mineral oxides which absorb water to form a colloidal gel, which solidifies over a period of approximately 4 hours. It has proven very popular as a root-end filling material and has shown generally high success rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MTA produces a high pH environment, which is bactericidal, and may stimulate osteoblasts to produce bone to fill in any defects caused by infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naik|first=ReshmaM|last2=Pudakalkatti|first2=PushpaS|last3=Hattarki|first3=SanjeeviniA|date=2014-01-01|title=Can MTA be: Miracle trioxide aggregate?|url=http://www.jisponline.com/text.asp?2014/18/1/5/128190|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.4103/0972-124x.128190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinc Oxide Eugenol Cement ===
Modified versions of ZOE cement, such as IRM or Super EBA, have high compressive strength, high tensile strength, neutral pH, and low solubility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Success Rates ==
Reported success rates for apicoectomy vary widely. Studies generally focus on one material or method of treatment compared to another, so it can be difficult to obtain any good evidence on the overall success rate. A meta-analysis published in 2010 indicated an overall success rate of 85-95% for surgical endodontic treatment using a modern technique, with the evidence level rated high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsesis|first=Igor|last2=Faivishevsky|first2=Vadim|last3=Kfir|first3=Anda|last4=Rosen|first4=Eyal|title=Outcome of Surgical Endodontic Treatment Performed by a Modern Technique: A Meta-analysis of Literature|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2009.07.025|journal=Journal of Endodontics|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1505–1511|doi=10.1016/j.joen.2009.07.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar systematic review published in 2009 suggested an overall success rate of 77.8% for surgical endodontic treatment at 2–4 years, falling to 71.8% at 4–6 years, and 62.9% at 6+ years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torabinejad|first=Mahmoud|last2=Corr|first2=Robert|last3=Handysides|first3=Robert|last4=Shabahang|first4=Shahrokh|title=Outcomes of Nonsurgical Retreatment and Endodontic Surgery: A Systematic Review|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2009.04.023|journal=Journal of Endodontics|volume=35|issue=7|pages=930–937|doi=10.1016/j.joen.2009.04.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many factors which will affect the likelihood of success of apicoectomy. If performed correctly, it can be highly successful in preventing loss of teeth which would otherwise be extracted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9843">The '''average treatment effect (ATE)''' is a measure used to compare treatments (or interventions) in randomized experiments, evaluation of policy interventions, and medical trials. The ATE measures the difference in [[mean]] (average) outcomes between units assigned to the treatment and units assigned to the control.  In a [[randomized trial]] (i.e., an experimental study), the average treatment effect can be [[Estimator|estimated]] from a sample using a comparison in mean outcomes for treated and untreated units. However, the ATE is generally understood as a [[causal]] parameter (i.e., an estimate or property of a [[Statistical population|population]]) that a researcher desires to know, defined without reference to the [[study design]] or estimation procedure. Both [[Observational study|observational]] studies and experimental study designs with random assignment may enable one to estimate an ATE in a variety of ways.

== General definition ==

Originating from early statistical analysis in the fields of agriculture and medicine, the term "treatment" is now applied, more generally, to other fields of natural and social science, especially [[psychology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] such as, for example, the evaluation of the impact of public policies. The nature of a treatment or outcome is relatively unimportant in the estimation of the ATE—that is to say, calculation of the ATE requires that a treatment be applied to some units and not others, but the nature of that treatment (e.g., a pharmaceutical, an incentive payment, a political advertisement) is irrelevant to the definition and estimation of the ATE.

The expression "treatment effect" refers to the causal effect of a given treatment or intervention (for example, the administering of a drug) on an outcome variable of interest (for example, the health of the patient). In the [[Rubin causal model|Neyman-Rubin "Potential Outcomes Framework"]] of [[causality]] a treatment effect is defined for each individual unit in terms of two "potential outcomes." Each unit has one outcome that would manifest if the unit were exposed to the treatment and another outcome that would manifest if the unit were exposed to the control. The "treatment effect" is the difference between these two potential outcomes. However, this individual-level treatment effect is unobservable because individual units can only receive the treatment or the control, but not both. [[Random assignment]] to treatment ensures that units assigned to the treatment and units assigned to the control are identical (over a large number of iterations of the experiment). Indeed, units in both groups have identical [[Probability distribution|distributions]] of [[covariate]]s and potential outcomes. Thus the average outcome among the treatment units serves as a [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] for the average outcome among the control units. The differences between these two averages is the ATE, which is an estimate of the [[central tendency]] of the distribution of unobservable individual-level treatment effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holland |first=Paul W. |year=1986 |title=Statistics and Causal Inference |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association|J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.]] |volume=81 |issue=396 |pages=945–960 |jstor=2289064 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1986.10478354}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a sample is randomly constituted from a population, the ATE from the sample (the SATE) is also an estimate of the population ATE (or PATE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Imai |first=Kosuke |first2=Gary |last2=King |first3=Elizabeth A. |last3=Stuart |year=2008 |title=Misunderstandings Between Experimentalists and Observationalists About Causal Inference |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A|J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. A]] |volume=171 |issue=2 |pages=481–502 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2007.00527.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an [[experiment]] ensures, in [[Law of large numbers|expectation]], that potential outcomes (and all covariates) are equivalently distributed in the treatment and control groups, this is not the case in an [[observational study]]. In an observational study, units are not assigned to treatment and control randomly, so their assignment to treatment may depend on unobserved or unobservable factors. Observed factors can be statistically controlled (e.g., through [[regression analysis|regression]] or [[Matching (statistics)|matching]]), but any estimate of the ATE could be [[confounding|confounded]] by unobservable factors that influenced which units received the treatment versus the control.

== Formal definition ==

In order to define formally the ATE, we define two potential outcomes : &lt;math&gt;y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the outcome variable for individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if he is not treated, &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the outcome variable for individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if
he is treated. For example, &lt;math&gt;y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt;  is the health status of the individual if he is not administered the drug under study and &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}&lt;/math&gt; is the health status if he is administered the drug.

The treatment effect for individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}-y_{0i}=\beta_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. In the general case, there is no reason to expect this effect to be constant across individuals.

Let &lt;math&gt;E[.]&lt;/math&gt; denote the expectation operator for any given variable (that is, the average value of the variable across the whole population of interest). The Average treatment effects is given by: &lt;math&gt;E[y_{1i}-y_{0i}]&lt;/math&gt;.

If we could observe, for each individual, &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; among a large representative sample of the population, we could estimate the ATE simply by taking the average value of &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}-y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; for the sample: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N (y_{1i}-y_{0i})&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the sample).

The problem is that we can not observe both &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; for each individual. For example, in the drug example, we can only observe  &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}&lt;/math&gt; for individuals who have received the drug and &lt;math&gt;y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; for those who did not receive it; we do not observe &lt;math&gt;y_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; for treated individuals and &lt;math&gt;y_{1i}&lt;/math&gt; for untreated ones. This fact is the main problem faced by scientists in the evaluation of treatment effects and has triggered a large body of estimation techniques.

== Estimation ==

Depending on the data and its underlying circumstances, many methods can be used to estimate the ATE. The most common ones are
* [[Natural experiment]] and the similar [[quasi-experiment]],
* [[Difference in differences]] or its short version: diff-in-diffs,
* the [[Regression discontinuity design]] method,
* [[Paired difference test|matching method]],
* methods based on the theory of [[local IV]]s (in a strict sense regression discontinuity design belongs here as well)

Once a policy change occurs on a population, a [[Regression analysis|regression]] can be run controlling for the treatment. The resulting equation would be
:&lt;math&gt; y = \Beta_{0} + \delta_{0}d2 + \Beta_{1}dT + \delta_{1}d2 \cdot dT ,&lt;/math&gt;
where y is the [[Dependent and independent variables|response variable]] and &lt;math&gt; \delta_{1} &lt;/math&gt; measures the effects of the policy change on the population.

The [[difference in differences]] equation would be
:&lt;math&gt; \hat \delta_{1} = (\bar y_{2,T} - \bar y_{1,T}) - (\bar y_{2,C} - \bar y_{1,C}) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where T is the treatment group and C is the control group. In this case the &lt;math&gt; \delta_{1} &lt;/math&gt; measures the effects of the treatment on the average outcome and is the '''average treatment effect'''.

From the diffs-in-diffs example we can see the main problems of estimating treatment effects. As we can not observe the same individual as treated and non-treated at the same time, we have to come up with a measure of counterfactuals to estimate the average treatment effect.

== An example ==
Consider an example where all units are unemployed individuals, and some experience a policy intervention (the treatment group), while others do not (the control group). The causal effect of interest is the impact a job search monitoring policy (the treatment) has on the length of an unemployment spell: On average, how much shorter would one's unemployment be if they experienced the intervention? The ATE, in this case, is the difference in expected values (means) of the treatment and control groups' length of unemployment.

A positive ATE, in this example, would suggest that the job policy increased the length of unemployment. A negative ATE would suggest that the job policy decreased the length of unemployment. An ATE estimate equal to zero would suggest that there was no advantage or disadvantage to providing the treatment in terms of the length of unemployment. Determining whether an ATE estimate is distinguishable from zero (either positively or negatively) requires [[statistical inference]].

Because the ATE is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment, a positive or negative ATE does not indicate that any particular individual would benefit or be harmed by the treatment. Thus the average treatment effect neglects the distribution of the treatment effect. Some parts of the population might be worse off with the treatment even if the mean effect is positive.

The '''C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich''' (German: '''C. G. Jung-Institut Zürich''') was founded in [[Küsnacht]], [[Switzerland]], in 1948 by the psychiatrist [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the founder of [[Analytical psychology]] (more commonly called Jungian psychology). [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] and [[Jolande Jacobi]] were also active in the foundation and early work of the institute.

The institute was founded in 1948 to provide training and conduct research in Analytical psychology and [[psychotherapy]]. Jung led the institute until 1961, the year of his death. The library of the institute holds around 15,000 books and periodicals related to [[Jungian psychology]].

Several other organizations named the C.G. Jung Institute exist around the world, e.g. in [[Los Angeles]].

'''Cardiotocography''' ('''CTG''') is a technical means of recording the [[fetal heartbeat]] and the [[uterine contractions]] during [[pregnancy]]. The machine used to perform the monitoring is called a '''cardiotocograph''', more commonly known as an '''electronic fetal monitor''' ('''EFM''').

Fetal monitoring was invented by Doctors Alan Bradfield, [[Orvan Hess]] and [[Edward Hon]].  A refined (antepartal, non-invasive, beat-to-beat) version (cardiotocograph) was later developed for [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett Packard]] by [[Konrad Hammacher]].

CTG monitoring is widely used to assess fetal wellbeing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grivell |first1=Rosalie M |last2=Alfirevic |first2=Zarko |last3=Gyte |first3=Gillian ML |last4=Devane |first4=Declan |last5=Grivell |first5=Rosalie M |title=Antenatal cardiotocography for fetal assessment |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD007863 |year=2015 |pmid=26363287 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007863.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review found that in the antenatal period (before labour) there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring women with high-risk pregnancies benefits the mother or baby although research around this is old and should be interpreted with caution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The same review found that computerised CTG machines resulted in lower numbers of baby deaths than the traditional CTG machines (as shown in picture). More up-to-date research is needed to provide more information around this practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

CTG monitoring can sometimes lead to medical interventions which are not necessarily needed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation (sound played to the unborn baby through the mother’s abdomen) has been used to provoke the baby into being more active.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tan |first1=Kelvin H |last2=Smyth |first2=Rebecca MD |last3=Wei |first3=Xing |last4=Tan |first4=Kelvin H |title=Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation for facilitation of tests of fetal wellbeing |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=12 |pages=CD002963 |year=2013 |pmid=24318543 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002963.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can improve their CTG monitoring so that the mother does not have to be monitored for as long.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However the safety of this technique has not been fully assessed; hearing impairment, stress reactions and other effects should be investigated before this technique is used widely.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Method ==
[[File:Cardiotocography diagram.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic explanation of cardiotocography: heart rate (A) is calculated from fetal heart motion determined by ultrasound, and uterine contractions are measured by a ''tocodynamometer'' (B). These numbers are represented on a time scale with the help of a running piece of paper, producing a graphical representation.]]
'''External cardiotocography''' can be used for continuous or intermittent monitoring. The fetal heart rate and the activity of the uterine muscle are detected by two transducers placed on the mother’s abdomen (one above the fetal heart, to monitor heart rate and the other at the [[Fundus (uterus)|fundus]] of the uterus to measure frequency of contractions). Doppler ultrasound provides the information which is recorded on a paper strip known as a cardiotocograph (CTG).&lt;ref name=alfirevic2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alfirevic|first=Zarko|last2=Devane|first2=Declan|last3=Gyte|first3=Gillian Ml|last4=Cuthbert|first4=Anna|date=3 February 2017|title=Continuous cardiotocography (CTG) as a form of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) for fetal assessment during labour|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD006066|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006066.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28157275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; External tocometry is useful in showing the beginning and end of contractions, as well as frequency, but not the strength of contractions. The absolute values of pressure readings on an external tocometer are dependent on position, and are not sensitive in people who are obese.&lt;ref name="Callahan 2013 p.43-47 "/&gt; In cases where information on the strength, or precise timing, of contractions is needed, an internal tocometer is more appropriate.&lt;ref name="Callahan 2013 p.43-47 "/&gt;

'''Internal cardiotocography''' uses an electronic transducer connected directly to the fetal scalp. A wire electrode is attached to the fetal scalp through the cervical opening and is connected to the monitor. This type of electrode is sometimes called a spiral or scalp electrode. Internal monitoring provides a more accurate and consistent transmission of the fetal heart rate than external monitoring because factors such as movement do not affect it. Internal monitoring may be used when external monitoring of the fetal heart rate is inadequate, or closer surveillance is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gynecology/external_and_internal_heart_rate_monitoring_of_the_fetus_92,P07776/|title=Types of Fetal Heart Monitoring|author=|date=|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal tocometry can only be used if membranes (fore-waters) have ruptured either spontaneously or artificially, and the cervix is open.  To gauge the strength of contractions, a small catheter (Intrauterine pressure catheter or IUPC) is passed into the uterus, past the fetus. Combined with an internal fetal monitor, an IUPC may give a more precise reading of the baby's heart rate and the strength of contractions.

A typical CTG reading is printed on paper and/or stored on a computer for later reference. A variety of systems for centralized viewing of CTG have been installed in a large number of maternity hospitals in industrialised countries, allowing simultaneous monitoring of multiple tracings in one or more locations. Display of maternal vital signs, ST signals and an electronic partogram are available in the majority of these systems. A few of them have incorporated computer analysis of cardiotocographic signals or combined cardiotocographic and ST data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nunes |first1=Inês |last2=Ayres-de-Campos |first2=Diogo |last3=Figueiredo |first3=Catarina |last4=Bernardes |first4=João |title=An overview of central fetal monitoring systems in labour |journal=Journal of Perinatal Medicine |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=93–9 |year=2013 |pmid=23093259 |doi=10.1515/jpm-2012-0067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pennmedicine.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=14&amp;pid=14&amp;gid=000138{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neilson |first1=J |title=Cardiotocography during labour |journal=BMJ |volume=306 |issue=6874 |pages=347–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8461676 |pmc=1676479 |doi=10.1136/bmj.306.6874.347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alfirevic2017 /&gt;

In the US, the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] sponsored a workshop to develop a standardized nomenclature for use in interpreting intrapartum fetal heart rate and uterine contraction patterns.  This nomenclature has been adopted by the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses ([[AWHONN]]), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ([[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]]), and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.&lt;ref name=nic&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macones |first1=George A. |last2=Hankins |first2=Gary D.V. |last3=Spong |first3=Catherine Y. |last4=Hauth |first4=John |last5=Moore |first5=Thomas |title=The 2008 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Workshop Report on Electronic Fetal Monitoring |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=661–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18757666 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181841395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation of a CTG tracing requires both qualitative and quantitative description of:
*Uterine activity (contractions)
*Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR)
*Baseline FHR variability
*Presence of accelerations
*Periodic or episodic decelerations
*Changes or trends of FHR patterns over time.

===Uterine activity===
There are several factors used in assessing uterine activity.  
*Frequency- the amount of time between the start of one contraction to the start of the next contraction.
*Duration- the amount of time from the start of a contraction to the end of the same contraction.
*Intensity- a measure of how strong a contraction is.  With external monitoring, this necessitates the use of palpation to determine relative strength.  With an IUPC, this is determined by assessing actual pressures as graphed on the paper.
*Resting Tone- a measure of how relaxed the uterus is between contractions. With external monitoring, this necessitates the use of palpation to determine relative strength.  With an IUPC, this is determined by assessing actual pressures as graphed on the paper
*Interval- the amount of time between the end of one contraction to the beginning of the next contraction.

The NICHD nomenclature&lt;ref name=nic/&gt; defines uterine activity by quantifying the number of contractions present in a 10-minute window, averaged over 30 minutes.  Uterine activity may be defined as:
*'''Normal-''' less than or equal to 5 contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window
*'''[[Uterine tachysystole|Tachysystole-]]''' more than 5 contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window

===Baseline fetal heart rate===
The NICHD nomenclature&lt;ref name=nic/&gt; defines baseline fetal heart rate as:
The baseline FHR is determined by approximating the mean FHR rounded to increments of 5 beats per minute (bpm) during a 10-minute window, excluding accelerations and decelerations and periods of marked FHR variability (greater than 25 bpm). There must be at least 2 minutes of identifiable baseline segments (not necessarily contiguous) in any 10-minute window, or the baseline for that period is indeterminate. In such cases, it may be necessary to refer to the previous 10-minute window for determination of the baseline. Abnormal baseline is termed ''bradycardia'' when the baseline FHR is less than 110 bpm; it is termed ''tachycardia'' when the baseline FHR is greater than 160 bpm.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Baseline FHR variability===
Moderate baseline fetal heart rate variability reflects the delivery of oxygen to the fetal [[central nervous system]]. Its presence is reassuring in predicting an absence of [[metabolic acidemia]] and [[Intrauterine hypoxia|hypoxic]] injury to the fetus at the time it is observed.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt; In contrast, the presence of mild baseline FHR variability, or an absence of FHR variability does not reliably predict fetal acidemia or hypoxia; lack of moderate baseline FHR variability may be a result of the fetal sleep cycle, or a result of medications, extreme prematurity, congenital anomalies, or pre-existing neurological injury.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

The NICHD nomenclature&lt;ref name=nic/&gt; defines baseline FHR variability as:
Baseline FHR variability is determined in a 10-minute window, excluding accelerations and decelerations. Baseline FHR variability is defined as fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency. The fluctuations are visually quantitated as the amplitude of the peak-to-trough in beats per minute. Using this definition, the baseline FHR variability is categorized by the quantitated amplitude as:
*'''Absent-''' undetectable
*'''Minimal-''' greater than undetectable, but less than or equal to 5 beats per minute
*'''Moderate-''' 6-25 beats per minute
*'''Marked-''' greater than 25 beats per minute

===Accelerations===
The NICHD nomenclature&lt;ref name=nic/&gt; defines an acceleration as a visually apparent abrupt increase in fetal heart rate. An abrupt increase is defined as an increase from the onset of acceleration to the peak in less than or equal to 30 seconds. To be called an acceleration, the peak must be greater than or equal to 15 bpm, and the acceleration must last greater than or equal to 15 seconds from the onset to return to baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=RE |title=Intrapartum fetal monitoring |journal=American Family Physician |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=1388–96 |year=2009 |pmid=20000301 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=20000301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''prolonged acceleration'' is greater than or equal to 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes in duration. 
An acceleration lasting greater than or equal to 10 minutes is defined as a baseline change. 
Before 32 weeks of gestation, accelerations are defined as having a peak greater than or equal to 10 bpm and a duration of greater than or equal to 10 seconds.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Periodic or episodic decelerations===
{{anchor|deceleration}}
Periodic refers to decelerations that are associated with contractions; episodic refers to those not associated with contractions.  There are four types of decelerations as defined by the NICHD nomenclature, all of which are visually assessed.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;
*'''Early Decelerations''' are a result of increased [[vagal tone]] due to compression of the fetal head during contractions. Monitoring usually shows a symmetrical, gradual decrease and return to baseline of FHR which is associated with a uterine contraction.  A 'gradual' deceleration has a time from onset to nadir of 30 seconds or more. Early decelerations begin and end at approximately the same time as contractions, and the low point of the fetal heart rate occurs at the peak of the contraction.&lt;ref name="Callahan 2013 p.43-47 "&gt;{{cite book | last=Callahan | first=Tamara | title=Blueprints obstetrics &amp; gynecology | publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location=Baltimore, MD | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4511-1702-8 | pages=43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Late Decelerations''' are a result of [[placental insufficiency]], which can result in [[fetal distress]]. Monitoring usually shows symmetrical gradual decrease and return to baseline of the fetal heart rate in association with a uterine contraction.  A 'gradual' deceleration has onset to nadir of 30 seconds or more. In contrast to early deceleration, the low point of fetal heart rate occurs after the peak of the contraction, and returns to baseline after the contraction is complete.&lt;ref name="Callahan 2013 p.43-47 "/&gt;
*'''Variable Decelerations''' are generally a result of [[umbilical cord compression]], and contractions may further compress a cord when it is trapped around the neck or under the shoulder of the fetus. They are defined as abrupt decreases in fetal heart rate, with less than 30 seconds from the beginning of the decrease to the nadir of heart rate. The decrease in FHR is greater than or equal to 15 beats per minute, lasting greater than or equal to 15 seconds, and less than 2 minutes in duration.&lt;ref name="Callahan 2013 p.43-47 "/&gt; When variable decelerations are associated with uterine contractions, their onset, depth, and duration commonly vary with successive uterine contractions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
*'''Prolonged Deceleration:''' Decrease in FHR from baseline greater than or equal to 15 bpm, lasting greater than or equal to 2 minutes, but less than 10 minutes. A deceleration greater than or equal to 10 minutes is a baseline change.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Additionally, decelerations can be ''recurrent'' or ''intermittent'' based on their frequency (more or less than 50% of the time) within a 20 min window.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

===FHR pattern classification===
Before 2008, fetal heart rate was classified as either "reassuring" or "nonreassuring". The NICHD workgroup proposed terminology of a three-tiered system to replace the older, undefined terms.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

*'''Category I (Normal)''': Tracings with all these findings present are strongly predictive of normal fetal acid-base status at the time of observation and the fetus can be followed in a standard manner:
**Baseline rate 110-160 bpm,
**Moderate variability,
**Absence of late, or variable decelerations,
**Early decelerations and accelerations may or may not be present.
*'''Category II (Indeterminate)''': Tracing is not predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status, but evaluation and continued surveillance and reevaluations are indicated. 
**Bradycardia with normal baseline variability
**Tachycardia
**Minimal or Marked baseline variability of FHR
**Accelerations: Absence of induced accelerations after fetal stimulation
**Periodic or Episodic decelerations: Longer than 2min but shorter than 10min; Recurrent late decelerations with moderate baseline variability
**Variable decelerations with other characteristics such as slow return to baseline, overshoots of "shoulders" seen (humps on either side of deceleration)
*'''Category III (Abnormal)''': Tracing is predictive of abnormal fetal acid-base status at the time of observation; this requires prompt evaluation and management:
**Absence of baseline variability, with recurrent late or variable decelerations, or bradycardia; or
**[[Sine wave|Sinusoidal]] fetal heart rate

=== Updated 2015 FIGO Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring Guidelines ===
[[International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] has recently modified the guidelines on intrapartum fetal monitoring, proposing following interpretation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.figo.org/news/available-view-figo-intrapartum-fetal-monitoring-guidelines-0015088|title=Available to view: FIGO Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring Guidelines {{!}} FIGO|website=www.figo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Normal''': No hypoxia/acidosis, no intervention necessary to improve fetal oxygenation state: 
**Baseline 110-160 bpm
**Variability 5-25 bpm
**No repetitive decelerations (decelerations are defined as repetitive when associated with &gt; 50% contractions)
*'''Suspicious''': Low probability of hypoxia/acidosis, warrants action to correct reversible causes if identified, close monitoring or adjunctive methods: 
**Lacking at least one characteristic of normality, but with no pathological features.
* '''Pathological''': High probability of hypoxia/acidosis, requires immediate action to correct reversible causes, adjunctive methods, or if this is not possible expedite delivery. In acute situations immediate delivery should be accomplished 
** Baseline &lt;100 bpm
**Reduced or increased variability or [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] pattern
**Repetitive late or prolonged decelerations for &gt; 30 min, or &gt; 20 min if reduced variability (decelerations are defined as repetitive when associated with &gt; 50% contractions)
**Deceleration &gt; 5 min

== Benefits and problems ==
According to the [[Cochrane review]] from the February 2017, CTG  was associated with fewer neonatal seizures but it is unclear if it had any impact on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. No clear differences in cerebral palsy, infant mortality or other standard measures of neonatal wellbeing, neither on any meaningful long-term outcomes could be shown. Continuous CTG was associated with the higher rates of caesarean sections and instrumental vaginal births. The authors see the challenge in how to discuss these results with women to enable them to make an informed decision without compromising the normality of labour. Future research should focus on events that happen in pregnancy and labour that could be the cause of long term problems for the baby.&lt;ref name="alfirevic2017" /&gt;

'''Chlorine gas poisoning'''  is illness resulting from the effects of exposure to [[chlorine]] beyond the [[threshold limit value]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs of acute chlorine gas poisoning are primarily respiratory, and include [[Dyspnea|difficulty breathing]] and cough; listening to the lungs will generally reveal [[crackles]]. There will generally be sneezing, nose irritation,burning sensation, and throat irritation. There may also be skin irritation or chemical burns and eye irritation or conjunctivitis.  A person with chlorine gas poisoning may also have nausea, vomiting, or a headache.&lt;ref name=Jones2010rev&gt;Jones R, Wills B, Kang C. Chlorine gas: an evolving hazardous material threat and unconventional weapon. West J Emerg Med. 2010 May;11(2):151-6. {{PMID|20823965}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908650/pdf/wjem-11-151.pdf PMC 2908650]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White2010rev&gt;White CW, Martin JG. Chlorine gas inhalation: human clinical evidence of toxicity and experience in animal models. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 2010 Jul;7(4):257-63. Review. {{PMID|20601629}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136961/pdf/PROCATS74257.pdf PMC 3136961]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medscapeOver&gt;Gerald F O'Malley, GF et al. [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/832336-overview#showall Chlorine Toxicity] Medscape Drugs &amp; Diseases, Ed. Dembek, ZF. Updated: Dec 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic exposure to relatively low levels of chlorine gas may cause pulmonary problems like acute wheezing attacks, chronic cough with phlegm, and asthma.&lt;ref name=White2010rev/&gt;

==Causes==
Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and common domestic exposures result from the mixing of [[Chlorine|chlorine bleach]] with [[Cleaning agent|acidic washing agents]] such as [[Acetic acid|acetic]], [[Nitric acid|nitric]] and [[phosphoric acid]]. They also occur as a result of the chlorination of table water.  Other exposure risks occur during industrial or transportation accidents. Wartime exposure is rare.&lt;ref name=White2010rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=medscapeOver/&gt;

===Dose toxicity===
Humans can smell chlorine gas at ranges from 0.1–0.3 ppm.  According to a review from 2010: "At 1–3 ppm, there is mild mucus membrane irritation that can usually be tolerated for about an hour. At 5–15 ppm, there is moderate mucus membrane irritation. At 30 ppm and beyond, there is immediate chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough. At approximately 40–60 ppm, a toxic pneumonitis and/or acute pulmonary edema can develop.... Concentrations of about 400 ppm and beyond are generally fatal over 30 minutes, and at 1,000 ppm and above, fatality ensues within only a few minutes."&lt;ref name=White2010rev/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The concentration of the inhaled gas and duration of exposure and water contents of the tissues exposed are the key determinants of toxicity; moist tissues like the eyes, throat, and lungs are the most susceptible to damage.&lt;ref name=CDCbasic&gt;CDC [http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/chlorine/basics/facts.asp Basic Facts] Page last reviewed April 10, 2013. Page last updated April 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Once inhaled, chlorine gas diffuses into the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the [[respiratory epithelium]] and may directly interact with small molecules, proteins and lipids there and damage them, or may [[hydrolyze]] to [[hypochlorous acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] which in turn generate chloride ions and [[reactive oxygen species]]; the dominant theory is that most damage is via the acids.&lt;ref name=White2010rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=medscapeOver/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mechanism2010rev&gt;Squadrito GL, Postlethwait EM, Matalon S. Elucidating mechanisms of chlorine toxicity: reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and physiological implications. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2010 Sep;299(3):L289-300. Review. {{PMID|20525917}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951076/ PMC 2951076]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATSDRtreatment&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry via the CDC. [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MMG/MMG.asp?id=198&amp;tid=36 Medical Management Guidelines: Chlorine] Page last reviewed: October 21, 2014.  Page last updated: October 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Test performed to confirm chlorine gas poisoning and monitor patients for supportive care include pulse oximetry, testing serum electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, measuring arterial blood gases, chest radiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function testing, and laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy.&lt;ref name=medscapeOver/&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no antidote for chlorine poisoning; management is [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]] after evacuating people from the site of exposure and flushing exposed tissues. For lung damage caused by inhalation, oxygen and [[bronchodilators]] may be administered.&lt;ref name=ATSDRtreatment/&gt;

==Outcomes==
There is no way to predict outcomes.  Most people with mild to moderate exposure generally recover fully in three to five days, but some develop chronic problems such as [[reactive airway disease]].  Smoking or pre-existing lung conditions like asthma appear to increase the risk of long term complications.&lt;ref name=Jones2010rev/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
In 2014, the [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] reported that about 6000 exposures to chlorine gas in the US in 2013, compared with 13,600 exposures to [[carbon monoxide]], which was the most common poison gas exposure;&lt;ref&gt;Mowry JB, et al 2014 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 32nd Annual Report. Clin Toxicol. 2015;53(10):962-1147. {{PMID|26624241}}. Page 1089&lt;/ref&gt; the year before they reported about 5,500 cases of chlorine gas poisoning compared with around 14,300 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Mowry JB, et al. 2013 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 31st Annual Report. Clin Toxicol. 2014 Dec;52(10):1032-283. {{PMID|25559822}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782684/pdf/ictx-52-1032.pdf PMC 4782684] Page 1225&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many instances of mass chlorine gas poisonings in industrial accidents.  In the US, a freight train derailed in South Carolina in 2005, releasing an estimated 11,500 gallons of chlorine gas. As a result, nine people died, and at least 529 persons sought medical care. In 2004 in Texas a freight train accident released 90,000 pounds of chlorine gas and other toxic chemicals.  Forty-four persons were injured, including three who died.  In August 2002 in Missouri, approximately 16,900 pounds of chlorine gas were released from a railroad tanker car when a flex hose ruptured during unloading at a chemical plant. Sixty-seven persons were injured.&lt;ref name=Jones2010rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CDC [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5403a2.htm Public Health Consequences from Hazardous Substances Acutely Released During Rail Transit --- South Carolina, 2005; Selected States, 1999--2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Nigeria, eight people died in a July 2015 explosion of a chlorine gas storage tank at a water treatment plant in [[Jos]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Olukayode for Bloomberg News.

'''Circle of Health International''', known as COHI for short, is a US based [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 2004 with the mission to work with women and their communities with a community based approach in times of crisis. As of 2016, COHI has responded to eighteen humanitarian emergencies and served over three million women globally. COHI has worked with [[Midwife|midwives]] and [[public health]] professionals in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tibet]], [[Tanzania]], [[Israel]], the [[Philippines]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sudan]], [[Haiti]], and [[Afghanistan]].

As of 2016 COHI supports [[Maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]] clinics in Haiti, midwives in an indigenous women's forum in Nicaragua, midwifery students and [[sexual health]] advocates in [[Nepal]], a clinic for [[refugee]]s in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] on the Mexico/US border, and works with survivors of [[human trafficking]] globally. COHI is also engaged in Austin's [[social enterprise]] community through a program, known as the COHI Cloth Network, to address women's [[poverty]] through income generation initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Foundation Is Improving Maternal Health Worldwide, One Birth At A Time|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2015/12/98629/circle-of-health-international-psa|website=Refinery29.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How U.S. moms can help celebrate International Women's Day|url=http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1075897/international-womens-day-how-you-can-reach-moms-across-the-globe|date=8 March 2015|website=Sheknows.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sera Bonds helps refugee women get the care they need|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/sera-bonds-helps-refugee-women-get-the-care-they-need|website=Msnbc.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions==
=== Tibet ===
In 2004, COHI partnered with a local host organization, Tibetan Healing Fund, in Tongren, also known as Repkong, Eastern Tibet to aid with the training of midwives in order to create a more sustainable maternal health care system.

=== Israel/West Bank ===
In 2004, COHI and their partners worked with Israeli and Palestinian woman to address midwifery and gender based violence (GBV). Conducted an assessment based on three main categories

# To produce a substantial GBV ethnography of the region;
# To design and implement specialized programming targeting the cultural nuances of each group; and
# Coalition-building among Israeli and Palestinian organizations to implement relevant projects in partnership with local women's rights organizations.

The assessment included in depth interviews and recommendations for each sector of Israel and the West Bank's diverse populations: religious and secular Jews, immigrant populations (Ethiopian, Russian, Congolese), the Bedouin, and the Palestinian populations of Israel and the West Bank, both Muslim and Christian

The results from the assessment were used to advocate for the needs of Israeli and Palestinian women such as better postpartum care.

On 3 June 1989, just before midnight [[Iran Standard Time|IRST]], [[Marja'|Grand Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], leader of the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the first [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] and founder of the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]], died in [[Jamaran]], [[Greater Tehran]] aged 86 after spending eleven days at a local clinic, near [[Ruhollah Khomeini's residency (Jamaran)|his residency]], after repeated [[heart failure]] (five [[heart attack]]s in ten days).&lt;ref name=newstatesman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2009/03/khomeini-funeral-body-crowd|title=Ayatollah Khomeini's funeral: The funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini was not a tragedy but a gruesome farce|website=''[[New Statesman]]''|publisher=James Buchan|date=12 March 2009|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19890613&amp;id=PDseAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Jb8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6937,3485824|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune – Google News Archive Search|publisher=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|date=13 June 1989|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources put his age at 89, and list the cause of death as bleeding in [[Human digestive system|digestive system]].&lt;ref name=newyorktimes1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/world/khomeini-imam-of-iran-and-foe-of-us-is-dead.html|title=Khomeini, Imam of Iran And Foe of U.S., Is Dead|website=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=4 June 1989|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini was given a [[state funeral]] and then buried at the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] (''The Paradise of [[Fatimah|Zahra]]'') cemetery in south [[Tehran]].

== Funeral service ==

=== The first funeral ===
On 5 June, the coffin with Khomeini's body was transferred to the Musalla, a vacant lot in north Tehran. The body was displayed there on a high podium made out of steel shipping containers, in an air-conditioned glass case, wrapped in a white shroud. It stayed there until the next day. Hundreds of thousands of mourners had seen the body.&lt;ref name=newstatesman /&gt; On 6 June, the body was brought down and the coffin opened for Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani]] to lead the [[Salat al-Janazah]] (funeral prayer), which lasted for 20 minutes. Afterwards, since the crowds of mourners had swelled overnight to several millions, it was impossible to deliver the body to the cemetery through Tehran to the southern part of the city in an procession. Eventually, the body was transferred to an [[Islamic Republic of Iran Army|IRIA]] [[Bell Huey family|Bell Huey]] helicopter and brought by air to the cemetery.&lt;ref name=newstatesman /&gt;  

At the cemetery, the crown surged past the makeshift barriers and the authorities lost control of the events. According to journalist [[John Kifner]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'':
[[File:Funeral of Ruhollah Khomeini, 4 June 1989 (6).jpg|thumb|right|Mourning men pull the coffin with Khomeini's body from the helicopter.]]
{{quote|The crowd, much of it made up of [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|IRGC]] personnel detailed to maintain order, pulled the coffin from the helicopter and began parading it around the makeshift compound surrounding the gravesite. As the excitement grew, the body of the Ayatollah, wrapped in a white burial shroud, fell out of the flimsy wooden coffin, and in a mad scene people in the crowd reached to touch the shroud. The soldiers pushed and wrestled, finally firing warning shots, to get the body back. Ayatollah Khomeini's son, [[Ahmad Khomeini|Ahmad]], was knocked from his feet. But even as the soldiers pushed the body back into the helicopter, the crowd swarmed over the craft, dragging it back down as it tried to take off. Others jumped into the hole dug for the Ayatollah's body. The troops drove the crowd back, finally clearing the compound enough to allow the helicopter to take off, its rotors scattering more mourners.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/07/world/amid-frenzy-iranians-bury-the-ayatollah.html|title=Amid Frenzy, Iranians Bury The Ayatollah|website=''[[The New York Times]]''|publisher=[[John Kifner]]|date=7 June 1989|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The second funeral ===
The body was taken back to north Tehran to go through the ritual of preparation a second time. To thin the crowd, it was announced on television and radio that the funeral had been postponed. Five hours later, the body was returned to the cemetery and this time the guards were better prepared. The body was brought out of a helicopter, sealed in a metal box resembling an airline shipping container.&lt;ref name=newstatesman /&gt; Once again, the crowd broke through the cordon, but by weight of numbers the guards managed to push their way through to the grave. There, according to reporters for [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]:

{{quote|The metal lid of the casket was ripped off, and the body was rolled into the grave. The grave was quickly covered with concrete slabs and a large freight container.&lt;ref name=newstatesman /&gt;}}

In 1992, the construction of the [[Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini]] on the burial site was completed.

'''Elephant hunting''', which used to be an accepted activity '''in Kenya''', was banned in 1973, as was the [[ivory trade]]. Illegal hunting continues, as there is still international demand for [[elephant tusks]]. [[Kenya]] pioneered the [[destruction of ivory]] as a way to combat this [[black market]]. [[Elephant]] [[poaching]] continues to pose a threat to the population.

==Colonial Kenya==
During colonial times, elephant hunting in Kenya was seen as a sport for noblemen and was exploited by the colonial governors.&lt;ref name="History1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Museum of Natural History|title=The American Museum journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66seAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 May 2011|year=1915|publisher=American Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British East Africa]] was not unique in this: [[big-game hunting]] was popular in many parts of [[British Empire|the Empire]]. Among the [[white hunter]]s, the bull elephant was said to be the most exhilarating target. Small-bore [[rifle]]s appeared to be the preferred option and aiming at the brain instead of the heart was another preference. The motive was not always monetary. However, many hunters were indiscriminate in their choice of elephants to kill – young, old, male or female, it did not matter, as the primary purpose was ivory to sell and [[elephant meat]] to feed their hunting party.&lt;ref name="Steinhart2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinhart|first=Edward I.|title=Black poachers, white hunters: a social history of hunting in colonial Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXaP-eY493cC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=6 May 2011|year=2006|publisher=James Currey|isbn=978-0-85255-960-4|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[East African Professional Hunter's Association]] was formed to regulate the industry and restrict its excesses. The Association, which came into being at the [[Fairmont The Norfolk Hotel|Norfolk Hotel]], Nairobi, stemmed from a desire to regulate hunting in the wake of technological developments like the safari vehicle, which had made accessing remote hunting areas much easier. During its existence it was able to accomplish much to conserve East African wildlife and become perhaps one of the most respected societies in the world of its kind.&lt;ref name=herne167&gt;{{cite book |title=White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris |last=Herne |first=Brian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC |location=New York |isbn= |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of the most prolific of the white hunters was the Scottish adventurer [[W. D. M. Bell]], who is reported to have killed over a thousand elephants, spread across several African countries. &lt;ref name="Barclay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Edgar N|title=Big Game Shooting Records 1931|publisher=HF&amp;G Witherby|chapter=Chapter One - correspondence with WDM Bell and author}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the first of his memoirs, ''The Wanderings of an Elephant Hunter'' (1923), for more information. Some of the madness of the desire to shoot an elephant (albeit not in Kenya) is shown in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'', a fictionalised version of what happened during the filming of the Hollywood classic ''[[The African Queen (film)|African Queen]]''.

In 1963, the [[History_of_Kenya#Independence|first year of independence]], the [[government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] issued 393 permits ([[hunting license]]s) for elephants.&lt;ref name="McNickle2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNickle|first=Dan|title=Teaching and Hunting in East Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdSHVaGcCwsC&amp;pg=PT275|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=19 March 2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4120-1935-4|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Kenyan poacher received approximately Shs. 3-4/lb ($.79–1.05/kg); by the 1970s, it was Shs. 100/kg ($12.74/kg), increasing the black market value for the primary producer from about one-fifth to one-third of the real value.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas-Hamilton, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ban, and ivory smuggling==
According to the American hunter [[Craig Boddington]], elephant hunting was made illegal in Kenya in 1973 and all animal hunting without a permit in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsafield.com/notes-from-afield/africas-elephant-explosion|title=Africa's elephant explosion|publisher=Sportsafield|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1970s, the elephant population was estimated around 275,000, dropping to 20,000 in 1989.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_file236_12046.pdf |title=Elephants on the High Street |date=March 2004 |publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare |pages=18 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928081306/http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_file236_12046.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1977, Kenya lost more than half of its elephants.&lt;ref name="savetheelephants.org1979"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:aVmYNQzzD6wJ:www.savetheelephants.org/files/pdf/publications/1979%2520Douglas-Hamilton%2520African%2520Elephant%2520Ivory%2520Trade%2520Study.pdf+kenya+elephant+ivory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjXA_YT_db_nctmmbthPos3ND898AdycIwZxSwqAQrLb1EIJtiFy256vXYlu78njDGIelvBtUYi8MCWD2QDoME2zD-lemLDTFdcthjgS-0H2z4G-GbaepaVoeawZDsvloI2C8Ix&amp;sig=AHIEtbRtWTmA6gOHe3MIqyQSFH3bpPFppg|title=AFRICAN ELEPHANT IVORY TRADE STUDY  FINAL REPORT|first=I. |last=Douglas-Hamilton|date=August 1979|work=savetheelephants.org|pages=19|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, [[Ngina Kenyatta]] (Mama Ngina), wife of then-President [[Jomo Kenyatta]], and other high-level government officials were allegedly involved in an ivory-smuggling ring that transported tusks out of the country in the state private aeroplane.&lt;ref name="Information1975"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zE74f2fU1iwC&amp;pg=PA452|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=22 May 1975|publisher=Reed Business Information|page=452|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonner|first=Raymond|title=At the hand of man: peril and hope for Africa's wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXfwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1993|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-40008-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Society1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animal kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAEdAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1980|publisher=New York Zoological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wieland2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munger1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munger|first=Edwin S.|title=Touched by Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06MMAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1983|publisher=Castle Press|isbn=978-0-934912-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''New Scientist'' claimed that there was now documentary proof that at least one member of "Kenya's royal family" (the Kenyatta) had shipped over six tons of ivory to China.&lt;ref name="Information1975"/&gt; 

In the 1970s, 1900 elephants were killed in Kenya for their ivory tusks, increasing to 8300 elephants in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lowery1997" /&gt;

==The worldwide ban on ivory trade==

In 1989, as a dramatic gesture to persuade the world to halt the ivory trade, President [[Daniel arap Moi]] [[Destruction_of_ivory#Kenya_and_the_first_fire|ignited twelve tons of elephant tusks]].&lt;ref name="Perlez1989"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/world/kenya-in-gesture-burns-ivory-tusks.html|title=KENYA, IN GESTURE, BURNS IVORY TUSKS|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=July 19, 1989|publisher=[[The New York Times]]  |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s the widespread ban on commercial ivory trading reduced the industry to a fraction of what it had been and elephant populations have stabilised.&lt;ref name="Wieland2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieland|first=Terry|title=A view from a tall hill: Robert Ruark in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CflNHBquJWAC&amp;pg=PA411|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Down East Enterprise Inc|isbn=978-0-89272-650-9|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; But illegal poaching and sale on the black market still poses a serious threat, as does government bribery. The largest poaching incident in Kenya since the ivory trade ban occurred in March 2002, when a family of ten elephants was killed.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org2004" /&gt;

Illegal elephant deaths decreased between 1990, when the [[CITES]] ban was issued, and 1997, when only 34 were illegally killed.&lt;ref name="Lowery1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/poach.htm|title=ICE Case Studies - CASE NUMBER: 33 - CASE MNEMONIC: POACH  - CASE NAME: Ivory Poaching |first=N. |last=Lowery |date=December 1997|publisher=[[American University]]|accessdate=9 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505054639/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/poach.htm |archive-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory seizures rose dramatically since 2006 with many illegal exports going to Asia.&lt;ref name="cnn.com2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-06/world/kenya.illegal.ivory_1_illegal-ivory-elephant-tusks-kenyan-elephants?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Kenya finds Illegal ivory in boxes disguised as diplomatic baggage |date=May 6, 2011 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513075330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-06/world/kenya.illegal.ivory_1_illegal-ivory-elephant-tusks-kenyan-elephants?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poaching spiked seven-fold between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Straziuso2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37167109/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/ivory-trade-threatens-african-elephant/|title=Ivory trade threatens African elephant |last=Straziuso|first=Jason |author2=Michael Casey |author3=William Foreman |date=2010-05-15|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Large scale tourism promotion picked up in Kenya following the imposed hunting ban in Kenya since 1977. It has been noted that "photographic tourism", or non-consumptive wildlife use, [[Tourism in Kenya|is contributing 12% of Kenya’s GDP]]. Hence, some groups have recommended that tourism be promoted rather than any kind of hunting or consumptive wildlife use, as it could divert the attention of the government of Kenya from the policy goal of wildlife preservation.&lt;ref name=sport&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bornfree.org.uk/campaigns/further-activities/trophy-hunting/|title=Shooting animals for ‘sport’|accessdate=8 May 2011|publisher=Bornfree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Archive Digital Library"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arkell-Hardwick|first1=Alfred|title=An ivory trader in North Kenia|date=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/ivorytraderinnor00hard|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current situation, including safari tourism==
[[File:Elephant576.JPG|thumb|An elephant skull with tusk removed by poachers near [[Voi]], [[Taita-Taveta District]].]]

Though elephant hunting has been banned for a 40-year period in Kenya, poaching has not reduced. Given the poverty of many of the people, and the high value of elephant tusks, they are shipped overseas and sold on the black market. Although Kenya has many national parks and reserves protecting wildlife, elephant populations are still at risk, a problem which is made worse by corruption and some officials supplementing their income with permitting poaching.&lt;ref name="AndersonGrove1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David|last2=Grove|first2=Richard H.|title=Conservation in Africa: Peoples, Policies and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oclQ6rHRJAYC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=25 May 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-34990-1|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan government has attempted to crack down on elephant poaching with the aid of multi-nationals but has often been too late in preventing the poaching of many elephants whose tusks have been seized ''en masse'' in cases at [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport|Nairobi Airport]] and in [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok Airport]] where Kenyan tusks have often been imported.

Arrests continue at Nairobi's international airport, where 92 kilos{{clarify|reason=kilograms?|date=March 2014}} of raw ivory were seized in 2010, and 96 kilos{{clarify|reason=kilograms?|date=March 2014}} in 2011.&lt;ref name="voanews.com2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/04/29/kenya-seizes-traveler-carrying-elephant-ivory/ |title=Kenya Seizes Traveler Carrying Elephant Ivory |date=April 29, 2010 |publisher=Voice of America News |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506152540/http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/04/29/kenya-seizes-traveler-carrying-elephant-ivory/ |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual case that received publicity in 2014 was the death of [[Satao (elephant)|Satao]], one of the world's largest elephants, in the [[Tsavo Trust]]. Despite [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] guards, poachers managed to shoot the bull with a poisoned arrows and cut off his tusks.

==Possible trophy hunting in the future==
[[Trophy hunting]], purely as sport and as a conservation action, is now being considered for adoption in Kenya, as such a programme appears to have yielded positive results in Namibia and South Africa under a programme titled "Community-Based Natural Resource Management" (CBNRM). Under this programme, while cash was offered as an incentive for sport hunting, the basic aim was wildlife control on the communal land, providing benefits to the community as a whole.&lt;ref name=trophy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservationfinance.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/elephant-hunting/ |title=Elephant Hunting |accessdate=7 May 2011 |publisher=Conservation Finance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813225940/http://conservationfinance.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/elephant-hunting/ |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed{{By whom|date=October 2011}} that trophy hunting might attract elephant poachers into moving into legal hunting and leaving elephant trading.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s (FAO) report states: "Trophy hunting is generally self-regulating because low off-take is required to ensure high trophy quality and marketability in future seasons. Trophy hunting creates crucial financial incentives for the development and/or retention of wildlife as a land use over large areas in Africa, including in areas where ecotourism is not viable. Hunting plays an important role in the rehabilitation of degraded wildlife areas by enabling the income generation from wildlife without affecting population growth of trophy species."&lt;ref name=hunting&gt;{{Cite web|url=fttp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/aj114e/aj114e09.pdf|format=pdf|title=Trophy Hunting In Sub Saharan Africa: Economic Scale and Conservation Significance|accessdate=7 May 2011|publisher=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of trophy hunting has been adopted in 23 sub-Saharan African countries. The income generated in total in Africa is quoted to be USD 201 million/year, derived from about 18,500 international hunting clients covering an area of 1.4 million km².&lt;ref name=hunting/&gt; Since there is a lack of consensus among the clients about the efficacy of this method of biodiversity conservation in Africa, a study carried out by the [[Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund]] indicates that if Kenya makes trophy hunting legal again, nearly 90% of the clients would be interested to pursue this activity in that country. In this context, the importance of effective regulation of hunting operators and clients has also been highlighted.&lt;ref name=fund&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/Research_Team_at_African_Wildl/Romanach_Pubs/Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting.pdf |format=pdf |title=Potential of trophy hunting to create incentives for wildlife conservation in Africa where alternative wildlife-based land uses may not be viable |pages=283, 286–287, 289 |accessdate=8 May 2011 |publisher=Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517024606/http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/Research_Team_at_African_Wildl/Romanach_Pubs/Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the disadvantages of trophy hunting is the possible publicity backlash, such as [[Zimbabwe]] experienced with the [[killing of Cecil the lion]].

'''Emma Louise Call''' (1847–1937) was an American physician, and one of the first female physicians in the United States.&lt;ref name="whonamedit1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2706.html |title=dictionary of medical eponyms |publisher=Whonamedit |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Sigmund Exner]], she is one of the namesakes of [[Call-Exner bodies]], a [[pathognomonic]] feature of [[granulosa cell tumor]]s. These tumors are associated with [[ovarian cancer]]s.

==Biography==
Call received her [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from the [[University of Michigan Medical School]] in 1873, and moved to [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] as Sigmund Exner's postgraduate student. In 1875, they published the manuscript announcing their findings of the pathology findings - [[eosinophil]]ic follicles present in ovarian tumors - that would later be named after the two of them.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=VdY-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA362&amp;lpg=PA362&amp;dq=emma+louise+call&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q_045tm5cb&amp;sig=6UdsVncnN_3s_06V3FPrUGE-nTM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgKahUKEwiKpLTv8s7HAhUUMogKHeVzA3I#v=onepage&amp;q=emma%20louise%20call&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Louise Call and Sigmund Exner: Zur Kenntniss des Graafschen Follikels und des Corpus luteum beim Kaninchen. Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Mathematish naturwssenschaftliche Classe, Wien, 1875, 72: 321-328.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be Call's only publication, as she later returned to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and practiced clinically as an obstetrician for 40 years. Call would become the first woman to receive membership into the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/279274712_fig2_Fig-2-Emma-Louise-Call-1847-1937-courtesy-of-the-University-of-Michigan-student&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I entered the Medical Department of the University the first year that women were admitted. The first class of women...were naturally the objects of much attention critical or otherwise (especially critical) so that in many ways it was quite an ordeal. I believe that only one of the medical faculty was even moderately in favor of the admission of women, so that it speaks well for their conscientiousness when I say (with possibly one exception) we felt that we had [a] square deal from them all."&lt;ref name="whonamedit1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to Call's quote, Robert H. Young stated that "Corydon Ford had taught [[Elizabeth Blackwell]] at Geneva Medical College and was tolerant of the women students, but not all the professors were so kind. The professor of chemistry, Silas Douglas, did not intervene when the men students stamped their feet and shouted as the women entered the lecture room for the one subject that was taught to mixed classes."&lt;ref name="whonamedit1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2712">'''ESUVEE''' was a US year-long consumer education campaign on [[sport utility vehicle]] safety in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadandtravel.com/safetyandsecurity/2005/esuvee.htm "SUV Safety Campaign Launched Online" ''Road &amp; Travel Magazine''], retrieved on February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also an associated [[website]] game.&lt;ref name=autochannel&gt;[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2005/04/21/045291.html "Esuvee Safety Campaign Develops New Web Game to Further Promote Safety Messages," The Auto Channel, April 21, 2005], retrieved on February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the campaign was to encourage safe driving of SUVs. The campaign emphasized the need to drive carefully to avoid rolling the vehicles over because SUVs handle like trucks, not cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgia.gov/00/article/0,2086,5426814_5684686_38192912,00.html The ESUVEE Safety Campaign, State of Georgia Governor's Office of Consumer Affairs], retrieved on February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus was changing driver behavior, particularly among younger male drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsaa.org/nsaa/safety/esuvee.asp The ESUVEE Safety Campaign], retrieved on February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was a $27 million effort sponsored by the consumer protection agencies and the [[Attorneys General]] of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=autochannel/&gt; Part of the funding came from a settlement agreement with the [[Ford Motor Company]] to resolve [[lawsuit]]s alleging that Ford’s marketing practices misled consumers on how to drive, load, and maintain the [[Ford Explorer]]. &lt;ref name&gt;[http://www.ago.state.co.us/press_detail.cfmpressID=46.html "States Unite to Promote SUV Safety with $27 Million Public Education Campaign" Colorado Attorney General Office, January 31, 2005], retrieved on February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SUUVEE campaign was to inform the public about four safety elements to help save lives:
:Handling - A higher risk of rollover in SUVs because of a higher center of gravity than passenger cars.
:Loading - Number of occupants, as well as the weight and distribution of cargo, raises the center of gravity, thus increasing the risk of rollovers.
:Tires - the size, pressure, and proper maintenance of tires are keys to SUV safety.
:Seat belts - Since 80% of deaths in SUV rollovers were from ejection, seat belt use would help prevent fatalities.

The European Commission set aside 12 million [[euro]]s to recognise the European Year of People with Disabilities.

The Year was officially launched under the Greek Presidency in Athens on 26 January 2003. The opening ceremony in [[Athens]] was co-hosted by [[Julie Fernandez]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">'''Dr. Euthanasia Sherman Meade''' (1836–1895) was a pioneer woman physician of the Pacific Coast. Dr. Meade was the first president of The Woman's Medical Club of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritter|first1=Mary B.|last2=Shuey|first2=Sarah I.|title=Dr. E.S. Meade|journal=Pacific Medical Journal|date=1896|volume=39|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKARAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=euthanasia+meade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZsmsILi5a-&amp;sig=qxozHnz0YJfoDOBsdrSfSmLuxRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij6vL1zfvZAhWosVQKHVL9AdUQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=euthanasia%20meade&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Euthanasia Sherman was born in 1836 in Genessee, New Jersey. She was the niece of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General W.T. Sherman]]. When she was 17 years old, she married a man her mother chose and shortly after moved to California. After the death of her only child in its birth, she turned to obstetrics, and later medicine. She returned to the East Coast and worked in hospitals during the war. In 1869, she graduated from the [[Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]]. 

== California ==
When she returned to California, Dr. Meade opened an office on Mission Street in [[San Francisco, CA|San Francisco]]. She was the first regular woman physician to establish herself in California. However, due to the times, she was met with little recognition in the medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkinson|first1=James H.|title=Occidental Medical Times|date=1896|publisher=D. Johnston &amp; Co.|location=Sacramento|pages=114|volume=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etK6cI5LS4gC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=dr.+euthanasia+sherman+meade&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5jLb52fvZAhUHxmMKHcOnDswQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=dr.%20euthanasia%20sherman%20meade&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed asthma and eventually moved to [[San Jose, California|San José]] where she practiced for 25 years. In 1876, Dr. Meade was admitted to the State Medical Society along with four other women physicians.

== Death ==
Dr. Meade died in 1895 due to a cerebral embolus from an [[endocarditis]]. She was cremated and her ashes placed at Cypress Lawn Cemetery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16267">[[Kenya]] has a severe, generalized [[HIV]] epidemic, but in recent years, the country has experienced a notable decline in HIV prevalence, attributed in part to significant behavioral change and increased access to [[Antiretroviral drug|ART]](antiretroviral drugs). Adult HIV prevalence is estimated to have fallen from 10 percent in the late 1990s to about 4.8 percent in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/kenya|title=UNAIDS: Kenya fact sheet|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women face considerably higher risk of HIV infection than men, and also experience a shorter life expectancy due to [[HIV/AIDS]]. The 7th edition of AIDS in Kenya reports an HIV prevalence rate of eight percent in adult women and four percent in adult men. Populations in Kenya that are especially at risk include [[Drug user|injecting drug users]] and [[Sex worker|people in prostitution]], whose prevalence rates are estimated at 53 percent and 27 percent, respectively. [[Men who have sex with men]] (MSM) are also at risk at a prevalence of 18.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20170720_Data_book_2017_en.pdf|title=UNAIDS Data Book 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups also include discordant couples (where one partner is infected and the other is not) however successful ARV-treatment will prevent transmission.

== History ==
The following will be a timeline of the major events that have led up to today in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Kenya from 1984-2018.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/282003/HIV-past-present-and-future/#vars!date=2013-01-01_04:09:04!|title=HIV: past, present and future|last=timeline|website=www.tiki-toki.com|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1984: First case of HIV found in Kenya&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1985: Sex workers were involved in 26 new recorded cases of HIV&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1985: The condition is still a mystery in Kenya&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1986: There is a mass denial of the disease being a problem&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1987: A study was performed on the unique women from Majengo slum in Nairobi, who were "immune" to AIDS&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1988: HIV prevalence is now at 3,000 cases&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1990: Prevalence rises to 2.5% of the population as the government is still in denial&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1995: By 1995, the death toll rose to about 200,000 people&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1998: Prevalence rate is at 9.8%&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

2003: Prevalence rate drops to 6.7%&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

2003: Public sector releases low cost ARVs&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

2005: Around 65,000 HIV positive individuals in Kenya are on ARVs&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

2012: Prevalence has dropped to 5.6%, but Kenya still has the 4th largest HIV epidemic&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Overview of the HIV epidemic ==
Here is a brief overview of the HIV epidemic in the country as reported by the Ministry of Education in June 2014, as well as the UNAIDS report on Kenya for 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* 53,000 Kenyans were infected with HIV In 2017.
* 8,000 children, 27,000 women, and 18,000 men were infected with HIV in 2017.
* 65% of new HIV infections occur in 9 out of 47 counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/counties-highest-hiv-infections-report|title=Counties With Highest HIV Infections - Report - Kenyans.co.ke|work=Kenyans.co.ke|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social outlook ==

====== LGBTQ+ ======
As the [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] community has always been part of the fight against HIV/AIDS in all countries, the same has happened in Kenya.  Although MSMs and other forms of same-sex contact are not the main risk group or cause of HIV/AIDS in Kenya, they have been a big proponent due to the laws that have been put in place by the country's government.  [[Homosexuality]] is currently illegal in Kenya, allowing the government to 595 cases of homosexuality from 2010-2014.  While MSMs and members of the LGBTQ+ community already face discrimination on a regular basis, they are being denied treatment due to their identity and the penal code in many places in Kenya.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, recently, activist groups have been able to challenge the [[constitutionality]] of the laws that are in place, resulting in the government contemplating if they should be repealed.  This advance happened in 2016, and currently the verdict has not come in about the constitutionality of the penal code that is in place with respect to this community.  Victory has been won in other places that had laws that discriminated against the LGBTQ+ community, so the activists have a positive outlook on this subject at this point in time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kuchutimes.com/2018/09/the-repeal-of-the-anti-homosexuality-laws-in-kenya/|title=THE REPEAL OF THE ANTI HOMOSEXUALITY LAWS IN KENYA|date=2018-09-28|work=Kuchu Times|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Adolescents ======
With adolescents being a big risk group in Kenya, society has molded the outlook of this group and how they interact with HIV/AIDS.  There are many social stigmas involved with people aged 15-19, as they go through harsh environments in schools and in the community.  HIV and AIDS in school is viewed as a killer disease that is a sign of sexual immortality.  Many adolescents feel afraid to disclose their status, due to the stigma that is behind it.  Fear is also found in walking into health centers and asking about HIV/AIDS, due to the conception that health workers will look down on you and your condition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceafrica.co.ke/hiv-kenyan-adolescents-hardest-hit/|title=HIV:  Kenyan Adolescents Hardest Hit {{!}} Science Africa|last=Africa|first=Science|website=scienceafrica.co.ke|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has also provided adolescents in Kenya with illegitimate information about the disease, prevention of the disease, and overall outlook.  While the main fear is found in public shaming or judging, another problem is that adolescents are not represented in policy very well, compared to that of children and adults. Economic burdens that are placed on adolescents that do not have parents to provide the means for their education and wellbeing is another problem for the group.  Sometimes, adolescents are forced into being sex workers to provide for themselves, resulting in an increased risk for HIV infection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====== Sex Workers ======
Sex workers have the highest prevalence among the risk groups of HIV/AIDS in Kenya.  It has been reported that 29.3% of sex workers have HIV.  The main problem within this community is the fear of coming forward about being raped or abused, because it could lead to prosecution for being a sex worker.  Therefore, sex workers are less likely to go to anyone for help because of this fear.  Being prosecuted and arrested can lead to an interruption in HIV treatment.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== Current status ==
The Kenyan Ministry of Health published a report on June 2014 called ''Kenya HIV Prevention Revolution Road Map. ''The road map aims to dramatically strengthen HIV prevention, with the ultimate goal of reducing new HIV infections to zero by 2030. The following observations and conclusions were outlined:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nacc.or.ke/attachments/article/418/Kenya_HIV_Prevention_Revolution_Road_Map.pdf|title = Kenya_HIV_Prevention_Revolution_Road_Map|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sexual transmission accounts for 93.7% of all new HIV infections (MOT, 2008).
* The HIV epidemic in Kenya exhibits extreme geographical and gender disparities. National estimates and modelling indicate that 65% of new adult infections occur in nine of the 47 Counties. There is higher prevalence among women at 7.6% compared to men at 5.6%. There is a treatment gap of over 99,500 women and 64,900 men, in need of [[Antiretroviral drug|ART]] but not currently receiving treatment. ART coverage is 77% in eligible women compared to 80% in men.
* Key populations contribute a disproportionately high number of new HIV infections annually despite their small population size. According to the MOT 2008, although these populations represent less than 2% of the general population, they contribute a third of all new HIV infections. Key populations in Kenya include sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs. Additionally, there are geographical disparities in the distribution of key populations across the Counties.
*A recent development in April 2018 shows Kenya receiving funding from the [[The Children's Investment Fund Foundation|Children's investment Fund Foundation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; to buy [[Antiretroviral therapy|AR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Antiretroviral therapy|V]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for children in the country. The country received 400 million Kenyan shillings after the 38 billion shillings was not enough to cover all the risk groups involved in the epidemic. While the grant for 38 billion shillings was given by the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fun]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|d]] to cover a broad spectrum of diseases including tuberculosis and malaria, the new grant has been given specifically for treatment of children with HIV. This is due to the fact that about 120,000 children, ages of fourteen and under, are living with HIV. As of 2012, Kenya has received about 100 billion shillings in funding over the span of 19 grants given by various organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/04/27/kenya-gets-sh400m-to-buy-arvs-for-children_c1749955|title=Kenya gets Sh400m to buy ARVs for children|work=The Star, Kenya|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As of September 2018, adolescents are a high risk group in Kenya to be infected by HIV. Nearly 106,000 adolescents, aging from 15 to 19, are living with HIV. This trend is on the rise due to the stigmatization of HIV/AIDS within adolescent communities and society. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Cost ==

====== Low Cost Antiretroviral Drugs ======
ART was introduced to Kenya in the late 90s when the treatment was initially being rolled out. However, they did not start receiving low cost drugs until around 2003. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Costs continued to decline, and with enough donor money, more than a million patients receive ART for free through the government. Recently, Kenyans with HIV got access to a high end drug for cheap due to an international deal. The cost per year for this drug treatment is US$75 and is a big improvement as it combines some drugs together to make the treatment plan cheaper and easier for patients living with HIV. This drug has been accessible in high income countries since 2014, but the new deal has placed the drug in middle and low income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001255406/good-news-for-kenyans-living-with-hiv-aids|title=Kenyans to access new, highly-effective HIV drugs at lower prices|last=Jamah|first=Ally|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
During the initial outbreak of AIDS in the 80s, the Kenyan government stayed away from discussions about how big of a problem there was with HIV/AIDS in the country. By 1993, statements were finally made about the problem and how the situation should have been addressed sooner. Kenya could not afford to lose so many skilled workers to HIV/AIDS when there was currently no treatment for it. The response and plan to reduce the amount of HIV infections has been more extensive going into the new century and currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/18/world/after-years-of-ignoring-aids-epidemic-kenya-has-begun-facing-up-to-it.html|title=After Years of Ignoring AIDS Epidemic, Kenya Has Begun Facing Up to It|last=Lorch|first=Donatella|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== HTC ======
HIV testing and counseling (HTC) has been one response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Kenya. The government has encouraged getting tested and for people to be more open about the diagnosis so it can be addressed appropriately. Self testing kits for low cost have been introduced over recent years, along with community based testing and door-to-door campaigns. In 2008, only 860,000 people were being annually tested for HIV, compared to 9.9 million people that are being tested annually now. &lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/kenya|title=HIV and AIDS in Kenya|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Condom Availability ======
Even though condom use wasn't endorsed by the Kenyan government until 2001, the rate of condom usage has gradually increased ever since. Free condoms have been distributed throughout different communities, including the sex workers community. This has decreased unprotected sex, which is critical in lowering new HIV infections. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

====== Education ======
Education about HIV/AIDS has been in the school curriculum since 2003, and it has been effective in increasing knowledge within children about the disease. There has been some controversy about the ethics of teaching students about sexual health, due to the fear that it would encourage young people to have sex. However, rates of new HIV infections have said otherwise. Mass media campaigns have also been done to educate people about HIV/AIDS. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

====== PMTCT ======
Preventing mother to child transmission (PMTCT) has also been a big step in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The country's dedication to eliminating this type of transmission has led to a drop of children born with HIV from 12,000 children in 2010 to 6,600 in 2015. Male partners have also been encouraged to take part in this type of treatment, by getting tested along with the soon-to-be mother.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

====== VMMC, Harm Reduction, and PrEP ======
Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) was implemented as an option in 2008 in Kenya as a prevention method. By 2016, 92% of men in Kenya are circumcised.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Harm reduction is the distribution of clean needles and syringes along with counseling and medically assisted treatment with methadone, implemented by the government in 2012. The amount of Intravenous drug users that are using clean needles now is up to 90% compared to the 51% in 2012.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Pre-exposure prophylaxis has been an ongoing trend in Kenya, as HIV negative people have been receiving ART to prevent against any future infection of HIV. It is being offered for people who are in high risk groups that have an ongoing risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

'''Hellboy''' is a fictional [[superhero]] created by writer-artist [[Mike Mignola]]. The character first appeared in ''San Diego Comic-Con Comics'' #2 (August [[1993 in comics|1993]]), and has since appeared in various [[eponym]]ous [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and [[intercompany crossover]]s. The character has been adapted into two live-action feature films in [[Hellboy (2004 film)|2004]] and [[Hellboy II: The Golden Army|2008]] that starred [[Ron Perlman]] in the title role, and two [[Hellboy Animated|straight-to-DVD animated films]], as well as three video games – ''[[Hellboy: Asylum Seeker|Asylum Seeker]]'', ''[[Hellboy: The Science of Evil|The Science of Evil]]'', and as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]''. A [[Hellboy (2019 film)|film reboot]] starring [[David Harbour]] is set for release in 2019.

A well-meaning half-[[demon]] whose true name is '''Anung Un Rama''' ("and upon his brow is set a crown of flame"), Hellboy was summoned from [[Hell]] to [[Earth]] as a baby on October 5th (given as his birth date by Mike Mignola&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thecomicbug.com/2011/08/20/mike-mignola-exclusive-hellboy-fury-print-at-the-comic-bug | title=Mike Mignola Exclusive Hellboy Fury Print at The Comic Bug! | accessdate=2011-10-06 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051033/http://thecomicbug.com/2011/08/20/mike-mignola-exclusive-hellboy-fury-print-at-the-comic-bug/ | archivedate=2012-04-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultists]] (spawning his hatred for the [[Third Reich]]). He was discovered by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the "Right Hand of Doom"). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted [[peanut|peanuts]]. Although a bit gruff, he shows none of the malevolence thought to be intrinsic to classical demons, and has an ironic sense of humor. This is said to be because of his upbringing under Professor Bruttenholm, who raised him as a normal boy.

Hellboy works for the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|B.P.R.D.]], an [[international]] non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[witches]], in a series of tales that have their roots in [[folklore]], [[pulp magazine]]s, vintage adventure, [[Lovecraftian horror]] and [[horror fiction]]. In earlier stories, he is identified as the "World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator".

==Fictional character biography==
{{plot|date=July 2017}}
Hellboy, or "Anung Un Rama" as he was called, was conceived on October 5, 1617, the day his birth-mother Sarah Hughes was on her deathbed. In life, Sarah was a witch who gained her powers from being a consort of the demon Azzael&lt;!-- Hellboy's father is called in comic Azzael not Azazel. --&gt;, a duke of Hell who is Hellboy's "biological" father. Taking Sarah's body to hell when she attempted to repent on her deathbed within a church in [[East Bromwich]], [[England]], Azzael burned her away so their child would be born, and chopped off the newborn's right hand to replace it with the "Right Hand of Doom", a relic tied to the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. When the other princes of Hell learned of his actions, Azzael sent his half-demon child away while he was stripped of his powers and imprisoned in ice (like [[Lucifer]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'').

The child is eventually summoned to Earth in the final months of [[World War II]] by the "Mad Monk" [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]] on Tarmagant Island, off the coast of [[Scotland]], having been commissioned by the [[Nazism and occultism|Nazis]] to change the tide of a losing war ("[[Project Ragna Rok]]"). As a direct result of this ritual, the child appears on Earth in a fireball at what remained of the ruined Bromwich Church on December 23, 1944. Proving not to be a [[devil]], in the traditional sense, but a devil-like creature, the child was dubbed "Hellboy" by Professor Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken by the [[United States Armed Forces]] to an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base in [[New Mexico]], Hellboy is raised by Professor Bruttenholm and the [[United States Army]] where the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (BPRD), a private organization dedicated to combating [[occult]] threats, begins. Due to the success of his first mission in 1952, Hellboy is granted "honorary human" status by the [[United Nations]] and becomes a member of the BPRD as the "world's greatest paranormal investigator".&lt;ref&gt;''Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: 1952 #5''. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Hellboy interacts regularly with humans, primarily law enforcement officials, the military, and various "scholars of the weird", most of whom are not presented as overtly reacting to his strange appearance.

As an adult, having matured physically within years and aging slowly while having a teenaged mind, Hellboy becomes the primary agent for the BPRD, alongside other human and quasi-human agents that include [[Kate Corrigan]], a professor of [[folklore]] at [[New York University]]; [[Abe Sapien]], an [[amphibian]] [[humanoid]] (''Ichthyo sapiens''); and [[Liz Sherman]], a young [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]. Things change for Hellboy during the events of ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction|Seed of Destruction]]'' when he finds Professor Bruttenholm after he disappears in an expedition in the Arctic, and witnesses his adopted father's death at the hands of a Lovecraftian frog monster. The search takes Hellboy, Abe and Liz to the Cavendish Hall mansion, which is a trap established by Rasputin to lure Hellboy into an embrace of his own "destiny", with the assistance of Sadu-Hem: one of the spawn of the Ogdru Jahad. Controlled by the spirit of one of the ancestral Cavendish men, Abe impales Rasputin. Liz's firestorm then incinerates Rasputin's body alongside Sadu-Hem's, and destroys Cavendish Hall. Soon after, during a visit to Bromwich Church, Hellboy gets a glimpse of his conception 300+ years ago, and learns he has two human half siblings: a nun and a priest whose spirits haunt the church after their deaths, attempting to stop Azzael from claiming Sarah.

During the events of ''[[Hellboy: Wake the Devil]]'', Hellboy's journey of self-discovery leads him to Romania to investigate the theft of an ancient box containing the corpse of Vladimir Giurescu, a Napoleonic officer who was in fact a vampire before he was "killed" on the order of a fearful Adolf Hitler. The culprit of the theft is revealed to be Ilsa Haupstein, one of the surviving members of Project Ragna Rok, who was revived from suspended animation and then aided in Giurescu's resurrection. Finding Castle Giurescu after splitting up with the other search groups, Hellboy learns that the source of Giurescu's rebirth is the ancient goddess [[Hecate]]. Though Hellboy destroys Hecate's original body, he faces her again after Rasputin unintentionally provides her with Ilsa's iron-maiden encased body. Hecate swallows Hellboy, but he returns to his own reality after he denounces the dark purpose he was born to perform.

Hellboy later learns that Liz is dying after losing her powers when she accidentally revived a homunculus while searching another location for Giurescu, finding [[Roger (Hellboy)|Roger]] in the events of ''[[Hellboy: Almost Colossus]]'' as he convinces the homunculus to save Liz's life. Following the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#The Right Hand of Doom|Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom]]'', gaining insight about his stone hand and being referenced as a harbinger of the Apocalypse, Hellboy is accompanied by Abe to hunt down the warlock Igor Bromhead in ''Box Full of Evil''. But it turned out to be a trap conducted by Bromhead and the demon Ualac to capture Hellboy so that the latter can claim Hellboy's normally invisible Crown of the Apocalypse. But this act allows Hellboy to no longer be controlled by his true name as he kills Ualac's mortal body before the demon and the crown are taken to Hell by the demon Astaroth, who is later revealed to be Hellboy's paternal uncle.

In the aftermath of ''[[Hellboy: Conqueror Worm]]'', assisted by the ghost of [[Lobster Johnson]], Roger, and Abe, a disillusioned Hellboy resigns from the Bureau before it later gains new agents in [[Johann Kraus]], the spirit of a German medium kept in a containment suit; and Captain [[Ben Daimio]], a [[special operations]] soldier that became an [[Olmec were-jaguar]]. From there, Hellboy decides to find out the truth of his existence once and for all. But, as revealed in ''[[Hellboy: Strange Places]]'', Hellboy ends up being stranded on an island where he inadvertently resurrected an ancient mystic who gained knowledge of the secret history of the creation of Ogdru Jahad and the Right Hand of Doom.

Six years later, as ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]'' opens, Hellboy's search takes him to England where he finds himself in the middle of a power vacuum caused by Bromhead incapacitating Hecate in Italy. Refusing to serve the witches as their king, Hellboy ends up in the dimension of Baba Yaga, a witch whom he encountered in the past and happens to be an ally of Rasputin's. Managing to defeat Baba Yaga's champion Koshchei, Hellboy returns to his reality and is led to Bromhead after he became monstrous and in agony from his attempt to take Hecate's powers for his own. Hellboy gives Bromhead a merciful death before returning to England during the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Wild Hunt]]'' where he encounters Alice Monaghan, a young woman he saved as a baby from a fairy named Gruagach who has revived the lunatic sorceress Nimue to fill the void left by Hecate.

During that time, Hellboy encounters the spirit of [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana le Fay]] who reveals to Hellboy both the names of his parents and that Sarah Hughes was her descendant, which names Hellboy as the last living heir to [[Arthur Pendragon]] and the rightful king of England.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellboy: The Wild Hunt'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; But as he also learns from Astaroth that he is destined to kill [[Satan]] and become the new king of Hell, Hellboy is reluctant to wield [[Excalibur]] and the army of undead British nobility amassed to face Nimue's army. Therefore, enlisting Baba Yaga's assistance with his eye as payment for the injury he did to her in their first meeting, Hellboy decides to face Nimue one-on-one in the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Storm and the Fury]]''. But in the aftermath of his battle with Nimue, who was possessed by Ogdru Jahad at the time, Hellboy is killed by the witch in her final moments. As revealed in ''[[Hellboy in Hell]]'', Hellboy ends up trapped in Hell, where he encounters what's left of his demonic kin and the souls of the damned, and ultimately comes to terms with the destiny he has been shrugging off his whole life.

==Powers and abilities==
Afforded by his demonic heritage as well as extensive physical training and bodybuilding, Hellboy possess superhuman strength that exceeds the 1 ton base limit, endurance, a degree of resistance to injury, and a [[healing factor]] that allows him to heal quickly from virtually all bodily injuries as well as renders him immune to all diseases. He also has the innate ability to comprehend ancient and magical languages. The extent of his strength is unclear, but he has torn down a large tree and hurled it at an opponent and has lifted massive stones. He has also picked up and thrown opponents weighing at least four to five hundred pounds. Hellboy has a high degree of resilience to injury. He can withstand powerful blows that would severely injure or kill a human. He survived being shot many times in the chest with an [[MG 42]] machine gun before destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Army''&lt;/ref&gt; He has survived being impaled through the chest with a sword, severe werewolf mauling, being beaten unconscious with heavy iron tongs, falling from extreme heights, being crushed by boulders, and more. In the film version it is stated that Hellboy is immune to all forms of fire and burns, including Liz Sherman's flames, and electrocution. Despite his ability to quickly recover from seemingly mortal wounds, he is far from invulnerable, and can be injured or bloodied by conventional weapons. It is revealed to [[Baba Yaga]] by the dead Russian nobility that Hellboy may not be slain even through supernatural means and that he appears to be as deathless as her warrior, [[Koschei]] the Deathless.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellboy: Darkness Calls''&lt;/ref&gt; In the films, Hellboy has shown skill in [[necromancy]], animating a man's dead body so that it could give him directions.

Hellboy ages very differently from humans. In the story ''Pancakes'' he is two years old but appears to be somewhere between 6 and 10 human years old. In ''Nature of the Beast'', set in 1954, the ten-year-old Hellboy appears fully grown. His rapid physical maturation is in contrast to his actual rate of aging, however, which seems to be much slower than humans. Throughout the sixty-year span of time depicted in the comics, he does not age beyond the plateau of physical maturity. This mystical aging process is similar to the other demons and supernatural beings that populate Hellboy's world. The lifespan of a demon, or half-demon as Hellboy's mother was human, are left undefined within the comics and seem to range from decades to many thousands of years. In the movies, Hellboy's aging process is described by BRPD as "reverse [[List of unusual units of measurement#Dog year|dog years]]".

In addition to his natural physical abilities, Hellboy carries a variety of items in his utility belt and jacket that can be used against various supernatural forces. He has been known to carry [[holy relic]]s, horseshoes, various herbs, and [[hand grenade]]s. Though he commonly carries [[Good Samaritan (comics)|an oversized revolver]], Hellboy freely admits to being a lousy shot and often fights [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]], preferring to use short-ranged physical weapons like swords, spears, and his massive stone fist over firearms. Hellboy's lack of formal combat training and education is compensated for by his decades of experience as a paranormal investigator, though encounters with unfamiliar threats have often forced him to resort to improvisation and using his wits.

===Right Hand of Doom===
As revealed in ''Strange Places'', Hellboy's right hand was originally the right hand of Anum, one of the "greater spirits" that watched over the burgeoning Earth and created the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. After sealing the Ogdru Jahad away, Anum was destroyed by his fellow spirits. Only his right hand remained intact as it was kept and preserved by many races throughout history, including the first race of man. The Right Hand of Doom eventually ended up in the possession of Azzael before he grafted it onto the newborn Hellboy.

As the hand which created and bound the Ogdru Jahad, it is also the key which will "loose and command" them; in other words, it is a catalyst that will bring about [[Ragnarok]]. The comic books themselves never mention how the Right Hand of Doom would actually perform these tasks; they only explain this is the case and someone or something intends to do it with or without Hellboy's consent. The film shows it working like a key: being turned twice in a special obelisk secured by Rasputin would release the Ogdru Jahad. It is made clear it is not necessary for the arm to be attached to Hellboy to perform its duties. It has been suggested if Hellboy dies while the Hand is attached to him, it would become useless. He has therefore concluded the only way to prevent its falling into the wrong hands is to keep and protect it.

==Concept and creation==
Hellboy originated with a drawing [[Mike Mignola]] did at a [[comic book convention]] of a demon with the name "Hellboy" written on his belt. Mignola had no intention of doing anything serious with the concept, but eventually decided he liked the name.&lt;ref name="Back21"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Irving|first= Christopher|date= April 2007|title= The Genesis of Hellboy|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 3–5|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Mignola became interested in doing a creator-owned comic, as he felt it made more sense to create his own characters for the stories he wanted to tell, rather than trying to shoehorn existing characters into these stories. Mignola elaborated, "The kinds of stories I wanted to do I had in mind before I created Hellboy. It’s not like I created Hellboy and said, 'Hey, now what does this guy do?' I knew the kinds of stories I wanted to do, but just needed a main guy." He initially created Hellboy as part of a team of five, but scrapped this idea when he realized he could not think of any team names that he liked.&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt;

Much like other American comic book superheroes such as [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], Hellboy is constantly tormented by the knowledge of his past. One example being in ''Wake the Devil'' where he describes his mindset since the aftermath of ''Seed of Destruction'' by saying, "I ''like'' not knowing. I've gotten by for fifty-two years without knowing. I sleep good ''not knowing''."

==Publication history==
{{See also|List of Hellboy comics}}
Before ''Hellboy'' was published independently at Dark Horse Comics, the concept was initially pitched to a board of directors for [[DC Comics]], who loved it, but did not like the idea of it involving "Hell".{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bamkapow.com/hellboy2-tokens.php |title=Hellboy II: The Golden Army |work=Bam!

The early stories were conceived and drawn by Mignola with a script written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and some later stories have been crafted by creators other than Mignola, including [[Christopher Golden]], [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]], [[Ryan Sook]], and [[Duncan Fegredo]]. The increasing commitments from the ''Hellboy'' franchise meant that the 2008 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''In the Chapel of Moloch'' was the first ''Hellboy'' comic Mignola had provided the script and art for since ''The Island'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18580 | title=Going to the Chapel: Mignola Returns to Drawing ''Hellboy'' | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===
Beyond the ''Hellboy'' comic and its associated spin-offs, Hellboy has made appearances in other publications:

====Great Salt Lake Comic-Con pamphlet====
The character name "Hell Boy" was included in a drawing by Mike Mignola of a demon character in a black and white illustration, with the later recognized name appearing on the demon's belt buckle. This image, accompanied by a short biography of Mike Mignola and his latest creation, appeared in the pamphlet in 1991. It is the first published mention of the later recognized name. This image was reprinted in'' The Art of Hellboy''.

====''Dime Press''====
A prototype incarnation of Hellboy appeared on the cover of ''Dime Press'' #4 (Glamour International Production, 1993), an obscure Italian fanzine, with "Hellboy©Mignola 93" written at the bottom of the cover. The cover, illustrated by Mignola and by the Italian artist [[Nicola Mari]], show Hellboy in the act of attacking a "diabolic" version of the Italian SF comic book character [[Nathan Never]] (with bat wings and pointed tail). Mari at the time was one of the artists that worked on Nathan Never, and the first two years of life of this comic were the main topic of the fanzine. With the exception of the cover, there is no other mention of Hellboy within the fanzine. The character shown was still in a draft stage, and although close to the final design of Hellboy, it had gray skin and an outfit not common to the character.

====''San Diego Comic-Con Comics''====
''Mike Mignola's Hellboy'' by Mike Mignola and John Byrne featured the character's first full appearance, and was a four-page black-and-white story that had an approximately 1,500 book print run. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in ''San Diego Comic-Con Comics'' #2 (August 1993) for distribution at the [[Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] [[comic book convention|convention]] held in [[San Diego]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="HBSDC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hellboy.com/_rev1/comic_1993-sdcc2.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707120729/http://www.hellboy.com/_rev1/comic_1993-sdcc2.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2009-07-07 | title=''San Diego Comic Con Comics'' #2 | accessdate=2009-02-21 | work=Hellboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellboy travels to an American [[ghost town]], where he encounters a mangy mutt that transforms into [[Anubis]], the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian god of [[mummy|mummification]].&lt;ref name=SDBook&gt;{{Cite book | first=Mike | last=Mignola | year=2004 | title=Hellboy: Seed of Destruction | publisher=Dark Horse Comics | isbn=978-1-59307-094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was collected in the trade paperback ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction]]''.&lt;ref name="SDTPB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/12-743/Hellboy-Volume-1-Seed-of-Destruction-TPB | title=Hellboy: Seed of Destruction | accessdate=2009-02-21 | work=Dark Horse Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Next Men''====
Hellboy makes a guest appearance in John Byrne's ''Next Men'' #21; this is the first American appearance in a full color cameo.

====Comics Buyer's Guide====
''Mike Mignola's Hellboy: World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator'' by Mike Mignola and John Byrne featured the character's next solo appearance. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a special four-page mini-comic for distribution in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1,070 (May 20, 1994).&lt;ref name="HBCGC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hellboy.com/_rev1/comic_1994-cbg.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707113144/http://www.hellboy.com/_rev1/comic_1994-cbg.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2009-07-07 | title=Mike Mignola's Hellboy: World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator | accessdate=2009-02-21 | work=Hellboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story Hellboy battles with the disembodied head of Nazi scientist [[Herman von Klempt]] and his puppet henchman Brutus the Gorilla to rescue a captive girl from the doctor's transference of nutrient fluids process.&lt;ref name=SDBook /&gt;

The story was collected in the trade paperback ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction]]''.&lt;ref name="SDTPB"/&gt;

====''Celebrate Diversity''====
''Hi, My Name is Hellboy'' by Mike Mignola was a one-page panel ad that related the character's fictional origins. It was published by [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] in catalog supplement ''Celebrate Diversity'' collector's edition (October 1994).&lt;ref name="HBCD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hellboy.com/_rev1/comic_1994-cdce.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707111307/http://www.hellboy.com/_rev1/comic_1994-cdce.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2009-07-07 | title=Celebrate Diversity (Collector's Edition) | accessdate=2009-02-21 | work=Hellboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad was collected in the trade paperback ''The Art of Hellboy''.

''Hellboy: The First 20 Years'' was published 1 April 2014.

====''Hellboy'' (2004)====
{{Main article|Hellboy (2004 film)}}
The film was directed and co-written by [[Guillermo del Toro]] and starred [[Ron Perlman]] as Hellboy (the favorite of both del Toro and Mignola for the role), [[Selma Blair]] as [[Liz Sherman]], [[Rupert Evans]] as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] John Myers (a character created for the film), [[John Hurt]] as Professor [[Trevor Bruttenholm]], [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as [[Abe Sapien]] (voiced by an uncredited [[David Hyde Pierce]]), [[Karel Roden]] as [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]], and [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as FBI Senior Special Agent [[Tom Manning (comics)|Tom Manning]]. The film depicts Hellboy as living at the BPRD with a dozen cats and limited access to the outside world, and considered an [[urban legend]] by the general populace.

====''Hellboy II: The Golden Army'' (2008)====

{{Main article|Hellboy II: The Golden Army}}
A sequel, ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', was shot in Budapest by [[Guillermo del Toro]] and released in 2008, with Perlman and Blair returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15863 |title=Universal Pictures Picks Up Hellboy 2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806085706/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15863 |archivedate=August 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones also returned as Abe Sapien (undubbed this time), and also in two other roles: The Angel of Death and The Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/774/774138p1.html | title=Start Date for Hellboy 2 Confirmed | work=[[IGN]] | date=March 20, 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Revolution Studios]] had planned on making the film (which [[Columbia Pictures]] was to distribute), but the studio went out of business before filming. [[Universal Studios]] then picked it up. The plot is a shift to more folklore rather than action, with heavy European overtones. The character of [[Johann Krauss]] was added to the team, voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]. The character [[Roger (Hellboy)|Roger the Homunculus]] was not, but he was written into the plot as a very prominent character in early drafts of the script. The character of Agent Myers from the first film does not return, his absence being explained by Liz remarking that Hellboy had him transferred to [[Antarctica]] out of jealousy. Hellboy also reveals himself to the outside world in this film, and Liz is revealed to be pregnant with his children, twins. On November 11, 2008, ''Hellboy II: The Golden Army'' was released on DVD.

====Canceled sequel====

{{Main article|Hellboy II: The Golden Army #Sequel}}
A sequel for ''Hellboy II: The Golden Army'' was in development in 2009, entitled ''Hellboy III: Dark Worlds'', with [[Guillermo del Toro]] slated to return as the film's director and writer as well as [[Ron Perlman]], [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Selma Blair]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]] were set to reprise their roles. In the sequel, Hellboy would live his normal life as a father for his two newborn twins with [[Liz Sherman]], but also has to face an extremely powerful enemy who wishes to rule and bring the darkness upon [[Earth]]. In 2017, it was announced that the sequel was canceled due to the difficulty of funding the film, and a reboot would happen instead.

===Animation===
{{Main article|Hellboy Animated}}
On November 9, 2005, [[IDT Entertainment]] issued a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idt.net/about/press/story.aspx?id=12708 | work=IDT Corporation | title=IDT Entertainment Licenses Animation Rights to Hellboy From Revolution Studios | date=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing that the company had licensed the rights to develop "animated content for television and home entertainment" based on the ''Hellboy'' comic. [[Ron Perlman]] (Hellboy), [[Selma Blair]] (Liz Sherman), [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] (Abe Sapien) and [[John Hurt]] (Professor Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm) have all voiced their respective characters. Actress [[Peri Gilpin]] joined the cast as Professor [[Kate Corrigan]].

The first two 75-minute animated movies, ''[[Hellboy: Sword of Storms|Sword of Storms]]'' and ''[[Hellboy: Blood and Iron|Blood and Iron]]'', were aired on [[Cartoon Network]] before being released on [[DVD]]. The first one aired October 28, 2006, and the second aired March 17, 2007.

Both stories have much more in common with the comic book ''Hellboy'' rather than the film — [[Abe Sapien]] is not psychic, for example, and the artwork and color palette is derived more closely to Mignola's original artwork. The DVD of ''Sword of Storms'' was released on February 6, 2007; it contains documentary material commentary and a ''Hellboy'' comic, "Phantom Limbs". ''Blood and Iron'' similarly contains a comic called "The Yearning".

After the initial release, some stores included exclusive giveaways with copies of the ''Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron'' DVD:
* [[Best Buy]]: A 7" Hellboy figure.
* [[Walmart]]: An 80-page digest titled ''The Judgment Bell''.
* Transworld: A 64-page ''Hellboy Digest''.
* Infinity: A [[Lobster Johnson]] magnet.
* [[Circuit City (1949 company)|Circuit City]] - A Hellboy "Bust Up".

A "Hellboy 2 Pak" limited edition DVD set was released July 1, 2008, that contained both films and a 7" figure.

A third animated Hellboy film, ''The Phantom Claw'', has been put on hold. [[Tad Stones]], director and writer of the direct-to-video movies, says the film will star [[Lobster Johnson]] and will have some familiar characters, but Abe and Liz will not be in the film (at least not as main characters).

===Novels and anthologies===
[[Christopher Golden]] has written several [[novel]]s about the character, the first two of which, ''The Lost Army'' and ''The Bones of Giants'', are part of the official ''Hellboy'' story canon. The events of both these novels are listed in the comic's official timeline featured in ''Hellboy: The Companion''. In particular, the Golden-penned character of Anastasia Bransfield was also described in the companion, despite having never actually appeared in a comic.

[[Herman von Klempt]] and his war ape Kriegaffe #10 were slated to make appearances. On May 9, 2006, it was revealed that the ''Hellboy'' game would appear in the summer of 2007, on [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game was released in North America on June 24, 2008 with the name ''[[Hellboy: The Science of Evil]]''. It is developed by [[Krome Studios]], and published by Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. As well as single player campaign where the player gets to play as Hellboy the game also features co-op play, featuring the characters [[Abe Sapien]] and [[Liz Sherman]].  Two additional levels and [[Lobster Johnson]] as a playable character (voiced by [[Bruce Campbell]]) as DLC were developed but were unreleased. 

A ''Hellboy'' video game called ''Hellboy II: The Golden Army - Tooth Fairy Terror'' was released for the [[iPhone]] by Tuesday Creative on January 14, 2009.

Hellboy is a playable DLC character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Michael-Leon Wooley]] as part of the "Fighter Pack 2". The character was released for download on Tuesday, November 14, 2017. He is brought to Injustice universe by Brainiac who decides to add him to his collection as he is fascinated by Hellboy's human-like mind and personality despite being a demon. In his ending, Hellboy escapes from Brainiac's collection and defeats him. As a result he is asked to assist in rounding up local supervillains before eventually returning to the B.P.R.D. but finds his work there unfulfilling and ends up retiring to Africa.

'''Hendrick Rudolf "Henk" Chin A Sen''' ({{zh|t=陳亞先|zh|s=陈亚先|p=Chén Yàxiān}}; 18 January 1934 – 11 August 1999) was a [[Suriname]]se politician who served as the [[President of Suriname]] from 15 August 1980 until 4 February 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1218515.stm|title=Timeline: Suriname|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Chin A Sen was born in the town of [[Albina, Suriname|Albina]], on 18 January 1934. He studied medicine at the medical school of [[Paramaribo]] and graduated in 1959. From 1959-1961, he began a general practice, then went to the Netherlands to specialize as an internist. When he returned to Suriname, he worked in the Sint Vincentius hospital in Paramaribo. Then he joined the ''[[Nationalist Republican Party (Suriname)|Nationalist Republican Party]]'' (PNR), a party which pursued the independence of Suriname, although he was not very active.

On 15 March 1980, after the [[1980 Surinamese coup d'état|Sergeants Coup]], which brought [[Dési Bouterse]] and his military council to power, Chin A Sen was installed as [[Prime Minister of Suriname]]. The appointment of the non-politically active Chin A Sen came as a surprise. Chin A Sen formed a leftist cabinet which also included two members of the National Military Council (NMR). On 15 August 1980, after President [[Johan Ferrier]] resigned, Chin A Sen assumed the post of [[President of Suriname|President]] as well. However, Bouterse and Chin A Sen soon fell out. Bouterse sought a society with a socialist and revolutionary base in which the NMR would pull the strings in the background while Chin A Sen sought the restoration of democracy.

On 4 February 1982, Chin A Sen was sacked by Bouterse and exiled himself first to [[Pittsburgh]] in the United States and then to the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, after the [[December murders]] of 1982, Chin A Sen was chosen as Chairman of the Council for the Liberation of Suriname. The Council opposed the reign of Bouterse and his supporters, but it was not very successful. Chin A Sen was later in connection with [[Ronnie Brunswijk]] and his [[Jungle Commando]], who waged an armed struggle against Bouterse.

An attack in [[Rijswijk]] in 1985 in which 3 people died during a meeting of the Council for the Liberation, was probably directed against Chin A Sen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1985/08/13/020.html|title=Intento de atentado|accessdate =7 January 2010|author = Agencias|date = 1985-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, not present at that moment.

In 1995, Chin A Sen returned to Paramaribo, where he resumed his work as an internist. He died at the age of 65 in Paramaribo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2599433/1999/08/12/Arts-premier-kon-Bouterse-niet-aan.dhtml|title=Trouw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herman H. Spitz''' is an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] known for his work measuring [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] among those with [[developmental disability]]. He was Director of Research at the [[E.R. Johnstone Training and Research Center]], which was a State Institution for upper level mentally retarded adolescents and young adults, in Bordentown, New Jersey, until he retired in 1989. He worked under the direction of the Superintendent John M. Wall, who retired in 1990 having served from August 1969.

Spitz studied concepts such as [[mental age]],&lt;ref name="mentalage"&gt;Spitz HH (1982). Intellectual Extremes, Mental Age, and the Nature of Human Intelligence. ''Merrill-Palmer Quarterly'' v28 n2 p167-92 Apr 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and the abilities of [[autistic savant]]s.&lt;ref name="savants"&gt;Spitz HH (1995). Calendar calculating idiots savants and the smart unconscious. ''New Ideas in Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; He co-authored a survey of attempts to raise intelligence among people with [[mental retardation]].&lt;ref name="retarded"&gt;Spitz HH (1986). The Raising of Intelligence: A Selected History of Attempts to Raise Retarded Intelligence. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; He reported on programs like the Carolina Abecedarian Early Intervention Project which advocated the early education of poor children.&lt;ref name="abecedarian"&gt;Spitz HH (1992). Does the Carolina Abecedarian Early Intervention Project Prevent Sociocultural Mental Retardation? ''Intelligence'' v16 n2 p225-37 Apr-Jun 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Through use of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]], he reported that the [[Flynn effect]] of massive [[intelligence quotient]] gains in a single generation in many nations only applied to people in the average intelligence range.&lt;ref name="weschler"&gt;Spitz HH (1989). Variations in Wechsler Interscale IQ Disparities at Different Levels of IQ. ''Intelligence'' v13 n2 p157-67 Apr-Jun 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He also looked at the hereditarian hypothesis for [[general intelligence factor]] by examining Wechsler subtest patterns among mentally retarded test-takers.&lt;ref name="subtest"&gt;Spitz HH (1988). Wechsler Subtest Patterns of Mentally Retarded Groups: Relationship to "g" and to Estimates of Heritability. ''Intelligence'' v12 n3 p279-97 Jul-Sep 1988&lt;/ref&gt; He published 2 books and over 100 papers in scholarly journals and books. His last book was Nonconscious Movements: From Mystical Messages to Facilitated Communication, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1997).

In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.&lt;/ref&gt;" an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the measurement and significance of intelligence following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

The terminology used to describe the symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, has gone through many changes over history, including "minimal brain damage", "minimal brain dysfunction", "learning/behavioral disabilities" and "hyperactivity".  In the second edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], known as [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-II .281968.29|DSM-II]] (1968), the condition was called "Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood".  It was in the 1980 [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-III .281980.29|DSM-III]] that "ADD (Attention-Deficit Disorder) with or without hyperactivity" was introduced.  In 1987 this label was further refined to "ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)" in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-III-R .281987.29|DSM-III-R]] and subsequent editions, including the current [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adhd-federation.org/publications/adhd-a-historical-overview/|title=Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder: An illustrated historical overview|editor1-last=Warnke|editor1-first=Andreas|editor2-last=Riederer|editor2-first=Christian|date=May 2013|website=World Federation of ADHD|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
A number of early writers described human behaviour patterns similar to today's definitions of ADHD.

===Melchior Adam Weikard===
In 1775, Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician, published the textbook ''[[Der Philosophische Arzt]]''.  Weikard's text contained a description of ADHD-like behaviours, possibly the first ever such description in medical literature&lt;ref name="BarkleyPeters"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Barkley | first1 = Russell A. | last2 = Peters | first2 = Helmut | title = The earliest reference to ADHD in the medical literature? Melchior Adam Weikard's description in 1775 of attention deficit (Mangel der Aufmerksamkeit, Attentio Volubilis) | journal = Journal of Attention Disorders | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 623-30 |date=November 2012 | doi = 10.1177/1087054711432309 | PMID = 22323122 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weikard described many of the symptoms now associated with the inattentive dimension of ADHD in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].  For instance, according to the English translation provided by Barkley and Peters, Weikard stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An inattentive person won't remark anything but will be shallow everywhere. He studies his matters only superficially; his judgements are erroneous and he misconceives the worth of things because he does not spend enough time and patience to search a matter individually or by the piece with the adequate accuracy.  Such people only hear half of everything; they memorize or inform only half of it or do it in a messy manner. According to a proverb they generally know a little bit of all and nothing of the whole…. They are mostly reckless, often copious considering imprudent projects, but they are also most inconstant in execution. They treat everything in a light manner since they are not attentive enough to feel denigration or disadvantages.&lt;ref name="BarkleyPeters"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Weikard, the treatment recommended was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The inattentive person is to be separated from the noise or any other objects; he is to be kept solitary, in the dark, when he is too active. The easily agile fibres are to be fixated by rubbing, cold baths, steel powder, [[cinchona]], mineral waters, horseback riding, and gymnastic exercises.&lt;ref name="BarkleyPeters" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sir Alexander Crichton===
Scottish-born physician and author, Sir [[Alexander Crichton]] described, in 1798, a mental state much like the inattentive subtype of ADHD, in his book ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Mental Derangement.''&lt;ref name="Crichton1798"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Crichton |author-link=Alexander Crichton |chapter=On Attention and its diseases |title=An Inquiry Into the Nature and Origin of Mental Derangement: Comprehending a Concise System of the Physiology and Pathology of the Human Mind. And a History of the Passions and Their Effects|volume=1 |url={{google books|XlRJAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=19 June 2013 |year=1798 |location=London |publisher=T. Cadell, Junior, and W. Davies |pages=254-90 |chapter-url={{google books|XlRJAAAAYAAJ|page=254|plainurl=yes}} |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crichton had received some of his medical training in Germany and may well have known Weikard given that his training occurred in several of the towns where Weikard was known to have practiced medicine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} More detailed in his observation than Weikard, Crichton described attention problems as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object, almost always arises from an unnatural or morbid sensibility of the nerves, by which means this faculty is incessantly withdrawn from one impression to another. It may be either born with a person, or it may be the effect of accidental diseases.

When born with a person it becomes evident at a very early period of life, and has a very bad effect, inasmuch as it renders him incapable of attending with constancy to any one object of education. But it seldom is in so great a degree as totally to impede all instruction; and what is very fortunate, it is generally diminished with age.&lt;ref name="Crichton1798" /&gt;{{Rp|[{{google books|XlRJAAAAYAAJ|page=271|plainurl=yes}} 271]}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crichton further observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this disease of attention, if it can with propriety be called so, every impression seems to agitate the person, and gives him or her an unnatural degree of mental restlessness. People walking up and down the room, a slight noise in the same, the moving of a table, the shutting a door suddenly, a slight excess of heat or of cold, too much light, or too little light, all destroy constant attention in such patients, inasmuch as it is easily excited by every impression.&lt;ref name="Crichton1798" /&gt;{{Rp|[{{google books|XlRJAAAAYAAJ|page=272|plainurl=yes}} 272]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crichton noted that "…they have a particular name for the state of their nerves, which is expressive enough of their feelings. They say they have the ''fidgets''."&lt;ref name="Crichton1798" /&gt;{{Rp|[{{google books|XlRJAAAAYAAJ|page=272|plainurl=yes}} 272]}} Dr. Crichton suggested that these children needed special educational intervention and noted that it was obvious that they had a problem attending even how hard they did try.  "Every public teacher must have observed that there are many to whom the dryness and difficulties of the Latin and Greek grammars are so disgusting that neither the terrors of the rod, nor the indulgence of kind intreaty can cause them to give their attention to them."&lt;ref name="Crichton1798" /&gt;{{Rp|[{{google books|XlRJAAAAYAAJ|page=278|plainurl=yes}}  278]}}

Both Melchior Adam Weikard and Alexander Crichton wrote about the occupationally disabling features of this disorder, including attentional problems, restlessness, early onset, and how it can affect schooling, without any of the moralism introduced by George Still and later authors.&lt;ref name="Palmer2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=Erica D|last2=Finger|first2=Stanley|title=An Early Description of ADHD (Inattentive Subtype): Dr Alexander Crichton and ‘Mental Restlessness’ (1798)|journal=Child Psychology and Psychiatry Review|date=May 2001|volume=6|issue=2|pages=66–73|doi=10.1017/S1360641701002507|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===Sir George Frederic Still===
In March 1902, Sir [[George Frederic Still]] (1868–1941), known as the father of British [[paediatrics]], gave a series of lectures to the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in London under the name [[Goulstonian Lectures]] on ‘some abnormal psychical conditions in children’, which were published later the same year in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Still|first1=George F|title=The Goulstonian Lectures: On Some Abnormal Psychical Conditions in Children|journal=Lancet|date=12 April 1902|volume=159|issue=4102|pages=1008–1013|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)74984-7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673601749847}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He described 43 children who had serious problems with sustained attention and self-regulation, who were often aggressive, defiant, resistant to discipline, excessively emotional or passionate, which showed little inhibitory volition, and could not learn from the consequences of their actions; though their intellect was normal. He wrote: "I would point out that a notable feature in many of these cases of moral defect without general impairment of intellect is a quite abnormal incapacity for sustained attention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

Dr. Still wrote:  "there is a defect of moral consciousness which cannot be accounted for by any fault of environment". When Still was talking about moral control, he was referring to it as [[William James]] had done before him, but to Still, the moral control of behavior meant "the control of action in conformity with the idea of the good of all."&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

"Another boy, aged 6 years, with marked moral defect was unable to keep his attention even to a game for more than a very short time, and as might be expected, the failure of attention was very noticeable at school, with the result that in some cases the child was backward in school attainments, although in manner and ordinary conversation he appeared as bright and intelligent as any child could be."&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; He proposed a biological predisposition to this behavioral condition that was probably hereditary in some children and the result of pre- or postnatal injury in others.&lt;ref name="Palmer2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barkley|first1=Russell A.|title=The Relevance of the Still Lectures to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Commentary|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|date=November 2006|volume=10|issue=2|pages=137–140|pmid=17085623|doi=10.1177/1087054706288111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians of ADHD have inferred that the children Still described in his series of three published lectures to the Royal College of Physicians would likely have qualified for the current disorder of ADHD combined type, among other disorders.&lt;ref name="Palmer2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

The clinical definition of "ADHD" dates to the mid-20th century, but was known by other names. Physicians developed a diagnosis for a set of conditions variously referred to as "minimal brain damage", "minimal brain dysfunction", "minimal brain disorder", "learning/behavioral disabilities" and "hyperactivity". Some of these labels became problematic as knowledge expanded. For example, as awareness grew that many children with no indication of brain damage also displayed the syndrome, the label which included the words "brain damage" did not seem appropriate.

The DSM-II (1968) began to call it "Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood" even though the professionals were aware that many of the children so diagnosed exhibited attention deficits without any signs of hyperactivity. In 1980, the DSM-III introduced the term "ADD (Attention-Deficit Disorder) with or without hyperactivity." That terminology (ADD) technically expired with the revision in 1987 to ADHD in the DSM-III-R. In the DSM-IV, published in 1994, ADHD with sub-types was presented. The DSM-IV-TR was released in 2000, primarily to correct factual errors and make changes to reflect recent research; ADHD was largely unchanged.

Under the DSM-5, there are three ADHD presentations, including one which lacks the hyperactivity component. Approximately one-third of people with ADHD have the [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I)]], meaning that they do not have the hyperactive or overactive behavior components of the other ADHD presentations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kadi.myweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kadi.myweb.uga.edu/The_Development_of_the_DSM.html|title=The Development of the DSM|year=2004|website=The History of Psychiatric Classification: From Ancient Egypt to Modern America|last1=Moon|first1=Kathryn F.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232901/http://kadi.myweb.uga.edu/The_Development_of_the_DSM.html|archivedate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even today, the ADHD terminology is objectionable to many. There is some preference for using the ADHD-I, ADD, and AADD terminology when describing individuals lacking the hyperactivity component, especially among older adolescents and adults who find the term "hyperactive" inaccurate, inappropriate and even derogatory.

===Encephalitis epidemic 1917–1918===
The treatment of children with similar behavioral problems who had survived the epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]] from 1917 to  1918 and the pandemic of influenza from 1919 to 1920 led to terminology which referred to "brain damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ballas |first1=Paul |title=ADHD's Dynamic History: The Effects of Continuously Changing Diagnostic Criteria |url=http://www.healthcentral.com/adhd/c/7930/23979/adhds-history-effects |website=Health Central |publisher=Remedy Health Media |date=2 April 2008 |dead-url=no |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232935/http://www.healthcentral.com/adhd/c/7930/23979/adhds-history-effects |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also be called "post-encephalitic behavior disorder."  The association of symptoms similar to ADHD in the surviving children eventually led later authors to speculate that whenever the behavior pattern may be present, it may reflect an underlying disturbance of or damage to the brain.  The syndrome came to be known as brain-injured child syndrome, to be amended later to minimal brain damage, and subsequently to minimal brain dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Barkley |editor-first=Russell A. |date=2006 |title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |oclc=314550821 |isbn=978-1-59385-210-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lange|first1=Klaus W. |last2=Reichl|first2=Susanne |last3=Lange|first3=Katharina M. |last4=Tucha|first4=Lara |last5=Tucha|first5=Oliver |title=The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=ADHD Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders |date=30 November 2010 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=241-55 |doi=10.1007/s12402-010-0045-8 |doi-access=free |pmid=21258430 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12402-010-0045-8/fulltext.html |pmc=3000907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult ADHD Diagnostic Expansion===
In the 1970s, American research began to study the symptoms and development of children diagnosed with ADHD.

As analyzed by Conrad and Potter, "ironically, controversy about ADHD raises the public's awareness and increases the diffusion of information about the disorder, which can indirectly contribute to diagnostic expansion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''House Gymnastics''' is a [[sport]] created by [[James Robert Ford]] and [[Spencer Harrison]].

This fitness regime is akin to an indoor version of [[Parkour]] or an internet based, [[Fluxus]] "happening", which encourages maximum audience participation. The participant uses their surroundings in their house as apparatus. When someone performs House Gymnastics, the aim is to create human sculptures that last around 3 seconds. Viewers can sign up as members, submit photos and enter the Move of Month competition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Origins==
House Gymnastics originated during an attempt by Harrison and Ford to put up a bedroom blind. "The Brace" and "The 25th Element" were the first moves conceived. From there on in moves were being created on a daily basis. Language was developed to compliment the physicality of House Gymnastics, and new moves and areas of were given names. As such, words such as "busted" and "amped" were developed and entered the "House Gymnastics" vocabulary.

==Injuries==
Injuries due to the sport are seen as unfortunate, but inevitable,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/2718389.stm Keeping fit is child's play&lt;/ref&gt; and one reviewer of the site and product said it would be more likely to lead to a trip to the hospital than a thrill, for people who aren't trained professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BrZU29RvLx0C&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=%22house+gymnastics%22+harrison#PPA336,M1] The 505 Weirdest Online Stores&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypoxia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Surgical Diseases|last=Samuel|first=Jacob|last2=Franklin|first2=Cory|date=2008|location= New Yotk|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387752457|pages=391–94|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-75246-4_97}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate [[oxygen]] supply at the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] level. Hypoxia may be classified as either ''generalized'', affecting the whole body, or ''local'', affecting a region of the body. Although hypoxia is often a [[pathological]] condition, variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during [[hypoventilation training]]&lt;ref&gt;Woorons, Xavier, ''[http://www.hypoventilation-training.com/Activity.html Hypoventilation training, push your limits!]'' Arpeh, 2014, 164 pp. {{ISBN|978-2-9546040-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or strenuous physical exercise.

Hypoxia differs from [[hypoxemia]] and anoxemia in that hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient, whereas hypoxemia and anoxemia refer specifically to states that have low or zero arterial oxygen supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=West |first=John B. |title=Pulmonary Pathophysiology: The Essentials |year=1977 |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |pages=22 |isbn=978-0-683-08936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is referred to as '''anoxia'''.

Generalized hypoxia occurs in healthy people when they ascend to [[high altitude]], where it causes [[altitude sickness]] leading to potentially fatal complications: [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]) and [[high altitude cerebral edema]] ([[HACE]]).&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypoxia also occurs in healthy individuals when breathing mixtures of gases with a low oxygen content, e.g. while diving underwater especially when using closed-circuit [[rebreather]] systems that control the amount of oxygen in the supplied air. Mild, non-damaging intermittent hypoxia is used intentionally during [[altitude training]] to develop an athletic performance adaptation at both the systemic and cellular level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gore CJ, Clark SA, Saunders PU |title=Nonhematological mechanisms of improved sea-level performance after hypoxic exposure |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1600–09 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17805094 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3180de49d3 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-9131&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=1600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypoxia is a common complication of [[preterm birth]] in newborn infants. Because the lungs develop late in pregnancy, premature infants frequently possess underdeveloped lungs. To improve lung function, doctors frequently place infants at risk of hypoxia inside incubators (also known as humidicribs) that provide [[continuous positive airway pressure]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Generalized hypoxia==

The symptoms of generalized hypoxia depend on its severity and acceleration of onset.

In the case of [[altitude sickness]], where hypoxia develops gradually, the symptoms include [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Hypoesthesia|numbness]] / tingling of extremities, [[nausea]], and anoxia.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Grace |last2=Strading |first2=John |last3=West |first3=Sophie |title=Oxford Handbook of Respiratory Medicine |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=880 |isbn=978-0199545162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pia&gt;{{cite web |first=Pia |last=Bergqvist | url=http://www.flyingmag.com/technique/proficiency/preventing-hypoxia-what-do-now | title=Preventing Hypoxia: What To Do Now | work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms are often difficult to identify, but early detection of symptoms can be critical.&lt;ref name=pia&gt;{{cite web |first=Pia |last=Bergqvist | url=http://www.flyingmag.com/technique/proficiency/preventing-hypoxia-what-do-now | title=Preventing Hypoxia: What To Do Now | work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[hemoglobin]] is a darker red when it is not bound to oxygen ([[deoxyhemoglobin]]), as opposed to the rich red color that it has when bound to oxygen ([[oxyhemoglobin]]), when seen through the skin it has an increased tendency to reflect blue light back to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahrens |first1=Thomas |last2=Rutherford Basham  |first2=Kimberley |first3=|title=Essentials of Oxygenation: Implication for Clinical Practice |year=1993 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |page=194 |isbn=978-0867203325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where the oxygen is displaced by another molecule, such as carbon monoxide, the skin may appear 'cherry red' instead of cyanotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramrakha |first1=Punit |last2=Moore |first2=Kevin |title=Oxford Handbook of Acute Medicine |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=990 |isbn=978-0198520726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypoxia can cause [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], and injure the liver, among other deleterious effects.

==Local hypoxia==

If tissue is not being perfused properly, it may feel cold and appear pale; if severe, hypoxia can result in [[cyanosis]], a blue discoloration of the skin. If hypoxia is very severe, a tissue may eventually become gangrenous.
Extreme pain may also be felt at or around the site.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Tissue hypoxia from low oxygen delivery may be due to low haemoglobin concentration (anaemic hypoxia), low cardiac output (stagnant hypoxia) or low haemoglobin saturation (hypoxic hypoxia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pediatric Critical Care|last=Lacroix|first=Jacques|last2=Tucci|first2=Marisa|last3=Tinmouth|first3=Alan|last4=Gauvin|first4=France|last5=Karam|first5=Oliver|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323073073|pages=1162–76|doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-07307-3.10082-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of oxygen deprivation in tissues is a switch to anaerobic metabolism at the cellular level. As such, reduced systemic blood flow may result in increased serum lactate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hemodynamics and Cardiology: Neonatology Questions and Controversies|last=Kluckow|first=Martin|last2=Seri|first2=Istvan|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781437727630|pages=237–67|doi=10.1016/b978-1-4377-2763-0.00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serum lactate levels have been correlated with illness severity and mortality in critically ill adults and in ventilated neonates with respiratory distress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Cause==
Oxygen passively diffuses in the lung [[alveoli]] according to a pressure gradient. Oxygen diffuses from the breathed air, mixed with water vapour, to [[artery|arterial]] blood, where its partial pressure is around 100&amp;nbsp;mmHg (13.3&amp;nbsp;kPa).&lt;ref name="02_calc"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kenneth Baillie |author2=Alistair Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php | publisher= Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}} – Online interactive oxygen delivery calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; In the blood, oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, a protein in [[red blood cell]]s. The binding capacity of hemoglobin is influenced by the [[:wikt:partial pressure|partial pressure]] of oxygen in the environment, as described in the [[oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve]]. A smaller amount of oxygen is transported in solution in the blood.

In peripheral tissues, oxygen again diffuses down a pressure gradient into cells and their [[mitochondria]], where it is [[cellular respiration|used to produce energy]] in conjunction with the breakdown of [[glucose]], [[fat]]s, and some [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jae-Hwan |first=Lee |last2= Eun-Kyeong |first2=Shin |last3=Dongoh |first3=Lee |last4=Eui-Bae |first4=Jeung |date=April 2015 |title=SAT-532: Expression of Beta-Oxidation Related Genes Under Hypoxic Condition Induced Preeclamptic Model in Vitro and in Vivo |url=http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/endo-meetings.2015.CE.4.SAT-532 |journal=Endocrine Reviews |volume=36 |issue=2 |doi= 10.1210/endo-meetings.2015.CE.4.SAT-532|access-date=11 November 2016|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypoxia can result from a failure at any stage in the delivery of oxygen to cells. This can include decreased partial pressures of oxygen, problems with diffusion of oxygen in the lungs, insufficient available hemoglobin, problems with blood flow to the end tissue, and problems with breathing rhythm.

Experimentally, oxygen diffusion becomes rate limiting (and lethal) when arterial oxygen partial pressure falls to 60&amp;nbsp;mmHg (5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa) or below. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Almost all the oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin, so interfering with this carrier molecule limits oxygen delivery to the periphery. Hemoglobin increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood by about 40-fold,&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Lawrence|title=All you really need to know to interpret arterial blood gases|year=1999|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-683-30604-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment, a relationship described in the [[oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve]]. When the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen is interfered with, a hypoxic state can result.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Nicki R. Colledge |editor2=Brian R. Walker |editor3=Stuart H. Ralston |others= illustrated by Robert Britton|title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine.|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-3085-7|edition=21st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|997–999}}

===Ischemia===
{{Main article|Ischemia}}
[[Ischemia]], meaning insufficient blood flow to a tissue, can also result in hypoxia. This is called 'ischemic hypoxia'. This can include an [[embolus|embolic event]], a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that decreases overall blood flow, or trauma to a tissue that results in damage. An example of insufficient blood flow causing local hypoxia is [[gangrene]] that occurs in [[diabetes]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Diseases such as [[peripheral vascular disease]] can also result in local hypoxia. For this reason, symptoms are worse when a limb is used. Pain may also be felt as a result of increased hydrogen ions leading to a decrease in blood pH (acidity) created as a result of [[anaerobic metabolism]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Hypoxemic hypoxia===
{{Main article|Hypoxemia}}
This refers specifically to hypoxic states where the arterial content of oxygen is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=West |first=John B. |title=Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=La Jolla |year=2008 |pages=88–89 |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be caused by alterations in [[respiratory drive]], such as in [[respiratory alkalosis]], physiological or pathological shunting of blood, diseases interfering in lung function resulting in a [[ventilation-perfusion mismatch]], such as a [[pulmonary embolus]], or alterations in the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the environment or lung alveoli, such as may occur at altitude or when diving.

====Carbon monoxide poisoning====
{{Main article|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
[[Carbon monoxide]] competes with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin molecules. As carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin hundreds of times tighter than oxygen, it can prevent the carriage of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Douglas CG, Haldane JS, Haldane JB |title=The laws of combination of hemoglobin with carbon monoxide and oxygen|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=Jun 12, 1912|volume=44|issue=4|pages=275–304|pmid=16993128|pmc=1512793|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1912.sp001517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carbon monoxide]] poisoning can occur acutely, as with smoke intoxication, or over a period of time, as with cigarette smoking. Due to physiological processes, carbon monoxide is maintained at a resting level of 4–6 ppm. This is increased in urban areas (7–13 ppm) and in smokers (20–40 ppm).&lt;ref name = "CO ppm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wald|first=NJ|author2=Idle, M |author3=Boreham, J |author4=Bailey, A |title=Carbon monoxide in breath in relation to smoking and carboxyhaemoglobin levels.|journal=Thorax|date=May 1981|volume=36|issue=5|pages=366–69|pmid=7314006|pmc=471511|doi=10.1136/thx.36.5.366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A carbon monoxide level of 40 ppm is equivalent to a reduction in hemoglobin levels of 10 g/L.&lt;ref name = "CO ppm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The formula &lt;math&gt; Hb_{CO}(\%) = \frac {CO - 2.34} {5.09} &lt;/math&gt; can be used to calculate the amount of carbon monoxide-bound hemoglobin. For example, at carbon monoxide level of 5 ppm, &lt;math&gt;= \frac {5 - 2.34} {5.09} = .5\%&lt;/math&gt;, or a loss of half a percent of their blood's hemoglobin. (Wald et al., 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

CO has a second toxic effect, namely removing the allosteric shift of the oxygen dissociation curve and shifting the foot of the curve to the left.  In so doing, the hemoglobin is less likely to release its oxygens at the peripheral tissues.&lt;ref name = AllYouReally&gt;
Martin, Lawrence. (1992) All you really need to know to interpret arterial blood gases. 2nd edition {{ISBN|0-683-30604-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain [[hemoglobinopathies|abnormal hemoglobin variants]] also have higher than normal affinity for oxygen, and so are also poor at delivering oxygen to the periphery.

====Altitude====

Atmospheric pressure reduces with altitude and with it, the amount of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Netzer |first1=Nikolaus |last2=Strohl |first2=Kingman |last3=Faulhaber |first3=Martin |last4=Gatterer |first4=Hannes |last5=Burtscher |first5=Martin |title=Hypoxia‐Related Altitude Illnesses |journal=Journal of Travel Medicine |date=1 July 2013 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=247–55 |doi=10.1111/jtm.12017 |pmid=23809076 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/20/4/247/1830765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Netzer |first1=Nikolaus |last2=Strohl |first2=Kingman |last3=Faulhaber |first3=Martin |last4=Gatterer |first4=Hannes |last5=Burtscher |first5=Martin |title=Hypoxia‐Related Altitude Illnesses |journal=Journal of Travel Medicine |date=1 July 2013 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=247–55 |doi=10.1111/jtm.12017 |pmid=23809076 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/20/4/247/1830765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in the partial pressure of inspired oxygen at higher altitudes lowers the oxygen saturation of the blood, ultimately leading to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Netzer |first1=Nikolaus |last2=Strohl |first2=Kingman |last3=Faulhaber |first3=Martin |last4=Gatterer |first4=Hannes |last5=Burtscher |first5=Martin |title=Hypoxia‐Related Altitude Illnesses |journal=Journal of Travel Medicine |date=1 July 2013 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=247–55 |doi=10.1111/jtm.12017 |pmid=23809076 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/20/4/247/1830765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical features of altitude sickness include: sleep problems, dizziness, headache and oedema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Netzer |first1=Nikolaus |last2=Strohl |first2=Kingman |last3=Faulhaber |first3=Martin |last4=Gatterer |first4=Hannes |last5=Burtscher |first5=Martin |title=Hypoxia‐Related Altitude Illnesses |journal=Journal of Travel Medicine |date=1 July 2013 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=247–55 |doi=10.1111/jtm.12017 |pmid=23809076 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/20/4/247/1830765}}&lt;/ref&gt;i&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Netzer |first1=Nikolaus |last2=Strohl |first2=Kingman |last3=Faulhaber |first3=Martin |last4=Gatterer |first4=Hannes |last5=Burtscher |first5=Martin |title=Hypoxia‐Related Altitude Illnesses |journal=Journal of Travel Medicine |date=1 July 2013 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=247–55 |doi=10.1111/jtm.12017 |pmid=23809076 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/20/4/247/1830765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hypoxic breathing gases ====
{{main article|Inert gas asphyxiation|Asphyxiant gases}}
The [[breathing gas]] in [[scuba diving]] may contain an insufficient partial pressure of oxygen, particularly in malfunction of rebreathers. Such situations may lead to unconsciousness without symptoms since carbon dioxide levels are normal and the human body senses pure hypoxia poorly.

A similar problem exists when inhaling certain odorless [[asphyxiant gases]]. Asphyxiant gases reduce/displace the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air, where prolonged exposure to this hypoxic breathing gas leads to unconsciousness, followed by death by [[inert gas asphyxiation]] (suffocation).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sensidynegasdetection.com/gasinsite-gas-detection-blog/what-is-an-asphyxiant.php|title=What is an Asphyxiant? {{!}} Sensidyne|last=Sensidyne|website=www.sensidynegasdetection.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When oxygen level dips below 19.5% v/v, the air is considered oxygen-deficient, where oxygen concentrations below 16% volume are considered highly dangerous for humans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As asphyxiant gases are relatively inert and odorless, their presence may not be noticed until the effects of elevated blood carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) are recognized by the body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inert gas asphyxiation may be deliberate with use of a [[suicide bag]]. Accidental death has occurred in cases where concentrations of nitrogen in controlled atmospheres, or methane in mines, has not been detected or appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milroy|first=Christopher|date=Autumn 2018|title=Deaths from Environmental Hypoxia and Raised Carbon Dioxide|journal=Academic Forensic Pathology|volume=8|pages=2–7|doi=10.23907/2018.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====
Hemoglobin's function can also be lost by chemically oxidizing its iron atom to its ferric form.  This form of inactive hemoglobin is called [[methemoglobin]] and can be made by ingesting sodium nitrite&lt;ref&gt;[[Berton Roueché|Roueché, Berton]] (1953) Eleven blue men, and other narratives of medical detection. Boston: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as certain drugs and other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneff, Stephanie]]; Swanson, Nancy; Li, Chen (2015) Aluminum and Glyphosate Can Synergistically Induce Pineal Gland Pathology: Connection to Gut Dysbiosis and Neurological Disease. Agricultural Sciences, 2015, 6, 42–70. [https://dx.doi.org|/10.4236/as.2015.61005]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anemia===
{{Main article|Anemia}}
Hemoglobin plays a substantial role in carrying oxygen throughout the body,&lt;ref name=MARTIN1999 /&gt; and when it is deficient, [[anemia]] can result, causing 'anaemic hypoxia' if tissue [[perfusion]] is decreased. [[Iron deficiency]] is the most common cause of anemia. As iron is used in the synthesis of hemoglobin, less hemoglobin will be synthesised when there is less iron, due to insufficient intake, or poor absorption.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|997–999}}

Anemia is typically a chronic process that is compensated over time by increased levels of [[red blood cell]]s via upregulated [[erythropoetin]]. A chronic hypoxic state can result from a poorly compensated anaemia.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|997–999}}

===Histotoxic hypoxia===
====Cyanide poisoning====
Histotoxic hypoxia results when the quantity of oxygen reaching the cells is normal, but the cells are unable to use the oxygen effectively as a result of disabled oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. This may occur in [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pittman|first1=RN|title=Regulation of Tissue Oxygenation|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54113/|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Life Sciences|date= 2011|page=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological compensation==

===Acute===
If oxygen delivery to cells is insufficient for the demand (hypoxia), electrons will be shifted to [[pyruvic acid]] in the process of [[lactic acid fermentation]].  This temporary measure (anaerobic metabolism) allows small amounts of energy to be released.  Lactic acid build up (in tissues and blood) is a sign of inadequate mitochondrial oxygenation, which may be due to hypoxemia, poor blood flow (e.g., shock) or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hobler |first=K.E. |author2=L.C. Carey | title=Effect of acute progressive hypoxemia on cardiac output and plasma excess lactate | journal=Ann Surg | year=1973 | pages=199–202 | volume=177 | issue=2 | pmid= 4572785 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-197302000-00013 | pmc=1355564}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If severe or prolonged it could lead to cell death. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In humans, hypoxia is detected by the peripheral chemoreceptors in the [[carotid body]] and [[aortic body]], with the carotid body chemoreceptors being the major mediators of reflex responses to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arieff|first1=Allen I.|title=Hypoxia, Metabolic Acidosis, and the Circulation|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1461475422|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0g_pBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=hypoxia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response does not control ventilation rate at normal p{{chem|O|2}}, but below normal the activity of neurons innervating these receptors increases dramatically, so much so to override the signals from central chemoreceptors in the [[hypothalamus]], increasing p{{chem|O|2}} despite a falling p{{CO2}}

It is seen in a few humans (encountered with hypoxia), there is word loss in their speech due to their state of confusion and cell damage in the brain.

In most tissues of the body, the response to hypoxia is [[vasodilation]]. By widening the blood vessels, the tissue allows greater perfusion.

By contrast, in the [[lung]]s, the response to hypoxia is [[vasoconstriction]]. This is known as [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]], or "HPV".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michiels|first1=Carine|title=Physiological and Pathological Responses to Hypoxia|journal=The American Journal of Pathology|volume=164|issue=6|pages=1875–82|pmc=1615763|year=2004|doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63747-9|pmid=15161623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic===
When the pulmonary capillary pressure remains elevated chronically (for at least 2 weeks), the lungs become even more resistant to pulmonary edema because the lymph vessels expand greatly, increasing their capability of carrying fluid away from the interstitial spaces perhaps as much as 10-fold. Therefore, in patients with chronic [[mitral stenosis]], pulmonary capillary pressures of 40 to 45&amp;nbsp;mm Hg have been measured without the development of lethal pulmonary edema.[Guytun and Hall physiology]

Hypoxia exists when there is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body. Hypoxemia refers to a reduction in PO2 below the normal range, regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung, CaO2 is adequate, or tissue hypoxia exists. There are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia, but in patients with [[COPD]] the predominant one is V/Q mismatching, with or without alveolar hypoventilation, as indicated by PaCO2. Hypoxemia caused by V/Q mismatching as seen in COPD is relatively easy to correct, so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (less than 3 L/min for the majority of patients) are required for [[LTOT]]. Although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea, these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with COPD as to be of limited value in patient assessment. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonale—right ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failure—in patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in COPD, to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by [[FEV1]] is the best correlate with overall prognosis in patients with COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease. Large-scale studies of LTOT in patients with COPD have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between daily hours of oxygen use and survival. There is reason to believe that continuous, 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the NOTT and MRC studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10771781 | volume=45 | issue=1 | title=Pathophysiology and clinical effects of chronic hypoxia | year=2000 | journal=Respir Care | pages=39–51; discussion 51–3| author1=Pierson | first1=D. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
To counter the effects of high-altitude diseases, the body must return arterial p{{chem|O|2}} toward normal. [[Acclimatization]], the means by which the body adapts to higher altitudes, only partially restores p{{chem|O|2}} to standard levels. [[Hyperventilation]], the body’s most common response to high-altitude conditions, increases alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} by raising the depth and rate of breathing. However, while p{{chem|O|2}} does improve with hyperventilation, it does not return to normal. Studies of miners and astronomers working at 3000 meters and above show improved alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} with full acclimatization, yet the p{{chem|O|2}} level remains equal to or even below the threshold for continuous oxygen therapy for patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).&lt;ref name="West 2004 789–800"&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=2004 |title=The Physiologic Basis of High-Altitude Diseases |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=141 |pages=789–800 |issue=10 |pmid=15545679 |author2=American College Of Physicians |author3=American Physiological Society |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-141-10-200411160-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are complications involved with acclimatization. [[Polycythemia]], in which the body increases the number of red blood cells in circulation, thickens the blood, raising the danger that the heart can’t pump it.

In high-altitude conditions, only oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of hypoxia. By increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air, the effects of lower barometric pressure are countered and the level of arterial p{{chem|O|2}} is restored toward normal capacity. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 4000&amp;nbsp;m, raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an altitude equivalent of 3000&amp;nbsp;m, which is much more tolerable for the increasing number of low-landers who work in high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=1995 |title=Oxygen Enrichment of Room Air to Relieve the Hypoxia of High Altitude |journal=Respiration Physiology |volume=99 |pages=225–32 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G |issue=2 |pmid=7777705}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of astronomers working in Chile at 5050&amp;nbsp;m, oxygen concentrators increased the level of oxygen concentration by almost 30 percent (that is, from 21 percent to 27 percent). This resulted in increased worker productivity, less fatigue, and improved sleep.&lt;ref name="West 2004 789–800"/&gt;

[[Oxygen concentrator]]s are uniquely suited for this purpose. They require little maintenance and electricity, provide a constant source of oxygen, and eliminate the expensive, and often dangerous, task of transporting oxygen cylinders to remote areas. Offices and housing already have climate-controlled rooms, in which temperature and humidity are kept at a constant level. Oxygen can be added to this system easily and relatively cheaply.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4546">At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] (1527-1546), Ix Tab, or '''Ixtab''' ([iʃˈtaɓ], 'Woman whose work involves the use of a rope'), was the indigenous Mayan goddess of [[suicide by hanging]]. Playing the role of a [[psychopomp]], she would accompany such suicides to heaven. No certain depictions of Ixtab are known.

==Sources==
The only description of the goddess occurs in the so-called ‘Relación’ of the 16th-century Spanish inquisitor, [[Diego de Landa]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 132, slightly adapted&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They said also and held it as absolutely certain that those who hanged themselves went to this heaven of theirs; and on this account, there were many persons who on slight occasions of sorrows, troubles or sickness, hanged themselves in order to escape these things and to go and rest in their heaven [''gloria''], where they said that the goddess of the gallows [''la diosa de la horca''], whom they called Ix Tab, would bring them.”&lt;ref&gt;Landa: "los venía a llevar," Tozzer: "came to fetch them."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond this description, there is only a very brief and somewhat obscure mention of Ix Tab in the Book of [[Chilam Balam]] of Tizimin and in the Pérez Codex, in a context of chaos, suffering, and hangings: “They suspended Ix Tab from their hands,” or, alternatively, “Ix Tab suspended them from her hands.”&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
''Ix Tab'' is the female form of ''ah tab'' 'hangman'.&lt;ref&gt;Ciudad Real 2001: 55&lt;/ref&gt; The function of Ix Tab as a benevolent 'hangwoman' could derive from a basic association with snares.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Landa (Tozzer 1941: 155) mentions the hunting deity [''Ah''] ''Tabay'' ('Ensnarer' or 'Deceiver'), possibly a patron of hunting with snares, including such that hoist the prey into the air. Animals hoisted by such snares are found depicted in the Dresden and Madrid codices, the Madrid codex (MC45c) personifying one of these traps by a male hunting deity. Ix Tab could be understood as a specialized, female form of such a deity, luring the human quarry into the hanging rope personified by her. Suicides freely putting their heads into this 'snare' (prompted, perhaps, by a dream) could then be seen to consecrate themselves to her. On the other hand, the [[Xtabay]] of contemporary folklore is a seductive female demon ‘ensnaring’ or 'deceiving' her male human preys so as to madden and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dresden Codex==
[[File:Ixtab.jpg|thumbnail|The image from the [[Dresden Codex]] thought to represent Ixtab.]]
The [[Dresden Codex]] picture (DC53b) of a dead woman with a rope around the neck, suspended from a celestial bar, is often, and without further proof, taken to represent Ix Tab. However, since the picture occurs in a section devoted to eclipses of sun and moon,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1972: 71-77&lt;/ref&gt; it may rather have been used to symbolize a lunar eclipse and its dire consequences for women, who were intimately associated with the moon goddess.

==As possible fabrication==
It has been claimed that the Pre-Spanish Maya did not have a suicide goddess, or a significant narrative of suicide by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Ix Tab may only have been a hunting goddess (see above, 'Comparisons').&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 19&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the sensationalist idea of a ‘cult of Ix Tab’ appears to be invoked by popular Yucatecan media to portray suicide as an indigenous problem, given that Yucatán has a suicide rate more than double that of Mexico at large.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">'''Mental Illness Awareness Week (MIAW)''' (also known as '''Mental Health Awareness Week''') was established in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nami.org/miaw/&lt;/ref&gt; by the U.S. Congress in recognition of efforts by the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI) to educate and increase awareness about [[mental disorder|mental illness]]. It takes place every year during the first full week of October. During this week, mental health advocates and organizations across the U.S. join to sponsor events to promote community outreach and public education concerning mental illnesses such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[schizophrenia]]. Examples of activities held during the week include art/music events, educational sessions provided by healthcare professionals, advertising campaigns, health fairs, movie nights, candlelight vigils, and benefit runs.

An estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older—about one in four adults—are believed to be diagnosable with a mental illness in any given year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwapps.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america.shtml |title=NIMH: The Numbers Count: Mental Disorders in America |publisher=Pps.nimh.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311123613/http://wwwapps.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america.shtml |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers may be larger because stigma reduces reporting.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/opinion/mental-illness-is-not-a-horror-show.html?|title=Mental Illness Is Not a Horror Show|last=Solomon|first=Andrew|date=2016-10-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Not only are these adults affected by one mental illness; 45% of these adults meet criteria for two or more disorders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7628/20140527/1-4-u-s-adults-suffer-diagnosable-mental-disorder-given.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These range from fairly common mood disorders to the much more serious anxiety and schizophrenia disorders. Among these, anxiety disorders were the most common, as some 40 million American adults ages 18 and older experience some form of anxiety disorder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7628/20140527/1-4-u-s-adults-suffer-diagnosable-mental-disorder-given.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large number of Americans affected by such disorders, [[social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental illness is a major barrier that prevents people from seeking the mental health treatment that they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter1/sec1.html#roots_stigma |title=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999) |publisher=Surgeongeneral.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs during Mental Illness Awareness Week are designed to create community awareness and discussion in an effort to put an end to stigma and advocate for treatment and recovery.

Mental Illness Awareness Week coincides with similar organization campaigns in early October such as [[World Mental Health Day]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfmh.org/00WorldMentalHealthDay.htm World Mental Health Day] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903050953/http://www.wfmh.org/00WorldMentalHealthDay.htm |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[World Federation for Mental Health]]), National Depression Screening Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealthscreening.org/events/national-depression-screening-day.aspx |title=National Depression Screening Day |publisher=Mentalhealthscreening.org |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Screening for Mental Health), and National Day Without Stigma&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activeminds.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=94&amp;Itemid=132 National Day Without Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Active Minds]]).

'''Neglected tropical diseases''' (NTDs) are a set of infectious diseases affecting an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide.  The classification of this group of [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected diseases]] is linked to their frequent neglect in public and private sector expenditure and attention at local, national, and international levels, and their concentration among the poor.  [[Research and development]] yielding safe, effective drugs and vaccines for their treatment and prevention has been recognized as a global health priority.

==Overview==
[[File:Ivermectin skeletal.svg|thumb|The structure of two of the ivermectins, an important class of drug in the control of Onchocerciasis.]]

Neglected tropical diseases are a set of [[Infectious disease|infectious communicable diseases]] arising from a diverse group of parasitic worms, bacteria, and vector-borne protozoa.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;  The NTDs result in an estimated 534,000 deaths annually&lt;ref name="K2"/&gt; and 57 million [[disability-adjusted life years]] (DALYs) lost.&lt;ref name="K"/&gt; The social, economic, and health burden of these diseases falls primarily on [[Developing country|low and middle income countries]] where the diseases are most prevalent.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt;  The NTDs represent the sixth greatest global health burden in terms of DALYs, equal to or potentially surpassing global malaria burden.&lt;ref name="K"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

NTD interventions include both programs to address environmental and [[social determinants of health]] (e.g., vector control, water quality, sanitation), and programs offering [[mass drug administration]] for disease prevention and treatment.  Drug treatments exist&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; to confront many of the NTDs and represent some of the world's [[essential medicines]].&lt;ref name="Y"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;  Despite significant health and economic improvements using available medicines,&lt;ref name="G"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Z2"/&gt; the low number of new compounds being researched and developed for NTDs is an ongoing and significant challenge.&lt;ref name="Y"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D2"/&gt;  The dearth of candidates in pharmaceutical company [[drug pipeline]]s is primarily attributed to the high costs of drug development and the fact that NTDs are concentrated among the worlds' poor.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Other disincentives to investment include weak existing infrastructure for distribution and sales, and concerns regarding intellectual property protection.&lt;ref name="Z2"/&gt;  However, the major stakeholders in NTD drug development—governments, foundations, pharmaceutical companies, academia, and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]—are involved in activities to help address the research and development shortfall and meet the many challenges presented by neglected tropical diseases.&lt;ref name="Q"/&gt; Initiatives include public private partnerships, global R&amp;D capacity building, priority vouchers to speed drug approval processes, open source scientific collaborations, and harmonization of global governance structures concerning NTDs.

==NTD list==
The diseases considered neglected tropical diseases vary. [[Malaria]], [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], and [[tuberculosis]] have received an amount of public attention and increased funding to no longer be considered neglected by some researchers.  Outside "The Big Three", the seven most prevalent neglected tropical diseases in order of their global prevalence are [[ascariasis]], [[trichuriasis]], [[Hookworm infections|hookworm infection]], [[schistosomiasis]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], and [[trachoma]].&lt;ref name="K"/&gt;  These seven are among a larger list of thirteen major NTDs: [[onchocerciasis]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[Chagas' disease]], [[leprosy]], [[Human African trypanosomiasis]] (sleeping sickness), [[Dracunculiasis]], and [[Buruli ulcer]].&lt;ref name="K"/&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]]'s 2010 report dedicated to neglected tropical diseases offers an expanded list including [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[rabies]], [[yaws]], [[cysticercosis]], [[echinococcosis]], and [[Trematode infection|foodborne trematode infections]].&lt;ref name="Z3"/&gt;

==Deficient market==
In their 2002 review of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) databases and the [[European Medicines Agency|European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products]], Troullier ''et al'' found that 16 out of 1393 new chemical entities were approved for NTDs between 1975 and 1999 (~1%).&lt;ref name="Y"/&gt;  Cohen ''et al'' revisited the data and using the same methodology found 32 new chemical entities during the time period.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt; In a second analysis using an expanded list of NTDs based on the G-FINDER survey,&lt;ref name="Z4"/&gt; the number was slightly higher, with 46 new drugs and vaccines approved (~3% of the total including HIV drugs).&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;  Between 2000 and 2009, there has been some increase with an additional 26 newly approved drugs and vaccines for NTDs.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;

A number of factors are recognized as contributing to the low number. The barrier most reported is the high cost of drug development. Estimates are that pharmaceutical companies' development costs to approval fall between $500 million and $2 billion.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski calculated an average of $802 million in year 2000 dollars.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt; Furthermore, the time that drugs are approved for use averages seven years out of the twenty years on-patent, meaning a tendency for the market to focus on diseases of developed nations where high prices can be used to recoup research and development costs, and subsidize failed R&amp;D efforts.  In short, NTD research and development is considered a high investment risk given that NTDs predominantly affect the poor in low and middle income countries.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;  Additional barriers include drug safety regulatory requirements, intellectual property protection problems, and poor infrastructure for distribution and sales.&lt;ref name="Z2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;

Although drug companies have not invested heavily in the NTDs, in several cases, rather than focus on profits, some have decided to donate key drugs to address NTDs. For example, Merk has had a program since the mid-1980s to donate ivermectin (Mectizan) indefinitely to support the global fight of onchoceriasis.  GlaxoSmithKline and several other large pharmaceutical companies have donation programs as well.  Drug donation however, does not ameliorate the deficiency of new chemical entities being researched and developed.  This is especially of concern with reports of emerging resistance among existing drugs.&lt;ref name="X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V"/&gt;

Governments, foundations, the non-profit sector, and private sector have found new connections to help address market deficiencies by providing funding support and spreading both the costs and risks of NTD research and development.  The proliferation of [[Public Private Partnerships|public private partnerships]] (PPPs) has been recognized as a key innovation in the past decade, helping to unlock existing and new resources.

Major PPPs for NTDs include: the [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]], Norvartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health, MSD Wellcome Trust [[Hilleman Laboratories]], Infectious Diseases Research Institute, [[Institut Pasteur]] and [[INSERM]], WIPO Re:Search, and the [[International Vaccine Institute]].&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;  Likewise, a number of new academic drug development centers have been created in recent years drawing in industry partners.  Support for these centers is frequently traced to the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], the [[Sandler Foundation]], and the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref name="U"/&gt;

===R&amp;D capacity building in middle income countries===
Growing NTD research and development capacity in middle income countries is an area of policy interest.  A 2009 study of biotechnology companies in India, China, Brazil, and South Africa revealed sixty-two NTD products in development and on the market out of approximately five hundred products offered (~14%).  When products to fight HIV, malaria, and TB were included in the analysis, the number increased to one hundred twenty-three products, approximately 25% of the total products offered.

Researchers have argued that unlike most multinationals, small and mid-sized "Global South" companies see significant business opportunities in the development of NTD-related diagnostics, biologics, pharmaceuticals, and services.&lt;ref name="J"/&gt;  Potential actions to improve and expand this R&amp;D capacity have been recommended including expansion of human capital, increased private investment, knowledge and patent sharing, infrastructure building for business incubation and innovation support.

===Innovation prizes and grants===
Competitive innovation prizes have been used to spur development in a range of fields such as aerospace engineering, clean technology, and genomics. The [[X-Prize Foundation]] is launching a competition for high speed, point-of-care diagnostics for tuberculosis.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A more widely defined annual "Global Health EnterPrize" for neglected tropical diseases has been proposed to reward health innovators, particularly those based in countries where NTDs represent a serious health burden.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] offers the Grand Challenges Explorations Opportunities on a rolling basis. This grant program allows individuals from any organization or background to apply to address priority global health issues. Each project award is $100,000 dollars and is drawn from a Foundation funding pool of $100 million. Awardees have tended to offer research projects on topics that are highly speculative but offer potentially game-changing breakthroughs in global health.

===FDA priority review vouchers (PRV)===
In 2006, Ridley ''et al'' recommended the development of a [[priority review voucher]] (PRV) in the journal ''[[Health Affairs]]''.  It gained interest by Senator [[Sam Brownback]] of Kansas who championed its introduction in the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007|FDA Amendments Act of 2007]].  Under the enacted law, FDA approval of a non-NTD drug can be accelerated through the drug review process if paired to a drug that addresses a NTD.  The potential economic benefit to a pharmaceutical company is estimated to be potentially as high as $300 million per drug.  Three drugs have earned NTD PRVs to date (December 2014): Coartem (by Novartis, for malaria); bedaquiline (by Janssen, for TB) and miltefosine (by Knight, for leishmaniasis).  However, the success of the PRV system is now under much scrutiny, given that Knight benefitted by $125 million from the sale of a PRV earned from a drug (miltefosine) that was largely researched and developed by the WHO.  Medicins San Frontiers are now pressuring Knight to guarantee supplying miltefosine at cost price, thus far without success.

The PRV isn't limited to the pairing of drugs within a single company, rather can be transferred between companies.  Companies with NTD drug candidates in their pipelines but without a blockbuster drug, are able to sell their voucher producing financial returns. In the EU, similar priority review incentives are now under consideration to increase the speed of regulatory pricing and reimbursement decisions.

However, PRVs have been criticized as being open to manipulation and possibly encouraging errors through too rapid regulatory decision-making.&lt;ref name="O"/&gt;

===Open source collaboration initiatives===
[[File:DNDi logo.JPG|right|thumb|The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, a web focused not-for-profit drug R&amp;D organization dedicated to creating new NTD treatments.]]Several companies and scientific organizations are participating in open source initiatives to share drug data and patent information over the web, and facilitate virtual collaboration on NTD research.

One rich area to explore is in the wealth of genomic data resulting from the sequencing of parasite genomes.  These data offer opportunities for the exploration of new therapeutic products using computational, and [[open source]] collaboration methods for drug discovery.&lt;ref name="M"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N"/&gt; The Tropical Disease Initiative, for example, has used large amounts of computing power to generate the protein structures for ten parasite genomes.  An open source drug bank was matched algorithmically to determine compounds with protein interaction activity, and two candidates were identified.  In general, such methods may hold important opportunities for [[off-label use]] of existing approved drugs.

The '''Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC)''' is an independent statutory organisation responsible for implementing, monitoring and further developing the standards of care provided by all statutory, private and voluntary [[HSE National Ambulance Service|ambulance services]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is also responsible for conducting examinations at six levels of pre-hospital care, the control of ambulance [[paramedic|practitioner]] registration and the publication of [[medical guideline|clinical practice guidelines]].

==Levels of Care==
There are six levels of care set down by PHECC. They are divided into Responder levels and Practitioner levels. Currently, all practitioners working on emergency ambulances must be trained to a minimum of PHECC Level 5 ([[Paramedic]]) standard. A practitioner working on a non-emergency ambulance must be trained to a minimum of PHECC Level 4 ([[Emergency Medical Technician|EMT]]) standard. Responder levels are suitable for fire service personnel (excluding [[Dublin Fire Brigade]]), voluntary ambulance organisations, sports clubs and workplace first aiders.

===Responders===
[[File:Emtcard.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A PHECC practitioners' licence at Emergency Medical Technician level.]]
Responder levels of care are designed to provide basic medical training to lay people, non-medical emergency services staff (Gardaí, fire services), sports club staff and those designated to provide first aid at work. In addition to this, voluntary ambulance services such as [[Civil Defence]], [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]], [[Irish Red Cross]] and the [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland|St John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland]] depend on responder training to allow their members provide on-site first aid at the various events they cover.
Certain remote communities have set up their own individual Cardiac First Response programmes, where various people in the area are trained to PHECC Level 1 (CFR) standard and are provided with an [[Automated External Defibrillator]]. These responders can then be called or paged to the scene of a cardiac arrest to provide [[CPR]] and defibrillation, where the increased response time of an ambulance would greatly affect the patient's outcome.

===Practitioners===
Practitioners must register annually with PHECC to practice their skills. They are bound by various laws, primarily [[tort]] law when attending an incident or treating a patient.  Upon qualification and registration, a practitioner is issued with a licence and unique PIN which should be presented when treating a patient either on or off-duty. The practitioner's PIN must also be entered on Patient Care Report forms for any incident where the practitioner was involved; this is done for both reference purposes, record-keeping and proof of [[continuous professional development]].

==CPG Approved Service Providers==
All organisations and companies who are providing an ambulance service in any capacity must register with PHECC as a CPG Approved Service Provider to work to the current edition of Clinical Practice Guidelines published by PHECC. Approved Service Providers are broken down into four categories. 2nd Edition CPG Providers are the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and Event Medical Services Ltd. 3rd Edition CPG Providers are listed below.

==''Citizen CPR'' campaign==
In 2010, PHECC launched a poster-advertising and television-ad campaign aimed at informing the general public of what to do if they should witness an adult suddenly collapse. Its focus was to emphasise the fact that [[CPR]] can still be effective without mouth-to-mouth contact. Pocket-sized cards were distributed with instructions on the steps to take:

# '''Check''': check if the person is unresponsive and not breathing.
# '''Call''': Get someone to call [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] or 112 or call them yourself.
# '''Compress''': Push hard and fast in the centre of the chest. Don't stop until help arrives.

'''PLAID syndrome''' is a inherited condition characterised by [[antibody deficiency]] and [[immune dysregulation]], first described in 2012. The name is an acronym of "[[PLCG2]]-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation". It is characterised by [[cold urticaria|cold-induced urticaria]], [[autoimmunity]], [[atopy]] and [[humoral immune deficiency]].&lt;ref name=Milner2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milner|first1=JD|title=PLAID: a Syndrome of Complex Patterns of Disease and Unique Phenotypes.|journal=Journal of clinical immunology|date=August 2015|volume=35|issue=6|pages=527–30|doi=10.1007/s10875-015-0177-x|pmid=26206677|pmc=4575258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal fulfilment''' is achievement of life goals which are important to an [[individual]], in contrast to the goals of [[society]], [[family]] and other collective obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtC5o_PE8KcC |title=The individual, the family, and social good: personal fulfilment in times of change |year=1995 |author=Gary B. Melton | isbn=978-0-8032-8221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal fulfilment is an ongoing journey for a human individual. It commences when an individual starts becoming conscious of oneself and one's surroundings. It is then that one's exploration begins to realize what one is capable of. Like the tentative steps of a child that invariably lead to a few falls followed by seeking for some help from people around. Then the joy of achievement when one can successfully take a few steps without falling. The appreciation of people around is a key component of achieving personal fulfilment. It is invariably followed by a sense of habituality (i.e., being able to perform any act, such as walking, habitually). Then boredom. Followed by a yearning for the next horizon, whatever it may be for an individual.

Key components then of personal fulfilment are:

# Consciousness - of oneself and the environment
# Consciousness - of people around oneself
# Exploration - of something new that one may be capable of
# Initial failure - as one's initial attempts at exploration leads to stumbles and falls
# Trying - again and again till such time that one does not stumble and fall
# Experiencing joy - of having tried and achieved something new
# Commendation and applause - of those around, especially of the ones that the individual values
# Boredom - as one performs the 'not so new anymore' task as a matter of habit
# Then back to step three for something new to explore
# The cycle continuing throughout one's life as the individual grows and expands into newer and unexplored dimensions of personal fulfilment

[[Consciousness]] is the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been defined as sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to feel wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind.

Consciousness of the self is a complex experience for an individual being. A prime aspect of consciousness and awareness of the self is the awakening to one's capabilities and potential.

The awakening to one's capabilities and potential is a continuous process throughout the period of existence of a being - from the birth of the physical being through the expiration of the same. Inherent to this process of being is a drive or a force that seems to be part and parcel of being in the physical being on earth. This drive manifests itself from the start of one's being - like a child crying as soon as it is born. It is the awakening of the child to its capabilities of exercising its vocal cords. The drive continues through the life of one's being (albeit in varying degrees of forcefulness and momentum at various points in time) through to death of the physical being as we know.

This drive is primal and is the single force that leads to exploration.

'''Pierre Dukan''' is a [[France|French]] medical doctor and nutritionist, and the creator of the [[Dukan Diet]].

==Career==
In 1975, Pierre Dukan was a [[general practitioner]] in [[Paris]] when he was first confronted with a case of [[obesity]]. At the time, being overweight or obese was thought to be best treated by [[low calorie]] and small sized meals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Dukan thought of an alternative way to prevent patients from regaining their lost weight after dieting. He designed a new approach in four phases, including stabilisation and consolidation. After 20 odd years of research Pierre Dukan published his findings in 2000 in his book ''Je ne sais pas maigrir'' (''I don't know how to get slimmer'') which became a bestseller in France.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The book became a bestseller in the UK after Carole Middleton introduced her daughter Catherine, now [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|The Duchess of Cambridge]], to the diet before her [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|wedding to Prince William]]. Catherine lost two dress sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nath, Dipanita|title=the Duchess Diet|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-duchess-diet/784775/1|date=May 3, 2011|work=IndianExpress.com|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In July 2011 a French court ruled against Dukan in his attempt to sue rival nutritionist [[Jean-Michel Cohen]] for libel, after Cohen had criticised Dukan's method in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2011794/Dukan-Diet-creator-suffers-total-defeat-losing-libel-case-French-court.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Peter | last=Allen | title=Creator of the Dukan Diet suffers 'total defeat' after losing libel case in French court | date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Dukan suggested that the Baccalaureate exam, taken by 17-year-old children, should include one test which the children could pass simply by staying within appropriate weight limits. He faced a disciplinary hearing in connection with these remarks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17516103 "French diet guru Pierre Dukan faces ethics hearing"] BBC News, 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 the French [[Conseils de l'ordre des médecins en France|Ordre des médecins]] asserted that Dukan had violated the organization's medical code of practice by practising medicine as a business.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Willsher, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/26/dukan-diet-inventor-faces-censure?INTCMP=SRCH "Dukan diet inventor faces censure"], ''The Guardian'', 27 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, he was removed from the membership of the [[Conseils de l'ordre des médecins en France|Ordre des Médecins]] at his request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2012/05/16/97001-20120516FILWWW00463-le-dr-dukan-radie-de-l-ordre-des-medecins.php "Dukan radié de l'ordre des médecins", ''Le Figaro'' 16/05/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Dukan was struck off the medical register for promoting his diet commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Penketh|first=Anne|title=Dukan diet creator struck off French medical register|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/pierre-dukan-diet-creator-struck-off-france|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pit additives''' is a commercially-produced material that aims to reduce [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] build-up and control [[odor]] in [[pit latrines]], [[septic tanks]] and [[wastewater treatment plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Manufacturers claim to use [[effective microorganism]]s (EM) in their products. Current scientific evidence does not back up most claims made by manufacturers about the benefits.&lt;ref name="Foxon" /&gt;   Removing sludge continues to be a problem in pit latrines and septic tanks.&lt;ref name="BakareBrouckaert2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakare|first1=BF|last2=Brouckaert|first2=CJ|last3=Foxon|first3=KM|last4=Buckley|first4=CA|year=2015|title=An investigation of the effect of pit latrine additives on VIP latrine sludge content under laboratory and field trials|journal=Water SA|volume=41|issue=4|pages=509|doi=10.4314/wsa.v41i4.10|issn=0378-4738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Pit additives are advocated for use in sanitation systems like [[pit latrine]]s and [[septic tank]]s.  Additives consist of packages of micro-organisms or enzymes or both. More than 1,200 septic system additives were estimated to be available in the U.S. in 2011.&lt;ref name="Pradhan" /&gt; However, very little peer-reviewed and replicated field research exists to confirm the efficacy of biological additives.&lt;ref name="Pradhan" /&gt;

===Claimed benefits===
Pit additive claims include an increase in speed of the breakdown of  sludge, which may also decrease odor.  The claim is based on assertions that the additive contains nutrients or certain aerobic (oxygen-breathing) micro-organisms that will break down the sludge.&lt;ref name="Foxon" /&gt; Research, however, finds that these claims are unlikely to be true.&lt;ref name="Foxon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foxon, K|last2=Still, D|title=Do pit additives work?|date=2012|publisher=Water Research Commission, University of Kwazulu-Natal, Partners in Development (PiD), South Africa|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grolle, K. (2015) [http://www.susana.org/images/documents/07-cap-dev/b-conferences/15-FSM3/Day-3/Rm-3/3-3-2-3Grolle.pdf Laboratory investigations into solids solubilisation of black water and faecal matter: Effect of additives and internal physical chemical pit latrine aspects],  Department of Environmental Technology and Research, University of Wageningen, Wageningen, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of bacteria introduced by pit additives is insignificant compared to the bacteria already present in the pit or septic tank.&lt;ref name="Foxon" /&gt;

== Applications ==

===Septic tanks ===
Researchers from the U.S. carried out field experiments in 2011 to assess the effect of additives on the performance of 20 septic tanks.&lt;ref name="Pradhan"&gt;S. Pradhan, Michael T. Hoover, G.H. Clark, M. Gumpertz, C. Cobb, J. Strock (2011) [http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/publications/septic/JEH12.11_Feature_Impacts_of_Biological_Additives_Part_2.pdf Impacts of biological additives; Part 2 Septic Tank Effluent Quality and Overall Additive Efficacy], Journal of Environmental Health, Volume 74, Number 5, p. 22-28&lt;/ref&gt; These septic tanks served residences at a mobile home park located in Orange County, North Carolina. The researchers distinguished between tanks that were well maintained, poorly maintained and maintained to an intermediate level.  "Well maintained" was defined as "de-sludged in the last 2-3 years.:   "Poorly maintained" had not been de-sludged for the last 15-20 years.  Tanks put in the intermediate category fell somewhere in between. 

Only well-maintained septic tanks showed some reduction in sludge build-up.  To determine if the reduction could be attributed to pit additives, a follow up-study investigated the impact of three additives on just the well-maintained septic tanks. Overall, the research concluded there was limited evidence of additive impact on the performance of septic tanks.  It should be stressed that these field experiments used additives other than EM ([[effective microorganism]]s), leaving the results open to the argument that the more varied composition of EM could make such additives more effective than the three additives tested.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA)  produced a fact sheet on the use of pit additives to improve the performance of septic tank treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;EPA 625/R-00/008 Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems Special Issues Fact Sheet 1 - Septic Tank Additives&lt;/ref&gt; The fact sheet concludes that bacteria and extracellular enzymes do not appear to significantly enhance normal biological decomposition processes in septic tanks. They go on to say that ‘some biological additives have been found to degrade or dissipate septic tank scum and sludge. However, whether this relatively minor benefit is derived without compromising long-term viability of the soil infiltration system has not been demonstrated conclusively’. They noted that some studies suggest that material degraded by additives in the tank actually adds to the suspended solids and other contaminants in the otherwise clarified septic tank effluent.

===Wastewater treatment plants===
Proponents claim the additives in [[wastewater]] can facilitate reduction in organic load and pathogen removal, leading to significant improvements in effluent quality. They also claim benefits relating to the rate of sludge build-up and odor reduction. One source claims that septic tank additives can reduce [[hydrogen sulphide]] and [[ammonia]] production.&lt;ref name="parr"&gt;{{cite conference |first = Dr. Teruo|last = Higa|author2 = Dr. James Parr|year = 1994|booktitle =Beneficial and Effective Microorganisms for a Sustainable Agriculture and Environment|url=http://www.emro-asia.com/data/66.pdf|publisher = International Nature Farming Research Center|location = Atami, Japan|pages = 7|accessdate = March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reasoning is that additives contain natural’ organisms that prevail over the rather less ‘natural’ organisms that would otherwise dominate conditions in the treatment unit, whether this be a septic tank or some form of aerobic treatment. They even claim that by overcoming the effects of ‘unnatural’ substances such as bleach and other disinfectants, the use of septic tank additives allows septic tanks and other treatment systems to function in conditions that would otherwise have resulted in their becoming ‘dead’ and non-functional.

One short note claims that microorganisms in the additives contain various organic acids due to the presence of lactic acid bacteria. These secrete organic acids, enzymes antioxidants, and metallic chelates thus create an antioxidant environment, which assists in the enhancement of solid-liquid separation, which is the foundation for cleaning water.&lt;ref&gt;Higa, T. &amp; Chinen, N. 1998, ‘EM Treatments of Odor, Waste Water, and Environmental Problems’,
College of Agriculture, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the note provide no explanation of how this works.

However, the findings from various studies around the world indicate that:
* There is no reliable evidence that addition of pit additives to wastewater prior to treatment has a significant effect on pathogen concentrations.  
* The evidence on the effect of pit additives on settleability of solids and reduction in effluent [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] and suspended solids is mixed. Under some circumstances, it appears that adding pit additives can have some effect on both BOD and SS concentrations but the effect is not large and is not proven.&lt;ref name="BakareBrouckaert2015"/&gt;
* The available evidence suggests that any lasting effect of pit additives is dependent on regular application of the microorganisms combined with good maintenance of the treatment technology. This will require (a) a reliable supply chain for the pit additive and (b) management systems that ensure that the pit additive is added regularly and on schedule.
While pit additives can lead to some improvement in effluent quality, it is unlikely that the improvement would be enough to make a difference.  Claims that pit additives can make otherwise ‘unsafe’ effluents ‘safe’ is unlikely to be justified.

==Costs==
Based on the research conducted so far, spending money on pit additives is a waste of money.&lt;ref name="Foxon" /&gt; In 2011, one fifth of South African municipalities purchased various additives as part of their sanitation management programmes. Even at that time the Water Research Commission in South Africa advised against this practice. Instead they suggested spending that money on improved pit emptying methods and improved pit design, which might include use of low flush toilets with alternating leach pits.&lt;ref&gt;Still, D., O’Riordan, M. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1712 Tackling the challenges of full pit latrines - Volume 3: The development of pit emptying technologies]. WRC Report No. 1745/1/12, {{ISBN|978-1-4312-0293-5}}, Water Research Commission, South Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs and health risks associated with manual pit emptying are significant. If an EM product could be developed to significantly reduce the filling rate of pits, this would be of enormous significance.&lt;ref name="Foxon" /&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Australia ===
Australian scientists investigated the effect of additives in a [[wastewater treatment plant]] and a number of septic tanks.&lt;ref name="lanfax"&gt;{{cite conference | first = N. | last = Szymanski |author2=Patterson, R.A. | year = 2003 | title = Effective Microorganisms (EM) and Wastewater Systems in Future Directions for On-site Systems: Best Management Practice.| booktitle = Proceedings of On-site '03 Conference | editor = R.A. and Jones, M.J. (Eds). | publisher = Lanfax Laboratories  | location = Armidale, NSW, Australia  | pages = 347&amp;ndash;354  | url = http://www.lanfaxlabs.com.au/papers/P53-03-Szymanski-Patterson.PDF | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-11-14 | isbn = 0-9579438-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their aim was to test the hypothesis that the additive reduces sludge volumes. They found significant reduction in pH levels at the wastewater treatment plant together with improved settlement of sludge but with a significant increase in organic matter (measured as [[biological oxygen demand]]). Their results for the septic tanks showed a homogenization of conditions in the tanks after application of septic tank additives, which they suggested was due to domination by a particular type of micro-organism. However, they found no reduction in suspended solids concentration in the effluent and concluded that there were not sufficient changes in sludge volume in the wastewater treatment plant or suspended solids in the septic tanks to indicate a clear benefit from the use of these kinds of additives in wastewater.

=== Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi, Pakistan ===
A project in Karachi, Pakistan called the [[Orangi Pilot Project]] (OPP) has been making use of pit additives. The OPP promotes a treatment technology comprising a two-chamber tank. The first of these acts like the first compartment of a septic tank while the second is filled with gravel to provide filtration. It is not clear whether flow through the second compartment is upward or downward.  This arrangement has some similarities to baffled reactor designs promoted by the German NGO [[Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association|BORDA]], although standard BORDA designs provide more chambers, arranged in series and with all after the first chamber operating in an upward flow mode. The baffled reactor design is one of a number of ‘DEWATS’ (decentralised wastewater treatment systems) wastewater treatment technologies promoted by BORDA. All operate anaerobically and are examples of what might be termed enhanced primary treatment. If maintained well, enhanced primary treatment modules should perform better than a well maintained conventional septic tank but will still produce an effluent with high pathogen levels and relatively high biological oxygen demand and suspended solids concentrations.

The OPP is using the additives to improve the effluent produced at these small treatment plants, including the plant that treats effluent from a nursery in Karachi. It has also supported the installation of several small treatment plants using EM technology in rural Sindh and Punjab. Its partner organization Ali Hasan Mangi Memorial Trust (AHMMT) installed a small sewage treatment unit with additives to treat sewage from 300 houses in the village Khairodero in Larkana District. Another eleven are reported to be functioning and more are planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oppinstitutions.org/Nursery.htm|title=Untitled Document|work=oppinstitutions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During discussions at the Urban Resource Centre in Karachi in late 2011, the late Parveen Rehman of OPP stated that adding pit additives to the inlet chamber of these treatment facilities had resulted in improved effluent quality and a significant reduction in smell. However, it seems that OPP had not attempted to quantify the improvement and had not made any formal assessment of the effect of the pit additive on effluent quality.

== Eradication efforts in the 20th century ==

The Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) was begun in Pakistan by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in the 1970s to combat deaths from six vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Health for all in Pakistan: achievements, strategies and challenges|journal = Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal = La Revue De Santé De La Méditerranée Orientale = Al-Majallah Al-Ṣiḥḥīyah Li-Sharq Al-Mutawassiṭ|date = 2000-07-01|issn = 1020-3397|pmid = 11794092|pages = 832–837|volume = 6|issue = 4|first = S.

Opposition to the polio vaccination program by militant groups continues to thwart the success of eradication efforts. In 2014, the number of polio cases reached 306, the highest it has been since 2000.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pakistan launches new polio vaccine, aims for 2016 wipeout|url = https://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-launches-polio-vaccine-aims-2016-wipeout-144401327.html|website = Yahoo News|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the country launched an injectable polio vaccine intended to treat four million children and bring Pakistan closer to its goal of eradication by 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pakistan launches new polio vaccine, aims for 2016 wipeout|url = https://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-launches-polio-vaccine-aims-2016-wipeout-144401327.html|website = Yahoo News|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the new vaccine is pricier than the traditional oral [[polio vaccine]] (OPV) and requires that a doctor or nurse administer it, the injection needs only one dose, not repeated doses, to generate immunity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Connection to the Assassination of Osama Bin Laden ===

Leading up to the early 2000s, Pakistani vaccination workers were making notable progress in eliminating the polio virus in the highly infected areas of Gadap, Quetta Block (Quetta, Pishin, Kila Abdullah Districts), FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar and the neighboring areas of Mardan, Charsaddah, Nowshehra and Lakki Marwat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan|title = Polio in Pakistan|date = 2015|accessdate = 19 October 2015|website = End Polio Pakistan|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employed the services of Pakistani doctor, [[Shakil Afridi]], and local health officials to stage a fake vaccination campaign in an attempt to confirm [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s location in Abbottabad. This ruse was organized in an effort to gain more knowledge on Bin Laden's whereabouts prior to [[Operation Neptune Spear]].&lt;ref name="Heidi Larson"&gt;{{cite news|title=The CIA's fake vaccination drive has damaged the battle against polio|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/27/cia-fake-vaccination-polio|accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 May 2012|author=Heidi Larson}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is still unknown if Afridi was aware of the implications for his services in the campaign, the main goal of the CIA was to collect [[DNA]] samples of [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s children from blood left on the needles used to deliver the [[Hepatitis B]] vaccination.&lt;ref name="BBC20111006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15206639|title=Bin Laden death: 'CIA doctor' accused of treason|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA's fake vaccination campaign has had severe lasting effects on the North West corner of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fake vaccine campaign in Pakistan could threaten plans to eradicate polio|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4580|journal = BMJ|date = 2011-07-19|issn = 0959-8138|pmid = 21771828|pages = d4580|volume = 343|doi = 10.1136/bmj.d4580|first = Jeanne|last = Lenzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, at least 70 polio workers have been killed in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four kidnapped polio workers are found dead in Pakistan - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31507217|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the attacks have been claimed by the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Taliban]], who forward claims that the vaccination campaigns are a facade for intelligence gathering.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/south-asia/pakistans-fight-against-polio-clashes-with-battle-against-taliban#page2 |title=Pakistan’s fight against polio clashes with battle against Taliban |date=20 January 2015 |publisher=The National |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fake Hepatitis B campaign has caused people to question the motivations behind all vaccination campaigns, leading to a spike in poliomyelitis cases from 198 in 2011 to 306 cases in 2014. Many citizens of both the US and various other nations have criticized the CIA's vaccination campaign for the effects that it has had on Pakistan's public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the CIA’s Fake Vaccination Campaign Endangers Us All|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-cia-fake-vaccination-campaign-endangers-us-all/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent government efforts ===

In 2015, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] government issued arrest warrants for 1,200 parents and guardians for refusing to administer vaccine to their children. 512 people were arrested on the charge but were later freed after signing an undertaking that they would not oppose vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1167750 |title=Polio: Arrest warrants for parents reduce cases of vaccination refusal |date=6 March 2015 |publisher=DAWN |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, new cases of polio had dropped by 70% as compared to 2014, due to increased vaccination in parts of the northwest Pakistan that had previously been under the control of militants. These areas were secured by Pakistani forces in the [[Zarb-e-Azb]] Campgain against Taliban militants.&lt;ref name="BBC: Polio in Pakistan"/&gt; Previously, vaccination teams were forbidden by militants from vaccinating children in the area.

==Factors affecting eradication==
Some of the reasons which affect the eradication of polio are political unrest, poor health infrastructure, and government negligence. The most afflicted areas are those where militants are present and the government lacks absolute control, such as the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]. Transmission of the virus from such areas then leads to spread through other parts of the country.

=== Misinformation campaigns ===
Due to the fact that the vaccines are primarily produced in western countries, militant groups like [[Tehrik-i-Taliban]] propagandize that they are made out of pig fat or contain alcohol, the two things that are forbidden in Islam. Some clerics have also denounced the vaccines.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/explainer-why-polio-remains-endemic-afghanistan-pakistan-nigeria/24804097.html |title=Explainer: Why Polio Remains Endemic In Afghanistan, Pakistan, And Nigeria |date=20 December 2012 |publisher=Radio Free Europe |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a myth prevalent in many of the areas with low literacy rates that the immunization sterilizes the local population.&lt;ref name="Heidi Larson"/&gt;

In early 2012, it was reported that some parents refused to get their children vaccinated in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[FATA]] on religious grounds but overall religious refusals in the rest of the country have "decreased manifold".&lt;ref name="WHO rejects rumours"&gt;{{cite news|title=WHO rejects polio imad rumours|url=http://dawn.com/2012/02/26/who-rejects-polio-rumours/|accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=26 February 2012|author=Imran Ali Teepu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both major sides of the Afghani civil war now support polio vaccination,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26121732&lt;/ref&gt; and polio rates are declining rapidly in Afghanistan, with only seven cases in 2015 (as of August 18, 2015).&lt;ref name="reuters.com-2015-08-18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/18/health-polio-who-idUSL5N10S2ST20150818 |title=CORRECTED-Pakistan, Afghanistan must step up fight against polio - WHO |author=Stephanie Nebehay |date=August 18, 2015 |website=Reuters.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]] there were 29 cases in the same period,&lt;ref name="reuters.com-2015-08-18"/&gt; with organizational difficulties slowing immunization,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/world/south-asia/pakistans-fight-against-polio-clashes-with-battle-against-taliban#page2&lt;/ref&gt; but more than ten million children have been vaccinated in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/uae-polio-campaign-vaccinates-millions-of-pakistani-children&lt;/ref&gt; This is the last remaining region with active polio cases as of 2015.

==== The potential role of Saudi Arabia ====
Some researchers point to the unique role that Saudi Arabia is able to play in the affairs of the Muslim-majority Pakistan, both as the site of the annual Islamic pilgrimage (the [[Hajj]]) and as the seat of formal Islamic authority, in terms of the ability to pass [[fatwa]]s and shape public opinion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Poliomyelitis in Pakistan: time for the Muslim world to step in|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673613607643|journal = The Lancet|pages = 1521–1523|volume = 381|issue = 9877|doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(13)60764-3|first = Qanta A|last = Ahmed|first2 = Sania|last2 = Nishtar|first3 = Ziad A|last3 = Memish|pmid=23623055|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that over 10% (200,000) of the Hajj pilgrims are Pakistani, Saudi Arabia has a vested interest in eradication campaigns in Pakistan to prevent spread during Hajj. One possible avenue for the Muslim world to eliminate the polio threat is to have local mosques and community centres promote vaccination, emphasizing that the sanctity of life is foremost in Islam.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; If supported by national and international Muslim organisations, with the aid of world health agencies and Muslim public health scholars, this policy could reduce the extent of misinformation the Taliban is able to spread.

=== Poor health infrastructure ===
[[Health care in Pakistan|Pakistan's healthcare system]] is burdened by poor public-sector funding, an ill-regulated private sector, and a lack of governmental transparency, all of which contribute to limiting the quality of public health services.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pakistan, politics and polio|url = http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0042-96862010000200018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization|issn = 0042-9686|pages = 159–160|volume = 88|issue = 2|doi = 10.2471/blt.09.066480|first = Sania|last = Nishtar|pmc = 2814480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Polio Eradication Initiative is well funded, it is delivered through the underfunded public infrastructure. Members of the Polio Eradication Committee in Pakistan have also expressed concerns regarding the accountability of the organizations backing the campaign.

Since the number of cases began to rise following the raid on the [[Osama Bin Laden]] compound, organizations including local health authorities, government workers, WHO, and UNICEF have been asserting blame rather than addressing the public health issues at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30822967|title = What must Pakistan do to beat polio?|date = 18 January 2015|accessdate = 19 October 2015|website = BBC News|publisher = BBC|last = Khan|first = M Illyas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public health system provides various avenues for institutionalized malpractice, wherein resources are leached. Staff misconduct is common, where staff members remain absent from duty, fail to run field operations, and divert vaccine for use in private facilities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This can result in the attachment of costs to services intended to be free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Choked pipes: reforming Pakistan's mixed health system|last = Nishtar|first = Sania|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0195479690|location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[Fecal-oral route|Fecal-oral transmission]] is the most common source of transmission of the poliovirus in developing countries, including Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transmissibility and Persistence of Oral Polio Vaccine Viruses: Implications for the Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Initiative|url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/150/10/1001|journal = American Journal of Epidemiology|date = 1999-11-15|issn = 0002-9262|pmid = 10568615|pages = 1001–1021|volume = 150|issue = 10|doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009924|first = Paul E. M.|last = Fine|first2 = Ilona A. M.|last2 = Carneiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition to the poor health and water sanitation infrastructure, the transmission of the virus is also heightened because of the high population density and climate conditions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "We Can't Give Up Now": Global Health Optimism and Polio Eradication in Pakistan|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01459740.2011.645927|journal = Medical Anthropology|pages = 385–403|volume = 31|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/01459740.2011.645927|first = Svea|last = Closser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that the polio vaccine has reduced per-dose efficacy in areas near the [[Tropics]], including Pakistan and its neighboring country India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oral Polio Vaccination of Children in the Tropics: I. the Poor Seroconversion Rates and the Absence of Viral Interference|url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/96/4/263|journal = American Journal of Epidemiology|date = 1972-10-01|issn = 0002-9262|pmid = 4342327|pages = 263–269|volume = 96|issue = 4|first = T. Jacob|last = John|first2 = P.|last2 = Jayabal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the climate in South Asia, sometimes ten or more doses of the vaccine need to be administered, each a month apart, in order to ensure immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New Strategies for the Elimination of Polio from India|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5802/1150|journal = Science|date = 2006-11-17|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17110580|pages = 1150–1153|volume = 314|issue = 5802|doi = 10.1126/science.1130388|first = Nicholas C.|last = Grassly|first2 = Christophe|last2 = Fraser|first3 = Jay|last3 = Wenger|first4 = Jagadish M.|last4 = Deshpande|first5 = Roland W.|last5 = Sutter|first6 = David L.|last6 = Heymann|first7 = R. Bruce|last7 = Aylward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month-long spacing can itself be a reason for families not to complete the vaccination schedule, because transportation could prove unreliable from month to month, and parents might be unable to take time off of work for risk of losing the day's income or losing their job entirely.

The threat of natural disaster also plays a role in delaying total eradication of polio.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, Pakistan is prone to earthquakes and heavy monsoon rains. In the [[2010 Pakistan floods]], of the 20 million affected, a majority were in the lowest socioeconomic percentile.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Floods in Pakistan: a public health crisis|url = http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0042-96862011000300016&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization|issn = 0042-9686|pmc = 3044252|pmid = 21379421|pages = 236–237|volume = 89|issue = 3|doi = 10.2471/BLT.10.083386|first = Haider|last = Warraich|first2 = Anita KM|last2 = Zaidi|first3 = Kavita|last3 = Patel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to cases of [[dengue fever]], [[cholera]], and [[measles]], the WHO reported an upsurge in cases of polio. By November 2010, Pakistan accounted for about 62% of all polio cases from endemic countries, with most new cases being from areas affected by the floods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Perceptions of Pakistani parents ===
Another reason for the resistance to the polio vaccine is one of mindset. There is a common perception that other issues are more pressing than vaccination. A manifestation of this is the policy perspective that, if the source of the virus is contaminated drinking water, efforts should be made to purify the water rather than focus on the treatment of disease caused by ingesting the water. Surveys of the Pakistani population show that a significant number feel that the allocation of funding to prevent the problem is more efficient than retroactive treatment once the problem (the spread of polio) has already happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/16/suspicion-slows-dangerous-work-to-eradicate-polio-in-pakistan|title = Suspicion slows dangerous work to eradicate polio in Pakistan|date = 16 April 2015|accessdate = 19 October 2015|website = The Guardian|publisher = The Guardian News|last = Hedayat|first = Nelufar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been shown that low parental - specifically, maternal - literacy and knowledge regarding vaccines and immunization schedules, poor socioeconomic status, and residence in rural areas all are attributable to decreased rates of immunization completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does improving maternal knowledge of vaccines impact infant immunization rates?

In a study of two-parent households in Pakistan, it was shown that the father's knowledge about health most impacted immunization decisions, with an effect so large that some researchers contend improving education will improve health more so than even the provision of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parental Education and Child Health—Understanding the Pathways of Impact in Pakistan|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001179|journal = World Development|date = 2012-10-01|pages = 2014–2032|volume = 40|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.05.007|first = Monazza|last = Aslam|first2 = Geeta Gandhi|last2 = Kingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factors ===
Widespread [[malnutrition]] in Pakistani children is a factor in lowered resistance to disabling diseases and reduced efficacy of the polio vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Education and Disability in Cross-Cultural Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PYwuAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-11-26|isbn = 9781135811587|first = Susan Jeanne|last = Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of polio in Pakistan ==
Polio has had drastic effects on the health of the population of Pakistan and on the nation's healthcare infrastructure and economy. The WHO estimates that 65–75% of polio cases in developing countries occur in children under 3 years of age, with 95% of all cases occurring in children under 5 years of age.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Poliomyelitis (Polio)|url = http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/polio/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University quantified the [[disease burden]] of various diseases in Pakistan; in the year 1990, a Pakistani person with polio averaged a loss of 1.13 healthy life years to the disease.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Applying burden of disease methods in developing countries: a case study from Pakistan.|journal = American Journal of Public Health|date = 2000-08-01|issn = 0090-0036|pmc = 1446325|pmid = 10937003|pages = 1235–1240|volume = 90|issue = 8|first = A A|last = Hyder|first2 = R H|last2 = Morrow|doi=10.2105/ajph.90.8.1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of disability of polio, averaged over 1000 people, was 81.84 years, the equivalent of diseases including [[diphtheria]], [[Meningitis|childhood meningitis]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

There has been limited research into the impacts of polio in Pakistan in recent years, but a 1988 health survey found that the most common handicaps among polio sufferers were associated with mobility, occupation, and social integration.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of community-based rehabilitation in Punjab, Pakistan: II: The prevalence of diseases, impairments, and handicaps|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09638288809164102|journal = International Disability Studies|date = 1988-01-01|issn = 0259-9147|pmid = 3261293|pages = 59–60|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.3109/09638288809164102|first = Gunnar|last = Grimby|first2 = Jane|last2 = Finnstam|first3 = Gunnel|last3 = Nelson|first4 = Saeada|last4 = Rashid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey found differences in participants based on whether they lived in a village or a slum area: there was a higher rate of handicap in the village population, and higher frequencies of infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases in the slum area. Both areas saw polio victims suffer from a higher incidence of musculoskeletal system diseases, as well as infections of the ear, and respiratory tract.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Given 1–2 years with occupational therapists, 80% of patients with handicaps showed improvement in function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of community-based rehabilitation in Punjab, Pakistan: I: Use of the WHO manual, ‘Training disabled people in the community’|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09638288809164100|journal = International Disability Studies|date = 1988-01-01|issn = 0259-9147|pmid = 3403499|pages = 54–58|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.3109/09638288809164100|first = Jane|last = Finnstam|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Grimby|first3 = Gunnel|last3 = Nelson|first4 = Saeada|last4 = Rashid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16420">The '''Public Finance Balance of Smoking in the Czech Republic''' was a 2001 report commissioned by [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]]'s [[Czech Republic|Czech]] division following concerns raised by the Czech health ministry that smoking's costs outweighed its fiscal benefits.&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/BUSINESS/07/16/czech.morris/|title=CNN.com - Study for Philip Morris found smokers' early deaths helped Czech finances - Jul. 16, 2001|date=July 16, 2001|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hspm.sph.sc.edu/courses/Econ/Classes/cbacea/czechsmokingcost.html|title=Public Finance Balance of Smoking in the Czech Republic|date=November 28, 2000|work=Arthur D.

Little]] and found that smokers' early mortality and cigarette-tax revenue, outweighed the costs of health-care and lost tax revenue from early death.&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; The study concluded through [[cost-benefit analysis]] "based on up-to-date reliable data and consideration of all relevant contributing factors, the effect of smoking on the public finance balance in the Czech Republic in 1999 was positive, estimated at +5,815 mil. CZK."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

The report which was leaked on July 16, 2001 was met with condemnation and subjected Philip Morris to vitriolic criticism from politicians, anti-smoking activists, and watchdog groups. Philip Morris subsequently disavowed the report and apologized for its conclusion. Nonetheless, the suggested "death benefit" raised by the report continues to be the subject of debate.

The report was unusual as historically, tobacco companies had disputed the link between smoking and early mortality, whereas the report used the early mortality as a selling point.&lt;ref name="Sarah"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/17/smoking.sarahboseley|title=Smoking can seriously aid your economy |last=Sarah|first=Boseley|author2=Kate Connolly |date=17 July 2001|work=Guardian|accessdate=13 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though similar studies in Europe had been done a decade earlier, Philip Morris stated that it had canceled any new similar reports in countries including Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/27/business/philip-morris-issues-apology-for-czech-study-on-smoking.html | work=The New York Times | title=Philip Morris Issues Apology For Czech Study on Smoking | date=27 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kmietowicz, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] reported that an [[Arthur D. Little]] representative had told them that Philip Morris had commissioned similar studies in Canada and the Netherlands, though Philip Morris stated it had no such on-going reports.&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt;

The Czech Prime Minister, [[Miloš Zeman]] had previously noted the "death benefit" stating that "By smoking, I contribute to the stability of the state budget. By buying cigarettes, I increase state revenues, and I will die of lung cancer, so the state won’t have to pay me a pension."&lt;ref name="Sarah"/&gt; In addition, Zeman had stated that "As a smoker, I support the state budget, because in the Czech Republic we pay tax on tobacco. Also, smokers die sooner, and the state does not need to look after them in their old age."&lt;ref name="WHO p20"&gt;Building Blocks for Tobacco Control: a Handbook, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HOLLEY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/05/news/mn-30831|title=Philip Morris Angers Czechs With Tobacco Toll Report|last=Holley|first=David|date=August 5, 2001|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}
The stated objective of the report "was to determine whether costs imposed on public finance by smokers are offset by tobacco-related tax contributions and external positive effects of smoking."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

==Public relations timeline==
Following the leak, the company initially defended the report. Philip Morris spokesman Remi Calvert stating that "It is very unfortunate that this is one aspect of the study that is being focused on"&lt;ref name="bbcj17"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1443098.stm|title=Fury over 'benefits of smoking' report|date=17 July 2001|publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "We understand that it appears quite cold, but tobacco is a controversial product."&lt;ref name="Sarasohn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/special/current/dbcooper.ssf?/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/ed_61dvs20.frame|title=Smoking cuts elderly costs, and elderly |date=20 July 2001|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|location=Portland, Oregon|accessdate=8 November 2011|first=David|last=Sarasohn|authorlink=David Sarasohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kaplan, director of communications at Philip Morris International stated that the report's purported death benefit was "just one point" and "was not the point we were emphasizing."&lt;ref name="Sarah"/&gt;

The company subsequently apologized for the report. Kaplan later stated that "We are not in any way suggesting that the social cost of smoking is of benefit to society."&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; Steven Parrish, vice-president at Philip Morris, stating that "We understand that this was not only a terrible mistake, but that it was wrong. To say it's inappropriate is an understatement."&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/27/michaelellison| title=Tobacco giant apologises to Czechs | newspaper= The Guardian|last=Ellison|first=Michael|date=27 July 2001|accessdate=13 August 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an internal memo, CEO [[John R. Nelson]] agreed with critics that the report "exhibited a callous and cynical disregard of basic human values."&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/2001-07-24-edtwof2.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Tobacco's death benefits|date=2001-07-23|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, 2001, Phillip Morris issued an apology in the Wall Street Journal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For one of our tobacco companies to commission this study (AD Little Report concluding that smokers save the state money - by dying early) was not just a terrible mistake, it was wrong. All of us at Philip Morris, no matter where we work, are extremely sorry for this. No one benefits from the very real, serious and significant diseases caused by smoking. We understand the outrage that has been expressed and we sincerely regret this extraordinarily unfortunate incident. We will continue our best efforts to do the right thing in all our business, acknowledging mistakes when we make them and learning from them as we go forward.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The release of the report was viewed as a setback for Philip Morris which had been making charitable donations to improve its public image.&lt;ref name="English"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2727666/Philip-Morris-is-extremely-sorry-for-Czech-study.html|title=Philip Morris is 'extremely sorry' for Czech study|last=English|first=Simon|date=27 July 2001|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mladá Fronta Dnes]]'' described the report as "first-class cynicism and hyena-ism" comparing it to how [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] determined the value of life in [[Nazi concentration camps]] adding "What an offer: `come help us make money on the death of your citizens."&lt;ref name="GREEN"/&gt; The ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'' described the report as "The Philip Morris Health Plan" comparing it to [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''.&lt;ref name="Proffitt"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Sweeping Concept – The Philip Morris Health Plan|last=Proffitt|first=Waldo|date=July 29, 2001|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|page=F2|quote=Editorial reaction I have seen has not recognized the full potential and significance of the Philip Morris policy. It is, no pun intended, truly breathtaking. There has been nothing comparable since Jonathan Swift's Modest Proposal in 1729.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the report, anti-smoking groups placed ads in prominent newspapers such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' depicting a corpse with a price tag stating "$1,227, [£860] that's how much a study sponsored by Philip Morris said the Czech Republic saves on healthcare, pensions and housing every time a smoker dies".&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

;Politicians
* On 17 July 2001, U.S. Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] called the report "appalling" and wrote to CEO Geoffry Bible that "by including a cost-benefit analysis of human lives in its calculations, Phillip Morris has stepped well-past the lines of decency and demonstrated, once again, that it conducts business in a manner completely disconnected from any sense of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="senateletter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/bpd22c00|title=Letter|last=Feinstein|first=Dianne|date=July 17, 2001|work=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library|publisher=University of California|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tobacco Products Liability Project stated that "The governments role normally is to protect the health and safety and welfare of their citizens so the idea that somehow or another the government or the state could be benefiting by their citizens dying off would strike anybody who has their conscious reasonably intact as being really quite dreadful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1440000/audio/_1442555_smoking06_daynard.ram Richard Raynard, Tobacco Products Liability Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

(1997). Designing HMDs for viewing comfort. In J. E. Melzer &amp; K. Moffitt (eds.), ''Head mounted displays: Designing for the user''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; These viewing systems include binocular microscopes, [[night vision device]]s or goggles (NVGs), and [[head-mounted display]]s (HMDs). IPD data are used in the design of such systems to specify the range of lateral adjustment of the exit optics or eyepieces. IPD is also used to describe the distance between the exit pupils or optical axes of a binocular optical system. The distinction with IPD is the importance of [[anthropometric]] databases and the design of binocular viewing devices with an IPD adjustment that will fit a targeted population of users.

== Measuring pupillary distance ==
[[File:Messbrille fcm.jpg|thumb|Monocular PD can be measured during an eye test]]
Different methods for measuring exist but accurate measurement can usually be determined by an [[Eye care professional|ECP]] during an [[eye examination]]. This is normally done with a small millimeter ruler referred to as a "PD stick" or with a corneal reflex [[Pupilometer|pupillometer]], which is a machine calibrated to help the optical professional more accurately measure the pupillary distance.&lt;ref name="McCleary2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David McCleary|title=The Optician Training Manual: Simple Steps to Becoming a Great Optician|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRWqYgctJfQC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2009|publisher=Santa Rosa Publishing|isbn=978-0-615-19381-6|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mobile phone and web apps that can measure one's pupillary distance.

== Viewing devices ==
Devices such as [[stereo microscope]]s have small exit pupils, and adjustment for user IPD is necessary.&lt;ref name="Boeing Report"&gt;Farrell, R. J., &amp; Booth, J. M. (1975). ''Design handbook for imagery interpretation equipment''. Seattle WA: Boeing Aerospace Company.&lt;/ref&gt; These devices can be designed to fit a large range of IPDs as factors such as size and weight of the adjusting mechanism are not overly critical. In contrast to microscopes, the weight and bulk of NVGs and HMDs are large factors for wearing comfort and usability. The ''ANVIS'' NVG has an adjustment range of 52 to 72&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Rash, C. E. (2001). Introductory overview. In C. E. Rash (ed.), ''Helmet-mounted displays: Design issues for rotary-wing aircraft''. Ft. Rucker AL: US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.rockwellcollins.com/optronics ''Rockwell-Collins Optronics''] ''XL35'' and ''XL50'' binocular HMDs have a range of 55 to 75&amp;nbsp;mm. The ''1988 Army Survey'' can be used to evaluate the percentage of the Army population captured by these ranges.

Binocular HMDs can be designed with a fixed IPD to minimize weight, bulk and cost. The fixed-IPD design strategy assumes that the exit pupil will be large enough to capture the IPD range of a targeted population. An adjustable IPD design assumes that the lateral adjustment range in conjunction with the exit pupil size is required to capture the targeted population.

== Databases ==
Anthropometric databases are available that include IPD.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgson, N. A. (2004). Variation and extrema of human interpupillary distance. In A. J. Woods, J. O. Merritt, S. A. Benton and M. T.

== Other applications ==
IPD is also used in binocular [[vision science]].  For example, a bench-top [[haploscope]] may require setting the mirror separation for each experimental subject. Other experimental presentations may require the use of IPD to control for ocular convergence and binocular depth. 

Several binocular HMDs that support night vision position the sensors on the sides of the helmet, effectively extending the IPD by approximately 4x and creating hyperstereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;Temme, L. A., Kalich, M. E., Curry, I. P., Pinkus, A. R., Task, H. L., &amp; Rash, C. E. (2009). Visual perceptual conflicts and illusions. In C. E. Rash, M. B. Russo, T. R. Letowski, &amp; E. T. Schmeisser (eds.), ''Helmet-mounted displays: Sensation, perception and cognition issues''. Ft. Rucker AL: U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperstereopsis increases ocular convergence and causes near objects to appear closer and with exaggerated depth and slant.

IPD application is found in [[stereoscopy]], [[Virtual reality headset|virtual reality headsets]] gaming, education and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Lewis Brooks|author2=Sheryl Brahnam|author3=Lakhmi C.

The '''Rasch model''', named after [[Georg Rasch]], is a family of [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] models for creating measurements from [[categorical data]], such as answers to questions on a reading assessment or questionnaire responses, as a function of the trade-off between (a) the respondent's abilities, attitudes, or [[personality trait]]s and (b) the item difficulty.&lt;ref name="Rasch1960"&gt;Rasch, G. (1960/1980). Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests.(Copenhagen, Danish Institute for Educational Research), expanded edition (1980) with foreword and afterword by B.D. Wright. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they may be used to estimate a student's reading ability or the extremity of a person's attitude to capital punishment from responses on a questionnaire.  In addition to [[psychometrics]] and educational research, the Rasch model and its extensions are used in other areas, including the [[health profession]]&lt;ref&gt;Bezruczko, N. (2005). Rasch measurement in health sciences. Maple Grove, MN: Jam Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and market research&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, G. G. (1985). Generalizing the Rasch model for consumer rating scales. Marketing Science, 4(1), 62-73.&lt;/ref&gt; because of their general applicability.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, B. D. (1977). Solving measurement problems with the Rasch model. Journal of Educational Measurement, 14(2), 97-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical theory underlying Rasch models is a special case of [[item response theory]] and, more generally, a special case of a [[generalized linear model]]. However, there are important differences in the interpretation of the model parameters and its philosophical implications&lt;ref&gt;Linacre J.M. (2005). Rasch dichotomous model vs. One-parameter Logistic Model. Rasch Measurement Transactions, 19:3, 1032&lt;/ref&gt; that separate proponents of the '''Rasch model''' from the item response modeling tradition. A central aspect of this divide relates to the role of specific objectivity,&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1977). On Specific Objectivity: An attempt at formalizing the request for generality and validity of scientific statements. The Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, 14, 58-93.&lt;/ref&gt; a defining property of the Rasch model according to [[Georg Rasch]], as a requirement for successful measurement.

==Overview==

===The Rasch model for measurement===
In the Rasch model, the probability of a specified response (e.g. right/wrong answer) is modeled as a function of person and item parameters. Specifically, in the original Rasch model, the probability of a correct response is modeled as a [[logistic function]] of the difference between the person and item parameter. The mathematical form of the model is provided later in this article. In most contexts, the parameters of the model characterize the proficiency of the respondents and the difficulty of the items as locations on a continuous latent variable. For example, in educational tests, item parameters represent the difficulty of items while person parameters represent the ability or attainment level of people who are assessed. The higher a person's ability relative to the difficulty of an item, the higher the probability of a correct response on that item. When a person's location on the latent trait is equal to the difficulty of the item, there is by definition a 0.5 probability of a correct response in the Rasch model.

A Rasch model is a ''model'' in one sense in that it represents the structure which data should exhibit in order to obtain measurements from the data; i.e. it provides a criterion for successful measurement. Beyond data, Rasch's equations model relationships we expect to obtain in the real world. For instance, education is intended to prepare children for the entire range of challenges they will face in life, and not just those that appear in textbooks or on tests. By requiring measures to remain the same (invariant) across different tests measuring the same thing, Rasch models make it possible to test the hypothesis that the particular challenges posed in a curriculum and on a test coherently represent the infinite population of all possible challenges in that domain. A Rasch model is therefore a model in the sense of an ''ideal'' or standard that provides a heuristic fiction serving as a useful organizing principle even when it is never actually observed in practice.

The perspective or paradigm underpinning the Rasch model is distinct from the perspective underpinning [[statistical model]]ling. Models are most often used with the intention of describing a set of data. Parameters are modified and accepted or rejected based on how well they fit the data. In contrast, when the Rasch model is employed, the objective is to obtain data which fit the model (Andrich, 2004; Wright, 1984, 1999). The rationale for this perspective is that the Rasch model embodies requirements which must be met in order to obtain measurement, in the sense that measurement is generally understood in the physical sciences.

A useful analogy for understanding this rationale is to consider objects measured on a weighing scale. Suppose the weight of an object A is measured as being substantially greater than the weight of an object B on one occasion, then immediately afterward the weight of object B is measured as being substantially greater than the weight of object A. A property we require of measurements is that the resulting comparison between objects should be the same, or invariant, irrespective of other factors. This key requirement is embodied within the formal structure of the Rasch model. Consequently, the Rasch model is not altered to suit data. Instead, the method of assessment should be changed so that this requirement is met, in the same way that a weighing scale should be rectified if it gives different comparisons between objects upon separate measurements of the objects.

Data analysed using the model are usually responses to conventional items on tests, such as educational tests with right/wrong answers. However, the model is a general one, and can be applied wherever discrete data are obtained with the intention of measuring a quantitative attribute or trait.

===Scaling===
[[Image:TCC.PNG|thumb|380px|right|Figure 1: Test characteristic curve showing the relationship between total score on a test and person location estimate]]
When all test-takers have an opportunity to attempt all items on a single test, each total score on the test maps to a unique estimate of ability and the greater the total, the greater the ability estimate. Total scores do not have a linear relationship with ability estimates. Rather, the relationship is non-linear as shown in Figure 1. The total score is shown on the vertical axis, while the corresponding person location estimate is shown on the horizontal axis. For the particular test on which the test characteristic curve (TCC) shown in Figure 1 is based, the relationship is approximately linear throughout the range of total scores from about 10 to 33. The shape of the TCC is generally somewhat sigmoid as in this example. However, the precise relationship between total scores and person location estimates depends on the distribution of items on the test. The TCC is steeper in ranges on the continuum in which there are a number of items, such as in the range on either side of 0 in Figures 1 and 2.

In applying the Rasch model, item locations are often scaled first, based on methods such as those described below. This part of the process of scaling is often referred to as item ''calibration''. In educational tests, the smaller the proportion of correct responses, the higher the difficulty of an item and hence the higher the item's scale location. Once item locations are scaled, the person locations are measured on the scale. As a result, person and item locations are estimated on a single scale as shown in Figure 2.

===Interpreting scale locations===
[[Image:PersItm.PNG|thumb|410px|left|Figure 2: Graph showing histograms of person distribution (top) and item distribution (bottom) on a scale]]
For dichotomous data such as right/wrong answers, by definition, the location of an item on a scale corresponds with the person location at which there is a 0.5 probability of a correct response to the question. In general, the probability of a person responding correctly to a question with difficulty lower than that person's location is greater than 0.5, while the probability of responding correctly to a question with difficulty greater than the person's location is less than 0.5. The Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) or Item Response Function (IRF) shows the probability of a correct response as a function of the ability of persons. A single ICC is shown and explained in more detail in relation to Figure 4 in this article (see also [[Item Response Theory#The item response function|the item response function]]). The leftmost ICCs in Figure 3 are the easiest items, the rightmost items in the same figure are the most difficult items.

When responses of a person are listed according to item difficulty, from lowest to highest, the most likely pattern is a [[Guttman scale|Guttman pattern]] or vector; i.e. {1,1,...,1,0,0,0,...,0}. However, while this pattern is the most probable given the structure of the Rasch model, the model requires only probabilistic Guttman response patterns; that is, patterns which tend toward the Guttman pattern. It is unusual for responses to conform strictly to the pattern because there are many possible patterns. It is unnecessary for responses to conform strictly to the pattern in order for data to fit the Rasch model.
[[Image:ICCs prog.png|thumb|380px|right|Figure 3: ICCs for a number of items. ICCs are coloured to highlight the change in the probability of a successful response for a person with ability location at the vertical line. The person is likely to respond correctly to the easiest items (with locations to the left and higher curves) and unlikely to respond correctly to difficult items (locations to the right and lower curves).]]
Each ability estimate has an associated [[standard error of measurement]], which quantifies the degree of uncertainty associated with the ability estimate. Item estimates also have standard errors. Generally, the standard errors of item estimates are considerably smaller than the standard errors of person estimates because there are usually more response data for an item than for a person. That is, the number of people attempting a given item is usually greater than the number of items attempted by a given person. Standard errors of person estimates are smaller where the slope of the ICC is steeper, which is generally through the middle range of scores on a test. Thus, there is greater precision in this range since the steeper the slope, the greater the distinction between any two points on the line.

Statistical and graphical tests are used to evaluate the correspondence of data with the model. Certain tests are global, while others focus on specific items or people. Certain tests of fit provide information about which items can be used to increase the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of a test by omitting or correcting problems with poor items. In Rasch Measurement the person separation index is used instead of reliability indices. However, the person separation index is analogous to a reliability index. The separation index is a summary of the genuine separation as a ratio to separation including measurement error. As mentioned earlier, the level of measurement error is not uniform across the range of a test, but is generally larger for more extreme scores (low and high).

==Features of the Rasch model==
The class of models is named after [[Georg Rasch]], a Danish mathematician and statistician who advanced the [[epistemology|epistemological]] case for the models based on their congruence with a core requirement of measurement in [[physics]]; namely the requirement of ''invariant comparison''.&lt;ref name="Rasch1960" /&gt; This is the defining feature of the class of models, as is elaborated upon in the following section. The Rasch model for dichotomous data has a close conceptual relationship to the [[law of comparative judgment]] (LCJ), a model formulated and used extensively by [[L. L. Thurstone]],&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L. L. (1927). A law of comparative judgment. Psychological Review, 34(4), 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone and sensory scaling: Then and now. (1994). Thurstone and sensory scaling: Then and now. Psychological Review, 101(2), 271–277. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.271&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore also to the [[Thurstone scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D. (1978b).  Relationships between the Thurstone and Rasch approaches to item scaling.  ''Applied Psychological Measurement'', 2, 449–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to introducing the measurement model he is best known for, Rasch had applied the [[Poisson distribution]] to reading data as a measurement model, hypothesizing that in the relevant empirical context, the number of errors made by a given individual was governed by the ratio of the text difficulty to the person's reading ability.  Rasch referred to this model as the ''multiplicative Poisson model''.  Rasch's model for dichotomous data – i.e. where responses are classifiable into two categories – is his most widely known and used model, and is the main focus here.  This model has the form of a simple [[logistic function]].

The brief outline above highlights certain distinctive and interrelated features of Rasch's perspective on social measurement, which are as follows:

# He was concerned principally with the measurement of ''individuals'', rather than with distributions among populations.
# He was concerned with establishing a basis for meeting a priori ''requirements'' for measurement deduced from physics and, consequently, did not invoke any ''assumptions'' about the distribution of levels of a trait in a population.
# Rasch's approach explicitly recognizes that it is a scientific hypothesis that a given trait is both quantitative and measurable, as operationalized in a particular experimental context.

Thus, congruent with the perspective articulated by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in his 1961 paper ''The function of measurement in modern physical science'', measurement was regarded both as being founded in [[theory]], and as being instrumental to detecting quantitative anomalies incongruent with hypotheses related to a broader theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Thomas S. "The function of measurement in modern physical science." Isis (1961): 161-193.&lt;/ref&gt;  This perspective is in contrast to that generally prevailing in the social sciences, in which data such as test scores are directly treated as measurements without requiring a theoretical foundation for measurement.  Although this contrast exists, Rasch's perspective is actually complementary to the use of statistical analysis or modelling that requires interval-level measurements, because the purpose of applying a Rasch model is to obtain such measurements. Applications of Rasch models are described in a wide variety of sources, including Alagumalai, Curtis &amp; Hungi (2005), Bezruczko (2005), Bond &amp; Fox (2007), Burro (2016), Fisher &amp; Wright (1994), Masters &amp; Keeves (1999), and the ''Journal of Applied Measurement''.

===Invariant comparison and sufficiency===

The Rasch model for dichotomous data is often regarded as an [[item response theory]] (IRT) model with one item parameter.  However, rather than being a particular IRT model, proponents of the model&lt;ref&gt;*Bond, T.G. &amp; Fox, C.M. (2007). ''Applying the Rasch Model: Fundamental measurement in the human sciences''. 2nd Edn (includes Rasch software on CD-ROM). Lawrence Erlbaum. Page 265&lt;/ref&gt; regard it as a model that possesses a property which distinguishes it from other IRT models.  Specifically, the defining property of Rasch models is their formal or mathematical ''embodiment'' of the principle of invariant comparison. Rasch summarised the principle of invariant comparison as follows:

:The comparison between two stimuli should be independent of which particular individuals were instrumental for the comparison; and it should also be independent of which other stimuli within the considered class were or might also have been compared.

:Symmetrically, a comparison between two individuals should be independent of which particular stimuli within the class considered were instrumental for the comparison; and it should also be independent of which other individuals were also compared, on the same or some other occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1961). On general laws and the meaning of measurement in psychology, pp.&amp;nbsp;321–334 in ''Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability'', IV. Berkeley, California: University of California Press. Available free from [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.bsmsp/1200512895&amp;page=record Project Euclid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasch models embody this principle because their formal structure permits algebraic separation of the person and item parameters, in the sense that the person parameter can be ''eliminated'' during the process of [[statistical estimation]] of item parameters.  This result is achieved through the use of conditional [[maximum likelihood]] estimation, in which the response space is partitioned according to person total scores.  The consequence is that the raw score for an item or person is the [[sufficient statistic]] for the item or person [[parameter]].  That is to say, the person total score contains all information available within the specified context about the individual, and the item total score contains all information with respect to item, with regard to the relevant latent trait.  The Rasch model requires a specific structure in the response data, namely a probabilistic [[Guttman scale|Guttman]] structure.

In somewhat more familiar terms, Rasch models provide a basis and justification for obtaining person locations on a continuum from total scores on assessments.  Although it is not uncommon to treat total scores directly as measurements, they are actually counts of discrete [[observations]] rather than measurements.  Each observation represents the observable outcome of a comparison between a person and item.  Such outcomes are directly analogous to the observation of the rotation of a balance scale in one direction or another.  This observation would indicate that one or other object has a greater mass, but counts of such observations cannot be treated directly as measurements.

Rasch pointed out that the principle of invariant comparison is characteristic of measurement in physics using, by way of example, a two-way experimental frame of reference in which each instrument exerts a [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[force]] upon solid bodies to produce [[acceleration]].  Rasch&lt;ref name="Rasch1960"/&gt;{{rp|112–3}} stated of this context: "Generally: If for any two objects we find a certain ratio of their accelerations produced by one instrument, then the same ratio will be found for any other of the instruments".  It is readily shown that [[Newton's second law]] entails that such ratios are inversely proportional to the ratios of the [[mass]]es of the bodies.

==The mathematical form of the Rasch model for dichotomous data==
Let &lt;math&gt; X_{ni} = x \in \{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt; be a dichotomous random variable where, for example, &lt;math&gt; x = 1 &lt;/math&gt; denotes a correct response and &lt;math&gt; x = 0 &lt;/math&gt; an incorrect response to a given assessment item.  In the Rasch model for dichotomous data, the probability of the outcome &lt;math&gt; X_{ni} = 1 &lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pr \{X_{ni}=1\} =\frac{e^{{\beta_n} - {\delta_i}}}{1 + e^{{\beta_n} - {\delta_i}}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \beta_n &lt;/math&gt; is the ability of person &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \delta_i &lt;/math&gt; is the difficulty of item &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in the case of a dichotomous attainment item, &lt;math&gt; \Pr \{X_{ni}=1\} &lt;/math&gt; is the probability of success upon interaction between the relevant person and assessment item.  It is readily shown that the log [[odds]], or [[logit]], of correct response by a person to an item, based on the model, is equal to &lt;math&gt;\beta_n - \delta_i&lt;/math&gt;. Given two examinees with different ability parameters &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt; and an arbitrary item with difficulty &lt;math&gt; \delta_i &lt;/math&gt;, compute the difference in logits for these two examinees by &lt;math&gt;(\beta_1 - \delta_i)-(\beta_2 - \delta_i)&lt;/math&gt;. This difference becomes &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 - \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, it can be shown that the log odds of a correct response by the same person to one item, ''conditional'' on a correct response to one of two items, is equal to the difference between the item locations.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{log-odds} \{X_{n1}=1 \mid \ r_n=1\} = \delta_2-\delta_1,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_n&lt;/math&gt; is the total score of person ''n'' over the two items, which implies a correct response to one or other of the items.&lt;ref name="Rasch1960"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, E.B. (1977).  Sufficient statistics and latent trait models, ''Psychometrika'', 42, 69–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D. (2010). Sufficiency and conditional estimation of person parameters in the polytomous Rasch model. ''Psychometrika'', 75(2), 292-308.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the conditional log odds does not involve the person parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta_n&lt;/math&gt;, which can therefore be ''eliminated'' by conditioning on the total score &lt;math&gt;r_n=1&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, by partitioning the responses according to raw scores and calculating the log odds of a correct response, an estimate &lt;math&gt;\delta_2-\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; is obtained without involvement of &lt;math&gt;\beta_n&lt;/math&gt;.  More generally, a number of item parameters can be estimated iteratively through application of a process such as Conditional Maximum Likelihood estimation (see [[Rasch model estimation]]).  While more involved, the same fundamental principle applies in such estimations.

[[Image:RaschICC.gif|thumb|450px|right|Figure 4: ICC for the Rasch model showing the comparison between observed and expected proportions correct for five Class Intervals of persons]]

The ICC of the Rasch model for dichotomous data is shown in Figure 4. The grey line maps the probability of the discrete outcome &lt;math&gt;X_{ni}=1&lt;/math&gt; (that is, correctly answering the question) for persons with different locations on the latent continuum (that is, their level of abilities). The location of an item is, by definition, that location at which the probability that &lt;math&gt;X_{ni}=1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 0.5.  In figure 4, the black circles represent the actual or observed proportions of persons within Class Intervals for which the outcome was observed.  For example, in the case of an assessment item used in the context of [[educational psychology]], these could represent the proportions of persons who answered the item correctly.  Persons are ordered by the estimates of their locations on the latent continuum and classified into Class Intervals on this basis in order to graphically inspect the accordance of observations with the model.  There is a close conformity of the data with the model.  In addition to graphical inspection of data, a range of [[statistical]] tests of fit are used to evaluate whether departures of observations from the model can be attributed to [[random]] effects alone, as required, or whether there are systematic departures from the model.

==The polytomous form of the Rasch model==
{{Main|Polytomous Rasch model}}
The polytomous Rasch model, which is a generalisation of the dichotomous model, can be applied in contexts in which successive integer scores represent categories of increasing level or magnitude of a latent trait, such as increasing ability, motor function, endorsement of a statement, and so forth.  The Polytomous response model is, for example, applicable to the use of Likert scales, grading in educational assessment, and scoring of performances by judges.

==Other considerations==

A criticism of the Rasch model is that it is overly restrictive or prescriptive because an assumption of the model is that all items have equal discrimination, whereas in practice, items discriminations vary, and thus no dataset will ever show perfect data-model fit. A frequent misunderstanding is that the Rasch model does not permit each item to have a different discrimination, but equal discrimination is an assumption of invariant measurement, so differing item discriminations are not forbidden, but rather indicate that measurement quality does not equal a theoretical ideal. Just as in physical measurement, real world datasets will never perfectly match theoretical models, so the relevant question is whether a particular dataset provides sufficient quality of measurement for the purpose at hand, not whether it perfectly matches an unattainable standard of perfection.

A criticism specific to the use of multiple choice items in educational assessment is that there is no provision in the model for guessing because the left asymptote always approaches a zero probability in the Rasch model. These variations are available in models such as the two and three parameter logistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, A. (1968).  Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee’s ability.  In Lord, F.M. &amp; Novick, M.R. (Eds.), ''Statistical theories of mental test scores''. Reading, MA: Addison–Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the specification of uniform discrimination and zero left asymptote are necessary properties of the model in order to sustain sufficiency of the simple, unweighted raw score. In practice, the non-zero lower asymptote found in multiple-choice datasets is less of a threat to measurement than commonly assumed and typically does not result in substantive errors in measurement when well-developed test items are used sensibly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holster|first1=Trevor A.|last2=Lake|first2=J. W.|title=Guessing and the Rasch model|journal=Language Assessment Quarterly|date=2016|volume=13|issue=2|pages=124–141|doi=10.1080/15434303.2016.1160096|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15434303.2016.1160096?journalCode=hlaq20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verhelst &amp; Glas (1995) derive Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) equations for a model they refer to as the One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM). In algebraic form it appears to be identical with the 2PL model, but OPLM contains preset discrimination indexes rather than 2PL's estimated discrimination parameters. As noted by these authors, though, the problem one faces in estimation with estimated discrimination parameters is that the discriminations are unknown, meaning that the weighted raw score "is not a mere statistic, and hence it is impossible to use CML as an estimation method" (Verhelst &amp; Glas, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;217). That is, sufficiency of the weighted "score" in the 2PL cannot be used according to the way in which a [[sufficient statistic]] is defined. If the weights are imputed instead of being estimated, as in OPLM, conditional estimation is possible and some of the properties of the Rasch model are retained (Verhelst, Glas &amp; Verstralen, 1995; Verhelst &amp; Glas, 1995). In OPLM, the values of the discrimination index are restricted to between 1 and 15. A limitation of this approach is that in practice, values of discrimination indexes must be preset as a starting point. This means some type of estimation of discrimination is involved when the purpose is to avoid doing so.

The Rasch model for dichotomous data inherently entails a single discrimination parameter which, as noted by Rasch,&lt;ref name="Rasch1960"/&gt;{{rp|121}} constitutes an arbitrary choice of the [[Units of measurement|unit]] in terms of which magnitudes of the latent trait are expressed or estimated.  However, the Rasch model requires that the discrimination is uniform across [[interactions]] between persons and items within a specified frame of reference (i.e. the assessment context given conditions for assessment).

Application of the model provides diagnostic information regarding how well the criterion is met. Application of the model can also provide information about how well items or questions on assessments work to measure the ability or trait. For instance, knowing the proportion of persons that engage in a given behavior, the Rasch model can be used to derive the relations between [[Difficulty of engagement|difficulty of behaviors]], attitudes and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrka|first=Katarzyna|last2=Jȩdrzejewski|first2=Arkadiusz|last3=Sznajd-Weron|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Weron|first4=Rafał|date=2016-09-01|title=Difficulty is critical: The importance of social factors in modeling diffusion of green products and practices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211630096X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=62|pages=723–735|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent advocates of Rasch models include [[Benjamin Drake Wright]], [[David Andrich]] and [[Erling Andersen]].

As a result of the water supply crisis during the severe [[2000s Australian drought|1997–2009 drought]], state governments began building [[desalination plants]] that purify seawater using [[reverse osmosis]] technology.

== Background ==
Until a few decades ago, Australia met its demands for water by drawing freshwater from [[dam]]s and [[water catchments]]. However, during 2000-2010 a significant lack of rainfall drained [[water reservoir]]s.&lt;ref name="elsaliby"&gt;El Saliby, I., Y. Okour, et al. (2009). "Desalination plants in Australia, review and facts." Desalination 247(1-3): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected cities were the capitals, where there is high uncertainty in water supply and demand. In 2007, [[Sydney]], the capital city of [[New South Wales]], experienced a dramatic drop of its main dam [[Warragamba Dam|Warragamba]], where water levels dropped to 33% of normal.

Australia’s first desalination plant was constructed in 1903 to treat saline groundwater in the gold fields of Western Australia at [[Kalgoorlie]].&lt;ref name="jheath"&gt;Heath, J. "The Water Supply in Hearth Australia." July 2007 Web. 28 April 2010 &lt;http://www.viacorp.com/perth_water.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several desalination plants were built in Australia between 1960 and 1980, especially following the revolution in membrane technology that made  [[reverse osmosis]] economically viable, but [[vapor-compression desalination]] and [[multi-stage flash distillation]] plants were also built. By 2002, however, only two reverse osmosis desalination plants were still operating, one on [[Kangaroo Island]] and the other on [[Rottnest Island]].&lt;ref name="elsaliby"/&gt; Seawater reverse osmosis is the only type of desalination technology currently used for large-scale desalination plants in Australia, the most important of these plants being located in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="jheath"/&gt;

== Methods ==
Compared to existing sources, desalination is considered to be expensive, but research is underway to develop more effective desalination technology.&lt;ref name="obarron"&gt;Barron, O. "Desalination options and their possible implementation in Western Australia." CSIRO. June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its drawbacks, it is considered a possible solution to the country's water shortages.

Australia is the driest inhabitable continent on earth and its installed desalination capacity is around 1% of the total world’s desalination capacity. The [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia)|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry]] has considered several desalination technologies processes in Australia:&lt;ref name="elsaliby"/&gt;

*[[Electrodialysis]]
*[[Multi-stage flash distillation]]

===ROSI===
{{main|Solar Powered Desalination Unit#ROSI}}
A [[solar powered desalination unit]] designed for remote communities has been tested in the Northern Territory. The [[reverse osmosis]] solar installation (ROSI) uses membrane filtration to provide a reliable and clean drinking water stream from sources such as brackish groundwater. Solar energy overcomes the usually high-energy operating costs as well as greenhouse emissions of conventional reverse osmosis systems. A photovoltaic solar array tracks the Sun and powers the pumps needed to process the water, using the plentiful sunlight available in remote regions of Australia not served by the power grid.

== Desalination plants ==
{{main|List of desalination plants in Australia}}

In Australia many desalination plants are utilizing wind farms to produce enough energy to operate nearby desalination plants.  For example, the [[Kurnell Desalination Plant]], with a capacity of producing 250 million liters (ML) of drinking water per day, supplies 15% of Sydney’s water needs via RO technology and is powered using “100 percent renewable energy” from the 140 MW Capital Wind Farm.&lt;ref name="ref25"&gt;Desalination. “Sydney Water. Sydney Water Corporation. n.d. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.sydneywater.com.au/Water4Life/Desalination/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref26"&gt;Kurnell Desalination Plant, Australia. n.d. Web. 28 April 2010.  &lt;http://www.water-technology.net/projects/kurnell-desalination/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Garden Island plant, currently planned for commissioning in 2014, will be powered by wave energy, using Carnegie Wave Energy's [[CETO]] system. This system uses submerged buoys to pressurise water offshore, which is piped onshore to either drive turbines for electricity generation or as in this case, to directly desalinate seawater. The Garden Island project is a commercial scale demonstration project, which follows a pilot project off the coast of Fremantle, Western Australia &lt;ref&gt;http://www.carnegiewave.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Port Stanvac Desalination Plant P1000724.jpg|thumb|Construction of [[Adelaide Desalination Plant]]]]
The availability of renewable resources as well as their fluctuation in electricity production from region to region requires a customized design for each desalination facility.  In order to maintain steady-state operations many facilities utilize renewably produced energy while connected to a smart grid, importing or exporting energy to the plant as required.  The [[Perth Seawater Desalination Plant]] utilizes this strategy where 48 wind turbines produce 80MW on the Emu Downs Wind Farm to provide an overall 24MW to the desalination plant.&lt;ref name="ref27"&gt;Perth Seawater Desalination Plant, Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO), Kwinana, Australia.” Water-Technology. n.d. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.water-technology.net/projects/perth/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical energy from the renewable energy can also be stored in storage batteries and utilized when needed.  As seen in the PV-powered RO system in Gillen Bore, Australia; producing 1,200 L/d.&lt;ref name = "ref28"&gt;Ghermandi,A., and Messalem, R. “Solar-driven desalination with reverse osmosis: the state of the art.” Desalination and Water Treatment 7 (2009) 287&lt;/ref&gt; Or if the plant is not required full-time, it can operate using the power as it becomes available. In 2005 a PV-powered hybrid UF/RO filtration system providing 764 liters per day tolerated well power variation from changing weather conditions.&lt;ref name="ref29"&gt;De Munari, A., Capäo, D.P.S., Richards, B.S., and Schäfer, A.I. “Application of solar-powered desalination in a remote town in South Australia.” Desalination (1987) 67:81-95&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are limitations in the ability of renewable sources to provide for desalination facilities. Desalination is a continuous process while renewable energies provide inconsistent power{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. For any new desalination installation to claim it will be powered by renewable energy, additional renewable energy should be generated.

=== Perth plant ===

About 2 million people occupy the [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] region in the south western corner of Western Australia. The [[Perth Seawater Desalination Plant]] (PSDP) was installed in late 2006 to produce up to 45 gigalitres of potable water per year. In addition, its brine discharge has been shown to have no adverse impact on the environment. The plant buys its power from electricity generated by the [[Emu Downs Wind Farm]], located 200 kilometers north of Perth. The 83 megawatt wind farm consists of 48 wind turbines and contributes over 272 giga-watt-hours (GWhr) per year into the grid, fully offsetting the Perth SWRO Plant’s estimated electrical requirement of 180 GWhr per year.&lt;ref name="ref32"&gt;“Environmentally sound desalination at the Perth seawater desalination plant” by Richard Stover, Gary Crisp Energy Recovery, Inc., San Leandro, California, USA. Retrieved on 2 May 2010 from http://www.energyrecovery.com/UserFiles/file/archives/news/documents/ThePerthSaltwaterDesalinationPlant.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; The plant has attracted interest from the world’s water industry and media, and has won numerous national and international awards including the [[International Desalination Association]]’s International Desalination Plant of the Year in 2007.

Another seawater desalination plant on the coast about 160 kilometres south of Perth is now operational. This plant is designed to have an initial annual output of 50 gigalitres, with the potential to double to 100 gigalitres.&lt;ref name="ref33"&gt;http://www.watercorporation.com.au.

'''St George's Church, Bergen''' ({{lang-no|'''Sankt Jørgen kirke'''}}) is a historic church  in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. This is also the site of the Leprosy Museum  (''Lepramuseet''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://kunsthistorie.com/fagwiki/Sankt_J%C3%B8rgen_kirke |title= Sankt Jørgen kirke|publisher=     Kunsthistorie |accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview==
The complex is located on [[Kong Oscars gate, Bergen|Kong Oscars gate]], close to the central railway station, in the central part of the city of [[Bergen]].  The church is part of the [[List of churches in Hordaland#Bergen domprosti|Bergen]] arch-[[deanery]] in the [[Diocese of Bjørgvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/kirker.htm|title=Oversikt over Nåværende Kirker|language=Norwegian |publisher=KirkeKonsulenten.no |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire site, including the church, is now open to the public as a [[Leprosy]]  museum  which has been open to the public since 1970. The church remains consecrated and is kept in good order and condition.  The church is no longer used as a regular [[parish church]], but it is still used twice a month for [[English language]] worship services as well as occasional [[Swedish language]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkesok.no/eng/kirker/St.-Joergen-hospitalkirke|title=St. Jørgen hospitalkirke|publisher=Kirkesøk: Kirkebyggdatabasen|accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Lepramuseet |title= Lepramuseet|publisher=    lokalhistoriewiki.no |accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The church was originally the  hospital chapel (''Hospitalskirken'') in Bergen. A leprosy hospital in Bergen was documented in 1411, and was run at that time by the nuns of [[Nonneseter Abbey, Bergen|Nonneseter Abbey]] in Bergen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://sml.snl.no/lepra |title= lepra|publisher=   Store medisinske leksikon |author=   Bjørn Myrvang |accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It seems likely that this facility was the immediate forerunner of the hospital and church.  The church initially just served the patients at the hospital, but eventually it became its own parish serving the surrounding parts of [[Årstad (municipality)|Årstad]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://sml.snl.no/lepra |title= lepra|publisher=   Store medisinske leksikon |author=   Bjørn Myrvang
|accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://medisinskhistoriebergen.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/st-jorgen-hospital-lepramuseet/
 |title= St. Jørgen hospital (Lepramuseet)|publisher=  Medisinsk historie i Bergen  |date=  6 May 2015|accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The parish was also the base for chaplains at the nearby city prison, poor house, and home for widows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bergenbyarkiv.no/bergenbyleksikon/arkiv/1423006|publisher=Bergen Byarkiv|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-08-13|title=Hospitalskirken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church had burned down with the rest of the hospital in 1640. The church was rebuilt again after the Bergen citywide fire in 1702 when most of the city was burned to ashes. The church building was largely designed in late [[Baroque]] style. The  present appearance  of the church results from a major reconstruction of 1789-90.

Founded by Florida businessmen [[Mel Sembler]] and his wife Betty Schlesinger Sembler, along with Joseph Zappala, the program was praised by prominent figures such as former U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] and former [[First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]], but was also subject to multiple accusations of abusive practices.&lt;ref name=Malmgren/&gt; In every state that Straight had a facility, abuse was either documented by state investigators or was alleged in civil suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maia-szalavitz/romney-fires-one-teenabus_b_63311.html|title="Romney Fires One Teen-Abuse Linked Financier, Keeps Big One" |work=Huffington Post |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Straight was established in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], in 1976, following the closure the previous year of a program called Seed, Inc. &lt;ref name=Childs1976&gt;{{cite news| first=Joe | last=Childs | date=27 July 1976 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OEdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nlgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1924,2181239&amp;dq=straight+inc&amp;hl=en | title=Straight Inc. New Drug Program Set for September 1 | newspaper= The Evening Independent | page=14A |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPTimes1976&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9sNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dl0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5003,2777703&amp;dq=straight+inc&amp;hl=en | title=Drug Program Will Treat Youths | newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=28 July  1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; When announcing its establishment, organizers said it would enroll youth ages as young as 10 to 18 who had a history of drug abuses or offenses, ranging from youth whose parents had noted "minor drug trouble" to those referred by courts, but would not treat "addicts or those with a physical dependence on narcotics."&lt;ref name=Childs1976/&gt; James Hartz, a clinical psychologist, was announced as its first director.&lt;ref name=Childs1976/&gt;&lt;ref name=SPTimes1976/&gt; 

In 1981, Dr. [[Robert DuPont]], the founding director of the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] visited Straight to encourage the organization to expand by creating new facilities nationwide and by training counselors in Straight's methodology.&lt;ref name=DuPont/&gt; DuPont noted that many American communities lacked drug treatment centers that served young people.&lt;ref name=DuPont&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyrity|first=Kathy|title=Straight Inc. Urged to Expand Nationwide|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tvIcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3GcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3446,4710047&amp;dq=straight+inc&amp;hl=en|accessdate=3 December 2011|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=9 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1982, the program had expanded to enroll youth up to age 20.&lt;ref name=NYTNancyReagan&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/style/mrs-reagan-in-florida-sees-efforts-to-fight-drug-abuse.html?pagewanted=all | last=Nemy |first=Enid |title=Mrs. Reagan, in Florida, Sees Efforts to Fight Drug Abuse |newspaper = New York Times | date=16 February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] visited a Straight facility in Florida in 1982.&lt;ref name=NYTNancyReagan/&gt;  Prior to the visit, she said she did not specifically endorse the program, but an aide told news media that Reagan was impressed with Straight because it was one of the few drug programs that enrolled adolescents, it did not receive government funding, and it was "drug-free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uGlQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8FkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7248,3814652&amp;dq=straight+inc&amp;hl=en |title=Mrs. Reagan to Visit Drug Abuse Programs |last=Brown |first=Marilyn |newspaper=The Evening Independent |date=15 February 1982 |page=16A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Reagan and [[Princess Diana]] visited Straight's facility in Springfield, Virginia. The two women attended a group "rap session", where Straight clients described their drug use and its sometimes violent consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schafer|first=Susanne|title=Princess Diana and Nancy Reagan Visit Drug Abuse Center|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=11 November 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===State licensing===

Over the course of its existence, Straight was in conflict with state licensing officials in Virginia, Maryland and Florida on a number of occasions. As early as January 1978, Florida state officials reported concerns with the program that led it to consider withdrawing its operating license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o1pQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mVgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6771,968894&amp;dq=straight+inc&amp;hl=en | title=State Reports on Straight Inc. |newspaper=The Evening Independent |date = 20 January 1978 |page=10A | accessdate=22 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia's [[Virginia Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse|Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services]] cited Straight's [[Springfield, Virginia]] center for violating state regulations repeatedly from the time the facility opened in 1982 to its closing in 1991. Virginia officials argued that state laws required that adolescents in Straight's programs be in school, while Straight believed that its clients should not be attending school until they had made progress in their treatment for substance abuse. In addition, Virginia regulators found that Straight's staff had held young clients against their will, allowed clients to restrain other clients and deprived clients of sleep, food and water as a punishment. Straight responded by denying certain allegations and changing some of its practices. In 1991, Straight decided to move its program from Springfield, Virginia to [[Columbia, Maryland]] as a result of what it considered harassment by regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=DeNeen|title=Maryland Finds Straight Inc. Not Accredited; Accused of Abuse in Virginia, Drug Center Faces New Scrutiny|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=3 August 1991|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the closure of Straight's Virginia facility, Maryland officials granted Straight a probationary license to operate a treatment center in Columbia, but only after Straight agreed to modify its practices, by providing educational programs to school-age students either on site or at [[Howard County, Maryland]] public schools and by letting parents determine where their children would spend the night while in the early stages of the program. Previously, Straight staff members assigned students to stay with families of Straight clients who were further along in the program. Maryland officials found "no truth" to "allegations of child abuse, the use of physical restraints, [or] brainwashing" leveled against Straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beyers|first=Dan|title=Straight Inc. Gets The Go-Ahead for Md. Drug Program|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=17 September 1991|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Maryland regulators continued to express concerns with Straight's practices until February 1992 when Straight closed the facility amidst declining enrollment and financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beyers|first=Dan|title=Straight Inc. Is Closing Md. Center; Drug-Treatment Unit Blames the Recession|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 February 1992|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1984, Florida officials found that 13 Straight clients were held in the program against their will and that another 15 had been coerced into enrolling. Straight took the matter to the Florida courts, which ruled that parents could force their minor children into drug rehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=David|title=Children can be forced into drug treatment // State agency's ruling a victory for program based on Suncoast|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=17 January 1987|page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1993, Florida state investigators audited the state's licensing of Straight's St. Petersburg treatment center and found that officials at the [[Florida Department of Health|Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services]] had expressed concerns about Straight's practices, but that the agency granted Straight a license to operate despite those concerns. Regulators were concerned that Straight staff members denied medication to clients and used excessive force to restrain clients. According to the state audit, Straight co-founder Melvin Sembler, a prominent fundraiser for Republican politicians, and several [[Florida State Senate|Florida State Senators]] contacted the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services in support of Straight. The audit concluded that "it cannot be unequivocally corroborated that this outside influence actually altered the decision to issue the license [to Straight]" but that "it appears that some members of HRS experienced some degree of pressure to grant Straight a license."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krueger|first=Curtis|title=Audit says Straight Inc. got breaks|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=8 July 1993|page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straight opened a program in [[Yorba Linda, California]] in 1989, but, a year later, the state's [[California Department of Social Services|Department of Social Services]] shut down the program after denying it a license to operate as a foster-family agency. State officials cited a record of "unusual punishments" at Straight, such as denying teenagers sleep and bathroom breaks. The state also complained about intimidation and ridicule of clients. About 40 Straight clients and parents protested the decision by picketing a local State licensing office, carrying placards with messages such as "Straight Saves Kids' Lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Janine|title=Families protest state closure of drug-treatment program|newspaper=The Orange County Register|date=2 August 1990|page=B02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
In May 1983, Straight, Inc was convicted of false imprisonment after being sued by 20-year-old Fred Collins Jr., who alleged he had been held captive by the program against his will. The program was ordered to pay $40,000 in compensatory and $180,000 in punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dahl|first=David|title=Senate panel questions St. Petersburg developer|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=9 June 1989|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gainesville Sun via Google Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eT1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1-kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7234,3794009&amp;dq=fred+collins+straight&amp;hl=en |title=Jury Awards $220,000 to Forced Drug Therapy Victim|publisher=Gainesville Sun|date=26 May 1983 |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakeland Ledger via Google Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s5IsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ifsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7149,4616056&amp;dq=fred+collins+straight&amp;hl=en |title=Straight Loses $220,000.00 verdict to patient|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|date=27 May 1983 |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1990, a jury awarded Karen Norton, a Florida resident, $721,000 in damages due to mistreatment by Straight. In 1982, while a patient in Straight's Florida facility, Norton alleged that staff members assaulted her, denied her health care and refused to give her permission to visit her dying grandfather. At the time, the ''St. Petersburg Times'' described the verdict as the largest award ever against Straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Journey|first=Mark|title=Straight client wins $ 721,000 suit|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=10 November 1990|location=North Pinellas Times|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment methods==

Straight's philosophy emphasized the role of [[peer pressure]] in a young person's decision to use drugs and as a means for encouraging drug users to become "straight". The organization believed that effective treatment required isolating drug users from all of the factors that might explicitly or implicitly encourage drug use, including relationships with family and friends as well as elements of popular culture such as music and clothing. During this period of isolation, Straight clients would receive constant reinforcement from peers about the negative effects of drug use and the necessity of becoming clean. As young people progressed through the Straight program, they would be allowed to gradually assume new responsibilities, for instance by serving as counselors for other young people, and to return to school.&lt;ref name=Geyelin&gt;{{cite news|last=Geyelin|first=Mylo|title=Growing Straight, Inc. Remains Controversial|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YZlSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EXsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6464,5135431&amp;dq=straight+inc&amp;hl=en|accessdate=3 December 2011|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=6 July 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' followed a 15-year-old boy through his treatment at Straight's [[Tampa Bay]] facility. The ''Times'' described Straight's treatment program as follows: 

{{quote|The methods, at least initially: No living at home. No talking to parents. No contact with anyone outside the program. No drugs. No cigarettes. No TV. No music. No reading. No school. And a daily onslaught of counseling sessions that often reduces a person to tears.
Eventually, the person is allowed to read, move back home, and return to school. But such things can take a year or more, all depending upon how well each person behaves as they progress through the program.&lt;ref name=finkel&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=David|title=Going Straight: The story of a young man's struggle against his addiction to drugs|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=3 May 1987|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At the core of the Straight experience were "rap sessions", or discussions led by a Straight staff member on topics such as the rules of the program, clients' experiences with drug use, their current feelings about their drug use and their personal and family problems. In order to be called on to speak at a rap session, a teenager would be required to practice "Motivating", a Straight tradition which the ''Times'' described as "waving your hand in the air... so hard that your arm aches and you begin to perspire."&lt;ref name=finkel2&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=David|title=Going Straight: Part 2: The first 50 days in the program|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=4 May 1987|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire group would say "love you" when a person finished speaking and would regularly sing songs together. A typical day at a Straight facility consisted of a series of rap sessions from 9am to 7pm, interrupted by several breaks for meals and exercise. On Fridays, patients might finish their last rap session at midnight.&lt;ref name=finkel2/&gt;

Straight used a [[twelve-step program]] modeled after [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name=finkel2/&gt; However, the Straight program was also divided into five stages: a client began the program in the first stage, known as "humbling", and would gradually advance to subsequent stages as staff members determined that his or her treatment was progressing.&lt;ref name=finkel2/&gt; In the first phase of the program, patients were not allowed to talk to their parents and were led everywhere by their belt loops, a means of demonstrating to patients that they had lost control of their lives.&lt;ref name=finkel2/&gt; Patients stayed overnight at the homes of other young people who were further along in the program. This first phase lasted a minimum of 14 days and often for months. Straight clients could progress to the second phase, where they would be allowed to spend the night at home, only once they had convinced staff members that they understood their dependence on drugs and wanted to change their behavior. ''St. Petersburg Times'' reporter [[David Finkel]] described the emotional intensity of the humbling phase as follows: "Only when [a patient] is feeling worthless and miserable is he considered to be making progress."&lt;ref name=finkel2/&gt;

Families would become more involved in the second phase. Straight staff would schedule one or more meetings for a client and his or her immediate family, and rap sessions would be held for groups of parents to attend by themselves or with their children. Siblings of Straight clients over the age of 8 were required to attend their own separate meetings.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; As of 1987, Straight parents were required to comply with a list of rules that ran to six pages in length. Among these rules: both parents were required to be at home every night when their child was in the first or second phase of the program. In the third phase overnight business travel was permitted, and in the fifth phase, vacation was permitted, but in both cases parents were required to submit their plans to Straight for approval. Parents could be asked to host other children in the program overnight.&lt;ref name=finkel3&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=David|title=Going Straight: Part 3: The parents' story|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=5 May 1987|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the third phase of the Straight program, clients were allowed to return to school or to start a part-time job. However, clients were still expected to spend their evenings and weekends at the Straight facility, where they would take on new responsibilities, such as assisting with cleaning and greeting visitors.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; In the fourth and fifth phase of the treatment, clients were only required to come to Straight three or four days a week instead of seven. Fifth phase clients would help lead group sessions. While the first, second and third phases could be completed in a minimum of two or three weeks, clients were expected to spend at least three months in phase four and two months in phase five. At an absolute minimum, a young person could complete the entire Straight program in six months, but in typical cases, 10-14 months were required and sometimes longer periods of time, up to 28 months, were necessary.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt;

Straight graduates participated in follow-up classes once or twice a week, sometimes accompanied by their parents, for the six months following their completion of the program. Graduates were also eligible to return to Straight as paid, part-time staff members.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt;

The ''St. Petersburg Times'' noted that Straight's treatment practices were designed as a "gentler" successor to an earlier program called The Seed, which was closed after an independent report noted that its methods were reminiscent of "highly refined [[brainwashing]] techniques employed by the [[North Korea|North Koreans]] during the 1950s."&lt;ref name=finkel/&gt;

Straight stated that their methods, while radical, enabled 60% of patients to become drug-free.&lt;ref name=finkel/&gt;

===Defining drug abuse===
Straight officials took the position that drug use in all forms is harmful and requires treatment. In a 1983 speech in [[Bryan, Ohio]], Straight administrator Dave Crock stated that the term "drug abuse" itself is problematic because it implies that occasional drug use might be acceptable while only more frequent use of drugs constitutes "abuse".&lt;ref name=Bryan/&gt; In 1981, Straight's Executive Director, James Hartz, said that while his organization did not have a formal policy defining drug abuse, he personally felt that: "...A 14-year-old who did alcohol and pot and never got arrested, never skipped school - that person in our opinion needs to work through his or her relationship to that drug just as much as the person who is 16 and who was out [breaking and entering], ripping off and so on and so forth."&lt;ref name=Geyelin/&gt;

===Program costs===

Straight's St. Petersburg branch charged a monthly fee of $385 in 1987, or about $778 in 2012 dollars. In addition, families paid $1089 ($2200 in 2012 dollars) at the outset of the program and then a $1600 evaluation fee ($3233 in 2012 dollars). Many insurance companies did not cover Straight's services. Parents were regularly asked to make small contributions to the organization.&lt;ref name=finkel3/&gt; In 1990, Straight's program in [[Yorba Linda, California]] charged about $1,400 a month, or about $2,460 in 2012 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lachnit|first=Caroll|title=Parents fight for anti-drug program|newspaper=The Orange County Register|date=31 July 1990|page=B01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment effectiveness== 
A 1989 study in the ''Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment'' conducted interviews with 222 patients of Straight's Virginia facility at least six months after their treatment ended (two thirds of these patients had graduated from the program, while one-third had left before graduation). Before starting treatment at Straight, 97% of these individuals had used [[marijuana]], 56% had used [[cocaine]] and 25% had used [[opiates]] such as heroin. After leaving the program, 26% reported using marijuana, 14% reported using cocaine and 4% reported using opiates. 35% of former clients reported feeling very satisfied with their experience at Straight, 35% reported feeling somewhat satisfied, 18% reported feeling somewhat dissatisfied and 12% reported feeling very dissatisfied. 53% of patients reported that Straight helped them "a lot", 21% reported that the program helped them "a fair amount", 18% reported that it helped them "a little" and 8% reported that it did not help them at all.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt;

After following a young man through Straight for over a year, journalist [[David Finkel]] reported feeling ambivalent about the program. Finkel observed "phenomenal changes" in the subject of his articles, and noted that the young man had stopped using drugs and that his attitude and his relationship with his parents had improved dramatically. But Finkel also felt that Straight was "imperfect in many ways", and criticized the high staff turnover at all levels of the organization, the lack of diversity among Straight clients and the organization's policy of holding minors against their will, if a parent consented. Finkel described this last policy as "unnecessary" and "potentially abusive". Finkel concluded that he would not consider Straight for his child if she was using drugs experimentally, but that he might try the program if his child had a more severe drug problem and other treatment options, such as counseling, had not succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=David|title=Drug treatment program isn't answer for every child|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=10 May 1987|page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Udaan Trust''' is an Indian [[non-governmental organisation]] operating in the state of [[Maharashtra]]. It is the first HIV/AIDS organisation founded by homosexuals living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development: [http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Publications/docs/hivaidsdirectory.pdf Directory of Associations of People Living with HIV/Aids, July 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127055731/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Publications/docs/hivaidsdirectory.pdf |date=2012-01-27 }}, accessed February 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Udaan focuses on issues of sexual health within the homosexual and transgender communities, particularly with regard to the prevention of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. In order to accomplish this, Udaan provides services such as condom distribution, sex education, counseling, and medical services to at-risk populations.&lt;ref&gt;Udaan Trust: [http://www.udaantrust.org/objective.php Objective], accessed February 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Udaan also attempts to increase awareness of issues relevant to the rights of homosexual and transgender individuals and people living with HIV/AIDS. The organisation does not merely provide services to these individuals - it is meant to reflect their interests, as Udaan employs MSM, TG, and PLHA people (men who have sex with men, transgender, and people living with HIV/AIDS, respectively).&lt;ref name=indiatimes1&gt;{{cite news |title=Udaan: Dedicated to problems of gays |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-06-24/pune/27309516_1_hiv-condoms-counselling |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=June 24, 2002 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the six members of the Board of Directors is a person living with HIV.

Udaan is funded through personal donations, and attends to a network of an estimated 1500 people living with HIV.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"/&gt; It has offices in [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]], [[Thane District]], [[Raigad District]], [[Jalgaon]], [[Nashik]], and [[Ahmednagar]].&lt;ref&gt;Udaan Trust: [http://www.udaantrust.org/projects.php Projects], accessed February 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Udaan operates within the framework provided by Avert Society, a joint enterprise of the U.S. and Indian governments. It was among a number of similar organisations criticised as ineffective by India's National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) in June 2011.&lt;ref name=indiatimes2&gt;{{cite news |title=AIDS work by 8 NGOs in state dubbed failures |author=Sumitra Deb Roy |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-23/mumbai/29693946_1_ngos-naco-hiv |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
Udaan Trust founded in 1992, in the state of [[Maharashtra]].

On March 7, 2011, officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development visited Udaan to conduct a review of its work.&lt;ref&gt;AVERT: [http://www.avertsociety.org/news-events/news/usaid-team-visit-on-7-march-2011.aspx USAID Team Visit, March 7, 2011], accessed February 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2011, Udaan donated two ambulances to the Gurdaspur police and staffed them with drivers and paramedics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2 ambulances donated to Gurdaspur police |author= |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110314/jal.htm |newspaper=The Tribune (India) |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">The '''Global AIDS Coordinator''' at the [[United States Department of State]] is the official responsible for overseeing U.S.-sponsored humanitarian aid programs to combat the [[AIDS epidemic]] around the world. The Global AIDS Coordinator has the rank of [[ambassador of the United States|ambassador-at-large]] and [[Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistant Secretaries and Equivalent Rank|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/c7649.htm|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department Organization Chart|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/99494.htm|date=March 2014|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The current Global AIDS Coordinator is Ambassador Deborah L. Birx.

The mission of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) is to lead the implementation of the U.S. [[President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), the largest commitment ever by any nation for an international health initiative dedicated to a single disease.[http://www.pepfar.gov/] Initiated in 2003, PEPFAR has been reauthorized three times. What began as an emergency response has since developed into one of the largest international health initiatives. PEPFAR has supported countries in the development of national health and information systems to support the fight of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and is collaborating with countries around the world to work towards epidemic control.

OGAC is also one of the few offices at the State Department that reports directly to the [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], instead of going through a [[Deputy Secretary of State]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Vaginismus''' is a condition in which involuntary [[muscle spams]] prevents [[vaginal penetration]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F. |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1 |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323448383 |page=1330 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1330 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often results in [[pain with sex|pain with attempts at sex]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Often it begins when [[sexual intercourse]] is first attempted.&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Severity as well as the pain during penetration varies between women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Reissing | first =Elke | authorlink = |author2=Yitzchak Binik |author3=Samir Khalife  | title =Does Vaginismus Exist?

==Causes==

===Primary vaginismus===
A woman is said to have primary vaginismus  when she is unable to have penetrative sex or experience vaginal penetration without pain. It is commonly discovered in teenage girls and women in their early twenties, as this is when many girls and young women first attempt to use [[tampon]]s, have penetrative sex, or undergo a [[Pap test|Pap smear]]. Women with vaginismus may be unaware of the condition until they attempt vaginal penetration. A woman may be unaware of the reasons for their condition.&lt;ref name=Pacik09/&gt;

A few of the main factors that may contribute to primary vaginismus include:

* a condition called [[vulvar vestibulitis]] syndrome, more or less synonymous with focal [[vaginitis]], a so-called [[sub-clinical]] inflammation, in which no pain is perceived until some form of penetration is attempted
* [[urinary tract infection]]s
* vaginal [[Candidiasis|yeast infections]]
* [[sexual abuse]], [[rape]], other [[sexual assault]], or attempted sexual abuse or assault
* knowledge of (or witnessing) sexual or physical abuse of others, without being personally abused
* [[domestic violence]] or similar conflict in the early home environment
* fear of pain associated with penetration, particularly the popular misconception of "breaking" the [[hymen]] upon the first attempt at penetration, or the idea that vaginal penetration will inevitably hurt the first time it occurs
* chronic pain conditions and [[Harm avoidance|harm-avoidance]] behaviour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borg |first1=Charmaine |last2=Peters |first2=L. M. |last3=Weijmar Schultz |first3=W. |last4=de Jong |first4=P. J. |title=Vaginismus: Heightened Harm Avoidance and Pain Catastrophizing Cognitions |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=558–567 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* any physically invasive trauma (not necessarily involving or even near the genitals)
* generalized anxiety
* stress
* negative emotional reaction towards sexual stimulation, e.g. disgust both at a deliberate level and also at a more implicit level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borg|first=Charmaine|author2=Peter J. De Jong |author3=Willibrord Weijmar Schultz |title=Vaginismus and Dyspareunia: Automatic vs. Deliberate: Disgust Responsivity|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=June 2010|volume=7|issue=6|pages=2149–2157|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01800.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* strict conservative moral education, which also can elicit negative emotions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borg|first=Charmaine|author2=Peter J. de Jong |author3=Willibrord Weijmar Schultz |title=Vaginismus and Dyspareunia: Relationship with General and Sex-Related Moral Standards|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=Jan 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=223–231|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary vaginismus is often [[idiopathic]].&lt;ref name=Health.am&gt;{{cite web | title =Vaginismus | work =Sexual Pain Disorders and Vaginismus | url=http://www.health.am/sex/more/sexual_pain_disorders_vaginismus/ | year = 2006 | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginismus has been classified by Lamont&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamont | first1 = JA | title = Vaginismus | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 633–6 | year = 1978 | pmid = 686049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pacik, PT. |author2=Cole, JB. |title=When Sex Seems Impossible. Stories of Vaginismus and How You Can Achieve Intimacy |publisher=Odyne Publishing |year=2010 |pages=40–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.

Although the [[pubococcygeus muscle]] is commonly thought to be the primary muscle involved in vaginismus, Pacik identified two additionally-involved spastic muscles in treated patients under sedation. These include the entry muscle ([[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosum]]) and the mid-vaginal muscle ([[puborectalis muscle|puborectalis]]). Spasm of the entry muscle accounts for the common complaint that patients often report when trying to have intercourse: "It's like hitting a brick wall".&lt;ref name=Pacik09&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pacik PT |title=Botox treatment for vaginismus |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=124 |issue=6 |pages=455e–6e |date=December 2009 |pmid=19952618 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bf7f11 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=124&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=455e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary vaginismus ===
Secondary vaginismus occurs when a person who has previously been able to achieve penetration develops vaginismus. This may be due to physical causes such as a [[yeast infection]] or trauma during [[childbirth]], while in some cases it may be due to psychological causes, or to a combination of causes. The treatment for secondary vaginismus is the same as for primary vaginismus, although, in these cases, previous experience with successful penetration can assist in a more rapid resolution of the condition. Peri-menopausal and menopausal vaginismus, often due to a drying of the vulvar and vaginal tissues as a result of reduced estrogen, may occur as a result of "micro-tears" first causing sexual pain then leading to vaginismus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacik|first=Peter|title=When Sex Seems Impossible. Stories of Vaginismus &amp; How You Can Achieve Intimacy|year=2010|publisher=Odyne|location=Manchester, NH|isbn=978-0-9830134-0-2|pages=8–16|url=http://www.vaginismusmd.com/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further factors that may contribute to either secondary or primary vaginismus include:
* Fear of losing control
* Not trusting one’s partner
* Self-consciousness about body image
* History of sexual abuse, rape, sexual assault, or attempted sexual abuse or assault
* Misconceptions about sex or unattainable standards for sex from exaggerated sexual materials, such as pornography or abstinence 
* Fear of vagina not being wide or deep enough / fear of partner’s penis being too large
* Undiscovered or denied sexuality

==Mechanism==
Which muscles are involved is unclear but may include the [[pubococcygeus muscle]], [[levator ani]], [[Bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]], circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lahaie|first=MA|author2=Boyer, SC |author3=Amsel, R |author4=Khalifé, S |author5= Binik, YM |title=Vaginismus: a review of the literature on the classification/diagnosis, etiology and treatment.|journal=Women's health (London, England)|date=Sep 2010|volume=6|issue=5|pages=705–19|pmid=20887170|doi=10.2217/whe.10.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

A [[Cochrane review]] found little high quality evidence regarding the treatment of vaginismus in 2012.&lt;ref name=Mel2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melnik|first1=T|last2=Hawton|first2=K|last3=McGuire|first3=H|title=Interventions for vaginismus.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD001760|pmid=23235583|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001760.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically it is unclear if [[systematic desensitisation]] is better than other measures including nothing.&lt;ref name=Mel2012/&gt;

===Psychological===
According to Ward and Ogden's qualitative study on the experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear of painful sex; the belief that sex is wrong or shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).

People with vaginismus are twice as likely to have a history of childhood sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (non-sexual) physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reissing ED, Binik YM, Khalifé S, Cohen D, Amsel R |title=Etiological correlates of vaginismus: sexual and physical abuse, sexual knowledge, sexual self-schema, and relationship adjustment |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |year=2003 |pmid=12519667 |doi=10.1080/713847095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===

Often, when faced with a person experiencing painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend [[Kegel exercises]] and provide some additional lubricants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sogc.org/publications/when-sex-hurts-vaginismus/|title= When sex hurts – vaginismus|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= n.d.|publisher= The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020055743/http://sogc.org/publications/when-sex-hurts-vaginismus/|archivedate= 2013-10-20|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthline.com/health/vaginismus?toptoctest=expand |title=Vaginismus |last=Herndon | first= Jaime |date=November 30, 2015|website=Healthline |publisher= George Kruick, MD. |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/vaginismus-causes-symptoms-treatments |title= Women’s Health: Vaginismus |last= Nazario | first= Brunilda, MD.  |date= 2012 |website=WebMD|publisher= |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Womens_Health_Watch/2012/May/when-sex-gives-more-pain-than-pleasure |title= When sex gives more pain than pleasure.|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 2012 |website=Harvard Health Publications |publisher= Harvard Health |accessdate= December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening the muscles that unconsciously tighten during vaginismus may be extremely counter-intuitive for some people. Although vaginismus has not been shown to affect a person's ability to produce lubrication, providing additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving successful penetration. This is due to the fact that women may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Treatment of vaginismus may involve the use [[Hegar dilators]], (sometimes called vaginal trainers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Vaginismus/Pages/Treatment.aspx|title=NHS Choices Vaginal Trainers to treat vaginismus|last=nhs|first=nhs|date=2015|website=NHS Choices Vaginismus treatment|publisher=NHS}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  progressively increasing the size of the dilator inserted into the vagina.&lt;ref name="Doleys2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doleys|first=Daniel|title=Behavioral Medicine|accessdate=|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|language=English |isbn=9781468440706|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuromodulators===
[[Botulinum toxin|Botulinum toxin A (Botox)]] has been considered as a treatment option, under the idea of temporarily reducing the hypertonicity of the pelvic floor muscles. Although no random controlled trials have been done with this treatment, experimental studies with small samples have shown it to be effective, with sustained positive results through 10 months.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacik, PT. Vaginismus: A Review of Current Concepts and Treatment using Botox Injections, Bupivacaine Injections and Progressive Dilation Under Anesthesia. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Journal, {{DOI|10.1007/s00266-011-9737-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in its mechanism of treatment, [[lidocaine]] has also been tried as an experimental option.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melnick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melnik|first=T|author2=Hawton, K |author3=McGuire, H |title=Interventions for vaginismus.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Dec 12, 2012|volume=12|pages=CD001760|pmid=23235583|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001760.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anxiolytic]]s and [[antidepressant]]s are other pharmacotherapies that have been offered to people in conjunction with other psychotherapy modalities, or if these patients experience high levels of anxiety from their condition.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt; Results from these medications have not been consistent.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
True epidemiological studies of vaginismus have not been done, as diagnosis would require painful examinations that such women would most likely avoid. Data available is primarily reported statistics from clinical settings.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;

A study of vaginismus in people in [[Morocco]] and [[Sweden]] found a prevalence of 6%. 18-20% of people in British and Australian studies were found to have manifest [[dyspareunia]], while the rate among elderly British people was as low as 2%.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lewis RW, Fugl-Meyer KS, Bosch R, etal |title=Epidemiology/risk factors of sexual dysfunction |journal=J Sex Med |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=35–9 |date=July 2004 |pmid=16422981 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1990 study of people presenting to sex therapy clinics found reported vaginismus rates of between 12% and 17%, while a random sampling and structured interview survey conducted in 1994 by National Health and Sexual Life Survey documented 10%-15% of people reported that in the past six months they had experienced pain during intercourse.&lt;ref name="Health.am"/&gt;

The most recent study-based estimates of vaginismus incidence range from 5% to 47% of people presenting for sex therapy or complaining of sexual problems, with significant differences across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;see Reissing et al. 1999; Nusbaum 2000; Oktay 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that a society's expectations of person's sexuality may particularly impact on the people with the condition.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite web | title =Critical literature Review on Vaginismus| work =Critical literature Review on Vaginismus | url=http://www.vaginismus-awareness-network.org/lit_review.html | publisher=Vaginismus Awareness Network | accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
